Lee is coming off winning bronze in the all-around and in the uneven bars final. On the men's side, China's Zou Jingyuan won gold on parallel bars. Illia Kovtun of Ukraine (silver) and Shinnosuke Oka of Japan (bronze) rounded out the podium. The horizontal bar final is still to come.\n\nUSA TODAY Sports is bringing you all the highlights, scores and live results. Follow along.\n\nSimone Biles on balance beam\n\nSimone Biles goes second to last. Brazil's Rebeca Andrade goes last.\n\nSuni Lee fell on balance beam in final\n\nIt wasn't to be for Suni Lee in the balance beam final. Seeking her fourth medal of these Games, Lee's right foot slipped off the balance beam at the end of her aerial series, causing her to split the beam and then take a hard fall onto the mat. The result was a score of 13.100 that effectively eliminates her shot at the podium.\n\nThe 21-year-old appeared frustrated as she re-mounted the beam and finished her routine after the fall, and as she walked away afterwards. But then she started to gradually lighten after talking with her coach, Jess Graba, and Simone Biles. Within moments, Lee was smiling and laughing again, perhaps remembering the breadth of what she's already achieved in Paris. After returning from a pair of kidney ailments, Lee won a second consecutive all-around Olympic medal -- this time a bronze -- to go with team gold and another bronze on uneven bars Sunday.\n\nBalance beam final results, scores\n\nHere is the order (and scores, as they come in) for the women's balance beam final.\n\nSimone Biles, Suni Lee introduced ahead of beam final\n\nSimone Biles and Suni Lee got a huge cheers from the crowd when they were introduced.\n\nTom Brady at gymnastics finals today\n\nSeven-time Super Bowl winner Tom Brady is at Bercy Arena today to watch the event finals.\n\nWhat time is gymnastics on today?\n\nSimone Biles is competing today in the finals for balance beam and floor exercise.

Jordan Chiles is in the floor final, Suni Lee in the balance beam final.\n\nHere are the scores from the men's parallel bars final.\n\nSimone Biles' floor routine\n\nHere is a look at Biles' floor routine from the all-around final at the Paris Olympics. She scored a 15.066 to win the gold medal. She competes in the floor final today at 8:23 a.m. ET and goes third-to-last.\n\nWomen's floor exercise final results, scores\n\nHere is the order (and scores, as they come in) for the women's floor exercise final, which starts at 8:23 a.m.\n\nBiles is the greatest gymnast of all time. She has consistently dominated the sport for over a decade, which would have been an unimaginable feat just a few years ago as most gymnasts reach their peak in their late teens. Her ability to win is in a class of its own. With 40 Olympic and world championship medals, Biles has won the most of any gymnast in history. She has also not lost an all-around competition since 2013.\n\nBiles redefines the possibilities of her sport not just in her record-breaking number of wins and medals, but also in the unmatched difficulty of the skills she completes. Biles has no less than five skills named after her -- two on the vault and floor and one on the balance beam -- because she was the first, and in most cases, the only athlete to complete them in competition.\n\nSimone Biles' moves named after her: What to know\n\nSimone Biles has left her mark on the sport of gymnastics, in addition to her combined 28 world championship and Olympic medals.

Next Up: Beam.", "body": "Having already won three gold medals in the last week -- in the team event, the all-around and the vault -- Biles on Monday will compete in the balance beam and the floor exercise.\n\nBiles, who won four golds at the Rio Games in 2016, could become the first woman to earn five medals in gymnastics at a single Olympics since Nastia Liukin in 2008.\n\nAbout 550 accredited members of the news media were in Bercy Arena last Tuesday for her gold medal performance in the all-around, and there promises to be another packed crowd on Monday, as fans and reporters try to watch Biles perform for the last time in Paris -- and, perhaps, at an Olympics.\n\nBiles, 27, has said she would love to compete at a home Olympics in 2028, when the Summer Games are staged in Los Angeles, but she also said that training for another four years would be difficult on both her body and mind.\n\nIf this is her final Olympics, Biles has a solid chance of going out on top. On the beam, she qualified second to Zhou Yaqin of China. On the floor exercise, she qualified first, way ahead of second-place Rebeca Andrade of Brazil, who has had a brilliant Olympics, finishing second to Biles in the all-around and vault.\n\nHere's what else to know:\n\nThe women's balance beam final will be aired live on Peacock and NBCOlympics.com at 6:38 a.m. Eastern time, followed by the women's floor exercise at 8:32 a.m. NBC will rebroadcast the events in its prime-time Olympic broadcast that starts at 8 p.m.\n\nTwo other Americans are competing on Monday. Sunisa Lee will perform on the balance beam, and Jordan Chiles will perform on the floor exercise. Despite battling two kidney diseases that limited her training over the past two years, Lee has performed well in Paris so far -- and maybe even better than she expected -- winning won the gold medal in the team event and bronze medals in the all-around and the uneven bars. Chiles is competing in only one individual final, the floor exercise, despite qualifying fourth in vault and all-around. Only two gymnasts per country can advance to a final, and Biles and Lee qualified ahead of Chiles in both events.\n\nZhou, 18, is looking to win the first gold medal for China's women's gymnastics team here, on balance beam. She won the silver medal on the beam at the world championships in 2023, where Biles won the gold.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "maggie_astor@nytimes.com", "name": "Maggie Astor", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "juliet_macur@nytimes.com", "name": "Juliet Macur", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_(gymnastics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Floor (gymnastics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accor_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Accor Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure_skating_at_the_2018_Winter_Olympics_\u2013_Team_event", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Figure skating at the 2018 Winter Olympics \u2013 Team event"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_beam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Balance beam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nastia_Liukin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nastia Liukin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_balance_beam", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's balance beam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebeca_Andrade", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebeca Andrade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_(nautical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beam (nautical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peacock (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunisa_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sunisa Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Chiles", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Chiles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uneven_bars", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uneven bars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/05/multimedia/05gymnastics-beam-floor-header-promo-01-whql/05gymnastics-beam-floor-header-promo-01-whql-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788572", "eventUri": "eng-9788572", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

Alice D'Amato of Italy took home the gold, Zhou Yaqin of China took silver and Italian Manila Esposito took the bronze.\n\nBiles still has one more chance to win her fourth gold medal of these Games later on in the floor exercise final which marks the end of the 2024 Olympic artistic gymnastic competition.\n\nThe stunning moment is the first bump in the road in these incredible Games for the American legend. Biles, already the most decorated gymnast of all time, put her name next to a few more records last week when she won the gold in the team event with Team USA, the individual all-around competition and the vault final.\n\nWith those wins, Biles became the most decorated American Olympic gymnast of all time - now with 10 total Olympic medals, including seven gold - and also became the oldest American gymnast to win a gold medal at 27.\n\nShe had a chance to tie another incredible mark if she had won both the beam and the floor exercises on Monday. The only two women to ever win nine Olympic gold medals are American swimmer Katie Ledecky and Soviet gymnast Larisa Latynina. Biles will have to wait until Los Angeles in 2028 if she wants to try and reach that mark.\n\nIt was a tough day on the beam overall for many as multiple competitors fell, including Biles' Team USA teammate Sunisa Lee.\n\nLee lost her footing during her routine and slipped, landing with the beam between her legs before tipping over onto the mat on her side. She would end up finishing in sixth place, one spot behind Biles.\n\nUnlike Biles, the 2020 gold medalist in the all-around won't get another chance on Monday to redeem herself. The beam was Lee's last competition here in Paris.\n\n\"It was a lot of pressure. It was just crazy to see how everybody was going down like that,\" Lee said after. \"You could feel the tension in the room. The crowd shushing us for cheering. We didn't like that as it was just so silent in there. I love hearing my teammates cheer for me.\"\n\nThe moment now marks a massive test for Biles later on Monday in Paris when she takes on the floor final.\n\nThroughout these Olympics, Biles has emphasized what a key role her mentality has played in bouncing back from disappointment in Tokyo. She acknowledged after the team final that thoughts of her withdrawal from those events three years ago were lingering as she began her vault for Team USA.\n\nBiles, who has talked about the importance of taking care of her mental health during these Games after each of her golden performances, has said she's speaking with her therapist every morning before competition and religiously every Thursday.\n\n\"After all these years of putting in the mental work in, it's paid off,\" Biles said Saturday after winning her latest gold.\n\nShe added, \"The Olympics is such a draining process for the athletes. It's multiple days of competitions, so you definitely have to be on top of your mental as well as your physical [health].\"", "source": {"uri": "ksltv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KSLTV.com"},

She got the same score as Biles.\n\nItaly's Alice D'Amato performed with precision, receiving 14.366 to take gold. China's Zhou Yaqin grabbed the silver and Italy's Manila Esposito won bronze.\n\nBiles, who has 10 Olympic medals to her name, has made an incredible comeback so far in Paris, after she dropped out of most events at the Tokyo Olympics and took a two-year break to prioritize her mental health.\n\nOn Saturday, Biles won gold on vault, while U.S. teammate Jade Carey scored the bronze. She also won gold in the all-around final, where Lee, the defending champ in that event, secured a bronze medal. The U.S. squad, who named themselves the \"Golden Girls,\" resoundingly won the team event. Lee also nabbed a bronze on the uneven bars on Sunday; Biles did not qualify for that final.\n\nIn Tokyo, Lee placed fifth in the beam final. Biles, who had withdrawn from all the other individual events and performed a relatively scaled-back beam routine, won bronze. At the 2016 Rio Olympics, Biles also took bronze on beam -- the only event she competed in that she didn't top.\n\nBoth women overcame great hardship to make it to Paris. Biles opened up in the new Netflix documentary, \"Simone Biles Rising,\" about the traumas she worked through in therapy after the pressure and weight of expectation pushed her to a breaking point in Tokyo.\n\nLee spent a large chunk of 2023 dealing with two rare kidney disease diagnoses, after she woke up one day swollen all over her body. She had to endure months of pain, swelling and exhausting treatments before she was cleared early this year to put her full focus back on training for the Olympics.\n\nAfter winning the all-around last week, Biles wrote on Instagram that \"mental health matters.\" In her own post following that competition, Lee said \"this medal goes deeper than gymnastics.\"\n\n\"I can't even begin to express how much my health has taken away from me & the strength it has taught me, so to be here is the greatest achievement of all,\" she wrote.\n\nThe last women's gymnastics event of the Paris Games, the floor exercise, follows the beam competition on Monday. Biles is a favorite, and could very well earn her eleventh Olympic medal.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunisa_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunisa Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_(nautical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beam (nautical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila_Esposito", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manila Esposito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_balance_beam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's balance beam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_D'Amato", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alice D'Amato"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_artistic_individual_all-around", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's artistic individual all-around"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowing_at_the_2016_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_eight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rowing at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's eight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jade_Carey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jade Carey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uneven_bars", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uneven bars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kidney disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_(gymnastics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Floor (gymnastics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/22d239e778a731539f44b3fa65c74bd3", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788572", "eventUri": "eng-9788572", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Italy's Alice D'Amato won gold and teammate Manila Esposito took bronze, while China's Yaqin Zhou earned silver.\n\nLee was second to go, and started strong before fumbling a landing on one of her flips.

Lee got back on and finished her routine, ending with a score of 13.100.\n\nBiles was seventh of the eight gymnasts to go, and in between her and Lee all but one of their competitors also fell off the beam. Biles, like Lee, looked solid, but after one of her flips Biles landed with too much power and fell off the beam. She got back on and finished out with her classic dismount, but after a long delay, the judges also gave Biles a 13.100, putting her in fifth place.\n\nBiles and Lee had both gone into the beam final hoping to improve upon their past Olympic performances on the apparatus. Biles won bronze in beam at the 2016 Rio and 2020 Tokyo Games, while Lee finished fifth in the event in Tokyo.\n\nEarlier in these Paris Games, Biles, Lee and their teammates -- Jordan Chiles, Jade Carey and Hezly Rivera -- won the gold medal in the women's team final. Biles earned gold in the women's all-around and Lee took the bronze medal on Aug. 1, and two days later, Biles secured her third gold in Paris in the vault final.\n\nWhile she keeps racking up medals and breaking records, Biles said after the team final that she's not keeping close attention to the numbers.\n\n\"I don't keep count, I don't keep stats,\" she told reporters, including PEOPLE. \"I just go out here and do what I'm supposed to and I'm doing what I love and enjoying it, so that's really all that matters to me.\"\n\nLee said ahead of the beam final, after winning bronze in the uneven bars, that she wanted gold today.\n\n\"Beam, I want to win this time around,\" Lee told reporters on Aug. 4. \"I feel like every single time I make it into a beam final I never really prove what I can do. So this time around I want to prove to myself that I can do it.\"", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_(nautical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beam (nautical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila_Esposito", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manila Esposito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_balance_beam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's balance beam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunisa_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunisa Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_D'Amato", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alice D'Amato"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_beam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Balance beam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_artistic_team_all-around", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's artistic team all-around"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karate_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karate at the 2020 Summer Olympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_vault", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's vault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezly_Rivera", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hezly Rivera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jade_Carey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jade Carey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Chiles", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Chiles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uneven_bars", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uneven bars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious_Metals", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious Metals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://people.com/thmb/NSbUbpNq_Or0on7pEZWe_bkgIfM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(3082x1021:3084x1023)/GettyImages-2164914973-0ae91a8c28e24a34ab97097dfff17377.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788572", "eventUri": "eng-9788572", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-01", "textStart": 1493, "textEnd": 1499}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-04", "textStart": 2104, "textEnd": 2110}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

Alice D'Amato of Italy took home the gold, Zhou Yaqin of China took silver and Italian Manila Esposito took the bronze.\n\nBiles still has one more chance to win her fourth gold medal of these Games later on in the floor exercise final which marks the end of the 2024 Olympic artistic gymnastic competition.\n\nThe stunning moment is the first bump in the road in these incredible Games for the American legend. Biles, already the most decorated gymnast of all time, put her name next to a few more records last week when she won the gold in the team event with Team USA, the individual all-around competition and the vault final.\n\nWith those wins, Biles became the most decorated American Olympic gymnast of all time - now with 10 total Olympic medals, including seven gold - and also became the oldest American gymnast to win a gold medal at 27.\n\nShe had a chance to tie another incredible mark if she had won both the beam and the floor exercises on Monday. The only two women to ever win nine Olympic gold medals are American swimmer Katie Ledecky and Soviet gymnast Larisa Latynina. Biles will have to wait until Los Angeles in 2028 if she wants to try and reach that mark.\n\nIt was a tough day on the beam overall for many as multiple competitors fell, including Biles' Team USA teammate Sunisa Lee.\n\nLee lost her footing during her routine and slipped, landing with the beam between her legs before tipping over onto the mat on her side. She would end up finishing in sixth place, one spot behind Biles.\n\nUnlike Biles, the 2020 gold medalist in the all-around won't get another chance to compete; the beam was Lee's last competition here in Paris.", "source": {"uri": "abc7ny.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC7 New York"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila_Esposito", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manila Esposito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_D'Amato", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alice D'Amato"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_(nautical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beam (nautical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_beam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Balance beam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_(gymnastics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Floor (gymnastics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_vault", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's vault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunisa_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sunisa Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larisa_Latynina", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Larisa Latynina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Ledecky", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Katie Ledecky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soviet Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious_Metals", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious Metals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/15145931_080524-wpvi-cnnw-simone-biles-slip-img.JPG?w=1600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788572", "eventUri": "eng-9788572", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

Hers came as she was attempting her acrobatic series. She landed her first flip but quickly got off-balance.\n\nThat resulted in her being forced to jump off the beam and reset, ending her chances of medaling on what is arguably gymnastics' toughest routine.\n\nBiles wasn't the only USA gymnast to fall. Her counterpart Suni Lee also couldn't stay on the apparatus, ensuring the Americans would not medal on the balance beam for the first time since 2000.\n\nHere's what to know about Biles' fall, score and her Olympic history in the event.\n\nMORE: Updated scores, results from men's, women's gymnastics at 2024 Olympics\n\nBiles' fall occurred during her biggest acrobatic series of the event. She was attempting to land three consecutive backflips while maneuvering across the beam, but she was a little off on her execution.\n\nBiles seemed to be rushing through the moves and quickly ended up off-balance. She ended up getting crooked as she completed her second flip and was unable to attempt her third, bailing out of her layout step to jump off the beam.\n\nBiles immediately looked disappointed. She got back on the beam and finished the routine, but the fall did enough damage to her score to prevent her from medaling.\n\nWhile Biles was disappointed with herself, NBC commentator Laurie Hernandez praised Biles for making the right move and jumping off the beam.\n\n\"Going for that last layout would have literally been a safety hazard,\" Hernandez said.\n\nBEST U.S. OLYMPIANS\n\nTop 33 rankings | Simone Biles | Katie Ledecky | Jesse Owens\n\nBiles scored a 13.100 on the balance beam. That was tied for fifth in the field with her teammate, Suni Lee, and 1.266 points lower than the score of gold medalist Alice D'Amato.\n\nIt's worth noting that Biles' original score was a 13.400, but she was given a 0.3-point deduction for failing to salute the judges following her routine. That deduction didn't make a difference in the medal race -- Biles was 0.9 points behind bronze medalist Manila Esposito -- but it was still a noteworthy penalty.\n\nBiles' overall score was also 1.633 points lower than the score she posted in qualifying, which was good for the second-best in the field. Had she posted a similar number Monday, she would have won the competition easily.\n\nBut the balance beam is a fickle apparatus, and the dreaded \"beam curse\" took out more than just Biles during the event finals. Lee, Julia Soares and Sabrina Maneca-Voinea all found themselves off the beam at least once during their routines; and Maneca-Voinea, who finished last with a score of 11.733, fell twice during her performance.\n\nMORE: What to know about Simone Biles' family tree\n\nThe balance beam is one of two apparatuses on which Biles has never won Olympic gold. She earned bronze medals on the beam in both Rio and Tokyo but was hoping to improve upon that result in Paris.\n\nBiles instead failed to medal on the beam, ending her bid for a perfect Olympics.\n\nThat said, Biles is still enjoying a stellar Olympics. She previously earned gold in the team competition, all-around and vault finals to start the event. Next up will be her last event -- the floor exercises -- at which she will be granted a chance to bounce back.\n\nThe floor is arguably Biles' best discipline, so she has a good chance to add a fourth medal to her coffers before she and her USA teammates prepare to finish up in Paris.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_balance_beam", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's balance beam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_(nautical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beam (nautical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_beam", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Balance beam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunisa_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunisa Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_D'Amato", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alice D'Amato"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurie_Hernandez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Laurie Hernandez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Owens", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jesse Owens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Ledecky", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Katie Ledecky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila_Esposito", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manila Esposito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics_at_the_2016_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_artistic_team_all-around", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's artistic team all-around"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_(gymnastics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Floor (gymnastics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://ng-sportingnews.com/s3/files/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-08/Simone%20Biles%20080524.jpg?itok=Z8GuVXcF", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788572", "eventUri": "eng-9788572", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

The American gymnastics star slipped and fell off the apparatus at the end of her acrobatic series during the beam finals at the 2024 Olympics in Paris on Monday, denying her an opportunity to add to the bronzes she won in the event at the 2016 and 2020 Games.\n\nWearing a blue-and-white leotard featuring over 5,000 crystals, Biles was more than halfway through her set when she couldn't quite keep her balance. The 27-year-old hopped off the beam and onto the mat while thousands inside a packed Bercy Arena -- including NFL great Tom Brady -- let out an audible \"ohhh.\"\n\nBiles received a score of 13.100, tied with U.S. teammate Sunisa Lee for fourth.\n\nThere was an extended wait for her score to post. At one point, Biles rolled her eyes in seeming annoyance knowing she wasn't going to finish on the medal stand.\n\nAlice D'Amato of Italy took the gold with a score of 14.366. Zhou Yaqin of China earned silver with a 14.100, just ahead of bronze medalist Manila Esposito of Italy. Italy, which won silver behind the U.S. in the team competition, had never medaled on beam before.\n\nBiles finished in a tie for fifth with Lee, whose hopes for a gold on beam she's long coveted ended in the middle of her routine when she fell during the end of her acro series, just like Biles did a few minutes later.\n\nThe 21-year-old Lee will still leave Paris with three medals just months after she was bedridden while trying to navigate a pair of chronic kidney-related diseases.\n\nWhile Lee's Olympics are over, Biles is also in the floor final later Monday, an event where she's never lost a major international competition, including a gold in Rio do Janeiro eight years ago.\n\n\"We were both just kind of annoyed just because we know what we're capable of,\" Lee said. \"We weren't able to get it done today, but she still has floor and she's the G.O.A.T., so she'll be amazing.\"\n\nThere is plenty of history on the line for Biles in what could be the last competition of her career. Biles has 10 medals in her Olympic career, including seven golds.

How and when to watch", "body": "After already winning three gold medals at the Paris Olympics, superstar Simone Biles will have her last two chances at gold in the Summer Games come Monday as gymnastics wrap up.\n\nMost recently, the 27-year-old gymnast won gold in the women's vault final on Saturday, marking her 7th gold medal and Olympic medal overall. Biles also picked up gold in the all-around and team events.\n\nThe gymnast has billed her tenure in Paris as a \"redemption tour\" -- three years after she withdrew from the Tokyo Games due to the \"twisties,\" changing the course of her career forever.\n\nWhat's next for Simone Biles after the Paris Games? Read her response here.\n\nBiles will aim to add more hardware when she competes in the balance beam and floor exercise, though she'll face fierce competition -- including from one of her own teammates.\n\nHere's Biles remaining competition schedule and when to watch:\n\nBalance beam final: Aug. 5\n\nBiles and fellow U.S. gymnast Suni Lee will find themselves in the same competition in the balance beam final. The two have been trading off highest scoring beam routines throughout the 2024 season- and this competition is bound to be a nail-biter. Biles took home the bronze medal on the balance beam in both 2016 and 2020. Lee, on the other hand, has not yet medaled in an Olympic balance beam final.\n\nThe balance beam final begins at 5:36 a.m. CT on Aug. 5. Streaming begins on E! at 4:45 a.m. CT and at 8:30 a.m. on NBC 5.\n\nFloor exercise final: Aug. 5\n\nThe floor exercise final will be the last event of the women's gymnastics competition this Olympics. Biles and Team USA's Jordan Chiles have both qualified.\n\nBiles won the floor exercise final at the 2016 Games, but had to pull out of the 2020 Games final, leaving room for USA's Jade Carey to take home gold. Carey missed the final in this year's Olympics after an uncharacteristic fall in qualifiers. It was later revealed she had been battling an illness during the Games.\n\nAfter Carey's fall, Chiles scored high enough to clinch the second spot in the final. Chiles' Beyonce-themed floor routine has been a consistent crowd pleaser throughout the Games so far.\n\nWatch the floor exercise final at 7:20 a.m. CT on Aug. 5. Streaming begins on E! at 4:45 a.m. CT and at 8:30 a.m. on NBC 5.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "nbcchicago.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Chicago"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_beam", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Balance beam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_(gymnastics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Floor (gymnastics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_balance_beam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's balance beam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunisa_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunisa Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_(nautical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beam (nautical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jade_Carey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jade Carey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Chiles", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Chiles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E!", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "E!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://media.nbcchicago.com/2024/08/1920x1080_SimoneBiles_GettyImages-2164832428.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788572", "eventUri": "eng-9788572", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 911, "textEnd": 917, "freq": 4}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

Biles took home the bronze medal on the balance beam in both 2016 and 2020. Lee, on the other hand, has not yet medaled in an Olympic balance beam final.\n\nBiles will also compete against another teammate, Jordan Chiles, in the floor event Monday, marking the last women's gymnastics competition of the Games.\n\nAs for the men, while no U.S. athletes are expected to compete, finals will be held in the parallel and horizontal bars.\n\nHere's what to know about all three events and how to watch:\n\nBiles and Lee will find themselves in the same competition yet again in the balance beam final.\n\nThe floor exercise final will be the last event of the women's gymnastics competition this Olympics. Biles and Chiles have both qualified.\n\nBiles won the floor exercise final at the 2016 Games, but had to pull out of the 2020 Games final, leaving room for Carey to take home gold. Carey missed the final in this year's Olympics after an uncharacteristic fall in qualifiers. It was later revealed she had been battling an illness during the Games.\n\nAfter Carey's fall, Chiles scored high enough to clinch the second spot in the final.

In order to compete in the individual finals, gymnasts had to qualify in the top-8 on that apparatus during the team qualification round.\n\nHezly Rivera, the youngest member of the gold medal-winning team, didn't qualify for any of the individual finals.\n\nBiles, the most decorated gymnast in the world, managed to qualify for each individual final, except uneven bars.\n\nBiles missed the uneven bars final by less than two tenths of a point. She qualified in ninth, so she's considered a \"reserve athlete\" for the event.\n\nThe women's balance beam finals begins at 6:36 a.m. Eastern on Monday, Aug. 5.\n\nHours later, Biles will perform her floor routine along with Jordan Chiles in the women's floor exercise final at 8:20 a.m. Eastern.\n\nHere is rest of the individual finals schedule for the entire U.S. women's gymnastics team athletes:\n\nBiles has kept quiet about her future plans, saying her focus after leaving Paris will be on the post-Olympic tour she headlines. Biles is also married and has talked openly about the fear of missing out on life milestones because of her time in the gym.\n\nMinutes after the American gymnastics star won the seventh Olympic gold of her career on Saturday in a vault final that left little doubt that even at 27 she remains in a class by herself, she played coy when asked if the event marked the final time she would ever explode off the springboard in competition.\n\nWhile Biles allowed she was officially retiring her eponymous Yurchenko double pike vault because \"I kind of nailed that one\" at the Paris Olympics, she didn't rule out a return to the Games when they move to Los Angeles in 2028.\n\n\"Never say never,\" Biles said. \"Next Olympics are at home. So you just never know. I am getting really old.\"\n\nThe 2024 Paris Summer Games is Simone Biles' third Olympic appearance. She made her debut in Rio and won four gold medals, including team and individual all-around, and one bronze.

She has also not lost an all-around competition since 2013.\n\nBiles redefines the possibilities of her sport not just in her record-breaking number of wins and medals, but also in the unmatched difficulty of the skills she completes.

In order to compete in the individual finals, gymnasts had to qualify in the top-8 on that apparatus during the team qualification round.\n\nHezly Rivera, the youngest member of the gold medal-winning team, didn't qualify for any of the individual finals.\n\nBiles, the most decorated gymnast in the world, managed to qualify for each individual final, except uneven bars.\n\nBiles missed the uneven bars final by less than two tenths of a point. She qualified in ninth, so she's considered a \"reserve athlete\" for the event.\n\nThe women's balance beam finals begins at 6:36 a.m. Eastern on Monday, Aug. 5.\n\nHours later, Biles will perform her floor routine along with Jordan Chiles in the women's floor exercise final at 8:20 a.m. Eastern.\n\nHere is rest of the individual finals schedule for the entire U.S. women's gymnastics team athletes:\n\nBiles has kept quiet about her future plans, saying her focus after leaving Paris will be on the post-Olympic tour she headlines. Biles is also married and has talked openly about the fear of missing out on life milestones because of her time in the gym.\n\nMinutes after the American gymnastics star won the seventh Olympic gold of her career on Saturday in a vault final that left little doubt that even at 27 she remains in a class by herself, she played coy when asked if the event marked the final time she would ever explode off the springboard in competition.\n\nWhile Biles allowed she was officially retiring her eponymous Yurchenko double pike vault because \"I kind of nailed that one\" at the Paris Olympics, she didn't rule out a return to the Games when they move to Los Angeles in 2028.\n\n\"Never say never,\" Biles said. \"Next Olympics are at home. So you just never know. I am getting really old.\"\n\nThe 2024 Paris Summer Games is Simone Biles' third Olympic appearance. She made her debut in Rio and won four gold medals, including team and individual all-around, and one bronze. She returned for the Tokyo Olympics, where she won silver in the team competition and bronze on the balance beam.\n\nDuring the Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Biles dropped from several events she was scheduled to compete in after suffering a condition that gymnasts call \"the twisties.\"\n\nThe twisties are no joke for an Olympic-level athlete.

Biles took home the bronze medal on the balance beam in both 2016 and 2020. Lee, on the other hand, has not yet medaled in an Olympic balance beam final.\n\nBiles will also compete against another teammate, Jordan Chiles, in the floor event Monday, marking the last women's gymnastics competition of the Games.\n\nAs for the men, while no U.S. athletes are expected to compete, finals will be held in the parallel and horizontal bars.\n\nHere's what to know about all three events and how to watch:\n\nBiles and Lee will find themselves in the same competition yet again in the balance beam final.\n\nThe balance beam final begins at 5:36 a.m. CT on Aug. 5.

Biles and Chiles have both qualified.\n\nBiles won the floor exercise final at the 2016 Games, but had to pull out of the 2020 Games final, leaving room for Carey to take home gold. Carey missed the final in this year's Olympics after an uncharacteristic fall in qualifiers. It was later revealed she had been battling an illness during the Games.\n\nAfter Carey's fall, Chiles scored high enough to clinch the second spot in the final. Chiles' Beyonce-themed floor routine has been a consistent crowd pleaser throughout the Games so far.\n\nWatch the floor exercise final at 7:20 a.m. CT on Aug. 5.

When her score, 13.1, popped up on the leaderboard, she looked furious.\n\nAlice D'Amato of Italy won the gold medal, with 14.366 points, and Zhou Yaqin of China won the silver, with 14.1 points. Another Italian, Manila Esposito, won the bronze, with 14.0 points.\n\nOf the eight gymnasts competing, four fell off the beam, including Sunisa Lee, the other American in the event, who finished sixth. Zhou lost her balance and had to grab the beam to steady herself, miscalculating one of the easier skills in an otherwise stellar routine.\n\nLee, the Olympic all-around champion in Tokyo, fell off the beam during a challenging tumbling series, landing on the beam smack between her legs before tumbling to the ground. That was her last chance to win another medal at these Games. She did not qualify for the final event, the floor exercise.\n\nLee said that the atmosphere in the arena, where the fans were silent during the beam routines and even shushed gymnasts who were cheering for their teammates, contributed to the pressure she felt on the apparatus.\n\n\"It was just crazy to kind of see how everybody was going down like that,\" Lee said. \"I think it's just because there's just so much pressure, you could feel the tension in the room.\"\n\nShe added: \"When I was up there, I was like, people can probably hear me breathing. It adds to the stresses because it's like, yes, you're the only one up there, but it just makes you feel like you're the only one up there.\"\n\nBut these Games can be considered a success for her, after she was diagnosed with two kidney diseases less than two years ago. Lee helped the United States win the team gold medal and she also won bronze medals in the all-around and the uneven bars.\n\nBiles, of course, has had an extraordinary Olympics so far -- until her fall on the beam, which happened on a back layout.\n\nHaving already won three gold medals in the last week -- in the team event, the all-around and the vault -- Biles has three gold medals at this Olympics and 10 Olympic medals overall. She came into these Games as the most decorated gymnast of all time, and may add yet another medal in the floor exercise.\n\nBiles, 27, has said she would love to compete at a home Olympics in 2028, when the Summer Games are staged in Los Angeles, but she also said that training for another four years would be difficult on both her body and mind.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_(nautical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beam (nautical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila_Esposito", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manila Esposito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunisa_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunisa Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_D'Amato", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alice D'Amato"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_beam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Balance beam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_(gymnastics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Floor (gymnastics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kidney disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uneven_bars", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uneven bars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://dnyuz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/One-Small-Slip-Stalls-Biless-Medal-Run-in-Paris.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788572", "eventUri": "eng-9788572", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

From the men's side, the events include parallel bars and high bar. While from the women's side, there's balance beam and floor exercise.\n\nAmong those who will headline the men's high bar is Tang Chia-Hung, leading all with 14.933 points. He completed in the previous 2020 Summer Olympics, but has yet to medal in this event.\n\nWithin the women's balance beam event, the top two leaders are representatives of Brazil in Rebeca Andrade with 14.500 points, and J\u00falia Soares with 13.800 points.\n\nHere's more details on how to watch the men's and women's apparatus finals today:\n\nHere's a recap of Simone Biles' historic run, courtesy of the Associated Press:\n\nPARIS (AP) -- Simone Biles huddled with Sunisa Lee. She looked to her husband Jonathan Owens in the stands. Lost in the moment. And maybe a touch frantic.\n\nThe American gymnastics star knew she was trailing Brazil's Rebeca Andrade and Algeria's Kaylia Nemour through two rotations during the Olympic all-around final Thursday.\n\nAfter a sloppy uneven bars that included a mistake Biles can never remember making in competition, she sat in a chair, closed her eyes, ignored the sea of cameras around her and attempted to refocus.\n\nShe and Lee tried to do the math. How bad was it? They weren't sure. It had been a long time since it was this tight.\n\nBiles checked with Owens, who reassured Biles that she was fine, even though she was in third. His wife of 15 months might not have believed him in the moment.\n\n\"I've just never been so stressed before,\" Biles said.\n\nMaybe because she hadn't been pushed -- not in a long time anyway -- the way Andrade pushed inside an electric Bercy Arena.\n\nYet the jitters eventually faded. The 27-year-old who is redefining what a gymnast can do and how long she can do it went to work.\n\nOne stoic beam routine and one floor exercise that is unlike anything ever done in her sport later, Biles found herself accepting a gold medal from IOC president Thomas Bach for a second time, this time with Lee standing next to her with a bronze.\n\nEight years ago in Rio de Janeiro, Biles was a teenage prodigy. Now, she's an icon. One who remains peerless even when she's not perfect.\n\nBiles now has nine Olympic medals, six of them gold. And while she says she doesn't keep track of these things, she sort of does. The GOAT necklace she rocked in the aftermath isn't a coincidence, even if she maintains she's just \"Simone Biles from Spring, Texas, that loves to flip.\"\n\nMaybe, but she's also the third woman to become a two-time Olympic champion, joining Larisa Latynina of the Soviet Union in 1956 and 1960 and Vera Caslavska of Czechoslovakia in 1964 and 1968. Oh, and the oldest to finish atop the all-around podium since then 30-year-old Maria Gorokhovskaya of the Soviet Union won the first-ever Olympic all-around in Helsinki in 1952.\n\nThe sport then is not what it is now. The days of \"little girls in pretty boxes\" are long gone. Biles has fueled that transformation one performance at a time. There's a reason stars like the U.S. men's basketball team and Kendall Jenner flock to watch her Thursday.\n\nWhen Biles tried to downplay her impact, Lee corrected her.\n\n\"Honestly Simone, I think a lot of it has to do with you,\" Lee said.\n\nEven if her 39th world or Olympic medal didn't come as easily as most of the 38 before it.\n\nShe misjudged a transition on uneven bars, the weakest of her four events, letting go of the upper bar too soon and forcing her to reach for a larger-than-expect gap.\n\nWhile she didn't fall -- Biles muscled her way back into the routine -- it blunted her momentum and led to major deductions that left her behind Andrade through two rotations.\n\nThe deficit didn't last.\n\nBiles responded with a largely wobble-free 14.566 on the balance beam, the highest of the night among the 24 finalists, while Andrade was forced to do a major balance check during her slightly easier set that dropped her down to second heading into floor exercise, Biles' signature event.\n\nAndrade, the silver medalist behind Lee in 2021, needed the best floor set of her life to catch Biles. It didn't quite happen. Andrade stepped out of bounds at one point, a minor problem but enough to create plenty of wiggle room for Biles.\n\n\"I don't want to compete with Rebeca no more,\" Biles said. \"I'm tired. Like, she's way too close. I've never had an athlete that close.\"\n\nBiles incorporated music from pop icons Taylor Swift and Beyonce into her current routine, a 75-second set that began with the opening bars of Swift's hit \"Ready For It?\" and featured the hardest tumbling done by a woman in the history of the sport.\n\nWhen she was done -- sealing gold that served as a redemption of sorts three years after pulling out of multiple finals in Tokyo to focus on her mental health -- Biles sprinted to hug Lee just off the podium and blew kisses to the cameras that have become fixtures wherever she goes under the Olympic rings.\n\nAfter the final score was announced, Biles and Lee -- both Olympic champions -- bolted onto the floor, waving an American flag.\n\nLee, the Tokyo winner with Biles sidelined, is the first to win gold in all-around one Games then earn another medal in the next since Comaneci in 1976 and '80. She did it despite spending much of the last 15 months dealing with multiple kidney diseases that left her return to the Games very much in doubt.\n\n\"I just wanted to prove to myself that I could do it because I didn't think that I could,\" Lee said.\n\nWhile there may be more medals on the way -- Biles is in three event finals later in the Games -- the all-around puts her into the conversation as perhaps the greatest American Olympian ever.\n\nYet she's also far more than that.\n\nShe's a vocal advocate for survivors of sexual abuse and the importance of proper mental health. She met virtually with her therapist before the Americans won gold in the team final on Tuesday. They kept their regular Thursday appointment too.\n\nBiles relied on the internal work she's done over the years after that rocky bars routine. She sat with her legs crossed on a chair in her blue sequined leotard and joked she was \"praying to every single God out there.\"\n\nIn reality, she was trying to re-center herself. And then she moved on. It's what she does.\n\nBiles has said repeatedly over the last three years that what happened in Tokyo is a part of her past, not her present, and if critics have a problem with it, that's their issue, not hers.\n\nShe's moved on to bigger things. Like setting a standard that may never be reached. In her gymnastics for sure, and maybe others too. When trying to count the number of active Olympians who have stood atop their sport for 11 years and counting, no math is required.\n\nThere is only one.\n\nThis story has been corrected to clarify that the location of the 1952 Games was Helsinki and not Melbourne.", "source": {"uri": "cleveland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cleveland"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Loic Venance/AFP via Getty Images hide caption\n\nNPR is in Paris for the 2024 Summer Olympics. For more of our coverage from the games head to our latest updates.\n\nPARIS -- The balance beam can bedevil even the finest gymnast, as Monday's Olympic final showed.\n\nIt is perhaps the trickiest apparatus in women's gymnastics. Athletes must pack as many skills as they can into a 90-second routine -- back handsprings, one-legged turns, flips, jumps and leaps, all performed on an apparatus just four inches wide.\n\nThe U.S. gymnast Simone Biles, perhaps the greatest the sport has ever seen, had been near flawless in this Olympic Games. Before Monday, she had won the gold medal in every event she entered.\n\nBut in the balance beam final, a flip layout midway through Biles's routine proved too off-kilter, and Biles slipped and fell to the mat. Ultimately, her score of 13.1 was not enough to earn her a medal.\n\nIt was one of those days on the balance beam; many of the other competitors in the final also fell or wobbled badly. Italy's Alice D'Amato, one of the few to perform her routine without a major error, took the gold. China's Zhou Yaqin won silver, followed by Italy's Manila Esposito with bronze.\n\nThe beam final was the first of two competitions for Biles on Monday. The second, the floor exercise, in which she is the favorite to win gold, will follow about two hours later.\n\nThe U.S. gymnast Suni Lee also participated in Monday's beam final, but a bad fall during her routine doomed her chances too at a medal.\n\nMonday marked Biles's final day of competition at the 2024 Olympic Games, and perhaps as what may be her final Olympic Games comes to a close. She has won 10 Olympic medals in her career, seven of them gold.\n\nAt 27, Biles is already older than most elite female gymnasts. After the 25-year-old Rebeca Andrade and 23-year-old Jordan Chiles, no competitor who faced Biles on Monday was older than 21. Most were still in their teens.\n\nBiles has not said whether she intends to retire from gymnastics after the Olympics. On Sunday, she chastised journalists for inquiring.\n\n\"You guys really gotta stop asking athletes what's next after they win a medal at the Olympics,\" she wrote on the social media site X. \"Let us soak up the moment we've worked our whole lives for.\" (When one user asked what her next step would be after Paris, Biles replied: \"babysitting the medal.\")", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "NPR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "becky_sullivan@npr.org", "name": "Becky Sullivan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_balance_beam", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's balance beam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_beam", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Balance beam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accor_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Accor Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NPR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila_Esposito", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manila Esposito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_D'Amato", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alice D'Amato"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunisa_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sunisa Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebeca_Andrade", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebeca Andrade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Chiles", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Chiles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_(gymnastics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Floor (gymnastics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/8256x4644+0+433/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9f%2Fd4%2F6381dbb444af87583e59401e13a3%2Fgettyimages-2164912242.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788572", "eventUri": "eng-9788572", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

For more of our coverage from the games head to our latest updates.\n\nPARIS -- The balance beam can bedevil even the finest gymnast, as Monday's Olympic final showed.\n\nIt is perhaps the trickiest apparatus in women's gymnastics. Athletes must pack as many skills as they can into a 90-second routine -- back handsprings, one-legged turns, flips, jumps and leaps, all performed on an apparatus just four inches wide.\n\nThe U.S. gymnast Simone Biles, perhaps the greatest the sport has ever seen, had been near flawless in this Olympic Games. Before Monday, she had won the gold medal in every event she entered.\n\nBut in the balance beam final, a flip layout midway through Biles's routine proved too off-kilter, and Biles slipped and fell to the mat. Ultimately, her score of 13.1 was not enough to earn her a medal.\n\nIt was one of those days on the balance beam; many of the other competitors in the final also fell or wobbled badly. Italy's Alice D'Amato, one of the few to perform her routine without a major error, took the gold. China's Zhou Yaqin won silver, followed by Italy's Manila Esposito with bronze.\n\nThe beam final was the first of two competitions for Biles on Monday. The second, the floor exercise, in which she is the favorite to win gold, will follow about two hours later.\n\nThe U.S. gymnast Suni Lee also participated in Monday's beam final, but a bad fall during her routine doomed her chances too at a medal.\n\nMonday marked Biles's final day of competition at the 2024 Olympic Games, and perhaps as what may be her final Olympic Games comes to a close. She has won 10 Olympic medals in her career, seven of them gold.\n\nAt 27, Biles is already older than most elite female gymnasts. After the 25-year-old Rebeca Andrade and 23-year-old Jordan Chiles, no competitor who faced Biles on Monday was older than 21. Most were still in their teens.\n\nBiles has not said whether she intends to retire from gymnastics after the Olympics. On Sunday, she chastised journalists for inquiring.\n\n\"You guys really gotta stop asking athletes what's next after they win a medal at the Olympics,\" she wrote on the social media site X. \"Let us soak up the moment we've worked our whole lives for.\" (When one user asked what her next step would be after Paris, Biles replied: \"babysitting the medal.\")", "source": {"uri": "gpb.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Georgia Public Broadcasting"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_beam", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Balance beam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NPR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila_Esposito", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manila Esposito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_balance_beam", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's balance beam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_D'Amato", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alice D'Amato"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_(gymnastics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Floor (gymnastics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunisa_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sunisa Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebeca_Andrade", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebeca Andrade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Chiles", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Chiles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://www.gpb.org/sites/default/files/styles/three_two_702x468/public/npr_story_images/2024/08/05/gettyimages-2164912242.jpg?h=aa2ca7c7&itok=4KyhjpUB", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788572", "eventUri": "eng-9788572", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

The 27-year-old gymnast has already won gold in the team final and the all-around in Paris.\n\nFollowing another striking performance, the 27-year-old Biles would not rule out a return to the Games when they are in Los Angeles in 2028.\n\nDid you miss the action? Re-watch it in primetime on NBC 5 beginning at 7 p.m. CT.\n\nAnd that won't be the last opportunity to witness the gymnastics GOAT compete in Paris.\n\nUneven bars final: Aug. 4\n\nLee was the only American woman to qualify for the uneven bars final. Typically considered one of her best events, Lee is a medal contender. At the 2020 Tokyo Games, she took home the bronze medal in the event. Leading up to the Games, Lee said making the podium at the uneven bars final is one of her major goals.\n\nBiles missed the uneven bars finals by tenths of a point. She qualified in ninth place, meaning she is considered a \"reserve athlete\" for the event.\n\nWatch the uneven bar final at 8 a.m. CT on Aug. 4 on NBC 5 or stream it live on Peacock.\n\nBalance beam final: Aug. 5\n\nBiles and Lee will find themselves in the same competition yet again in the balance beam final. The two have been trading off highest scoring beam routines throughout the 2024 season- and this competition is bound to be a nail-biter. Biles took home the bronze medal on the balance beam in both 2016 and 2020. Lee, on the other hand, has not yet medaled in an Olympic balance beam final.\n\nThe balance beam final begins at 5:36 a.m. CT on Aug. 5. Streaming begins on E! at 4:45 a.m. CT and at 8:30 a.m. on NBC 5.\n\nFloor exercise final: Aug. 5\n\nThe floor exercise final will be the last event of the women's gymnastics competition this Olympics. Biles and Chiles have both qualified.\n\nBiles won the floor exercise final at the 2016 Games, but had to pull out of the 2020 Games final, leaving room for Carey to take home gold. Carey missed the final in this year's Olympics after an uncharacteristic fall in qualifiers. It was later revealed she had been battling an illness during the Games.\n\nAfter Carey's fall, Chiles scored high enough to clinch the second spot in the final. Chiles' Beyonce-themed floor routine has been a consistent crowd pleaser throughout the Games so far.\n\nWatch the floor exercise final at 7:20 a.m. CT on Aug. 5.

It ends a streak of Olympic perfection, not only here in Paris but in all of Biles' career.

For more of our coverage from the games head to our latest updates.\n\nIt is perhaps the trickiest apparatus in women's gymnastics. Athletes must pack as many skills as they can into a 90-second routine -- back handsprings, one-legged turns, flips, jumps and leaps, all performed on an apparatus just four inches wide.\n\nThe U.S. gymnast Simone Biles, perhaps the greatest the sport has ever seen, had been near flawless in this Olympic Games. Before Monday, she had won the gold medal in every event she entered.\n\nBut in the balance beam final, a flip layout midway through Biles's routine proved too off-kilter, and Biles slipped and fell to the mat. Ultimately, her score of 13.1 was not enough to earn her a medal.\n\nIt was one of those days on the balance beam; many of the other competitors in the final also fell or wobbled badly. Italy's Alice D'Amato, one of the few to perform her routine without a major error, took the gold. China's Zhou Yaqin won silver, followed by Italy's Manila Esposito with bronze.\n\n\"Balance beam is such an unforgiving, uncertain event. Mistakes happen all the time,\" Zhou said afterward. \"I think the falters, falls, stumbles are because of the high pressure and the nature of balance beam.\"\n\nThe beam final was the first of two competitions for Biles on Monday. The second, the floor exercise, in which she is the favorite to win gold, will follow about two hours later.\n\nThe U.S. gymnast Suni Lee also participated in Monday's beam final, but a bad fall during her routine doomed her chances too at a medal. \"There was just so much pressure. It was crazy to see how everybody was going down like that,\" Lee said afterward.\n\nThe packed crowd at Bercy Arena was especially quiet on Monday -- disturbingly so, Lee said, with the crowd shushing the gymnasts when they tried to cheer for their competitors. \"When I was up there, you could probably hear me breathing. It adds to the stress,\" she said.\n\nThe falls seeped into the men's events, too. About half of the competitors in the horizontal bar final slipped off the bar or fell during their dismount.\n\nMonday marked Biles's final day of competition at the 2024 Olympic Games, and perhaps as what may be her final Olympic Games comes to a close. She has won 10 Olympic medals in her career, seven of them gold.\n\nAt 27, Biles is already older than most elite female gymnasts. After the 25-year-old Rebeca Andrade and 23-year-old Jordan Chiles, no competitor who faced Biles on Monday was older than 21. Most were still in their teens.\n\nBiles has not said whether she intends to retire from gymnastics after the Olympics. On Sunday, she chastised journalists for inquiring.\n\n\"You guys really gotta stop asking athletes what's next after they win a medal at the Olympics,\" she wrote on the social media site X. \"Let us soak up the moment we've worked our whole lives for.\" (When one user asked what her next step would be after Paris, Biles replied: \"babysitting the medal.\")", "source": {"uri": "weku.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "weku.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_beam", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Balance beam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_balance_beam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's balance beam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_(nautical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beam (nautical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NPR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila_Esposito", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manila Esposito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunisa_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunisa Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_D'Amato", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alice D'Amato"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_(gymnastics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Floor (gymnastics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accor_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accor Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebeca_Andrade", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebeca Andrade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Chiles", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Chiles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horizontal bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/103ef61/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7339x3853+0+826/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnpr.brightspotcdn.com%2Fdims3%2Fdefault%2Fstrip%2Ffalse%2Fcrop%2F7339x5504%20597%200%2Fresize%2F7339x5504%21%2F%3Furl%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9f%2Fd4%2F6381dbb444af87583e59401e13a3%2Fgettyimages-2164912242.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788572", "eventUri": "eng-9788572", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

Biles took home the bronze medal on the balance beam in both 2016 and 2020. Lee, on the other hand, has not yet medaled in an Olympic balance beam final.\n\nThe balance beam final begins at 5:36 a.m. CT on Aug. 5. Streaming begins on E! at 4:45 a.m. CT and at 8:30 a.m. on NBC 5.\n\nThe floor exercise final will be the last event of the women's gymnastics competition this Olympics.

In all, the 27-year-old gymnastics superstar has 10 Olympics medals after leading the U.S. team to gold in the women's final and taking the all-around and vault titles.\n\nA top-3 finish in the floor exercise and balance beam would move her past Czechoslovakia's Vera Caslavska (11) for second-most medals by a female gymnast in Olympic history behind Larisa Latynina, who had 18 in the 1950s and 60s for the Soviet Union.\n\nIn the balance beam, her toughest competition will actually be teammate Suni Lee; the two have taken turns with the highest beam routine scores in competitions this year. Lee nabbed bronze in the uneven bars event on Sunday to claim her sixth Olympic medal.\n\nFinally, Biles will be challenged by Brazil's Rebeca Andrade and U.S. teammate Jordan Chiles in the floor exercise. Biles won it in 2016 but pulled out of the event in Tokyo.\n\nAnother Team USA athlete, Jordan Chiles, will compete in the event with a fan-favorite routine set to Beyonce tunes after she finished third in qualifying behind Biles and Andrade.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the final two gymnastics events:\n\nBalance beam final: Aug. 5\n\nThe balance beam final begins at 5:36 a.m. CT on Aug. 5.

She hopped off the beam and onto the mat while thousands inside a packed Bercy Arena let out an audible \"ohhh.\"\n\nBiles received a score of 13.100, tied with U.S. teammate Sunisa Lee for fourth.\n\nThere was an extended wait for her score to post. At one point, Biles rolled her eyes in seeming annoyance knowing she wasn't going to finish on the medal stand.\n\nAlice D'Amato of Italy took the gold with a score of 14.366. Zhou Yaqin of China earned silver with a 14.100, just ahead of bronze medallist Manila Esposito of Italy.\n\nBiles finished in a tie for fifth with Lee, whose hopes for a gold on beam she's long coveted ended in the middle of her routine when she fell during the end of her acro series, just like Biles did a few minutes later.\n\nWATCH l Live coverage of Day 10 artistic gymnastics apparatus finals:\n\nThe 21-year-old Lee will still leave Paris with three medals just months after she was bedridden while trying to navigate a pair of chronic kidney-related diseases.\n\nWhile Lee's Olympics are over, Biles is also in the floor final later Monday, an event where she's never lost a major international competition, including a gold in Rio do Janeiro eight years ago.\n\nThere is plenty of history on the line for Biles in what could be the last competition of her career. Biles has 10 medals in her Olympic career, including seven golds. A medal in the floor final would tie her with Czechoslovakia's Vera Caslavska for the second-most medals by a female gymnast in Olympic history, trailing only former Soviet Union great Larisa Latynina's 18.\n\nBiles has stayed relatively quiet on what lies ahead for her beyond the Paris Games, though she did nudge the door open a little for a possible return when the Olympics shift to Los Angeles.\n\n\"Never say never,\" Biles said after claiming her second Olympic vault title on Saturday. \"Next Olympics are at home. So you just never know. I am getting really old.\"\n\nZou Jingyuan of China was close to perfection Monday to successfully defend his Olympic title in parallel bars on the final day of artistic gymnastics at the Paris Games.\n\nIt was Zou's third medal in Paris after he and his teammates were runner-up behind Japan in the team event. He also claimed a silver in rings.\n\nZou, who is also a three-time world champion in the discipline, claimed gold ahead of Illia Kovtun of Ukraine. Shinnosuke Oka of Japan, the all-around champion, took bronze.\n\nThere is a final gold medal to be decided later Monday in the men's competition, on the horizontal bar. It's another chance for China to add to its tally of Olympic titles after Zhang Boheng posted the highest score in qualifying.\n\nKovtun kicked off the event with a difficult routine that included a spectacular handstand on one rail that impressed judges and earned him a score of 15.500.\n\nHe remained in the lead until Zou posted a massive 16.200 with a sublime routine combining strength elements with impressive aerials that he capped with a stuck dismount. That was the highest single score in artistic gymnastics at these Games.\n\nIt was a rare feat from Zou, who became the first man to succesfully defend his title on parallel bars at the Olympics since Sawao Kato of Japan in 1976.", "source": {"uri": "cbc.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person",

Biles was second in qualifying behind China's Zhou Yaqin last week. She will go next-to-last in an eight-woman final that includes U.S. teammate Sunisa Lee and Brazilian standout Rebeca Andrade.\n\nBiles will then move to the floor later Monday, an event where she's never lost a major international competition, including a gold in Rio do Janeiro eight years ago.\n\nThere is plenty of history on the line for Biles in what could be the last competition of her career. Biles has 10 medals in her Olympic career, including seven golds. Two more medals would move her past Czechoslovakia's Vera Caslavska for the second-most medals by a female gymnast in Olympic history, trailing only former Soviet Union great Larisa Latynina's 18.\n\nTwo golds would tie her for the second most gold medals in the Olympics -- Summer or Winter -- in any sport.\n\nShe would join Finnish distance runner Paavo Nurmi, Latynina, American swimmer Mark Spitz, American sprinter Carl Lewis and American swimmer Katie Ledecky. U.S. swimmer Michael Phelps leads the way with 23 golds.\n\nBiles has stayed relatively quiet on what lies ahead for her beyond the Paris Games, though she did nudge the door open a little for a possible return when the Olympics shift to Los Angeles.\n\n\"Never say never,\" Biles said after claiming her second Olympic vault title on Saturday. \"Next Olympics are at home. So you just never know. I am getting really old.\"\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"},

Re-watch it in primetime on NBC 5 beginning at 6 p.m. CT.\n\nWhile it wasn't the last chance to catch Simone Biles, Lee and the rest of Team USA in action, the opportunities are numbered.\n\nHere are details on the final two competitions Monday:\n\nBalance beam final: Aug. 5\n\nBiles and Lee will find themselves in the same competition yet again in the balance beam final. The two have been trading off highest scoring beam routines throughout the 2024 season- and this competition is bound to be a nail-biter. Biles took home the bronze medal on the balance beam in both 2016 and 2020. Lee, on the other hand, has not yet medaled in an Olympic balance beam final.\n\nThe balance beam final begins at 5:36 a.m. CT on Aug. 5. Streaming begins on E! at 4:45 a.m. CT and at 8:30 a.m. on NBC 5.\n\nFloor exercise final: Aug. 5\n\nThe floor exercise final will be the last event of the women's gymnastics competition this Olympics. Biles and Jordan Chiles have both qualified.\n\nBiles won the floor exercise final at the 2016 Games, but had to pull out of the 2020 Games final, leaving room for Jade Carey to take home gold. Carey missed the final in this year's Olympics after an uncharacteristic fall in qualifiers. It was later revealed she had been battling an illness during the Games.\n\nAfter Carey's fall, Chiles scored high enough to clinch the second spot in the final. Chiles' Beyonce-themed floor routine has been a consistent crowd pleaser throughout the Games so far.\n\nWatch the floor exercise final at 7:20 a.m. CT on Aug. 5.

Lee performed early in the rotation, appearing to lose her balance slightly on some choreography before splitting the beam and falling to the mat. She earned a final score of 13.100.\n\nBrazil's J\u00falia Soares and Romania's Sabrina Voinea also struggled to stay steady before Biles hit the beam. She started strong but was ultimately unable to avoid a mishap. She earned the same score as her teammate Lee.\n\nDespite the upset at Monday's final, both Biles and Lee have impressed throughout the 2024 Games. They walked away from the team all-around with gold medals alongside fellow Team USA gymnasts Jade Carey, Jordan Chiles and Hezly Rivera before taking home individual medals. Biles earned gold in the vault competition, while Lee secured bronze in the uneven bars final.\n\nThe Paris Olympics have been an opportunity for both Biles and Lee to make big comebacks in the sport following challenges with mental and physical health. Biles notably pulled out of the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 due to a bout of the \"twisties,\" leaving the competition early. Lee, meanwhile, was diagnosed with two rare kidney diseases in 2023.\n\n\"Honestly just gonna look back and think about how I was able to persevere everything,\" Lee told reporter Zora Stephenson after Monday's finals, revealing that the arena felt \"too quiet\" during the competition, which added to the pressure. \"I'm so sad about my beam routine, but it's OK because ... I gave it my all.\"\n\nAccording to Lee, the final scores among the gymnasts \"would've been really close\" if there weren't any mistakes because \"everybody was so amazing\" throughout the Paris Olympics.\n\nBiles did not appear to speak with reporters following the beam competition, but she still has one more individual event before the closing ceremony. She and Chiles, 23, are set to compete in the floor exercise finals later on Monday.\n\nAfter earning her 10th Olympic medal in Paris, Biles sent a strong message to those wondering whether she'll be back for the 2028 Games in Los Angeles.\n\n\"You guys really gotta stop asking athletes what's next after they win a medal at the Olympics,\" she tweeted on Sunday, August 4. \"Let us soak up the moment we've worked our whole lives for.\"", "source": {"uri": "usmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Us Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "meredith_nardino@usmagazine.com", "name": "Meredith Nardino", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_(nautical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beam (nautical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Romania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Romania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_uneven_bars", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's uneven bars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezly_Rivera", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hezly Rivera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics_at_the_2016_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_artistic_team_all-around", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's artistic team all-around"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jade_Carey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jade Carey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Chiles", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Chiles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Summer_Olympics_closing_ceremony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2020 Summer Olympics closing ceremony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_(gymnastics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Floor (gymnastics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Simone-Biles-and-Suni-Lee-Fall-Off-Balance-Beam-During-2024-Olympics-Finals-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788572", "eventUri": "eng-9788572", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 85, "textEnd": 93}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-04", "textStart": 2286, "textEnd": 2294}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

Simone Biles, Suni Lee, and Jordan Chiles will compete in their final routines of the Games as they go for one more gold in the floor and beam finals.\n\nBiles and Lee will compete alongside each other in beam finals for what could be the last time of their careers. The two competed and medaled in the all-around finals just days ago. Monday is expected to be a repeat of that as the two are favorites to podium on the beam.\n\nIt will be close as Lee qualified fourth behind Rebeca Andrade and Biles second behind Zhou Yaqin. Then again, only the Americans are bronze medalists on the event.\n\nClosing out the competition is floor, where Biles will fly high as she goes for her second gold on the event. She'll compete alongside Chiles, who qualified for the event thanks to her show-stopping, Beyonc\u00e9-inspired routine. It will be Chiles first individual competition in her Olympic career, but she's set to make a run for the podium after qualifying third.\n\nWhile no gymnast has announced their future gymnastics plans, the floor and beam finals could be the final time Biles, Lee, and Chiles perform at the Olympic Games. So, take it all in as the trio completes its Paris redemption tour with what's hopefully a historic finish at Bercy Arena.\n\nThe Sporting News is live tracking results and highlights from the women's gymnastics floor and beam finals at the 2024 Olympics. Scroll below for updates.\n\nBecause NBC owns the broadcasting rights to the Olympics, events will be shown on channels under the network. The Olympic women's gymnastics beam finals will be aired on E! beginning at 6:36 a.m. ET on Monday, Aug. 5 after the men's parallel bars. Floor will begin at 8:20 a.m. ET after men's horizontal bar finals.\n\nCord-cutters can stream the competition on Fubo, which offers a free trial and provides access to all NBC networks.

Biles was second in qualifying behind China's Zhou Yaqin last week. She will go next-to-last in an eight-woman final that includes U.S. teammate Sunisa Lee and Brazilian standout Rebeca Andrade.\n\nBiles will then move to the floor later Monday, an event where she's never lost a major international competition, including a gold in Rio do Janeiro eight years ago.\n\nThere is plenty of history on the line for Biles in what could be the last competition of her career. Biles has 10 medals in her Olympic career, including seven golds. Two more medals would move her past Czechoslovakia's Vera Caslavska for the second-most medals by a female gymnast in Olympic history, trailing only former Soviet Union great Larisa Latynina's 18.\n\nTwo golds would tie her for the second most gold medals in the Olympics -- Summer or Winter -- in any sport.\n\nShe would join Finnish distance runner Paavo Nurmi, Latynina, American swimmer Mark Spitz, American sprinter Carl Lewis and American swimmer Katie Ledecky. U.S. swimmer Michael Phelps leads the way with 23 golds.\n\nBiles has stayed relatively quiet on what lies ahead for her beyond the Paris Games, though she did nudge the door open a little for a possible return when the Olympics shift to Los Angeles.\n\n\"Never say never,\" Biles said after claiming her second Olympic vault title on Saturday. \"Next Olympics are at home.

Typically considered one of her best events, Lee is a medal contender. At the 2020 Tokyo Games, she took home the bronze medal in the event. Leading up to the Games, Lee said making the podium at the uneven bars final is one of her major goals.\n\nBiles missed the uneven bars finals by tenths of a point. She qualified in ninth place, meaning she is considered a \"reserve athlete\" for the event.\n\nWatch the uneven bar final at 8 a.m. CT on Aug. 4 on NBC 5 or stream it live on Peacock.\n\nThe men's rings final will be held at 8 a.m. CT on Sunday, Aug. 4. The event will air live on NBC 5 and streaming on Peacock. No U.S. men qualified for the event, but Asher Hong is listed as the first reserve athlete, meaning if anyone is injured or unable to compete, he will be eligible.\n\nThe men's vault final will be held at 9:24 a.m. CT on Sunday, Aug. 4. The event will air live on NBC 5a and streaming on Peacock. No U.S. men qualified for the event, but Asher Hong is listed as the first reserve athlete, meaning if anyone is injured or unable to compete, he will be eligible.\n\nBiles and Lee will find themselves in the same competition yet again in the balance beam final. The two have been trading off highest scoring beam routines throughout the 2024 season- and this competition is bound to be a nail-biter. Biles took home the bronze medal on the balance beam in both 2016 and 2020. Lee, on the other hand, has not yet medaled in an Olympic balance beam final.\n\nThe balance beam final begins at 5:36 a.m. CT on Aug. 5. Streaming begins on E! at 4:45 a.m. CT and at 8:30 a.m. on NBC 5.\n\nThe floor exercise final will be the last event of the women's gymnastics competition this Olympics. Biles and Chiles have both qualified.\n\nBiles won the floor exercise final at the 2016 Games, but had to pull out of the 2020 Games final, leaving room for Carey to take home gold. Carey missed the final in this year's Olympics after an uncharacteristic fall in qualifiers. It was later revealed she had been battling an illness during the Games.\n\nAfter Carey's fall, Chiles scored high enough to clinch the second spot in the final. Chiles' Beyonce-themed floor routine has been a consistent crowd pleaser throughout the Games so far.\n\nWatch the floor exercise final at 7:20 a.m. CT on Aug. 5. Streaming begins on E! at 4:45 a.m. CT and at 8:30 a.m. on NBC 5.\n\nThe men's parallel bars final takes place at 4:45 a.m. CT on Monday, Aug. 5. The event will air live on E! and streaming on Peacock. No U.S. men are expected to compete.\n\nThe men's horizontal bar final will take place at 6:33 a.m. CT on Monday, Aug. 5. The event will air live on E! and streaming on Peacock.

She has won three gold medals in Paris, bringing her career total to seven. Though Biles has not confirmed if she will compete in the 2028 Los Angeles Games, she said \"never say never\" Saturday.\n\nAfter winning gold in the men's 100-meter final, Noah Lyles returns to the track for Round 1 of the men's 200 meters. Since 2022, Lyles hasn't lost a race in the 200 meters at the world championships or Olympics. If Lyles wins the 200m, he'll become just the third man to win the 100 meters and 200 meters at a single Olympics -- Usain Bolt (three times) and Carl Lewis in 1984 are the only others to do so, according to ESPN Stats & Information.\n\nOn the sand or indoors, a handful of America's volleyball teams compete in knockout round play. Chase Budinger and Miles Evans face Norway's Christian S\u00f8rum and Anders Mol, who won gold in Tokyo, in the round of 16. The U.S. men's volleyball team plays Brazil in the quarterfinals after undefeated pool play.\n\nHere's what to look out for Monday.\n\nSimone Biles and Suni Lee were back at work on the final day of gymnastics competition at the Paris Olympics. The women competed first on beam, where Biles and Lee were favorites for medals. It was a meet marred by falls.\n\nLee competed second and had a brilliant routine going before her right foot slipped on her aerial series and she split the beam. She took a hard fall, then remounted and finished her set. After her dismount, she hugged Biles and her coach, Jess Graba, and told them she was OK. Lee finished in sixth with a 13.1 and will leave Paris with a total of six Olympic medals over two Games.\n\nBiles competed second to last and suffered a fall on her series after a remarkable start. She remounted and stuck her landing and then waited an incredibly long time for her score to appear. She was also awarded a 13.1, but with a higher execution score than Lee, which placed her off the podium in fifth.\n\nItaly's Alice D'Amato won gold with a score of 14.366. China's Zhou Yagin earned silver with a 14.1, and Italy's Manila Esposito took bronze.\n\nIn the first final of the day, China's Zou Jingyuan took gold on parallel bars with a whopping score of 16.200. Illia Kovtun of Ukraine earned silver and Shinnosuke Oka of Japan finished with bronze.\n\nNext up: The floor final, Biles' and Jordan Chiles' last chance to earn medals at the Olympics. Chiles is the only returning member of Team USA who does not have an individual Olympic medal. She qualified third into this final. Now's her chance. -- Alyssa Roenigk\n\nEverybody wants to see the Simone Biles show -- even Tom Brady. The NFL legend made his way to Bercy Arena to see Biles compete for her fourth gold medal in Paris on beam.\n\nThe 400-meter hurdles have always been second nature for American runner Rai Benjamin, who was a silver medalist in the event at the Tokyo Games. But he's seeking revenge in Paris. His 13-step technique to float through the 10 barriers in the first round led to crossing the line first in his heat with a time of 48.82 seconds to advance to the semifinals.\n\nBetween a return to gold for the women's team and the first team medal in 16 years for the men's squad, it's been an Olympics to remember for USA gymnastics. But Team USA isn't done just yet. Simone Biles won the vault Saturday for her seventh career Olympic gold, and she is back in action Monday looking to repeat the feat in floor and on beam. Biles arrived to Bercy Arena with teammates Jordan Chiles and bars bronze medalist Suni Lee as the team looks to add more hardware to their Paris showing.\n\nTwo hours after the men's 100-meter final, Alain Zobrist, Omega's head timekeeper of the Olympics, is at a party at the Omega House in Paris' Hotel de Poulpry to celebrate the Olympics coming to Los Angeles in 2028. It's a star-studded affair, but Zobrist spent the past hour in a room upstairs speaking with news outlets on the phone and via Zoom to explain how he oversaw a room of judges at Stade de France as they determined who, in fact, was the fastest man in the world Sunday.\n\n\"Wait here. Let me get something,\" Zobrist said after rejoining the party. He returns with an 8\u00bd x 11 image from Omega's photo finish camera that represents the finish line over a specific period in the final milliseconds of the race. At first glance, it looks like a photograph of the eight sprinters crossing the finish line. It's a screenshot of the technology the judges used to determine the winner, which has split the runners to show when each man's chest crossed the finish line. According to Olympic rules, the first runner whose torso reaches the closest edge of the finish line is the winner.\n\nWhose toe or knee or head crosses first is irrelevant. The chest is what matters.\n\n\"Something said I need to lean, and I was like, 'I'm going to lean,' because it was that kind of race,\" gold medalist Noah Lyles said after the race.\n\nIn the image, red vertical lines are drawn through the \"frontest part of each man's chest,\" according to Zobrist. In real time, it was impossible to determine a winner, but in the image, Lyles' chest clearly is out front. \"It's clear. He crossed the line first,\" Zobrist says. \"That's the technology.\n\n\"Time doesn't matter,\" he says. What matters is finish order, and once the judges determine who won, they look at when precisely that happened. Then they compare how that time -- 9.784 seconds -- compares to records that have come before it.\n\nThe AI program then breaks down the data even further. A readout distributed by Omega shows Lyles' reaction time of 0.178 seconds was comparatively slow to his competitors, but that he reached his top speed of 43.60 kph (or approximately 27.09 mph) at the 65.1-meter mark. It explains that the race's critical moment came at the end. Lyles maintained his speed for the final 34.8 meters, while silver medalist Kishane Thompson decelerated, allowing Lyles to take the lead just after the 9-second mark. Most importantly, the document ends with a report of Lyles' medal color: gold. -- Alyssa Roenigk", "source": {"uri": "espn.ph", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

There's one thing that Biles and many of the other gymnasts have done during the competition that has left some people with questions.\n\nBiles and others have been known to write things on the balance beam during the competition. Former Olympian Shawn Johnson has explained what that's all about.\n\n\"A lot of times it's like personal notes. You're not, like, writing words. You're not literally, like, writing out words. But you're marking it. So, as you're going through your routine, it can be really good place holders or reminders for yourself to say, like, 'oh, start your skill here.' You don't want to be before it or behind it. It's just like little mental notes and reminders throughout your routine. Does that make sense?\" Johnson said on her Instagram Stories on July 31.\n\nJohnson is in Paris providing commentary and cheering on the Golden Girls (Biles, Jordan Chiles, Sunisa Lee, Jade Carey and Hezly Rivera).\n\nBiles will be going for gold in the balance beam event on August 5.\n\nBiles has been known to mark the balance beam before competing. However, she doesn't just make a small line to mark her spot as Johnson suggested.\n\n\"You see, everybody puts their line on the beam, so I can never tell which one is mine. So, I put an 'S' on it, and it happens to turn into a dollar sign. People think I do it on purpose, but I don't,\" Biles told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette in 2014.\n\nBiles is poised to win gold in the balance beam event, but she has to stay focused -- and healthy. Biles is competing in the 2024 Olympic Games with a sore calf. She's been spotted competing with her lower leg taped up and has even been seen limping from time to time.\n\nDuring the 2024 U.S. Olympic gymnastics trials in June, the gymnast was a bit more wobbly than she would have liked.\n\nShe was \"very, very pissed,\" her coach, Laurent Landi said, according to USA Today. \"Her mental is still -- it's never going to be healed completely, so this is why she really needs to calm herself down,\" Landi continued, adding, \"she needs to rely on her own practice. ... She hits everything perfectly normal.\"\n\nBiles herself spoke to the press about getting the wobbles during the event.\n\n\"I'm so upset about beam,\" Biles told NBC after the outing. \"I'm really disappointed in myself because that's not how I train. And so going forward, I'm going to try to compete how I train on that event. Because I know I'm good at it. I know I can do better. So that's what I'm going to work on,\" she added.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "effie_orfanides@heavy.com", "name": "Effie Orfanides", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_beam", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Balance beam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawn_Johnson_East", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shawn Johnson East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezly_Rivera", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hezly Rivera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunisa_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunisa Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jade_Carey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jade Carey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Chiles", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Chiles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_(nautical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beam (nautical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurent_Landi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laurent Landi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Post-Gazette", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MixCollage-01-Aug-2024-06-17-PM-5262.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788572", "eventUri": "eng-9788572", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 869, "textEnd": 876}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 1077, "textEnd": 1085}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

suffering big fall at Paris Olympics", "body": "Simone Biles was there for her Team USA colleague and friend Sunisa Lee\n\nOlympic champion Simone Biles was there for her teammate Sunisa Lee after the American suffered a major fall in the women's balance beam final at the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nLee, who is one of the best gymnasts in the world, took to the balance beam this morning (5 August) as she looked to secure yet another gold medal in the Paris Games.\n\nBut her stunning routine fell apart after she lost her footing.\n\nTragically for Lee and her supporters, the 21-year-old fell to the mat below where she stood still for a few seconds, absolutely devastated, before returning to finish off her routine.\n\nThe crowd gave her a rapturous applause as they got behind the athlete following her error, which took her out of contention for a medal.\n\nReturning to the USA benches, one of the first to say something to Lee was her teammate and friend, Simone Biles.\n\nBiles, who is competing for gold today in the floor finals and suffered a fall herself on the balance beam, was there to embrace her teammate.\n\nGiving her a big hug and with a beaming smile across her face, Biles could be heard saying: \"That was still so good.\"\n\nAfter sitting down back on the team benches, Lee could be heard telling Biles 'I'm good'.\n\nAnd that's because despite the fall, Lee has had a successful 2024 Games.\n\nShe won gold in the women's artistic team all-around event and bronze in the women's all-around and uneven bars.\n\nIn the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, Lee won gold in the all-around event.\n\nShe also won gold in the 2019 World Championships in Stuttgart for the women's artistic team all-around event.\n\nIt isn't the first time Biles has had Lee's back during the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nBiles has been there to back her teammate after former Olympic silver medallist MyKayla Skinner questioned the talent and worth ethic of the USA Gymnastics' Olympic team.\n\nIn a now-deleted video, Skinner said 'besides Simone, I feel like the talent and the depth just isn't like what it used to be'.\n\n\"The girls just don't have the work ethic,\" she added.\n\nSkinner quickly retracted the comments, posting an apology which read: \"I want to formally apologise to Team USA and to our gymnastic community for my comments during my recent YouTube episodes of the gymnastics Olympic trials.\n\n\"It was not my intention to offend or disrespect any of the athletes or to take away from their hard work.\"\n\nAfter winning gold in the team event with Lee, Biles posted an image of the five winning athletes and coyly writing: \"Lack of talent, lazy, Olympic champions.\"", "source": {"uri": "ladbible.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LADbible"}, "authors":

Simone Biles settled for fifth in the beam final at the Paris Olympics, tumbling off the perilous apparatus to leave her outside of the medals altogether.\n\nThe American superstar turned away with a grimace after learning her score, 13.100, which included a 0.3 penalty. After redemption in Paris and a third Olympic gold following a statement performance in the vault on Saturday, the beam provided a telling reminder of the cutthroat nature of gymnastics as Alice D'Amato claimed a famous gold for Italy.\n\nMonday was one last chance to witness history at the Bercy Arena, which has been one of the hottest tickets in Paris. Snoop Dogg has danced to her rhythm at the Bercy Arena and Team USA's basketball superstars, including Kevin Durant, are among the illustrious names queueing up to witness greatness.\n\nHer final appearance and the sport's final session in Paris brought an opportunity for a special exclamation point to conclude one of the great sporting chapters. Instead, the beam delivered intense drama to leave spectators gasping in horror at each mistake.\n\nIt brought the gymnasts together, though, given the uncomfortable viewing at each attempt to combat what proved to be a slippy beam. Sunisa Lee, Julia Soares and Sabrina Maneca-Voinea joined Biles by taking a tumble, with five slips in total. This was high risk, high reward, with the beam measuring just 10cm wide.\n\nAnd Lee's fall was especially jarring as she took the full force of the beam, leaving Biles to spin away in anguish before rushing to console her teammate a moment later.\n\nEven Biles in her prime, at Rio de Janeiro 2016, could only win bronze in the balance beam, repeating the trick in Tokyo. But the previous drama in the event here led to a hushed silence before she began, which may have proven distracting to her performance here.\n\nNonetheless, she started with a switch-leap mount, a pike back ensured a fluid, dynamic start, but then the fall came. A brave face followed, recovering with a full-twisting double back to finish. But the routine proved she is indeed human. And after an agonising wait, it was only fifth place. The second-highest difficulty score in the final was not enough to salvage the performance. D'Amato and a lofty score of 14.366 proved enough for gold. And she sobbed uncontrollably after a lengthy wait to learn Rebeca Andrade's score.\n\nThe glistening, diamond-encrusted 'GOAT' necklace has been swinging from Biles' neck this week. \"A little ode,\" she concluded. \"The haters hate it, so I love it even more, it's a special part of me and a visual reminder that I can do it.\"\n\nBut her beam performance proves a telling and valuable lesson that even the greatest can experience inconsistency in their arena.\n\nIf Biles missed out on a medal altogether, it further emphasised the real lesson of the Games for her in what has concluded a mental journey following invaluable training alongside her sports therapist.\n\nStill the third most decorated female gymnast with 10 Olympic medals, behind second-placed Vera Caslavska and overall leader Larisa Latynina, of the Soviet Union, on 18 medals, Biles has now experienced a full range of experiences in Paris.\n\nIf the team gold provided the platform for Biles to sparkle, removing any lingering doubt to banish the demons from Tokyo. Then the beam offered a humbling experience. Biles had previously conceded that Brazil's Rebeca Andrade had provided the \"stress\" and now she is tackling the right kind of stress.\n\nHer legacy has extended beyond gold medals for some time, even in a purely sporting aspect. The innovation for each routine has extended to Paris. The genuine buzz to see her perform the huge Biles II vault was an unforgettable moment of Paris 2024.\n\nAnd her audacious approach to each routine, gambling with techniques of a higher difficulty, which are at times a full mark higher than her rivals, would not stop at the beam. Her routine here was the second-highest difficulty rating overall.\n\nIt did not pay off here, but a willingness to try, time and again, should elevate the level of the sport in the build-up to Los Angeles 2028. There is still time for one final hurrah in the floor final, but Biles has now delivered the full Olympic experience.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_(nautical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beam (nautical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accor_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Accor Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_D'Amato", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alice D'Amato"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snoop_Dogg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Snoop Dogg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunisa_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunisa Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_beam", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Balance beam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horror film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rio de Janeiro"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rio de Janeiro"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebeca_Andrade", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebeca Andrade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Demon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larisa_Latynina", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Larisa Latynina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soviet Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/05/12/newFile-10.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788572", "eventUri": "eng-9788572", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

However, a fall from the beam proved her undoing and she couldn't fully recover.\n\nThe difficulty of her efforts meant some hoped she might be able to sneak into the medals, but it wasn't to be. Instead it was Alice D'Amato who claimed gold, with Rebeca Andrade - one of the favourites - only managing fourth, just ahead of Biles.\n\nAs the cameras cut to Biles while the judges made their decision, she appeared to ask why the crowd was shushing. She was locked in conversation with her coach after the run, though exactly what she said was unclear.\n\n\"Simone is not happy at all. It just goes to show she is a human being,\" BBC commentator Craig Heap said. \"All the other ladies in that final have made mistakes. She's not invincible.\"\n\n\"We usually say about beam that who stays on wins a medal, and unfortunately that's the way it's gone,\" added former Olympian Beth Tweddle. \"There was a lot of errors in that final. The two Italians went out and did their routines cleanly, and that's the result.\n\n\"The pressure of an Olympic final is so much and you only have to be slightly off line and that's game over. You cannot pull it back. They were going for some difficult elements out there.\"\n\nHow surprised were you by the result? Have your say in the comments section\n\nBiles, 27, won two golds in three days earlier in the Paris Olympic Games. She was vying for an 11th career Olympic medal in France, but fell just short - eventually tying with team-mate Sunisa Lee, who also fell in the final\n\n\"it was really silent when you get up there,\" Lee told NBC. \"I don't like that, just because it gives me too much time to like think, and I can hear everything.\"\n\nD'Amato was one of two Italians on the podium, with her team-mate Manila Esposito winning bronze. In between the Italian pair was China's Zhou Yaqin, the first to post a score in the final.\n\nBiles will be 31 by the time the next summer Olympics in Los Angeles rolls around, but she hasn't ruled out competing. \"Never say never,\" she said. \"Next Olympics are at home. So you just never know. I am getting really old.\"\n\nShe has one last chance to win another medal in Paris, in the floor final. However, she'll need to get the better of D'Amato with the Italian out to spring another surprise after welling up upon the realisation of what she had achieved.\n\nFollow all the action on day 10 of the Paris Olympics with Mirror Sport's live blog\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

Jingyuan qualified first with a massive score of 16.200 - a full point higher than the rest of his competitors and is undoubtedly the favorite for gold in the final.\n\nWhen Simone Biles is on the roster, many people automatically assume gold. However, the balance beam title is just about anybody's game.\n\nChina's Zhou Yaqin, who is the reigning world silver medalist, finished the qualification round with the highest score, but not by much. Biles, the reigning world champion, finished just over a tenth below Yaqin and will be hungry for gold after winning bronze in Rio and Tokyo.\n\nSuni Lee is also targeting gold and has been very vocal about her goal when talking to the media.\n\n\"Beam, I want to win this time around,\" Lee said after winning bronze on the uneven bars the day before beam finals. \"I feel like every single time I make it into a beam final I never really prove what I can do. So this time around I want to prove to myself that I can do it.\"\n\nBrazil's Rebeca Andrade could contend for a spot on the podium as well. Andrade qualified in third and only needs one more medal to surpass sailors Robert Scheidt and Torben Grael to become the most decorated Brazilian in Olympic history.\n\nBALANCE BEAM QUALIFICATION RESULTS:\n\n1. Zhou Yaqin (China) - 14.866\n\n2. Simone Biles (United States) - 14.733\n\n3. Rebeca Andrade (Brazil) - 14.500\n\n4. Suni Lee (United States) - 14.033\n\n5. Sabrina Maneca-Voinea (Romania) - 14.000\n\n6. Manila Esposito (Italy) - 13.966\n\n7. Alice D'Amato (Italy) - 13.866\n\n8. Julia Soares (Brazil) - 13.800\n\nSEE MORE: How to watch gymnastics at the Paris Olympics: TV and stream schedule\n\nThe men's gymnastics competition will conclude with the high bar final - where a new champion is guaranteed to be crowned after defending Olympic champion Daiki Hashimoto did not advance to the final.\n\nChina's Zhang Boheng notched the top score in qualifications and will be looking for gold in his final routine. Tang Chia-Hung could also contend to win Chinese Taipei's first gymnastics gold medal.\n\nTakaaki Sugino, who helped the Japanese team win gold, has yet to win an individual medal in Paris but stands a good chance after finishing third in qualifications on the event.\n\nThere's no better way to close out the gymnastics competition at the Paris Olympic Games.\n\nA gold medalist on the floor exercise from 2016, Biles is favored to come away with the gold again. Her intended difficulty is at least a full point higher than her competitors, giving her a comfortable cushion.\n\nAndrade is likely to end up on the podium as well, as long as she can control her landings - which is what took her out of medal contention on the event in Tokyo.\n\nJordan Chiles is a world medalist on the event from 2022 and has looked incredible on floor so far in Paris. If she wins a medal, it would be the third Olympic medal of her career and her first individual medal.\n\nSabrina Maneca-Voinea of Romania could be in the conversation as well, finishing just .066 behind Chiles in qualifications.

wrote: 'You guys really need to stop asking athletes what they're going to do after they win a medal at the Olympics.'\n\nBiles added in another post: \"Let's enjoy the moment we've worked our whole lives for.\"\n\nWhen a fan asked her what her next step was after winning another gold medal, she replied, \"keeping an eye on the medal.\"\n\nThe 27-year-old American won three gold medals in Paris and can win more on Monday\n\nBiles' victory in the vault final on Saturday earned her the seventh gold medal of her illustrious Olympic career.\n\nIn front of a star-studded crowd that included actor John Travolta, track star Allyson Felix, artists Pharrell and Flavor Flav, her teammates and her parents, she averaged 15.3 on her signature Yurchenko double pike and Cheng jumps to claim her second gold medal in the event, eight years after winning it in Rio.\n\nThat means Biles, already the most decorated gymnast in history, now becomes only the second woman to win two vault titles, after Vera Casalavska of Czechoslovakia (1984 and 1968).\n\nBiles has two more chances to add to her medal tally in Paris with the balance beam and floor finals on Monday.", "source": {"uri": "nybreaking.com",

her close bond with Chiles, 23, on display.\n\n'red, white, biles&chiles,' she captioned her post on Instagram.\n\nThe pair can be seen hanging out on a balcony in what presumably is the Olympic Village, which is located in the northern Paris suburb of Saint-Denis.\n\nBoth gymnasts wore booty shorts with 'TEAM USA' printed on them as they also showed off their back muscles with crop tops.\n\nSimone Biles and Jordan Chiles showed off their back muscles with captivating snaps, Sunday\n\nBiles' eye-popping post comes a day after she criticized reporters for their line of questioning\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nChiles also posted a series of pics with Biles on Instagram.\n\nShe wrote 'team usa girlies...' with a red heart emoji as a caption to her post.\n\nAfter claiming gold in the teams finals, all-around events and women's vault earlier this week, Biles expressed her frustration with the line of questioning taking place after her performances in Paris.\n\nAddressing reporters on X, she posted: 'you guys really gotta stop asking athletes what's next after they win a medal at the Olympics.'\n\nBiles then added in another post: 'let us soak up the moment we've worked our whole lives for'.\n\nWhen asked by a fan what does come next for her after winning another gold, she replied: 'babysitting the medal'.\n\nThe 27-year-old American has won three gold medals in Paris, and can win more on Monday\n\nBiles' victory in Saturday's vault final handed her the seventh gold medal of her illustrious Olympics career.\n\nIn front of a star-studded crowd that included actor John Travolta, track star Allyson Felix, artists Pharrell and Flavor Flav, her teammates and her parents, she averaged 15.3 for her signature Yurchenko double pike and Cheng vaults to claim a second gold on the event eight years after she trumped in Rio.\n\nIt means Biles, who is already the most decorated gymnast in history, is now only the second woman to win two vault crowns after Vera Casalavska, of Czechoslovakia (1984 and 1968).\n\nBiles has two more chances to boost her medal haul in Paris with balance beam and floor exercise finals on Monday.",

In the meantime, here's how Simone Biles did in her last event:\n\nAt last year's world championships, just days after her spectacular comeback began with a stunning all-around gold medal, Simone Biles' first vault final ended in a fall. It was the first time she had performed her Yurchenko double pike in a major final, and as she reached for the floor after the vault, her legs collapsed beneath her. Biles finished second behind Brazil's Rebeca Andrade.\n\nAs the Biles redemption tour continues and the gold medals continue to roll in, she cemented her status as the greatest vaulter of all time, holding off Andrade with another stunning display. Biles finished the vaulting final with an average score of 15.3 points. Andrade averaged 14.966, while Biles' teammate, Jade Carey, scored 14.466 for bronze.\n\nThis is the second time Biles has won the gold medal on the vault, following 2016. With three gold medals - in the team, all-around and vault - she has now won 40 Olympic and world medals, further extending her record as the most decorated gymnast - male or female.", "source": {"uri": "nybreaking.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NY Breaking News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_bars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parallel bars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horizontal bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebeca_Andrade", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebeca Andrade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalia_Yurchenko", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natalia Yurchenko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jade_Carey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jade Carey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious_Metals", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious Metals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Silver_and_Flatware", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Silver and Flatware", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://nybreaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Olympic-gymnastics-Simone-Biles-goes-for-gold-on-beam-and.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788572", "eventUri": "eng-9788572", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

The gymnast has won a gold medal in the women's gymnastics individual vault final, one for women's artistic individual all-around, and one with Team USA for the women's artistic team all-around -- alongside Suni Lee, Jordan Chiles, Jade Carey, and Hezly Rivera.\n\nThese are Biles' third Olympic Games, after she already participated in the Rio Games in 2016, and in Tokyo in 2021.\n\nThough she doesn't love the question, the GOAT did oblige a journalist who wanted to know \"what's next\" for her -- i.e. whether she's considering competing in Los Angeles in 2028 -- during a press conference.\n\n\"Never say never,\" she said. \"The next Olympics is at home, so you just never know.

Biles has openly discussed her relationship with therapy in recent years.\n\nDuring a press conference following her win in the women's all-around finals, Simone Biles revealed that her day began with a session with her therapist. Biles has openly discussed her relationship with therapy in recent years. In a 2021 interview with TODAY's Hoda Kotb, she reflected on her struggles with mental health, stating, \"I don't think people understand the magnitude of what I go through. But for so many years to go through everything that I've gone through having a front, I'm proud of myself.\"\n\nSimone Biles' Journey Through Mental Health\n\nOpening USA's final with a flawless Cheng vault, Biles demonstrated that she had conquered the nightmares of the Tokyo Olympics, where a team event mishap triggered the 'Twisties' and led to her withdrawal from the competition. This time, the 27-year-old gymnast led her team, comprising Jordan Chiles, Suni Lee, Jade Carey, and Hezly Rivera, to win the USA's fourth-ever gymnastics women's team gold medal at the Bercy Arena in Paris.\n\nFor an athlete of Biles' calibre, this gold medal was her first in eight years, with the lows of Tokyo 2021 wedged between her triumphs at the 2016 Rio Olympics and her current success in Paris. As Biles secured her second team gold medal, surpassing Shannon Miller as the most decorated American woman gymnast, she indicated that she had moved past the lows of the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nBiles had withdrawn mid-way through the Tokyo Games due to mental health concerns after experiencing the 'Twisties,' a psychological condition where gymnasts lose sync between their body and mind.\n\nBiles received widespread support for her decision to withdraw, explaining the terrifying sensation on social media. \"Literally can not tell up from down. It's the craziest feeling ever. Not having an inch of control over your body,\" she wrote on Instagram. Despite her team clinching the silver medal in her absence, Biles' cautious return to the balance beam, earning a bronze, was a testament to her resilience.\n\nTherapy as the Cornerstone of Her Comeback\n\nTherapy has been central to Biles' comeback, and it was no different on Tuesday. \"At the beginning of the day, I started off with therapy this morning. That was super exciting,\" Biles told Olympics.com. \"I told my therapist I was feeling calm and ready.\" Opening her team's final with a spotless Cheng vault, Biles confirmed that she had buried the Tokyo nightmares, completing the routine without any flashbacks or anxiety. \"After I finished vault, I was relieved. I was like, 'Phew!' because at least no flashbacks or anything. I did feel a lot of relief. As soon as I landed vault, I was like, 'Definitely, we're going to do this,'\" Biles said.\n\nThe Significance of Her Achievement\n\nThe six-time world champion expressed that winning her second team gold felt completely different from her first time in Rio in 2016. \"I think in 2016, we were destined to win gold, everybody kind of already said we were going to win gold. Now that I'm much older and we have so much more experience, we're out here really having fun and enjoying what we're doing.\" She highlighted the joy and camaraderie shared with her teammates, which added a new dimension to their victory.\n\nThe Importance of Mental Health in Sports\n\nIt is refreshing to see mental health taking center stage alongside physical health at this Olympics. Athletes are more prone to heightened anxiety and other mental health concerns due to the high expectations placed upon them. Incorporating therapy as a normal part of life is crucial, and we eagerly anticipate a future where visiting a therapist is discussed as naturally as a check-up with a physician. Simone Biles' journey represents the importance of acknowledging and addressing mental health, paving the way for a more awareness around this topic.", "source": {"uri": "shethepeople.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "SheThePeople"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ishika_thanvi@shethepeople.tv", "name": "Ishika Thanvi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure_skating_at_the_2018_Winter_Olympics_\u2013_Team_event", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Figure skating at the 2018 Winter Olympics \u2013 Team event"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoda_Kotb", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hoda Kotb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezly_Rivera", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hezly Rivera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accor_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accor Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunisa_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunisa Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowing_at_the_2016_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_eight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rowing at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's eight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jade_Carey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jade Carey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Chiles", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Chiles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shannon Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_beam", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Balance beam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Physician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anxiety"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Professional_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Professional Resources", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Policy_and_Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Policy and Advocacy", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Support_Groups/Mental_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Support Groups/Mental Health", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Organizations", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://img-cdn.thepublive.com/fit-in/1200x675/shethepeople/media/media_files/bm5ucGevkLGzzjfbEcTf.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788572", "eventUri": "eng-9788572", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

After finishing a painful fourth in the all-around and fifth on uneven bars, frustration began to build for Italy's Alice D'Amato.\n\nHowever, her wait was worth it. As one of the few athletes to stay on the beam, D'Amato won the gold this afternoon in Paris to continue Italy's historic run on the mats. The gold medal marked Italy's first in Women's Artistic Gymnastics.\n\nAfter China's Zhou Yaqin, the gold medal favorite, grabbed the beam in the first routine of the day, the door was open for other athletes to pounce. However, Yaqin would be just the first athlete, not the last, to fall victim to the beam.\n\nFalling was the norm in today's final, with four of eight athletes falling off of the apparatus and Yaqin grabbing the beam (a lesser five-tenth deduction). Unfortunately both American competitors fell victim to the \"curse.\"\n\nWhile both were medal favorites, Suni Lee and Simone Biles saw their first falls of the games in today's final. Simone's fall marked her first major error in a balance beam final since the Rio 2016 Olympics. For Suni, the fall stung even more - one of her primary goals for this games was redemption on balance beam. Even so, she leaves with an impressive three medals, bringing her total medal tally to six.\n\nIn a post-meet interview, Suni expressed her disappointment but seemed relieved to be finished, saying \"I'm so sad about my beam routine but it's OK because I gave it my all.\" Interestingly, when asked about what contributed to the multitude of falls from top athletes, Suni pointed to the abysmal noise levels in the arena. \"It was really silent when you get up [on the beam]\" she said with a laugh, \"I could literally hear myself breathing...it was too quiet.\"\n\nNonetheless, with many of the top contenders underperforming, a golden opportunity arrived for D'Amato and her Italian teammate Manila Esposito. Both Italians had among the cleanest routines of the day, finishing first and third. While the top competitors faltered, balance beam became a survival of the fittest (or survival of the athletes who thrive in quiet arenas).\n\nEven with her error, China's Yaqin was remarkably clean throughout the remainder of her routine and managed to sneak away with silver. Brazil's Rebeca Andrade, the all-around silver medalist, finished just .067 off the podium despite a hit routine.\n\nThough it was far from the final fans expected and hoped for, Italy triumphed on the balance beam today, bringing their gymnastics medal haul to three (one gold, one silver, and one bronze). And while D'Amato cried tears of joy when her score first flashed up in the midst of competition, those tears paled in comparison to the golden ones that would come minutes later.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_(nautical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beam (nautical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accor_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Accor Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_D'Amato", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alice D'Amato"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uneven_bars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uneven bars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artistic_gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artistic gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_balance_beam", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's balance beam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunisa_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunisa Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_at_the_2016_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_beam", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Balance beam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila_Esposito", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manila Esposito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebeca_Andrade", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebeca Andrade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious_Metals", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious Metals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Silver_and_Flatware", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Silver and Flatware", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66b0b733fd23770b7cae01dd/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788572", "eventUri": "eng-9788572", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

There are four medals on offer today in the following order: men's parallel bars, women's balance beam, men's horizontal bars, and women's floor exercise, which does of course mean that there are two opportunities to see one of the Olympics' biggest stars, Simone Biles.\n\nThere are no Britons on the qualifying lists for any of these events unfortunately, Joe Fraser the closest of any having qualified as second reserve for both men's finals today. The events for which British athletes were more fancied have been and gone in a gripping week of Olympic gymnastics, Jake Jarman winning bronze on Saturday's floor final, and Harry Hepworth taking the same medal in the men's vault final yesterday, whilst British gymnastics icon Max Whitlock retired having finished in fourth in his favourite event, the pommel horse, on Saturday, missing a fourth consecutive medal by 0.1 points.\n\nSo, all eyes are on Biles, and why wouldn't they been given we are in the presence of greatness. Today she will compete for Olympic titles eight and nine for her overall tally, and four and five in Paris alone as she bids to equal US swimmer Katie Ledecky and Soviet gymnast Larisa Latynina's gold tallies and become, gold medal-wise, the joint-greatest female Olympian all time - legacy-wise she is already in that pantheon.\n\nHer medal tally - standing at ten - means that her legacy is already secured but really the legend goes beyond that, as this article explains, with maximum difficulty skills name after her, prolific exploits outside the gym, and an unlikely recovery from a torrid time with the 'twisties' in Tokyo completed.\n\nToday, the best is saved until last as she heads into the floor final as overwhelming favourite, having qualified with a score of 14.600 - the closest competitor, Brazil's Rebecca Andrade, posting a 13.900 - and scoring a 15.066 on the floor on her way to the all-round gold.\n\nShe isn't as overwhelming a favourite for her first event of the day, the balance beam. She qualified second with 14.733 behind China's Yaqin Zhou who scored 14.866, although Biles ranked highest in the the discipline in the all-round final as both posted lower scores.", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "thomas_jeffreys@telegraph.co.uk", "name": "Thomas Jeffreys", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Fraser", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Fraser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_bars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parallel bars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_beam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Balance beam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_(gymnastics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Floor (gymnastics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artistic_gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artistic gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Jarman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jake Jarman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Whitlock", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Max Whitlock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pommel_horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pommel horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larisa_Latynina", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Larisa Latynina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Ledecky", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Katie Ledecky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soviet Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/olympics/2024/08/05/TELEMMGLPICT000388458840_17228466895130_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqU286MkCM_lkSqriSH7DQnenkUdU_RksFiOF-xBla3F4.jpeg?impolicy=logo-overlay", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788572", "eventUri": "eng-9788572", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

None of the Team USA men qualified for either event final.\n\nIf you want to watch the gymnastics event finals for free, consider stacking these two live TV streaming services that offer free trials and carry E!. If you stagger your subscriptions, you'll get eight days total free -- enough to watch the rest of gymnastics meet, which ends on August 5.\n\nThe official streaming home of the 2024 Olympics is Peacock, the streaming service from NBCUniversal. This year, Peacock is broadcasting over 5,000 hours of live coverage, which includes all 329 medal events, every single event leading up to them, and the new, popular whip-around show Gold Zone.\n\nPeacock costs $7.99/month with ads and $13.99/month without ads, and since the Olympics wrap up on August 11, you'll only need one month to watch the entire 2024 Games.\n\nAll three medalists from the all-around final will compete on beam today. The starting order is not seeded and was chosen at random.\n\nThere are nine gymnasts in this final, rather than the standard eight, because two gymnasts (Rina Kishi and Ana Barbosu) scored identically in qualifiers with a 13.600 -- their difficulty score and execution score were exactly the same, so there was no tie breaker.\n\nWhy Trust Post Wanted by the New York Post\n\nThis article was written by Angela Tricarico, Commerce Writer/Reporter for Post Wanted Shopping and New York Post's streaming property, Decider.

At Sunday's event final, Lee was the only member of Team USA competing in the individual event following qualifications last week.\n\nThe women's uneven bars final was a nail-biter from start to finish. Of the eight athletes competing, two fell from the bars.\n\nDespite those falls, Lee still had stiff competition. As she waited on the sidelines, Kaylia Nemour of Algeria and Qiu Qiyuan of China turned in high scores of 15.700 and 15.500, respectively.\n\nLee knew that she had to do better than Belgium's Nina Derwael, who had earned a 14.766.\n\nIt wouldn't be impossible. During these Games, Lee had already turned in three different uneven bar performances and reached a high score of 14.866.\n\nLee delivered a thrilling final uneven bars performance, just enough to slide into third place and clinch the bronze medal. All of her Team USA teammates could see seen cheering her on from the stands.\n\nThe uneven bars bronze is her third medal in Paris, but she's still not done. Lee will compete again on Monday in the balance beam finals.\n\nHere is the finals schedule for the U.S. women's gymnastics athlete based on qualifications:\n\nAug. 4 - Women's uneven bar final: The women's uneven bars final begins at 9 a.m. ET/6 a.m. PT on Sunday, Aug 4 on NBC and Peacock.\n\nAug. 5 - Women's balance beam finals: The women's balance beam finals begin at 6:36 a.m. ET/3:36 a.m. PT on Monday, Aug. 5.

The event will air on NBC and Peacock.\n\nMost of the gymnastics events will air live on NBC and Peacock. Some will also air on E!.

New episodes have been published every night before NBC's prime-time coverage is even over.\n\nHere's what I'll be watching Monday, August 5.\n\nThis is not a comprehensive list; visit Olympics.com for a full schedule.

Both the men and women will have semifinals followed by medal games.\n\nThe U.S. women's team started 0-3, but then turned things around and won five straight games. Team USA is the defending champ (though with a totally new roster) and will now have a chance to defend its gold medal with two wins Monday. That starts with a semifinal against Spain at 11:30 a.m. ET.\n\nThe U.S. men have already bowed out of the tournament, but the two men's semifinals are Netherlands vs. Lithuania and Latvia vs. France.\n\nMonday is the final day of gymnastics, which means it's your last chance to see Simone Biles.\n\nThe U.S. will have Biles and Suni Lee on the balance beam, and then Biles and Jordan Chiles on the floor routine.\n\nBiles already has three gold medals in Paris and seven total, among her 10 overall Olympic medals. She's the most decorated gymnast ever, with a chance to add two more to those totals.\n\nGymnastics starts with the men's parallel bars at 5:45 a.m. ET and then moves on to the women's events after that.\n\nTrack and field\n\nSpeaking of athletes who are the best in the world at what they do, tomorrow is Mondo Duplantis's day to shine. Duplantis, who was born in Louisiana and competes for Sweden, is the defending Olympic champ in the men's pole vault competition. That actually undersells it: He has broken the world record eight times since 2020.\n\nHe's a must-watch, whether he breaks the record again or one of his opponents takes him down. The final starts at 1:00 p.m. ET.\n\nThey will also hand out medals in the women's 800 meters, women's 5,000 meters and women's discus.\n\nLightning round\n\nThis article was originally published on

Nowhere is that more noticeable than on beam, a four-inch wide piece of wood 4 feet off the ground that requires intense concentration.\n\nWhile some in a crowd that included NFL great Tom Brady offered support during the routines, many also told others to quiet, making a typically boisterous atmosphere sound more like a golf tournament.\n\nLee and Biles, both of whom slipped at the end of their acrobatic series, couldn't help but notice. They commiserated afterward.\n\n\"The pressure was definitely on,\" Lee said. \"I don't know if you could tell, but a lot of people were definitely feeling it. I think it was the crowd but also just knowing that we're so close to being done and just adding that extra stress of wanting to end it off the right way.\"\n\nThe 21-year-old six-time Olympic medalist joked she wondered if the sea of photographers a few feet away could hear her breathing.\n\n\"It adds to the stress, just because it's like you, yes, you're the only one up there,\" said Lee, who scored 13.1, the same as Biles. \"So I was feeling the pressure.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_balance_beam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's balance beam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accor_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Accor Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunisa_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunisa Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_D'Amato", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alice D'Amato"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_Soares", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bruno Soares"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Romania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Romania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_of_Sound", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wall of Sound"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrobatics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acrobatics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/sn5fXbnErnBMH_p97vl_Cw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/e46ed968ddd1f4a109dacc8af8b4bc78", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788572", "eventUri": "eng-9788572", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 109, "relevance": 1}

Mandatory Credit: Jack Gruber-USA TODAY Sports\n\nMaking it to the Olympics in itself is a significant achievement for any athlete, let alone winning a medal in a category. While Simone Biles may have made it look easy with her effortless triple twists in the air, fans knew what went down for her to be able to reach that level of comfort.\n\nArmed with three golds already, Biles is gearing up for other competitions while basking in the Olympic glory. However, after being hounded by the same question frequently upon her victories, she recently expressed her dismay.\n\nParticipating and winning in the Olympics was an overwhelming situation, and she wanted everyone to understand that. She posted on X, how people were eager to know her plans for future competitions now that she had been on a golden streak.\n\nHowever, she dismissed them, explaining how athletes needed some time off to think about their next step.\n\n\"you guys really gotta stop asking athletes what's next after they win a medal at the Olympics\"\n\nShe argued that Olympians deserved a moment to soak in the glory and the fame that came with their victory. Pushing one to think of the future immediately could simply ruin the moment for several.\n\nAnd when one fan persevered on the subject, presumably asking Biles the same question as a joke, she had a sassy reply ready.\n\nThis isn't the first time that Biles has criticized social media for being a bit too pushy about subjects that didn't matter as much. For her and several other athletes, winning a medal was a significant milestone that demanded celebrations instead of a blueprint for the future.\n\nPreviously, she had to call out creators who criticized her hairstyle for the Olympic trials, asking them to stop pointing it out. Uploading a series of stories, she explained that the weather and travel conditions made it difficult, and she'd rather focus on her performance at the time.\n\nWhile Biles has always actively addressed negative comments online, learning to prioritize her mental peace has led her to be sharp and witty with her comebacks, without letting the words affect her. She experienced a massive phase of growth, and true fans are already proud of how far her achievements got her.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "radha_iyer@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Radha Iyer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accor_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Accor Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/08/e9547904-sbil1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788572", "eventUri": "eng-9788572", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 100, "relevance": 1}

We're Still Going to Keep Asking, 'What's Next?'", "body": "Simone Biles took to social media Sunday to implore people to stop asking athletes \"What's next?\" after they win Olympic medals.\n\nI can imagine it might be annoying as a winning athlete to get that question immediately. With all due respect to the greatest American gymnast of all time, however:\n\nSorry. We're still going to keep asking.\n\nWhy? Because the primary way people communicate and relate to their communities is through stories, and \"What's next?\" is one of the most important questions in crafting good stories.\n\nIf you strip the Olympics down, of course, that's the entire reason that hundreds of millions of people watch, and why NBC is willing to spend billions of dollars for the rights to broadcast the games into the next decade: it's all about dramatic stories.\n\nLet's put my B.A. in English to work for a minute. (Finally!). At the most basic level, compelling stories have three crucial components:\n\nWhat's the easiest, most conversational way in the English language to express that last key about conflict and development? Unfortunately for Biles, it's the exact question that she finds so frustrating: \"So, what's next?\"\n\nIt's not just the Olympics, of course. Think about every other big sporting event: the Super Bowl, or other league championships in football, soccer, and basketball. People watch them for the elite performances, but they get sucked in -- and return year after year -- because of the storylines.\n\nOr else, think about every good book you've ever read or your favorite movies. Don't they all have these elements?\n\nFun question: Why do so many successful films spawn sequels?\n\nThere's a built-in audience, sure, but the reason for that is that even though people watched and enjoyed the first episode, they're eager to see the same characters taking on their next challenges.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nWhen the knight slays the dragon, or the star-crossed lovers finally get together, or when the athlete tames her inner struggles and puts on a performance that's good enough for a gold medal, we laugh or applaud.\n\nThen, we look to see if there's another part of the story.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nIt's true in business, by the way, as well. For example, almost every marketing campaign needs this element of pacing and development as well.\n\nYou've created a fantastic product that makes people feel good? Wonderful! But everything has a shelf life. What's next?\n\nCome to think of it, Biles fielded exactly the \"What's next?\" question adroitly after she won the gold medal in the vault event over the weekend.\n\n(Basically, she opened the door to the idea she might return to compete at the Olympics in Los Angeles in 2028. I can only imagine how happy NBC was to hear her say that!)\n\nAlso, it's clear that not every Olympic medal-winning athlete finds the question as off-putting as Biles says she does.\n\nA few hours before her post, for example, U.S. Olympic gymnast Stephen Nedoroscik tweeted that he was proud to have won a bronze medal in Paris, but added, \"I got eyes for something shinier in my future #2028).\"\n\n(In other words, what's next? That's what's next.)\n\nI've written a few articles about Biles recently. I root for her as a competitor, and I'm also impressed that she's decided to use her platform to advocate for mental health.\n\nBut let's be honest: As problems go, fielding annoying questions every time you win an Olympic medal isn't a bad one to have.\n\nBy the way, just because we ask \"What's next?\" doesn't mean that we're entitled to an answer right away. (I'm using \"we\" collectively here; I've never met Biles in person.)\n\nIn fact, it's pretty common for athletes who to reply something along the lines of: \"I haven't even had time to think about that yet; I'm really just enjoying this moment while I have it.\"\n\nAnd, it's fair for athletes to be annoyed by the question--and even for Biles to suggest that people shouldn't ask it.\n\nBut what comes next after that is pretty clear as well:\n\nSorry you don't like it, but the question is just too important.", "source": {"uri": "inc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inc.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Knight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Nedoroscik", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Nedoroscik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Organizations", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://img-cdn.inc.com/image/upload/w_1024,h_576,c_fill/images/panoramic/getty_2165022631_2000133312425761244_pohvtl.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788572", "eventUri": "eng-9788572", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 91, "relevance": 1}

Her 13.100 score placed her fifth when the vent concluded, alongside U.S. teammate Suni Lee, who also tumbled during her routine.\n\nThe 10-time Olympic medalist Biles was seeking her third medal in beam, but a few other competitors had the star-studded athlete beat. Here's what to know about the other balance beam competitors that bested Biles on Monday:\n\nThe women who made the podium are Italy's Alice D'Amato, who won gold with a 14.366 along with China's Zhoi Yaquin, who earned silver with a 14.100. Italy's Manila Esposito took bronze with a 14.000.\n\nD'Amato has quite an impressive resume -- but Monday's gold medal on the balance beam in Paris takes the cake.\n\nThe 21-year-old gymnast from Italy also won silver at the team all-around at the 2024 Olympics and has 11 medals in events which include the World Championships, European Championships and Mediterranean Games.\n\nD'Amato has a twin sister, Asia, who competed at the 2020 Olympic Games as a gymnast.\n\nEarning gold in the women's balance beam on Aug. 5 at the 2024 Paris Olympics was D'Amato's first Olympic gold medal.\n\nAt the Olympics, D'Amato has two medals (1 gold and 1 silver) but she has numerous other medals in non-Olympic competitions.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC New York"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_(nautical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Beam (nautical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunisa_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunisa Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_beam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Balance beam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila_Esposito", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manila Esposito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_D'Amato", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alice D'Amato"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Artistic_Gymnastics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Artistic Gymnastics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mediterranean Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2024/08/GettyImages-2165357532.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&crop=0px%2C0px%2C5386px%2C3030px&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788572", "eventUri": "eng-9788572", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 1288, "textEnd": 1294}], "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 460560343, "relevance": 2}

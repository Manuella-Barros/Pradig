{"id": 231515522, "title": "Cattle are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions. Hawaiian seaweed could change that.", "text": "Limu kohu is most traditionally destined for poke bowls, but the distinctive-tasting seaweed is now increasingly in demand for cattle to reduce the amount of methane they burp into the atmosphere. Parker Ranch cattle are among the first of Hawai\u2019i\u2019s livestock to be fed farmed red algae. In previous trials, the seaweed has been found to reduce the amount of methane the animals belch by an average of 77 percent, according to Kona-based business Symbrosia. The algae\u2019s ability to mitigate cattle\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions has elevated Symbrosia and Blue Ocean Barns, another limu kohu farm based in Kona, in the growing international seaweed farming industry. Fueled by its litany of potential applications and climate change-mitigating properties, the World Bank predicts the industry could be worth almost $12 billion by 2030. And that is attracting immense public and private investment interest across the globe, including in Hawai\u2019i. The federal government awarded Symbrosia more than $2.2 million in grant funding this year, including a U.S. Department of Agriculture organic market development grant for $1.2 million late last month. That catalytic funding will increase the five-year-old operation\u2019s production by 1,600 percent, Symbrosia CEO Alexia Akbay said. That means just over 6,000 cattle could be eating Seagraze, the red algae product, as part of their diet. The cap is currently 250 cattle. With a $1 million grant from the National Science Foundation, awarded in January, it plans to streamline its currently labor-intensive production process, one that involves three stages of finicky cultivation and drying. Blue Ocean Barns signed on with two major mainland dairies, as well as ice cream producer Ben & Jerry\u2019s, raising $20 million. Symbrosia last year signed on with Organic Valley, the nation\u2019s largest farmers cooperative, and Danone, the country\u2019s largest yogurt producer. The recent injection is \u201creally the next step for us to start expanding commercially for our products, for both local producers like Parker Ranch and then some larger companies like Organic Valley,\u201d Akbay said. But the company does not appear to be leaving any time soon, given the growing conditions and Hawai\u2019i\u2019s unique climate. Symbrosia is expanding its footprint from a quarter of an acre to 15 acres and looking to increase its staff by 70 positions, Akbay said. That\u2019s partly because of the year-round growing climate for the seaweed farm. \u201cWe probably harvest a little bit more frequently, ship out product more frequently, just because the seaweed grows so quickly,\u201d Akbay said. But now the race is on to commercialize and scale the product across the world, given how high demand might be in the future, says Jim Wyban, who developed pathogen-free shrimp which underpins the global shrimp industry. Going global Major dairy and beef producers worldwide have started expressing serious interest in methane-reducing seaweed since researchers in Australia discovered its potential. The country\u2019s first commercial harvest was in 2022. Meanwhile, the Global Methane Pledge, with 155 signatory nations, specifically targets livestock because they contribute the bulk of agriculture\u2019s emissions. And agriculture accounts for 37 percent of the world\u2019s total methane discharged by humans. A single cow produces between 154 to 264 pounds of methane per year. The U.S., which commands a 20 percent share of the international beef industry, has a cattle population of more than 87 million. \u201cThey\u2019re going after a really big problem,\u201d Wyban, a leader in Hawai\u2019i\u2019s aquaculture industry, said of the seaweed companies. The global market for seaweed-based animal feed supplements could be worth $1.1 billion by 2030, according to the World Bank. There has been local interest beyond Parker Ranch, Hawai\u2019i Cattlemen\u2019s Council managing director Nicole Galase said. But many ranchers want to see results first, Galase said. Symbrosia\u2019s research with Parker Ranch is slated to last nine more months. The red seaweed has been associated with faster weight gain in cattle, more milk production, and even faster wool production in sheep. \u201cWe want this research and ingenuity coming up because we do want options. Ranchers are always looking for a way to improve,\u201d Galase said. \u201cThat takes research, that takes people trying things.\u201d But having a locally-grown and produced product is not going to keep more livestock in Hawai\u2019i, where a large proportion of cattle are shipped to the mainland. The number of cattle shipped to the continental U.S. is mainly determined by how much grass Hawai\u2019i has at any given time, a factor largely dictated by drought, Galase said. A valuable crop There are several other algae-based markets, including construction materials, fertilizers, and other agricultural inputs, bioplastics, biofuels, and fabric. Each represents an opportunity for greater environmental and economic sustainability, said Todd Low of the state Department of Agriculture. \u201cThere\u2019s three kinds of value to seaweed: There\u2019s the ecosystem services, the filtering of water and benefits to the environment. There\u2019s carbon sequestration, \u2026 then there\u2019s this value-added processing,\u201d Low said. Algae already sits just behind cattle as Hawai\u2019i\u2019s fifth most valuable agricultural crop. It was worth $45 million in 2022. Hawai\u2019i\u2019s entire aquaculture sector is anticipated to reach $600 million by 2034, according to the Department of Agriculture. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole world of different value-added things,\u201d Low said. \u201cFor us, the focus on macroalgae or seaweed is the vehicle into that world.\u201d State lawmakers have expressed interest in aquaculture recently, though Hawaii has largely ignored fish and algae farming in the past, instead favoring land-based farming. Little has materialized from legislation introduced in recent years. But algae has still grown as an industry, with little help. What Symbrosia and Blue Ocean Barns have shown is that Hawai\u2019i can compete in the aquaculture space, Low said. \u201cHawaii Grown\u201d is funded in part by grants from the Stupski Foundation, Ulupono Fund at the Hawaii Community Foundation, and the Frost Family Foundation.

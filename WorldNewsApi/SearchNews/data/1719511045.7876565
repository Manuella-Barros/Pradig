{"id": 223734282, "title": "Police say they are 'very aware of the ongoing issues in Falls Park' as 15-year-old is left unconscious following assault by a number of young males", "text": "Inspector R\u00f3is\u00edn Brown said: \u201cShortly before 9:20pm, it was reported to police that a 15-year-old male was unconscious after being assaulted by a number of young males in Falls Park. Police responded to the ongoing incident within a minute, and the young man was taken to hospital for injuries that are described as serious. \u201cWhilst officers administered first aid, other altercations between the large group of young people broke out so further policing resources were deployed into the park and the young people eventually dispersed from the area. \u201cPolice are very aware of the ongoing issues in Falls Park and are committed to finding solutions for the whole community. We want young people to gather and enjoy the park responsibly, however this type of violence is unacceptable. \u201cLocal residents also have the right to feel safe where they live. Those who engage in anti-social behaviour and other forms of criminality are only hurting their own communities, and unfortunately sometimes themselves. I appeal to parents and guardians again to know where your young people are. \u201cThis was a very hostile environment for our officers, but police will continue to carry out additional patrols across West Belfast. Anyone who witnesses anti-social or criminal behaviour to contact police on 101 so that we can respond. We would also ask parents and guardians to speak to their young people and to know where they are to prevent them from engaging in behaviour which could result in injury or a criminal record. A report can also be made using the online reporting form via www.psni.police.uk/makeareport.

World oil demand will grow more than expected this year, helping to ease a global glut despite rising production from North America and weak OPEC compliance with output cuts, the International Energy Agency said on Friday.\n\nThe agency raised its 2017 demand growth forecast to 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd) from 1.4 million bpd in its previous monthly report and said it expected demand to expand by a further 1.4 million bpd next year.\n\n\"Producers should find encouragement from demand, which is growing year-on-year more strongly than first thought,\" said the Paris-based IEA, which advises industrialised nations on energy policy.\n\n\"There would be more confidence that rebalancing is here to stay if some producers party to the output agreements were not, just as they are gaining the upper hand, showing signs of weakening their resolve,\" the IEA said.\n\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is curbing output by about 1.2 million bpd, while Russia and other non-OPEC producers are cutting a further 600,000 bpd until March 2018 to help support oil prices.\n\nThe IEA said OPEC's compliance with the cuts in July had fallen to 75 percent, the lowest since the cuts began in January.\n\nIt cited weak compliance by Algeria, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nIn addition, OPEC member Libya, which is currently exempt from the output cuts, steeply increased output.\n\nAs a result, the overall global oil supply rose by 520,000 bpd in July to stand 500,000 bpd above year-ago levels.\n\nAdding to the challenges of oil producers to support oil prices is rising non-OPEC output, which is expected to expand by 0.7 million bpd in 2017 and by 1.4 million bpd in 2018 on strong gains in the United States, which is not participating in the output caps.\n\nStill, strong global demand growth is helping to clear excess barrels with the IEA registering a decline in stocks in industrialised nations in both June and July.\n\nStocks remain 219 million barrels above a 5-year average - a level that OPEC is targeting with its output cuts.\n\nThe IEA also revised historic demand data for 2015-2016 for developing countries, cutting it by 0.2-0.4 million bpd.\n\n\"The impact of carrying this lower demand base into 2017 against unchanged supply numbers is that stock draws later in the year are likely to be lower than first thought,\" the IEA said.

"LONDON (Reuters) - World oil demand will grow more than expected this year, helping to ease a global glut despite rising production from North America and weak OPEC compliance with output cuts, the International Energy Agency said on Friday.\n\nThe agency raised its 2017 demand growth forecast to 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd) from 1.4 million bpd in its previous monthly report and said it expected demand to expand by a further 1.4 million bpd next year.\n\n\"Producers should find encouragement from demand, which is growing year-on-year more strongly than first thought,\" said the Paris-based IEA, which advises industrialised nations on energy policy.\n\n\"There would be more confidence that rebalancing is here to stay if some producers party to the output agreements were not, just as they are gaining the upper hand, showing signs of weakening their resolve,\" the IEA said.\n\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is curbing output by about 1.2 million bpd, while Russia and other non-OPEC producers are cutting a further 600,000 bpd until March 2018 to help support oil prices.\n\nThe IEA said OPEC's compliance with the cuts in July had fallen to 75 percent, the lowest since the cuts began in January.\n\nIt cited weak compliance by Algeria, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nIn addition, OPEC member Libya, which is currently exempt from the output cuts, steeply increased output.\n\nAs a result, the overall global oil supply rose by 520,000 bpd in July to stand 500,000 bpd above year-ago levels.\n\nAdding to the challenges of oil producers to support oil prices is rising non-OPEC output, which is expected to expand by 0.7 million bpd in 2017 and by 1.4 million bpd in 2018 on strong gains in the United States, which is not participating in the output caps.\n\nStill, strong global demand growth is helping to clear excess barrels with the IEA registering a decline in stocks in industrialised nations in both June and July.\n\nStocks remain 219 million barrels above a 5-year average - a level that OPEC is targeting with its output cuts.\n\nThe IEA also revised historic demand data for 2015-2016 for developing countries, cutting it by 0.2-0.4 million bpd.\n\nAs a result of those historic revisions, the IEA cut baseline demand figures for 2017-2018 by around 0.3-0.4 million bpd and hence lowered demand for OPEC crude by the same amount.\n\n\"The impact of carrying this lower demand base into 2017 against unchanged supply numbers is that stock draws later in the year are likely to be lower than first thought,\" the IEA said.\n\nChanges mainly happened as the IEA revised down historic demand data for Indonesia, Malaysia and Iran while revising up India and keeping China largely unchanged.", "time":

For the non-OPEC countries that joined the pact, the compliance rate edged up to 67 percent, said the Paris-based organization, which advises industrial countries on energy policy.\n\nOPEC and a number of other producers including Russia agreed late last year to cut production to ease oversupply and support the price of crude. In May they extended those cuts into 2018.\n\nIEA said compliance was weak by Algeria, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates, while Libya, which is currently exempt from the output cuts, steeply increased output. The oil industry group noted that markets were \"not entirely clear\" if all parties to the deal would be willing to honor their pledge.\n\n\"If re-balancing is to be maintained, the producers that are committed to seeing the task through to March 2018 need to convince the market that they are in it together,\" said the IEA.\n\nHopes pinned on demand growth\n\nAs global oil supply overshoot demand by 520,000 bpd in July, oil prices continued to languish in the doldrums. On Friday, North Sea Brent crude was down 39 cents to $51.51 in London morning trading. US benchmark WTI fell 41 cents to $48.18.\n\nOil prices have swung around $50 per barrel since the OPEC-led deal came into place - a far cry from historic peaks of well above $100 a few years ago.\n\nNevertheless, IEA said producers should find encouragement from demand, \"which is growing year-on-year more strongly than first thought,\" thus reducing the stocks overhang. IEA registered a decline in stocks in industrialized nations in both June and July, although they remained 219 million barrels above a 5-year average.\n\nAs a result of these developments, the organization raised its forecast for growth in demand this year to an average daily demand of 97.6 million barrels - about 1.5 million bpd more than previously estimated.\n\nHowever, the main challenge to higher oil prices continued to be rising non-OPEC output, IEA said, which was expected to expand by 0.7 million bpd in 2017 and by 1.4 million bpd in 2018.\n\nEspecially US shale producers, which are not participating in the output caps, were proving more resilient to low prices after cutting costs. Their output is now higher than before oil prices tumbled from above $100 per barrel in 2014.", "time": "11:07:00"}

global glut despite rising production from North America and weak OPEC compliance with output cuts, the International Energy Agency said on Friday.\n\nThe agency raised its 2017 demand growth forecast to 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd) from 1.4 million bpd in its previous monthly report and said it expected demand to expand by a further 1.4 million bpd next year.\n\n\"Producers should find encouragement from demand, which is growing year-on-year more strongly than first thought,\" said the Paris-based IEA, which advises industrialized nations on energy policy.\n\n\"There would be more confidence that rebalancing is here to stay if some producers party to the output agreements were not, just as they are gaining the upper hand, showing signs of weakening their resolve,\" the IEA said.\n\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is curbing output by about 1.2 million bpd, while Russia and other non-OPEC producers are cutting a further 600,000 bpd until March 2018 to help support oil prices.\n\nThe IEA said OPEC's compliance with the cuts in July had fallen to 75 percent, the lowest since the cuts began in January.\n\nIt cited weak compliance by Algeria, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nIn addition, OPEC member Libya, which is currently exempt from the output cuts, steeply increased output.\n\nAs a result, the overall global oil supply rose by 520,000 bpd in July to stand 500,000 bpd above year-ago levels.\n\nAdding to the challenges of oil producers to support oil prices is rising non-OPEC output, which is expected to expand by 0.7 million bpd in 2017 and by 1.4 million bpd in 2018 on strong gains in the United States, which is not participating in the output caps.\n\nStill, strong global demand growth is helping to clear excess barrels with the IEA registering a decline in stocks in industrialized nations in both June and July.\n\nStocks remain 219 million barrels above a 5-year average - a level that OPEC is targeting with its output cuts.\n\nThe IEA also revised historic demand data for 2015-2016 for developing countries, cutting it by 0.2-0.4 million bpd.\n\n\"The impact of carrying this lower demand base into 2017 against unchanged supply numbers is that stock draws later in the year are likely to be lower than first thought,\" the IEA said.\n\n(Reporting by Dmitry Zhdannikov; editing by Dale Hudson and Jason Neely)",

International Energy Agency said on Friday.\n\nThe agency raised its 2017 demand growth forecast to 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd) from 1.4 million bpd in its previous monthly report and said it expected demand to expand by a further 1.4 million bpd next year.\n\n\"Producers should find encouragement from demand, which is growing year-on-year more strongly than first thought,\" said the

newspaper\n\n* Market watching tensions between U.S., North Korea (Updates with prices, IEA data)\n\nBy Dmitry Zhdannikov\n\nLONDON, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Friday after the International Energy Agency said weak OPEC compliance with production cuts was prolonging a rebalancing of the market despite strong demand growth.\n\nBrent crude, the global benchmark, was at $51.83 a barrel at 1220 GMT, down 7 cents, having earlier fallen 50 cents or around 1 percent to its lowest since Aug. 1.\n\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was down 10 cents at $48.49 per barrel, having earlier dropped 1 percent to its lowest since July 26.\n\nOil touched 2-1/2-month highs on Thursday but closed down around 1.5 percent, with U.S. prices slipping back below $50 amid oversupply concerns.\n\n\"There would be more confidence that rebalancing is here to stay if some producers party to the output agreements were not, just as they are gaining the upper hand, showing signs of weakening their resolve,\" the IEA said in its monthly report.\n\nThe IEA said OPEC's compliance with the cuts in July had fallen to 75 percent, the lowest since those curbs began in January. It cited weak compliance by Algeria, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nIn addition, OPEC member Libya, which is exempt from the cuts, steeply increased output.\n\n\"Crude oil prices failed to hold recent gains, with a nervous market starting to doubt recent falls in inventories,\" ANZ bank said in a note. \"Supply-side issues also weighed on prices.\"\n\nThe IEA also said it had revised historic demand data for 2015-2016, meaning a lower demand base in 2017-2018 combined with unchanged high supply numbers could lead to lower stock draws than initially anticipated.\n\nSaudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said the kingdom did not rule out additional oil production cuts, the Saudi-owned Al Sharq Al Awsat newspaper reported.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump stepped up his rhetoric against North Korea again, saying his earlier threat to unleash \"fire and fury\" on Pyongyang if it launched an attack may not have been tough enough.\n\n\"I think the issue that is affecting the market is the general risk sentiment of sabre-rattling between Washington and Pyongyang,\" said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets.

The jump was largely due to rising output from two members exempt from the accord, but many participating countries are still pumping above the levels they agreed to last winter.\n\n\"There would be more confidence that re-balancing is here to stay if some producers party to the output agreements were not, just as they are gaining the upper hand, showing signs of weakening their resolve,\" the Paris-based International Energy Agency said in its monthly report.\n\nOPEC's compliance to the deal slipped to a new low of 75 percent in July, the IEA estimated. Meanwhile, adherence among a group of non-OPEC exporters that also agreed to limit output stood at 67 percent.\n\nThe output cuts by OPEC and other producers including Russia helped to reduce stockpiles in the OECD, a group of 35 mostly developed countries, by 500,000 barrels in the first half of 2017, IEA said. But inventory levels are still 219 million barrels above the five-year average. OPEC is trying to drive stocks down to that level.\n\n\"We should remember that although stocks are beginning to fall, they're falling from a very great height,\" Neil Atkinson, head of the oil industry and markets division at IEA,\" told CNBC on Friday.\n\n\"If OECD stocks keep falling at the kind of rates we've seen in the second quarter, it'll take until the early part of the next year before they get back down to the five-year average.\"\n\nOil prices are poised for a second straight weekly decline as the market continues to question OPEC's ability to rebalance the market.\n\nTo be sure, the world consumes more oil in the second half of the year, which helps to shrink oil stockpiles on the demand side.\n\nAtkinson also noted that Saudi Arabia has committed to cutting exports in August and September, a sign that some producers are determined to keep up the progress they've achieved. The United Arab Emirates also said it will ship fewer barrels in September.\n\nStill, other producers have offered little detail on how they plan to improve compliance.\n\nTop producers Saudi Arabia and Russia summoned exporters including Iraq, Kazakhstan and Malaysia to Abu Dhabi this week to explain how they plan to meet their output targets.

raises questions about the credibility of the report.\n\nIn addition, Libya, the OPEC member state that is currently exempted from cuts, has recorded a sharp increase in production.\n\nCrude oil producers are expected to grow by 0.7 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2017 and by 1.4 million bpd in 2018, driven by strong production increases in the United States that participate in the

About 32.6 million barrels a day will be needed from the group this year, less than the 32.84 million it pumped in July.\n\nThere are also growing doubts that all the countries involved in the accord to reduce supply are fully committed, the IEA said.\n\nOPEC's rate of compliance with the cutbacks slipped last month to 75 percent, the lowest since the accord started in January.

The Paris-based agency said 32.6 million barrels a day would be needed from the group this year, lower than the 32.84 million it produced last month.\n\nAnalysts at AB Bernstein said: \"Global inventories have declined sharply over the past two months, which lifted prices back above $50 a barrel. However, this will not be enough for Opec to draw down all the excess inventories.\"\n\nThe analysts warned that the IEA's lower demand forecast and rising output from Libya, Nigeria and the rest of the Opec cartel means the recent reduction in inventories may prove to be short lived.", "time": "14:00:00"}

prices fell slightly on Friday after the International Energy Agency said weak OPEC compliance with production cuts was prolonging a rebalancing of the market despite strong demand growth.\n\nBrent crude was down 11 cents at $51.79 a barrel at 11:53 a.m. EDT (1553 GMT), having earlier fallen 50 cents, or around 1 percent, to its lowest since Aug. 1.\n\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was down 15 cents at $48.44 per barrel, having earlier dropped 1 percent to its lowest since July 26.\n\nU.S. crude was on track to close more than 2.4 percent lower on the week, with Brent on track to close 1.8 percent lower.\n\nOil touched 2-1/2-month highs on Thursday but closed down amid oversupply concerns.\n\nThe IEA said OPEC's compliance with the cuts in July had fallen to 75 percent, the lowest since those curbs began in January. It cited weak compliance by Algeria, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nIn addition, OPEC member Libya, which is exempt from the cuts, steeply increased output.\n\n\"Crude oil prices failed to hold recent gains, with a nervous market starting to doubt recent falls in inventories,\" ANZ bank said in a note. \"Supply-side issues also weighed on prices.\"\n\nThe IEA also said it had revised historic demand data for 2015-2016, meaning a lower demand base in 2017-2018 combined with unchanged high supply numbers could lead to lower stock draws than initially anticipated.\n\nSaudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said the kingdom did not rule out additional oil production cuts, but stressed that his country would not take any unilateral action, the Saudi-owned Al Sharq Al Awsat newspaper reported.\n\nIn the United States, President Donald Trump again stepped up his rhetoric against North Korea again, saying what he called U.S. military solutions were \"locked and loaded\" as Pyongyang accused him of driving the Korean peninsula to the brink of nuclear war.\n\n\"I think the issue that is affecting the market is the general risk sentiment of saber-rattling between Washington and Pyongyang,\" said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets.\n\nOn Friday, energy services company Baker Hughes releases its monthly rig count number. Last week, data showed U.S. energy companies cut oil rigs for a second week in three, slowing the pace of a 15-month drilling recovery.\n\nBaker Hughes releases its data at 1 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT).\n\n\"We're watching to see if slowing of rig counts continues,\" said Mark Watkins, regional investment manager at U.S. Bank, \"That would be a positive sign ... that production might be topping in the U.S.\"\n\n(Reporting by Julia Simon in New York, Dmitry Zhdannikov in London; Editing by Jason Neely and Jonathan Oatis)\n\nGet latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.", "time": "17:14:00"}

worsened.\n\nWhile a weaker US dollar helped push prices in New York 0.5 percent higher on Friday, erasing earlier losses, futures closed 1.5 percent down for the week.\n\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) reduced demand estimates for OPEC crude this year and next, and said there are doubts about the group's commitment to cutting production.\n\nEven a pledge by Saudi Arabia and Iraq to strengthen their commitment to the curbs is not helping.\n\n\"With the latest rhetoric from the IEA, it looks like the balancing cycle is further protracted, which is not great for the market,\" Michael Loewen, a strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto, said by telephone.\n\nInvestors need to see either OPEC production really decline or compliance to the output reduction deal improve to believe rebalancing is happening, he said.\n\nOil just has not been able to stick to the US$50 mark in New York even though US crude inventories are at their lowest since October last year, in part because recent declines are seen mostly as the result of summer demand that is soon to diminish.\n\nOPEC's rate of compliance with output cuts slid to 75 percent last month, the lowest since the accord started in January, the IEA said.\n\nOPEC said its output is increasing on supplies from Libya, which is exempt from the deal.\n\nIf OPEC's compliance to the deal continues to slow, \"the rebalancing is going to take a longer time,\" Mark Watkins, a Park City, Utah-based regional investment manager at US Bank Wealth Management, which oversees US$142 billion in assets, said by telephone.\n\nMeanwhile, in the US the number of rigs drilling for crude rose to 768, the highest level since April 2015, as production is set to reach nearly 10 million barrels next year.\n\nAmid all the doubt that supply and demand are coming to balance, futures have been stuck in a tight range of about US$2.5 this month.\n\nWest Texas Intermediate (WTI) for September delivery on Friday rose US$0.23 to settle at US$48.82 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract is down 1.5 percent from last week's US$49.58 per barrel.\n\nThe US benchmark hovered near its 100-day moving average during the session, a sign its recent rally might be losing strength.\n\nBrent for October settlement on Friday rose US$0.20 to end the session at US$52.10 per barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, down 0.6 percent for the week.\n\nOil market news:\n\n\u2027 Royal Dutch Shell PLC has restarted four units at its Pernis refinery and more will be brought online in the coming days, an environmental regulator said.\n\n\u2027 Saudi Arabian Minister of Energy Khalid al-Falih and his Iraqi counterpart, Jabbar al-Luaibi, met in Jeddah and agreed to ensure coordination of their policies, according to a report from the Saudi Press Agency.", "time": "16:56:00"}

"https://etfdailynews.com/2017/08/12/oils-recent-bounce-appears-to-be-over-uso/", "body": "Oil prices were down at the end of the week on fears of lingering oversupply. The U.S. reported a strong drawdown in crude inventories and flat production, although those bullish figures were outweighed slightly by an uptick in gasoline inventories. Investors chose to focus on rising OPEC supply, which led to a selloff in crude on Thursday and Friday.\n\nIEA: Oil demand up; oil market rebalancing. In its latest monthly report, the IEA revised up its forecast for oil demand this year to 1.5 mb/d, up 100,000 bpd from last month. Oil demand growth continues into next year, expanding at an annual rate of 1.4 mb/d. The IEA also said that the rebalancing effort is continuing - the OPEC cuts, combined with demand growth, will erase the supply glut. Still, the agency said that the process is a stubborn one, and the growing signs of tightness in the market are being offset somewhat by the faltering compliance from OPEC.\n\nIEA made large revisions to past oil data. The IEA revised oil demand data from the past few years. The revisions are important because they mean that the \"call on OPEC\" will be 400,000 bpd lower this year and in 2018, and the revisions also mean that global oil demand is actually 330,000 bpd less for the period between 2015-2018 than previously thought.\n\nShale hiccups emerge in the Permian. Last week, Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE: PXD) reported a worrying increase in the gas-to-oil ratio from some of its Permian wells, a development that has alarmed investors. Pioneer's stock price plunged on the news, and the sheen on U.S. shale is suddenly looking a little tarnished. Goldman Sachs backed up this sentiment when it wrote in a report that it has fielded calls from investors looking to \"reallocate capital\" out of shale E&Ps and into other parts of the energy industry. Some analysts think there isn't much to see here, but judging by the recent stock declines from some top Permian players, the market has suddenly grown worried about the Permian.\n\nOPEC upgrades oil demand projection. In a new report, OPEC boosted its oil demand estimate for the rest of this year and next. The group said that the global market would demand 200,000 bpd more than expected from the cartel this year, as consumption appears stronger than anticipated. At the same time, however, rising Libyan production has pushed the group's output in July to its highest point so far this year. Libya added more than 150,000 bpd in July, pushing output above 1 mb/d. Saudi Arabia, surprisingly, also added 30,000 bpd, although some of that is surely to meet peak summer demand.\n\nOil futures flip into backwardation. The contango in the oil futures market has all but disappeared, with a slight backwardation emerging in the futures structure, which is when near-term contracts trade at a premium to futures further out. The backwardation is an indication that the market is tightening and the extreme bearishness drowning the market earlier this summer has diminished.\n\nAndurand: $100 oil is coming. Famed hedge fund manager Pierre Andurand is betting that oil will rise to $100 per barrel, going against the conventional wisdom within the oil industry, which says that prices will remain depressed for years to come. Andurand's hedge fund has lost 15 percent so far in 2017, but he still believes prices will spike before the end of the decade. \"In 2014, after four years at being around $110 a barrel, most analysts were saying we'd never see prices go back below $100,\" said Andurand, according to the FT. \"Now everyone is arguing we're never going back there, but I don't really buy that the cost of production has gone down structurally or that electric cars will have a big enough impact on demand.\" He argues that shale producers need much higher prices to grow over time, and in any event, shale won't be enough to meet global demand in sever years' time. \"There will be cost inflation on the way. Will [shale] be profitable one day? Only if prices go up significantly.\"\n\nNorth Korea tension rattling commodity markets. The war of words between the U.S. and North Korea is starting to worry commodity traders. North Korea is in close proximity to China, South Korea and Japan, three of the world's most voracious consumers of soy, LNG, coal, oil and other commodities. Bloomberg says that if tensions escalate, it could push up the cost of insurance for vessels, force changes in routes and ultimately push up costs all around. Shipping rates could spike by 20 or 30 percent if war broke out, according to Xinde Marine Services.\n\nSaudi Aramco prefers New York listing. Despite the recommendation from legal and financial advisers to list on the London Stock Exchange, Reuters reports that top Saudi officials would prefer to list the Aramco IPO in New York. London has fewer regulations, but the powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman wants to list in New York for \"political considerations,\" which is to say, to maintain and strengthen the strategic alliance with the U.S. A final decision has not been made.\n\nBritish Columbia vows to stop key oil pipeline. The new left-leaning government in British Columbia has laid out plans to block Kinder Morgan's (NYSE: KMI) Trans Mountain Expansion, a proposed twin line that will nearly triple the existing pipeline's capacity, allowing 890,000 bpd of Alberta oil to reach the Pacific Coast. The pipeline was given a greenlight by the federal government, and is a crucial project that would allow oil from Alberta to reach the global market, helping to solve a perennial problem for the province, which has been bogged down in stalled pipeline projects. Kinder Morgan's share price fell on the news.\n\nThe United States Oil Fund LP ETF (NYSE:USO) closed at $9.99 on Friday, up $0.08 (+0.81%). Year-to-date, USO has declined -14.76%, versus a 10.22% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.", "time": "11:51:00"}

In response, prices retreated almost by 1% intraday from the two-and-half month overnight highs.\n\nAt 3:14pm BST, the Brent front month futures contract was down 0.77% or 40 cents to $51.50 per barrel, while the West Texas Intermediate was down 0.93% or 45 cents to $48.14 per barrel.\n\nIn its monthly assessment report of the market, the IEA wrote: \"There would be more confidence that re-balancing is here to stay if some producers party to the output agreements were not, just as they are gaining the upper hand, showing signs of weakening their resolve.\"\n\nThe think-tank noted that Opec's hitherto impressive compliance with the cuts had fallen to 75% in July, the lowest since the drive began in January.\n\nThe IEA specifically cited weaker compliance by Algeria, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates. Additionally, Libya, an Opec member currently exempt from the output cuts, saw a sharp increase in its output.\n\nDespite the recent price uptick, many in the market remained unmoved by the Opec technical meeting earlier in the week, according to FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga.\n\n\"Scepticism is increasing over the cartel's plans to improve compliance after Opec's output hit a 2017 record high and exports marked a record. While Opec itself remains optimistic that the current supply cut agreement may eventually rebalance the saturated markets, the lagging compliance from Iraq and resurgent production in Libya are threatening to undermine efforts made by the rest of the group to prop up oil prices.\n\n\"With Ecuador already pulling out of the Opec agreement due to financial pressures, the clock is ticking and it will take more than pledges for the cartel to support oil prices moving forward.\"", "time": "15:10:00"}

Thanks to a combination of improving well productivity and some old-fashioned greed, supplies remain elevated, which has kept a lid on prices.\n\nThat said, according to the latest market report from the International Energy Agency, there is some good news from the most recent data. Because of that, the underlying fundamentals of the oil market seem to be improving, which is a positive for investors, though it will likely remain a slow grind for the foreseeable future.\n\nAccording to the IEA, global oil supplies increased by 520,000 barrels per day (Bpd) last month, which is the third straight monthly increase. Overall, crude supplies are up 500,000 Bpd versus last year. One of the culprits was OPEC, which saw its output rise 230,000 Bpd last month to a 2017 high of 32.84 million Bpd. Fueling that increase was a burst in production from Libya, which is exempt from the OPEC production reduction agreement, and a weaker compliance rate from members that had pledged to cut their output. Meanwhile, production growth in the U.S. thanks to shale drilling remains robust and is on pace to expand by 600,000 Bpd this year, accounting for nearly all the non-OPEC growth.\n\nThat said, on a more positive note, demand growth continues accelerating. The IEA now sees demand growing by 1.5 million Bpd this year, reaching 97.6 million Bpd, which is up from last month's forecast growth of 1.4 million Bpd. Because of robust demand, global oil stockpiles fell 19.3 million barrels in June. Though, they remain 219 million barrels above the five-year average. Those elevated stockpiles have continued to weigh on crude prices this year, which have trended well below the initial forecast that prices would average $55 per barrel this year.\n\nOne of the persistent problems in the oil market has been the reluctance of producers to slow the flow of oil. That's because many are trying to offset the impact of lower prices on their bottom line by pumping out higher volumes. It's an issue OPEC has tried to address by agreeing to an output cut and cap, which it recently extended into 2018. However, it has not only experienced dwindling compliance with that cap but the two producers not subject to the agreement, Libya and Nigeria, have opened their taps wide this year.\n\nOn the other hand, shale drillers, which had ramped up their drilling activities earlier this year, have noticeably pulled back in recent weeks. For example, leading Bakken Shale driller Whiting Petroleum (NYSE:WLL) sliced $150 million off its drilling budget, bringing it down to $950 million for the full-year. Because of that, Whiting only expects its output to increase 14% by the end of this year versus where it was at the end of last year. That's down from Whiting's initial estimate that it would jump 23% by year-end.\n\nMeanwhile, due to some unforeseen drilling delays, Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE:PXD) plans to defer the completion of 30 wells into next year. That move will save Pioneer $100 million this year and will result in its output only growing 15% to 16% versus last year's average, which is down from an initial forecast that production would rise 15% to 18%.\n\nOverall, most shale drillers announced a budget cut when they reported second-quarter results this summer. However, at the same time, many did not take down their 2017 production estimates. In fact, several increased their forecast because improving well productivity and efficiency gains are enabling them to do more with less. For example, Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) cut its 2017 budget by 10%. However, despite that reduction, Marathon Oil expects its output from U.S. resource plays to rise 23% to 27% by year-end, which is above its 20% to 25% initial forecast. Because of this dynamic, it's almost like shale drillers are taking as many steps back as they're moving forward. Though, the fact that many are pulling back on spending means that output still won't be as high as it could have been, which is a positive for the market because it will help it from growing oversupplied again.\n\nThe recent data from the IEA, when combined with a steady stream of updates from shale drillers, is a mixed bag for the market. That said, for an industry that had been plagued by nothing but bad news for several years, anything positive is a welcomed sight. While this suggests that oil stocks could muddle along in the near-term as the market digests not only the recent updates but the changing dynamics of supply and demand, the longer-term picture does seem to be getting brighter.", "time": "17:36:00"}

Even a pledge by Saudi Arabia and Iraq to strengthen their commitment to the curbs isn't helping.\n\n\"With the latest rhetoric from the IEA, it looks like the balancing cycle is further protracted, which is not great for the market,\" Michael Loewen, a strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto, said by telephone. Investors need to see either Opec production really decline or compliance to the output-reduction deal improve to believe rebalancing is happening, he said.\n\nOil just hasn't been able to stick to the $50 mark in New York even though US crude inventories are at their lowest since October, in part because recent declines are seen mostly as the result of summer demand that's soon to fade. Opec's rate of compliance with output cuts slid to 75 per cent in July, the lowest since the accord started in January, the IEA said. Opec said its output is increasing on supplies from Libya, which is exempt from the deal.\n\nIf Opec's compliance to the deal continues to slow, \"the rebalancing is going to take a longer time,\" Mark Watkins, a Park City, Utah-based regional investment manager at US Bank Wealth Management, which oversees $142 billion in assets, said by telephone.\n\nMeanwhile, in the US the number of rigs drilling for crude rose to 768, the highest level since April 2015, as production is set to reach nearly 10 million barrels next year. Amid all the doubt that supply and demand are coming to balance, futures have been stuck in a tight range of about $2.50 this month.\n\nThe IEA on Friday lowered projections for the amount of crude required from Opec this year and next by about 400,000 barrels a day. About 32.6 million barrels a day will be needed from the group this year, less than the 32.84 million it pumped in July.\n\nEarlier in the week, an Energy Information Administration report showed US crude inventories dropped for a sixth straight week, yet gasoline stockpiles unexpectedly rose by the most since January.\n\nThis week's inventory report \"had a little bit of a bearish tilt to it. We usually don't see gasoline builds at this time of year,\" Tariq Zahir, a New York-based commodity fund manager at Tyche Capital Advisors LLC, said by telephone. \"We're just stuck in this range here. $50 is definitely a brick wall.\"", "time": "13:52:00"}

There was a tug-of-war between bullish U.S. production and bearish OPEC fundamentals throughout the week. This led to a sideways-to-higher trade until Thursday when surprise data from OPEC proved to be too much for the longs to handle, leading to a bearish technical chart pattern and a lower close for the week.\n\nFor the week, October WTI crude oil settled at $48.97, up $0.22 or +0.45% and November Brent crude oil closed at $51.94, up $0.16 or +0.31%.\n\nOn the bullish side, official data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) showed crude inventories fell sharply by 6.5 million barrels in the week-ending August 4, as refiners ramped up run rates to the highest in 12 years due to strong demand.\n\nThe news wasn't good enough to sustain a rally, however, and the U.S. WTI futures market ended up losing 1.5% for the week, its second straight weekly decline, as doubts remain that the world will consume enough crude to end a global supply glut.\n\nThe International Energy Administration (IEA) also said OPEC's compliance with its production cuts in July had fallen to 75 percent, the lowest since the cuts began in January. It cited weak compliance by Algeria, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\"There would be more confidence that re-balancing is here to stay if some producers party to the output agreements were not, just as they are gaining the upper hand, showing signs of weakening their resolve,\" the IEA said in its monthly report.\n\nIn other news, energy services company Baker Hughes reported drillers last week added three rigs in the U.S., bringing the total oil drilling rig count to 768.\n\nForecast\n\nThe crude oil market is likely to continue to remain rangebound this week as the clash between U.S. production and OPEC production is likely to continue.\n\nThe wildcard this week could be Russia.

Thanks to a combination of improving well productivity and some old-fashioned greed, supplies remain elevated, which has kept a lid on prices.\n\nThat said, according to the latest market report from the International Energy Agency, there is some good news from the most recent data. Because of that, the underlying fundamentals of the oil market seem to be improving, which is a positive for investors, though it will likely remain a slow grind for the foreseeable future.\n\nAccording to the IEA, global oil supplies increased by 520,000 barrels per day (Bpd) last month, which is the third straight monthly increase. Overall, crude supplies are up 500,000 Bpd versus last year. One of the culprits was OPEC, which saw its output rise 230,000 Bpd last month to a 2017 high of 32.84 million Bpd. Fueling that increase was a burst in production from Libya, which is exempt from the OPEC production reduction agreement, and a weaker compliance rate from members that had pledged to cut their output. Meanwhile, production growth in the U.S. thanks to shale drilling remains robust and is on pace to expand by 600,000 Bpd this year, accounting for nearly all the non-OPEC growth.\n\nThat said, on a more positive note, demand growth continues accelerating. The IEA now sees demand growing by 1.5 million Bpd this year, reaching 97.6 million Bpd, which is up from last month's forecast growth of 1.4 million Bpd. Because of robust demand, global oil stockpiles fell 19.3 million barrels in June. Though, they remain 219 million barrels above the five-year average. Those elevated stockpiles have continued to weigh on crude prices this year, which have trended well below the initial forecast that prices would average $55 per barrel this year.\n\nOne of the persistent problems in the oil market has been the reluctance of producers to slow the flow of oil. That's because many are trying to offset the impact of lower prices on their bottom line by pumping out higher volumes. It's an issue OPEC has tried to address by agreeing to an output cut and cap, which it recently extended into 2018. However, it has not only experienced dwindling compliance with that cap but the two producers not subject to the agreement, Libya and Nigeria, have opened their taps wide this year.\n\nOn the other hand, shale drillers, which had ramped up their drilling activities earlier this year, have noticeably pulled back in recent weeks. For example, leading Bakken Shale driller Whiting Petroleum (NYSE:WLL) sliced $150 million off its drilling budget, bringing it down to $950 million for the full-year. Because of that, Whiting only expects its output to increase 14% by the end of this year versus where it was at the end of last year. That's down from Whiting's initial estimate that it would jump 23% by year-end.\n\nMeanwhile, due to some unforeseen drilling delays, Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE:PXD) plans to defer the completion of 30 wells into next year. That move will save Pioneer $100 million this year and will result in its output only growing 15% to 16% versus last year's average, which is down from an initial forecast that production would rise 15% to 18%.\n\nOverall, most shale drillers announced a budget cut when they reported second-quarter results this summer. However, at the same time, many did not take down their 2017 production estimates. In fact, several increased their forecast because improving well productivity and efficiency gains are enabling them to do more with less. For example, Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) cut its 2017 budget by 10%. However, despite that reduction, Marathon Oil expects its output from U.S. resource plays to rise 23% to 27% by year-end, which is above its 20% to 25% initial forecast. Because of this dynamic, it's almost like shale drillers are taking as many steps back as they're moving forward. Though, the fact that many are pulling back on spending means that output still won't be as high as it could have been, which is a positive for the market because it will help it from growing oversupplied again.\n\nThe recent data from the IEA, when combined with a steady stream of updates from shale drillers, is a mixed bag for the market. That said, for an industry that had been plagued by nothing but bad news for several years, anything positive is a welcomed sight. While this suggests that oil stocks could muddle along in the near-term as the market digests not only the recent updates but the changing dynamics of supply and demand, the longer-term picture does seem to be getting brighter.", "time": "17:36:00"}], "count": 1, "page": 1}}}

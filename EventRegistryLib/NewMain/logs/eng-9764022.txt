"Israel warns of Iran plan to target its athletes at Olympics\n\nWill Bolton\n\n25 July 2024 at 6:29 pm\n\nIsrael's foreign minister has reportedly warned French authorities of a possible Iranian-backed plot to attack the country's athletes at the Olympics.\n\nIsrael Katz sent a letter to St\u00e9phane S\u00e9journ\u00e9, his French counterpart, warning him of the potential targeting of the Israeli delegation during Paris 2024.\n\nIn the letter, parts of which were published by Israeli media, Mr Katz told the minister for Europe and foreign affairs of his concerns regarding a possible attack.\n\nHe wrote: \"We have intelligence indicating that Iranian operatives and other terrorist groups are planning to target members of the Israeli delegation and Israeli tourists.\"\n\nMr Katz said that \"there were those who seek to undermine the celebratory nature of this joyous event\".\n\nHe expressed his gratitude to French officials for the \"unprecedented security measures\" to protect Israelis at the Games, as well as the French government's rejection of calls to ban Israel from the Olympics.\n\nIt comes after it emerged armed Israeli agents were being sent to Paris to help protect the athletes.\n\nMiki Zohar, Israel's minister of culture and sport, previously said the security forces had been planning the details for the Olympics for more than a year.\n\nHe said they had doubled the team's security budget in preparation.\n\nSome 88 Israeli athletes and their staff are set to receive security details from Israel's Shin Bet intelligence agency, but not every athlete will have their own bodyguard, Mr Zohar said.\n\nThe Israeli government has repeatedly issued travel warnings to its citizens travelling abroad since the start of the Gaza conflict broke out following the terrorist atrocities committed by Hamas on October 7.\n\nIsrael said it has foiled \"dozens\" of attacks against Israelis abroad in recent months.\n\nFrance is considered a \"category 2\" country, which means the Israeli government considers it a \"potential threat\" for Israelis.\n\nIt recommends Israeli citizens take \"increased precautionary measures\".\n\nOn Wednesday evening, pro-Palestine demonstrations staged minor protests during one of the Games's opening football matches.\n\nBooing erupted from various corners at the Parc des Princes during the Israeli national anthem but warnings of major disruption did not materialise during the match against Mali.\n\nInside, a group of four activists in \"Free Palestine\" T-shirts were ushered away from the seats before kick-off but a group of eight men and women were allowed to stay despite unfurling Palestine flags.\n\nSmall groups of Israel fans occasionally surrounded the protesters with their national flags, and at least two men incensed by the protest were asked to leave in the first half.\n\nThe police presence in Paris is triple that of London 2012, with officers drafted in from 43 countries.", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "will_bolton@aol.co.uk", "name": "Will Bolton", "type": "author",

Tensions in the Middle East, inflamed by conflicts such as Israel's Gaza retaliation, have heightened security concerns. France plans a major security operation, with heavy police and military presence.\n\nIsrael's foreign minister warned his French counterpart on Thursday of a potential Iranian-backed plot to target Israeli athletes and tourists during the Paris Olympic Games.\n\nIsrael's military campaign in the Palestinian-run Gaza Strip, launched in retaliation against Hamas militants' deadly cross-border raid last October, has inflamed tensions in the Middle East and stoked security concerns for the Summer Olympics. \"We currently have assessments regarding the potential threat posed by Iranian terrorist proxies and other terrorist organisations who aim to carry out attacks against members of the Israeli delegation and Israeli tourists during the Olympics,\" Israel Katz told Stephane Sejourne in a letter seen by Reuters.\n\nKatz did not detail any specific intelligence or threat against the Games. The Iranian mission to the United Nations told Reuters in response to the accusation: \"Terrorist acts have no place in the principles of resistance groups; lies and deceit cannot switch the roles of the plaintiff and the accused.\"\n\nFrance's foreign ministry declined to comment. In 2018, France foiled a bomb plot on the outskirts of Paris masterminded by an Iranian diplomat later convicted in Belgium.\n\nFrance will roll out one of its biggest peacetime security operations on Friday when it hosts the Games' opening ceremony in the heart of Paris. More than 6,000 athletes will participate in a parade along the river Seine, with 45,000 police and 10,000 soldiers securing the event.\n\nIsrael's delegation is expected to be on a riverboat with Italian and Jamaican athletes, two sources familiar with the planning said. Katz thanked the French government for what he called unprecedented security measures to deliver a safe Games.\n\nIsrael's opening Olympic soccer match against Mali on Wednesday passed the Games' first major security test. The Israeli national anthem was initially booed before those cries were drowned out. A few supporters waved Palestinian flags. Israeli competitors will be escorted to and from events by elite tactical units and given 24-hour protection throughout the Olympics, officials say. Israel's internal security service, Shin Bet, is helping with security.\n\nMany Israelis still remember with horror the deaths of 11 members of the Israeli Olympic team in an attack and hostage-taking

Those anxieties were underscored in recent days by a barrage of ominous phone calls and emails to Israeli athletes -- messages that Israeli officials blamed on Iran.\n\n\"Iran is exploiting an apolitical international sporting competition to promote digital terrorism against Israel and its right to participate in these competitions,\" Israel's National Cyber Directorate chief, Gaby Portnoy, said on Thursday.\n\nIranian officials managed to acquire contact information for the athletes and publish it on social media, Portnoy's agency said. The athletes received a message that purported to be from the \"People's Defense Organization,\" reportedly a \"fictitious\" group that promised \"to repeat the events of Munich 1972\" if Israeli athletes participated in the Olympics.\n\n\"Once again we are exposed to the attempts of the head of the Iranian snake to threaten Israeli athletes and use psychological terror against our wonderful delegation,\" Israeli Culture and Sport Minister Miki Zohar said Thursday. \"The athletes are ready and more determined than ever to achieve success.\"\n\nThe lead-up to the Paris Olympics has been marked by a flurry of arrests. On Sunday, French officials arrested a Russian-born chef on the grounds that he was plotting a \"large-scale project\" to disrupt the games. French Foreign Minister Gerald Darmanin also suggested that a video that seems to depict a Palestinian terrorist forecasting \"rivers of blood\" would flow at the Olympics was faked.\n\n\"We saw a video which purports to be someone from Hamas ... who announces an attack in the next few days and comes because France is going to welcome Israeli athletes,\" Darmanin said. \"We're not sure, but it looks like it is fake and has been spread by pro-Kremlin and pro-Russian channels.\"\n\nBelgian authorities also arrested seven people \"suspected of participation in a terrorist group's activities, financing of terrorism and preparation of a terrorist attack\" on Thursday, according to Belgian authorities, with the caveat that the group might not have been planning to attack the Olympics.\n\n\"[There are] no details at this time as to the locations or targets but what was found leads us to believe an attack was being prepared,\" Belgian government spokesman Arnaud d'Oultremont said on Thursday.\n\nFrench officials have given the Israeli athletes round-the-clock security. Israel's Shin Bet intelligence agency also has deployed security teams to protect the athletes in the Olympic Village and throughout the competitions.\n\n\"We try our best to make sure the athletes feel free but also safe and not afraid,\" Zohar said last week. \"We don't want them to notice the security guards too much. We want them to feel confident so they can do their job.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nDarmanin also ordered French law enforcement to establish an \"antiterrorism perimeter\" around the stadium where Israel's soccer team played Mali to a draw on Wednesday.\n\n\"I want to convey my profound gratitude for the extraordinary security measures the French government has implemented to safeguard the Israeli delegation and tourists,\" Katz, the Israeli foreign minister, wrote in the Thursday letter to his counterpart. \"This stands as a clear testament to President Macron and the French government's resolve to confront those hostile elements seeking to undermine the legitimacy of Israel's Olympic participation.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com",

round-the-clock personal security provided by elite French police, both inside the Olympic village and every time they leave the compound in northern Paris.\n\nIn an address to the US Congress on Wednesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called for a global alliance against the Iranian \"axis of terror.\"\n\nHe argued that the United States and Israel \"must stand together\" against Iran and its proxies.\n\nIran had hailed the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel but said it was not involved in it.\n\nTensions have soared during the war sparked by the attack, drawing in Iran-backed armed groups in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen.\n\nYemen's Houthis, along with the Hezbollah group in Lebanon and former Iran-backed paramilitaries in the Iraqi armed forces, are part of a Tehran-aligned \"axis of resistance\" that supports Hamas against Israel and its allies.\n\nIran has reiterated support for the groups but insisted they are independent in their decision-making and actions.\n\nOn April 13-14, Iran carried out an unprecedented drone and missile attack on Israel, days after an air strike widely attributed to Israel levelled Iran's consulate in Damascus and killed seven Revolutionary Guards, two of them generals.", "source": {"uri": "arab.news", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arab News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@arab.news", "name": "Agence

{"id": 231232744, "title": "There are new digital nomads on the block: families", "text": "By Sam Kemmis | NerdWallet For some, \u201cdigital nomad\u201d evokes the image of a young, unencumbered tech worker sending emails from the beach. Indeed, three-quarters of digital nomads are under age 40, according to a 2023 survey of over 1,200 digital nomads by Flatio, an online accommodation platform. Yet some families have joined the digital nomad lifestyle, leaving their belongings \u2014 and the idea of a \u201chome\u201d \u2014 behind as they travel the globe. The lifestyle may not afford families the same hammock-swinging freedom that digital nomads without children enjoy, but these adventurous parents say the trade-offs are worth it. \u201cWe really like the whole adventure,\u201d says Chris Oberman, founder of Moving Jack, a blog about his family\u2019s trips around the world. \u201cNormal things like going to the supermarket become really special because it\u2019s a new experience.\u201d Originally from the Netherlands, Oberman, his partner, their 6-month-old baby and their two cats are currently in Iraq. They plan to move to South Korea this summer. \u201cLogistically, it requires a lot of planning,\u201d Oberman says. \u201cBefore we move abroad, we return to our home country to arrange all necessary documents. Since we don\u2019t own a house, we either stay with family or rent a place. When we depart for our new destination, we stay in a temporary place such as a serviced apartment or hotel that allows cats (which isn\u2019t easy to find).\u201d In the midst of this explanation, the power went out. \u201cThe power goes out five times a day,\u201d Oberman says with a laugh, highlighting some of the unexpected challenges of living abroad with a family. Schools and social circles Schooling poses one of the biggest challenges to families living on the road. Oberman\u2019s infant is too young for school, so that\u2019s not an issue, but other digital nomad families must get creative when it comes to education. \u201cOur decision on where to go is influenced by factors such as having internet access to educational opportunities for our kids, safety and cost of living,\u201d Vasilii Kiselev said in an email. Kiselev is from Florida, and his family of four is currently nomading in Portugal. \u201c[We] incorporate local culture and history into their learning experience.\u201d This approach reflects an educational movement called \u201cworld schooling,\u201d an unofficial term that describes an educational approach centered around cultural immersion. Some, like Kiselev, still seek formal education while traveling, while others combine nomadism with homeschooling. The Facebook group \u201cWorldschoolers\u201d has over 67,000 members. And while it might sound challenging for children to get uprooted regularly, Kiselev, whose children are ages 8 and 12, suggests that adjusting to nomadism is a matter of practice. \u201cThey have adapted well to the lifestyle,\u201d Kiselev said. Changing friend groups and even languages from one month to the next can be a challenge for anyone, never mind a child. Oberman says he\u2019s aware of the social difficulties that lie ahead for his son. \u201cAs he makes friends, it could be tough for him.\u201d Budgets and trade-offs Raising kids is expensive whether at home, abroad or on Mars. It\u2019s easy to be daunted by the cost of traveling full time with a family, especially given how expensive a few weeks\u2019 vacation can be. Yet many nomadic families are able to maintain a budget when living full time on the road. Kiselev\u2019s family budgets about 1,500 to 2,500 euros ($1,629 to $2,715) per month for housing. \u201cIt\u2019s pricey but necessary for a comfortable living space.\u201d Another cost is private school, which costs Kiselev about 500 to 1,000 euros ($543 to $1,086) per month, or $6,516 to $13,032 per year \u2014 an attractive price for many U.S.-based parents in high cost-of-living areas. For comparison, according to a study last updated in October 2023 by the Education Data Initiative, a research group focused on the U.S. education system, the average annual private school tuition across grade levels K-12 in Massachusetts is $25,061, and California\u2019s average is $16,637. Of course, that doesn\u2019t include last-minute hotels, airfare, travel insurance and all the other expenses accrued from shuttling a family around the globe. Oberman\u2019s family found themselves flying back and forth from Iraq to the Netherlands and Dubai during the pregnancy because of concerns about the quality of health care in Iraq. Those expenses can add up in a hurry and swamp any savings from lower overall costs of living. Yet many families find the financial trade-offs worth it in terms of the experiences they and their families are able to accrue. \u201cShowing our child so much of the world is very rewarding and helps him grow with a global perspective,\u201d says Oberman.

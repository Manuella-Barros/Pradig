A court heard that Nick Billingham, 42, vowed \u201cmy body, my heart, my love has been yours since the day I met you and will be yours until the day I die\u201d as he tried to win back Fiona Beal following an affair. \u201cYou are the most beautiful woman in the world,\u201d he gushed in letters read to the Old Bailey. \u201cYou are so kind-hearted in every single way and if there were more people like you around, the world would be a better place.\u201d The couple reconciled in 2020, but Beal, 50, murdered him \u201cin cold blood\u201d less two years later. His mummified body lay undiscovered in a \u201cde-facto coffin\u201d in their back garden for more than four months while she told friends and family her partner of 17 years had left her for another woman. The Year 6 teacher had initially pleaded guilty to the lesser offence of manslaughter by reason of a loss of control, but denied murdering Mr Billingham between October 30 and November 10 2021 at their terraced home in Northampton. She changed her plea part way through a trial last month, admitting his murder. At a two-day sentencing hearing beginning on Wednesday, the court heard that Beal documented the \u201ccarefully planned domestic execution\u201d in sinister journal entries discovered by police. Promising sex, she lured him to bed and stabbed him in the neck, while he is thought to have been restrained with cable ties. She told colleagues and they had tested positive for Covid-19 and needed to self-isolate, while she disposed of his body. The journal entries, written in a log cabin in Cumbria in March 2022 before she made an attempt on her own life, said: \u201cI had smoked all day. I had a bath. I left the water in. He had been pushing for sex. \u201cI encouraged the bath with the incentive of sex afterwards. While he was in the bath I kept the knife in my dressing gown pocket and then I had it in the drawer next to the bed. \u201cI brought a chisel, bin bag and cable ties up too. I got him to wear an eye mask.\u201d Prosecutor Hugh Davies KC told the court that the 6cm knife wound to Mr Billingham\u2019s neck \u2013 which severed his jugular vein \u2013 would not have killed him immediately. According to her journal, his final word was \u201cwhy\u201d as he eventually succumbed to blood loss. Over the following ten days, while pretending to be at home recovering from Covid-19, she buried his body in the back garden as \u201cif it was building waste\u201d before returning to work \u201cas if nothing had happened\u201d, Mr Davies told the court. \u201cColleagues noted her weight loss and good spirits,\u201d he added. The trial previously heard how she buried Mr Billingham in the side return of their terraced home \u2013 where she hid his body under breeze blocks before covering it with bark chippings and a plant pot. That Christmas, Mr Billingham\u2019s mother visited Beal at the home to drop off presents, thinking her son had left her for another woman. In extracts of a victim impact statement, read to the court, Yvonne Valentine said: \u201cYou sat in your front room with me, having a casual chat with me, having a Christmas drink with me and the whole time, you knew that you had killed my son and buried him only feet from where I was sat. \u201cI felt sad and embarrassed that my son had left you, but I shouldn\u2019t have wasted my energy and concern on you. You had planned it all and at no point have you ever given me the same consideration or thought about the devastation you caused by killing my son.\u201d The court previously heard that Beal, who regularly used cannabis, had an alter ego she referred to as \u201cTulip 22\u201d, who was \u201ccapable of wholly different and darker conduct than her public persona of committed teacher\u201d. Beal\u2019s mental health started to deteriorate in late February 2022. The following month, police were called to a cabin in Cumbria, amid concerns for her welfare, where they discovered the journal entries.

In all, 17 penalties were dolled out over the final period, adding up to 136 penalty minutes.\n\nIt may have been a jarring figure for most fans of the modern NHL, in which penalty minutes have generally declined over the last few decades. This is reflected more specifically in playoff stats: Of the 19 times the Bruins have accrued at least 60 penalty minutes in a playoff game, only three of those happened in the 21st century.\n\nOne was Wednesday night's Game 2. The others were Game 3 of the 2011 Stanley Cup Final (an 8-1 Bruins win over the Canucks in which Boston chalked up 75 PIM), and -- not surprisingly -- Game 2 of last year's first-round debacle that also came against Florida (in which Boston ran up 60 PIM in a 6-3 loss).\n\nThe Panthers, it should be noted, are a bit of a throwback team regarding penalties. Florida not only led the league in penalty minutes per game, but also in opponent PIM. In fact, the Panthers per game total (13.6) was the highest by any NHL team since the 2014-2015 Penguins.\n\nBut in comparison to older eras of hockey, even the Panthers' PIM stats seem minuscule. Twenty years ago, the NHL averaged 14.6 penalty minutes per game. Forty years ago, that number was 18.\n\nWith that in mind, here's a look back at the five most penalized games in Bruins playoff history:\n\nBruins penalty minutes: 77\n\nThe list begins with the most recent entry, Wednesday's chaotic defeat in Florida. In the context of the Panthers' incredible playoff upset over the 2023 Bruins (a team that was historically great in the regular season), Boston undoubtedly viewed the rematch with a certain degree of relish.\n\nFollowing the 5-1 win in Game 1, the Bruins took a 1-0 lead in the second game. But from that brief high point, things went downhill. The same could be said for the penalties. After three were called per team in the first two periods, the last 10 minutes saw an eruption of fights and (eventual) game misconducts.\n\nThe most talked about clash was David Pastrnak vs. Matthew Tkachuk. Though Pastrnak got knocked down, Bruins coach Jim Montgomery said after the game that he was \"proud\" of the prolific goal-scorer for dropping the gloves.\n\nBruins penalty minutes: 93\n\nIn a game that Boston Globe reporter Kevin Walsh called \"one of the hardest fought battles in the long history of the Stanley Cup playoffs,\" the Rangers desperately tried to rough up the Bruins to throw Boston's stars off their game.\n\nIt succeeded, at least for one night. New York managed a 4-3 win, building a 4-1 lead by the third period as a cushion against the seemingly inevitable Bobby Orr goal (as well as one more from Fred Stanfield).\n\n\"We're getting paid to get you,\" Rangers goaltender Ed Giacomin told Derek Sanderson (according to Sanderson). The cynical ploy resulted in Sanderson lasting in the game for exactly 91 seconds before he was enveloped by Rangers.\n\nAmid a charged Madison Square Garden playoff atmosphere, with fans holding up signs carrying the not-so-subtle message, \"Kill Derek,\" the Bruins centerman known as \"The Turk\" accounted for 30 PIM all by himself. He was summarily dismissed for the night along with Rangers winger Dave Balon.\n\nThe Bruins, of course, had the last laugh that season. Boston went on to win the series, 4-2, and eventually lifted the team's first Stanley Cup in 29 years.\n\nBruins penalty minutes: 95\n\nThe first game of the Adams Division Semi-Final matchup against the rival Canadiens began ominously for the Bruins. After just 65 seconds, Boston was called for having too many men on the ice. A flurry of roughing calls followed, but were accompanied by no goals in the first period.\n\nMontreal fired in a trio of goals in the second period to take a commanding lead as the penalties started to flow more freely. Boston wing Louis Sleigher was sent to the box after a fight with Canadiens defenseman Larry Robinson (during which time Montreal's Bobby Smith opened the scoring on a power play).\n\nLuck was also not on Boston's side in what proved a decisive second period on the way to a 3-1 loss.\n\n\"Montreal was holding a 1-0 lead and, in the space of 1 minute 45 seconds, the Bruins hit the post three times and had the tying goal disallowed,\" recapped the Globe's Francis Rosa. \"Montreal scored for a 2-0 lead and all the young Bruins got a taste of what can happen in [The Forum].\"\n\nBruins penalty minutes: 105\n\nSimilar to the recent Bruins-Panthers clash, a majority of the penalty minutes in 1988 Adams Division Semi-Final Game 3 matchup between Boston and the Buffalo Sabres came in the final period.\n\nMore specifically, most of the fights happened in the last 47 seconds, with the scoreline already settled. Bruins head coach Terry O'Reilly was aghast at the officiating. Remarkably, his conclusion was that not enough penalties had been called.\n\n\"I've never, never in five years, seen a referee let so much go,\" O'Reilly raged in the postgame scene. \"I honestly do not know what's going on. It borders on dishonesty.\"\n\nThe incessant penalties ruined the \"flow\" of the game, per Rosa's Globe recap, but he noted that \"there were moments when some pretty decent hockey was played.\"\n\nThe decent hockey mostly came from Buffalo's John Tucker, as the Sabres center notched four goals (including a penalty shot score).\n\nThe Sabres skated away with a 6-2 win, but the Bruins went on to take the series in six games.\n\nBruins penalty minutes: 126\n\nEven after four separate one-on-one fights in the first period of the second game in a quarterfinal series between the Bruins and Islanders, it turned out that the two teams were simply warming up.\n\nRight at the end of the opening period, Boston's Mike Milbury and Stan Jonathan got into individual fights with the Islanders. And with both teams coming onto the ice due to the end of the period, the fights only grew in number. Even goaltenders Billy Smith and Yves Belanger got into it as the rink-wide brawl lasted 20 minutes.\n\nThis culminated with a staggering 248 penalty minutes in the first period by itself, as four players from each team were assessed fighting, misconduct, and game misconduct penalties.\n\nRemarkably, the ensuing two periods were as clean a hockey game as the 1980s could seemingly produce. Having dolled out 36 penalties in the first period, referee Dave Newell made just three more over the second and third periods combined (along with the 84 seconds of overtime).\n\n\"Those were two of the greatest periods of hockey you could hope to see,\" remarked Bruins coach Harry Sinden after the game.\n\nThe Islanders managed to find an overtime winner in a 5-4 victory, taking a 2-0 series lead (New York would eventually advance in five games).\n\n\"You have to hand it to them,\" Sinden added. \"They won two overtime games here.\"\n\n\"Maybe we took over,\" said Wayne Cashman of the Bruins, \"but we didn't win -- and that's what counts.\"", "source": {"uri": "boston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hayden_bird@boston.com", "name": "Hayden Bird",

Amid all the illustrious highlights of their first 100 seasons, however, a handful of lowlights still haunt a passionate fanbase.\n\nAnd one, in particular, has lasted for nearly half a decade.\n\nMay 10, 1979.\n\nFriday marks the 45th anniversary of arguably the most notable too many men penalty in NHL history.\n\nThe Don Cherry-led Lunch Pail A.C. Bruins had the hated Canadiens on the ropes at the old Montreal Forum in Game 7 of the 1979 Stanley Cup semifinals. But the legendary Habs found new life after the Bruins regained the lead late in the third on Rick Middleton's tally.\n\nThe Bruins, who relinquished a two-goal lead earlier in the final frame, were just 3:59 away from advancing to the Cup Final. But then came the most infamous too many men penalty in franchise history. The late Guy Lafleur notched Montreal's second tying marker during that power play attempt, ultimately setting the scene for Yvon Lambert's series clincher in overtime. The blunder extended the Canadiens' dynasty and ended Cherry's coaching tenure in Boston.\n\nThirty-one years later, the Bruins endured another ill-timed too many men infraction in Game 7 against the Flyers, this time on Garden ice. Simon Gagne promptly put the finishing touches on Philadelphia's 3-0 comeback -- in the series and the game -- to deliver another painful chapter in Bruins history.\n\nFast forward 14 years later, and, well, the Bruins still can't shake off that too many men legacy.\n\nAmid a sloppy night of turnovers, defensive mishaps, and a third-period slugfest, Boston committed its fifth too many men infraction of the 2024 playoffs during its ugly 6-1 loss to the Florida Panthers in Game 2.\n\nHaving grown up in Montreal, second-year Bruins coach Jim Montgomery received a firsthand account of that too many men call from the legendary Forum. After Wednesday's tilt, he took full responsibility for the ongoing troubling trend.\n\n\"It falls on me in the end,\" Montgomery said. \"We know of the people who's up [in the lineup], and they're making mistakes. So my clarity on who's up is obviously failing our team.\"\n\nThe miscommunications during line changes and personnel rotations fall directly on the coaching staff.

Despite their rich history and numerous successes, the Bruins have come up short 14 times on hockey's biggest stage.\n\nSince their inception in 1924 as the first American franchise in the NHL, the Bruins have established themselves as a powerhouse, winning six Stanley Cup titles and cementing their place among hockey's elite. However, their journey has been marked by heartbreaking defeats as well.\n\nThe Detroit Red Wings, another Original Six team, come in a close second with 13 losses in the Stanley Cup Final.\n\nIn 98 games in the Stanley Cup Final, the Bruins have a record of 37 wins, 58 losses and three ties. They have accumulated 77 points in these games, resulting in a points percentage of .393.\n\nThe team has scored 231 goals while allowing 265, and their power-play and penalty-kill percentages in the Final stand at 17.2% and 85.2%, respectively.\n\nThe Bruins' 14 Stanley Cup Final losses span several eras, from their early years in the league to more recent times.\n\nSome of the most memorable defeats include the 2019 loss to the St. Louis Blues in a closely contested seven-game series and the 2013 loss to the Chicago Blackhawks, where they surrendered the lead in the final minutes of Game 6.\n\nFive worst Boston Bruins Stanley Cup final appearances\n\nThe Boston Bruins have had their fair share of disappointments in the Stanley Cup Final.\n\n#1 1943: Detroit Red Wings vs. Boston Bruins (4-0)\n\nDespite being the second-highest-scoring team in the league, the Bruins were outmatched by the Red Wings' defense. Boston scored only five goals in four games, losing twice by shutouts. It remains the franchise's worst showing in the final.\n\n#2 1977: Montreal Canadiens vs. Boston Bruins (4-0)\n\nThe Canadiens had a historic season, becoming the first team to reach 60 wins and 132 points in an 80-game campaign. The Bruins were outscored 14-5 in the first three games and lost the series in a sweep.\n\n#3 1988: Edmonton Oilers vs. Boston Bruins (4-0)\n\nThe Bruins failed to win a game despite having the fourth-most victories during the regular season.\n\nThe series is remembered for a power outage at the Boston Garden during Game 4, which was restarted in Edmonton. The Oilers won 6-3, completing the sweep.\n\n#4 1957: Montreal Canadiens vs. Boston Bruins (4-1)\n\nThe Bruins and Canadiens finished two points apart in the regular season, but Montreal dominated the series. Boston scored only six goals in five games, with the Canadiens collecting two shutout victories.\n\n#5 1990: Edmonton Oilers vs. Boston Bruins (4-1)\n\nThe Bruins faced the Oilers for the second time in three seasons but without Wayne Gretzky, Edmonton proved too strong.

It's a positive, right?\" coach Jim Montgomery replied sarcastically to a reporter noting that fact. \"Like I said, I take full responsibility. I have to be clearer. I have to be louder. And if I have to start grabbing people's pants so they don't jump when they shouldn't, I'll start doing that.\"\n\nThe Panthers were leading, 2-1, in the second period of Game 2 Wednesday when the Bruins got crossed up yet again. Their latest counting error came 23 seconds after they killed a Brandon Carlo hooking minor. If they had any flow to their game, it was halted.\n\n\"All of us together -- the communication, receiving the communication -- needs to be better,\" Montgomery said. \"Last night, there was no excuse for the too-many-men.\"\n\nMontgomery's frustration was apparent when he reviewed the situation to reporters Thursday afternoon at Hanscom Field.\n\n\"I'd like to say it's easy to solve with our group,\" he said. \"I think it is easy to solve. But it's a different player, at a different moment.\n\n\"And it's sometimes the guy coming to change stops and goes back, the guy watching the guy coming to change has to watch him to the bench, while he knows where the puck is. The last two were guys jumping when it wasn't supposed to be them going on the ice.\n\n\"That's why I say, all these things, it's clear that it's my responsibility to make them better in those areas. I don't want to answer anymore. Thanks.\"\n\nThe teams that messed up more than the Bruins include the 2021-22 Lightning, who committed their six infractions over 23 games; the 2014-15 Lightning (26 games), the 2012-13 Bruins (22 games), the 2010-11 Canucks (25 games), and the 1990-91 Penguins (25 games).\n\nAll of those teams made the Final, but only the '91 Penguins skated the Stanley Cup around on those jittery legs.\n\n\"We've got to sharpen up,\" winger James van Riemsdyk said. \"It's the playoffs, so there's always going to be different matchups and line matching and line juggling that goes on, so it's up to us to be a little bit more plugged in for when we're jumping on.\n\n\"That's usually how it goes. Usually guys on the bench will call out who they have. I think we have to maybe be a little more vocal so everyone on the bench can hear. If two guys say they have the same guy, we know something's wrong.\"\n\nVan Riemsdyk was a 20-year-old rookie on the 2009-10 Flyers team that committed five too-many-men penalties, but said he didn't remember them taking that many.\n\nBruins fans have different memories.\n\nA too-many-men call helped the Flyers strike the deciding blow of that painful series, which the Bruins once led, three games to zero. As the Bruins lost a 3-0 lead in Game 7, Vladimir Sobotka and Milan Lucic had a mix-up when Marc Savard changed off, and Simon Gagne scored the series winner on the ensuing power play.\n\nForty-five years ago, Don Cherry's Lunchpail AC Bruins were leading Game 7 of a Stanley Cup semifinal when they were whistled for too many men. Guy Lafleur struck on the power play to tie it, Yvon Lambert scored in overtime, and the Montreal Forum ghosts cackled with delight.\n\nThe Bruins, who have killed 28 of 30 penalties this postseason, have not allowed a power-play goal on any of their too-many-men sentences. They are 2-2 in games in which they take one.\n\nMontgomery hadn't decided on a netminder for Game 3, but he said that Linus Ullmark \"looked really good\" in his 18:32 of Game 2 work. Ullmark allowed a shorthanded goal and a power-play goal on 10 shots ... Montgomery on defenseman Andrew Peeke, who has been out since Game 3 against the Maple Leafs with a suspected left hand injury: \"He's getting closer. We'll know more tomorrow morning. But he's getting closer.\" ... Danton Heinen (undisclosed) remains day-to-day ... The NHL's postgame audit reduced the Game 2 hit totals from 70 (Boston) and 76 (Florida) to 60 and 65 ... The Bruins stayed in a team hotel before Game 7 of the Toronto series, Montgomery hoping to encourage team bonding and shield the players from distraction. After four nights in South Florida, they slept in their own beds before Game 3.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The Bruins and the Panthers will face off in Game 3 on Friday night (7) at the TD Garden.\n\n\"Any time you are in a series and you go on the road and take one of two, you gain home ice advantage and we love playing in front of our fans,\" said Bruins head coach Jim Montgomery during a press briefing at Hanscom Field.\n\nThe Bruins exploded for three-second period goals and cruised to a 5-1 victory in Game 1. The Panthers took umbrage at being embarrassed in front of their fans and blitzed the Bruins 6-1 in a physical, penalty filled rematch that set the tone for the remainder of the series. The referees assessed misconduct penalties to six Bruins and five Panthers, a number rarely seen in the modern playoffs.\n\n\"I think it is going to be physical, both teams are physical and that is what creates great playoff hockey,\" said Montgomery of Game 3. \"I think Game 1 we won handily and Game 2 they won handily and now it is going to get tight.\"\n\nThere was simmering bad blood between the teams that dated back to last season. The Bruins set NHL regular-season records for wins (65) and points (135) last season but were eliminated by the Panthers in the opening round of the playoffs. The Bruins built a 3-1 series lead but were beaten 4-3 in overtime in Game 7 on April 30 at the Garden. The Bruins gained a small measure of revenge by going 4-0 against the Panthers in the regular season.\n\nThe lingering ill feelings erupted in a pair of third-period melees and culminated in an unexpected throw down between David Pastrnak and Matthew Tkachuk at 12:42. Pushback was all the Bruins had to show for themselves in Game 2.\n\n\"As the game went on you could tell it was going to be a battle and it is an exciting brand of hockey for the fans in how intense and physical it's been,\" said Bruins left wing James van Riemsdyk.\n\n\"We always pride ourselves on sticking together as a team no matter what the game brings or what that style leads to. We are ready for that and it just shows our group is very willing. We are not going to shy away from any style game that wants to be played.\"\n\nPastrnak is a scorer, not a brawler, and he got the worst of the exchange with Tkachuk, who snuck in a couple of cheap body blows at the end when the two combatants were tangled on the ice.\n\n\"That gets you fired up when a guy like him who obviously cares and he wants to do whatever it takes to win,\" said van Riemsdyk of Pastrnak. \"It gets guys fired up but we obviously don't want to see him doing that too often.\"\n\nThe Bruins picked up their fifth too many men on the ice penalty of the playoffs when the bench was assessed a two-minute infraction at 15:48 of the second. Montgomery routinely mixes up his lines over the course of the game and was willing to take the hit for the Bruins' out of control problem.\n\n\"We've taken more in the postseason that we've taken in the regular season,\" said Montgomery. \"I take full responsibility and I have to be clear and be louder and if I have to start grabbing people's pants so they don't jump when they shouldn't, I'll start doing that.\n\n\"All of us together and the communication needs to be better and there was no excuse for the too many men. I'd like to say it will be easy to solve with our group and I think it is easy to solve. It is my responsibility to make them better in those areas.\"\n\nMontgomery would not disclose whether he plans to start Jeremy Swayman or Linus Ullmark in net for Game 3.\n\nSwayman has started eight games and is 5-3 with stellar numbers in goals against average (1.81) and save percentage (.942). But Montgomery replaced him with Ullmark after the Panthers' fourth goal at 1:28 of the third period. Swayman made 19 saves before getting the hook. Ullmark gave up two goals on 10 shots.\n\n\"It is the strength of our team, our biggest strength is we have two great goalies,\" said Montgomery.\n\nMontgomery fielded a number of inquiries about the disturbing subpar play of defenseman Charlie McAvoy, who logged a below average 18:36 minutes and was a minus two in the loss.\n\n\"I think McAvoy has been a horse for us in the playoffs,\" said Montgomery. \"Did he have his best game last night? No, but I don't think there was a Bruin who, except for maybe Swayman, had his best game last night.\n\n\"I think fatigue factors and he's our biggest numbers cruncher. He'll be ready (Friday) night.\"\n\nBruins GM Don Sweeney announced the team has assigned forward Patrick Brown to Providence, a move that could facilitate the return of winger Danton Heinen's to the lineup for Game 3. Heinen has missed four straight playoffs games with an undisclosed injury.\n\n\"I think day-to-day is his updated prognosis,\" said Montgomery.", "source": {"uri": "bostonherald.com", "dataType":

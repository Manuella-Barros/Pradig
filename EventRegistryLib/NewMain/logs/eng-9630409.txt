I extend words of deepest sympathy to his family,\" Tusk wrote.\n\nThe situation at the European Union's eastern border is increasingly tense under pressure from thousands of people from the Middle East, Asia and Africa trying to force their way through metal barrier that Poland put up in 2022 to seal the frontier. Latest figures from the Polish Border Guard say there have been some 17,000 attempts at illegally crossing the border this year.\n\nPoland and the EU say many of the migrants are organized and aided by Russia and its ally Belarus to destabilize Europe. Their pressure intensified this spring, ahead of key elections to the European Parliament. In-person voting began on Thursday, in the Netherlands, with the other 26 EU member states due to go to the polls by June 9.\n\nThe border is patrolled by about 6,000 Polish army troops, some 2,200 border guards and a few hundred police. Recently, some other officers also required hospital treatment for knife and other wounds inflicted from behind the barrier.\n\nEarlier Thursday, government officials demanded explanations after it emerged that three soldiers were handcuffed and detained by Polish military police in March for having fired warning shots when faced with an advancing group of migrants on the border with Belarus.\n\nThe soldiers had allegedly fired warning shots first into the air and then into the ground as they tried to stop an advancing migrant group on Polish territory.

The efforts have been successful in reducing the flow, said Foreign Ministry spokesman Pawel Wronski.\n\nBut recently more migrants have been arriving from Central African countries like Somalia, Eritrea or Yemen, where Western countries have limited possibilities of reaching people with information about the non-passable border, Wronski said.\n\nGovernment officials on Thursday demanded explanations after it emerged that three soldiers were handcuffed and detained by Polish military police in March for having fired warning shots when faced with an advancing group of migrants on the border with Belarus.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe soldiers had allegedly fired warning shots first into the air and then into the ground as they tried to stop an advancing migrant group on Polish territory.

Two of them have since been charged by prosecutors.\n\nThe border has recently seen a surge not only in the number of migrants and asylum seekers trying to cross, but also in aggression towards Polish officers. In some cases, soldiers and border guards have been hospitalised with injuries following attacks.\n\nYesterday, Onet, a leading news website, reported that in one case from around the turn of March and April, three soldiers were detained after firing warning shots into the air and ground around a group of 50 people - made up of men aged 20-30 - who had forced their way onto the Polish side of the border.\n\nTwo of the three soldiers have reportedly been charged with exceeding their powers and endangering the lives of others. They were also suspended from duty. The actions of the authorities have reportedly caused anger and frustration within the military.\n\nIn response to Onet's report, defence minister W\u0142adys\u0142aw Kosiniak-Kamysz issued a statement on Wednesday night saying that the situation was \"unacceptable\" and needed \"to be fully explained.\"\n\n\"Soldiers guarding state security must be sure that legal procedures protect them,\" wrote the minister. \"I will always stand on the side of the honour of Polish soldiers.\"\n\nKosiniak-Kamysz's predecessor as defence minister, Mariusz B\u0142aszczak, who is now the head of the opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party's parliamentary caucus, also condemned the news as an \"absolute scandal\".\n\n\"The Polish state has an obligation to stand behind border defenders. Soldiers cannot be exposed to physical attacks from migrants on the one hand and to legal consequences from Bodnar's prosecutor's office on the other,\" wrote B\u0142aszczak, referring to current justice minister and prosecutor general Adam Bodnar.\n\nB\u0142aszczak also rejected the idea that Kosiniak-Kamysz had only now learned of the incident. The defence ministry gets regular reports on the situation at the border and \"Kosiniak-Kamysz MUST have known about the detention of the soldiers\", wrote B\u0142aszczak. \"The truth was hidden for about two months.\"\n\nSebastian Kaleta, who served as a deputy justice minister in the former PiS government, also suggested that perhaps recent incidents of physical attacks on soldiers have happened because \"they are prohibited from defending themselves or because they are afraid [of prosecution]\".\n\nS\u0142awomir Mentzen, one of the leaders of the far-right Confederation (Konfederacja), another opposition party, accused the \"government of caring more about illegal immigrants storming our borders on Putin's orders than about Polish soldiers!\"\n\nHowever, figures from the current ruling coalition - including MPs Roman Giertych and S\u0142awomir \u0106wik - also criticised the actions of the prosecutors who have reportedly brought charges against the soldiers.\n\nMeanwhile, Jacek Siewiera, the head of President Andrzej Duda's National Security Bureau, said that it is a \"shocking and scandalous situation when the Polish army lacks proper tools in the face of an external threat to state security\".\n\nSiewiera noted that Duda had last year proposed legislation setting out new conditions for the use of weapons by the army when faced with \"hybrid threats\". He appealed for all political forces to now support that bill, reports news website Interia.\n\nLast week, in response to a rise in attempted crossings of the border by migrants and attacks on Polish officers, the government announced that it would reintroduce an exclusion zone banning people from approaching the Polish side of the border.\n\nThose measures were initially planned to go into place on Tuesday this week but, so far, have not been implemented. Meanwhile, this week has seen further attacks on officers at the border, including one who was hospitalised on Monday with serious injuries.", "source": {"uri": "notesfrompoland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Notes From Poland"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dziennik_gazeta_prawna@notesfrompoland.com", "name": "Dziennik Gazeta Prawna.", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "including_foreign_policy@notesfrompoland.com", "name": "Including Foreign Policy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W\u0142adys\u0142aw_Kosiniak-Kamysz", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "W\u0142adys\u0142aw Kosiniak-Kamysz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onet.pl", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Onet.pl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_seeker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asylum seeker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Border guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_and_Justice", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law and Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarus", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Bodnar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adam Bodnar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariusz_B\u0142aszczak", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mariusz B\u0142aszczak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S\u0142awomir_Mentzen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S\u0142awomir Mentzen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederation_Liberty_and_Independence", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Confederation Liberty and Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Giertych", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roman Giertych"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Bureau_(Poland)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Security Bureau (Poland)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrzej_Duda", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrzej Duda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Polish Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Illegal immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Land_Forces", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Land Forces", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Walls", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Walls", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://notesfrompoland.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/b848f918-552f-4dc6-9c7f-7aee68484bcb.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9630409", "eventUri": "eng-9630409", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

An appeal was issued for people to donate blood.\n\nOn Wednesday, prosecutors announced that an investigation into the attempted murder of the soldier had been handed over to the military affairs department of the district prosecutor's office in Warsaw. The perpetrator of the attack, however, has not been identified.\n\nSeparately, on Wednesday a media report revealed that two Polish soldiers had been charged over another incident earlier this year in which they had fired warning shots at migrants trying to force their way across the border.\n\nThat prompted criticism from the opposition, who claimed that the government was hindering soldiers in their defence of the border.

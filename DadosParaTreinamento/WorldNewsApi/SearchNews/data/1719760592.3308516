You\u2019re what I\u2019ve waited for here I am, I\u2019m your man\u2026\u201d At press time Manilow had not shared what ailment caused the show postponement. Manilow is in the middle of a nine-show residency run at the venue entitled The Last, Last UK Concerts; the series is slated to run through June 9. The setting is fitting because the London Palladium was where Manilow performed his first UK gigs in 1978. Earlier, in announcing the Palladium run, Manilow explained, \u201cIn 1978, The London Palladium is where I began my love affair with the British public. These shows will be my last full concerts in Britain and I wanted to end where I began \u2013 at the London Palladium.\u201d Before Tuesday\u2019s show, Manilow revealed that Monday\u2019s scotched gig has been rescheduled for June 9 at 2:30 p.m. Check out Manilow\u2019s scheduling post and fan footage from Tuesday\u2019s show below.", "summary": "The singer returned on Tuesday night (May 28) to the venue he first played in Oct. 1978.", "url": "https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/barry-manilow-returns-stage-london-palladium-cancelling-show-doctors-orders-1235694793/", "image": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Barry-Manilow-2021-billboard-1548.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:15:04", "author": "Gil Kaufman", "authors": ["Gil Kaufman"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.005}

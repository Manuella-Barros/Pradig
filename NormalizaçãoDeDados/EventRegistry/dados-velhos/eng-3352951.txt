Half the roster is composed of redshirt or true freshmen. New schemes have been installed on both sides of the ball.\n\nThere is no team in the Big Ten undergoing more drastic change this season than the Gophers, starting with their 36-year-old whirlwind coach, P.J. Fleck.\n\n\"A lot of energy has been brought to this complex,\" defensive tackle Steven Richardson said. \"With the other coaches I was very calm. I always kind of kept to myself, but it definitely brought a leadership role out of me.\"\n\nFleck brought his unabashed optimism and bounty of buzzwords, including the trademarked \"Row the Boat\" slogan to preach perseverance and unity, from Western Michigan after an improbable Cotton Bowl appearance and a 13-1 record. Fleck replaced Tracy Claeys, who was fired after a clash between the team and the administration over the process behind the bowl-game suspension of 10 players in connection with alleged sexual misconduct.\n\nThere's hardly another coach in country more wired to handle a fresh start.\n\n\"They're all over the place,\" linebacker Blake Cashman said. \"It fuels us, gets us going, and makes practice a lot of fun.\"\n\nCashman, whose team-high 7+ sacks all came over the last eight games, was put on scholarship for his junior season. He learned of the honor after a team-wide egg hunt at the facility this spring.\n\n\"It really shows where Coach Fleck's heart's at,\" Cashman said.\n\nFifth-year walk-on Justin Juenemann, the third-string kicker, was rewarded in similar fashion this week through a message shot from a T-shirt gun.\n\nThe Gophers will enter 2017 with many unproven players, notably wide receivers and defensive backs. They will ride running backs Rodney Smith and Shannon Brooks as much as they can and rely on a rich collection of linebackers to steer the defense.\n\n\"We could go 12-0 or 0-12. I'm not worried about the 'W' or the 'L,' what that looks like. I'm worried about this team doing everything they can to become their best,\" Fleck said.\n\nHere are some other angles to follow with the Gophers this season:\n\nRHODA VS. CROFT\n\nFleck must soon select a starting quarterback between Conor Rhoda and Demry Croft. Rhoda, a fifth-year senior, started one game last season for an injured Mitch Leidner. Croft subbed in three games as a freshman before redshirting last year.\n\n\"You have a tough quarterback, you have a tough team,\" Fleck said. \"We have to find out how tough the quarterbacks are.\"\n\nMIDWEEK MEDITATION\n\nAfter 22 players had offseason surgery, keeping the team healthy is a key goal. \"Zen Wednesdays\" are one way to try. There's no better picture of Fleck's creative spirit and holistic approach in program development than these midweek sessions for massage, stretching and yoga. Practice that day is a non-contact walk-through, without pads. Then the lights are dimmed, the music plays and the relaxation begins.\n\n\"I definitely feel better the next day, at night even,\" Smith said.\n\nHEAL AND HOLD THE LINE\n\nOffensive line coach Ed Warriner, who was Ohio State's offensive coordinator last year, has four players (Garrison Wright, Donnell Greene, Vincent Calhoun and Jared Weyler) who started seven or more games in 2016. But injuries could expose suspect depth.\n\n\"I feel great, honestly, going into fall camp,\" said Weyler, who will likely move from guard to center. \"I'm really happy where I'm at.\"\n\nSEASON OPENER\n\nThe Gophers host Buffalo on Aug. 31, their fifth straight Thursday night lid-lifter at TCF Bank Stadium. This will be the 10th time in 18 years that Minnesota has started the season on a Thursday. The Gophers beat the Bulls 41-17 in 2002, their only previous meeting.\n\nKEY GAMES\n\nThe Oct. 14 matchup at home with Michigan State, the 2015 Big Ten champs who went 3-9 last year, looms large. An Oct. 28 visit to rival Iowa, where Minnesota has not won since 1999, promises to be pivotal. The Nov. 25 home game against Wisconsin, with a humbling losing streak to the hated Badgers now at 13 straight games, wraps up the schedule.\n\nPREDICTION\n\nThere's a good chance the Gophers will be favored to win their first seven games , a benefit for an inexperienced team, but matching last season's 9-4 mark is a lot to ask. Consecutive trips to Iowa and Michigan kick off a daunting final five weeks. Finishing 7-5 with a bowl bid would be a safer bet.\n\n--\n\nFor more AP college football coverage: http://collegefootball.ap.org and https://twitter.com/AP-Top25", "timeCrawl": "21:38:00", "sim": 0.8196078538894653, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 3478, "date": "2017-08-31", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 3485}, {"date": "-10-14", "textStart": 3734, "amb": false, "textEnd": 3741}, {"date": "-10-28", "textStart": 3843, "amb": false, "textEnd": 3850}, {"date": "-11-25", "textStart": 3940, "amb": false, "textEnd": 3947}], "location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States of America"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}}, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-10", "id": "8491646", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "id": 32, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "id": 49, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "id": 51, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "id": 52, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "id": 134, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "id": 135, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "id": 137, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "id": 205, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

I always kind of kept to myself, but it definitely brought a leadership role out of me.\"\n\nFleck brought his unabashed optimism and bounty of buzzwords, including the trademarked \"Row the Boat\" slogan to preach perseverance and unity, from Western Michigan after an improbable Cotton Bowl appearance and a 13-1 record. Fleck replaced Tracy Claeys, who was fired after a clash between the team and the administration over the process behind the bowl-game suspension of 10 players in connection with alleged sexual misconduct.\n\nThere's hardly another coach in country more wired to handle a fresh start.\n\n\"They're all over the place,\" linebacker Blake Cashman said. \"It fuels us, gets us going, and makes practice a lot of fun.\"\n\nCashman, whose team-high 7\u00bd sacks all came over the last eight games, was put on scholarship for his junior season.

There's no better picture of Fleck's creative spirit and holistic approach in program development than these midweek sessions for massage, stretching and yoga.

Then the lights are dimmed, the music plays and the relaxation begins.\n\n\"I definitely feel better the next day, at night even,\" Smith said.\n\nHEAL AND HOLD THE LINE\n\nOffensive line coach Ed Warriner, who was Ohio State's offensive coordinator last year, has four players (Garrison Wright, Donnell Greene, Vincent Calhoun and Jared Weyler) who started seven or more games in 2016. But injuries could expose suspect depth.\n\n\"I feel great, honestly, going into fall camp,\" said Weyler, who will likely move from guard to center. \"I'm really happy where I'm at.\"\n\nSEASON OPENER\n\nThe Gophers host Buffalo on Aug. 31, their fifth straight Thursday night lid-lifter at TCF Bank Stadium.

Fleck may have changed head coaching jobs after last season, going from Western Michigan to Minnesota.\n\nBut one thing has stayed the same: Fleck's unique ways of informing a walk-on he has earned a scholarship.\n\nTwo years ago at a Western Michigan during special teams work in practice, Fleck taped a scholarship offer to a football and had his kicker aim it at walk-on running back Trevor Sweeney. Sweeney's teammates made sure he recovered the kick.\n\nHere's out it played out in the video:\n\nLast year in preseason practice, Fleck showed up and said if one of his players could stop him in a one-on-one drill that the team wouldn't have any more night meetings.\n\nFleck said he had to choose the player and he picked walk-on linebacker Kasey Carson. Naturally, Carson stopped Fleck.\n\nBut as the video below shows, that was just the beginning of the surprise.\n\nThis past spring at Minnesota, with help of his wife and coaching staff, Fleck staged an easter egg hunt in the Gophers' practice facility. Players were paired, taped together at the wrist and sent racing to collect plastic eggs.\n\nWhen they all reconvened in the team room, they were asked to open their eggs. All the eggs contained a small slip of paper on the inside of each egg saying that walk-on Blake Cashman had earned a scholarship as seen in the video below.\n\nThis week at a Minnesota team meeting, Fleck enlisted the help of a fan named Kyle, who is a patient at University of Minnesota children's hospital.\n\nFleck walked in the room with a T-shirt cannon. So he asked Kyle who was his favorite player and he named redshirt senior placekicker Justin Juenemann.\n\nFleck then allowed Kyle to fire the T-shirt cannon at Juenemann, who caught the shirt. When he opened it, the front of the shirt informed Juenemann that he had earned a scholarship as seen in the below video:\n\nCredit Fleck for his continued creativity. Gophers' fans hope that imagination carries over to the field.", "timeCrawl": "15:17:00", "sim": 0.7843137383460999, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-10", "id": "8428517", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "id": 32, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges_and_Universities", "label": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges and Universities", "id": 143, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Casual", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Casual", "id": 182, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty_Travel", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty Travel", "id": 704, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Now, air cannons. When it comes to awarding scholarships, Gophers football coach P.J. Fleck has creative ways of informing his players.\n\nOn Wednesday, Fleck released a video on Twitter (@Coach_Fleck) of how he informed senior place-kicker Justin Juenemann he had earned a scholarship.\n\nFleck, toting an air cannon at his side, brought in Kyle, a patient at the University of Minnesota Masonic Children's Hospital into the team's meeting room. Kyle addressed the team, then Fleck asked him who was his favorite player.\n\n\"I remember seeing one particular person a lot,'' Kyle said, referring to Gophers visiting him at the hospital. ''That was Justin [Juenemann].''\n\nFleck then spoke about how Kyle earlier was admiring the air cannon.\n\n''We were sitting in my office and Kyle points to this and asks, 'What is that?'\n\n'' 'That's my new toy. Just came in.'\n\n\" 'Can I shoot it?'\n\n''I said, 'No, you can shoot it.' His mom's like, 'No, no, don't let him shoot it.'\n\n''But I'll let you shoot it in here, though,'' Fleck added in the team room, instructing Kyle to shoot the cannon, loaded with a T-shirt, toward his favorite player.\n\nHe did, and Juenemann caught it on the fly.\n\nAfter a few moments, Juenemann read the writing on the T-shirt, which said, \"Justin, congratulations on earning a scholarship!''\n\nThe \"Row The Boat\" Culture is all about serving & giving!! Congrats to @JustinJuenemann on EARNING his scholarship!! https://t.co/fguiiyt5tY -- P.J. Fleck (@Coach_Fleck)\n\nAugust 9, 2017\n\nJuenemann's teammates erupted in cheers, much like they did when linebacker Blake Cashman received the news of his scholarship award via an Easter egg hunt.\n\n''I've never seen anybody serve and give more than that guy, who is not a star player, who hasn't played where his face is recognizable,'' Fleck said of Juenemann, who is pursuing his master's degree in Human Resources and Industrial Relations. \"He could easily just not do it and nobody would say anything.''\n\nOlder Post Ouch!

Fleck on his Sunday morning WCCO Radio appearance said that both Demry Croft and Conor Rhoda \"did a lot of really good things'' during Saturday's scrimmage, but neither has won the starting job as the Aug. 31 season opener against Buffalo approaches.\n\n\"There still hasn't been that one guy who's said, 'This is my job. I do this way better than the other guy,' '' Fleck said.\n\n\"The decision is getting tougher because they are both improving,'' Fleck added. \"... Hopefully we'll be able to make that decision in a reasonable time coming up.''\n\nSaturday's scrimmage, which was closed to the public and media, ran about 130 plays. \"We had to be able to get our young kids reps,'' Fleck said \"We had to put our quarterbacks in a lot of tough situations.''\n\nFleck emphasized that being decisive and avoiding turnovers will be key for whichever quarterback wins the starting job. \"The teams that usually are at the top of their divisions, they win the turnover margin,'' he said. \"... Whenever the quarterback touches [the ball] every single play, the decisions he makes, decisively, end up being the difference of the season.''\n\nOverall, Fleck was pleased with the scrimmage.\n\n\"I'm really proud of the progress we've made,'' he said. \"Does it mean we're fifth-year seniors across the board and we have depth everywhere? No. But we've gotten better since the beginning of training camp to now.''\n\nNotes\n\n** Fleck lauded true freshman receiver Demetrius Douglas for his performance in the scrimmage.\n\n\"He has been outstanding,'' Fleck. \"... Incredible leader. It looks like he's been here three years.''\n\n** Fleck liked what he saw from true freshman Rey Estes at cornerback and expects the former quarterback to provide needed depth in the secondary. The coach also said Justus Harris, another true freshman, could help at nickelback.\n\n** Fleck on true freshman offensive tackle Blaise Andries: \"If we can play him, and he's going to play [extensively], we'll play him. You never want to play a kid to kind of be a backup and he plays the ninth game one rep.''\n\nFleck sees Andries improving while taking his lumps. \"He's gotta get used to getting his butt kicked at times but also knowing to look at it from the positive side,'' he said.\n\nOlder Post Gophers kicker Juenemann enjoys 'whirlwind' 24 hours", "timeCrawl": "18:00:00", "sim": 0.7254902124404907, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 291, "date": "2017-08-31", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 298}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8950129", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "id": 51, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre", "id": 114, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "id": 284, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Sound_Files", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Sound Files", "id": 922, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job_Search", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job Search", "id": 948, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

J. Fleck"}, "type": "person", "id": "577987", "score": 5}], "time": "01:47:00", "isDuplicate": false, "body": "Gophers Head Coach P.J. Fleck took to the field during the Gophers football practice at Gibson-Nagurski Football Complex\n\nOne of the big story lines regarding P.J. Fleck taking over as Gophers coach has been whether he is downplaying expectations for a Gophers squad that went 9-4 last season and won its bowl game with a depleted roster against Washington State.\n\nThe Gophers finished fourth last season in scoring offense in the Big Ten at 29.3 points per game, though their total offense ranked 11th. They ranked fifth in scoring defense (22.1 points per game) and fourth in total defense.\n\nBut for Fleck the question isn't about what the team did last year. Instead he wants the team to realize that last year, no matter the record or success or failures, has nothing to do with this season.\n\n\"I'm not saying it's not possible [to have a better record], I'm just saying last year has nothing to do with this year,\" Fleck said. \"Whether you go 2-10, 0-12, 1-11, 9-4, 10-2, it has nothing to do with this year. It's a completely new football team.\"\n\nAnd while the team does have a solid group of returning players, Fleck said that when you scratch beneath the surface of the starters, that's where the team gets thin.\n\n\"Fifty-eight of our players are either true freshmen or redshirt freshmen,\" he said. \"We're one of the most inexperienced teams in the country, and we don't have a lot of depth. But we have a ton of heart. We have a ton of guys who have played. But it's the combination of that depth that we have to develop over camp.\"\n\nAnd when it comes to those freshmen, Fleck said there's no question that many are going to see time on the field this season.\n\n\"There's going to be a lot of freshmen that play,\" he said. \"Eventually there's going to be a lot of freshmen that play.\"\n\nQB battle\n\nWith the absence of four-year starter Mitch Leidner, Fleck and his staff have six quarterbacks on the roster -- freshmen Samuel Pickerign, Jaran Roste and Tanner Morgan, redshirt freshman Seth Green, redshirt sophomore Demry Croft and redshirt senior Conor Rhoda. And while Fleck has been coy about his quarterback battle, he did say it appears the starting job will come down to Rhoda or Croft.\n\n\"Yeah, we're getting there. I'd start to say it's starting to look that way,\" Fleck said. \"I'm not ready to say those are the final two, but we're getting closer to that.\n\n\"We have to start weaning that down towards the actual scrimmage on Saturday, and hopefully we can come up with a decision in a week or two.\"\n\nPersonally, I think it will be Croft because of his outstanding performance in the spring game.\n\nLeidner's rushing ability was put to heavy use under former head coaches Jerry Kill and Tracy Cleays, as he averaged about 374 rushing yards and just over eight rushing touchdowns per season.\n\nAnd while Fleck says the team doesn't want its quarterbacks running too much, if Croft is named starter one would have to think the fleet-footed quarterback, who rushed for 845 yards and 10 touchdowns in his senior season at Boylan High School in Illinois, would be asked to do some running.\n\n\"I hope they don't have to run too much, but our run game does call for our [quarterbacks] to have to run a little bit, not a lot,\" Fleck said. \"But if one does run a little bit better than the other, then maybe we'll run a little bit more. It just depends on the health of our football team as we go through the year.\"\n\nPractice underway\n\nWith opening day three weeks away, Fleck said some of the early concern about depth on the offensive line and defensive line has gotten better with the return of some injured players. But he still thinks the offensive line is going to be a work in progress.\n\n\"Defensive line is a little deeper, I think, than our offensive line,\" he said. \"But we have to be able to develop some guys pretty quickly up front on the offensive side.\"\n\nHe was asked if any players have surprised him early on in practice.\n\n\"Demetrius Douglas, No. 82, is having a phenomenal camp, the true freshman at wide receiver,\" Fleck said. \"I think in the secondary when you start to look at some guys like Rey Estes, who moved over from quarterback to defensive back. [Tight end] Nate Umlor I think is doing a tremendous job, and [offensive lineman] Blaise Andries. Those are some freshmen that are really popping out and standing out right now.\"\n\nDoes he think the players have absorbed some of the information they learned during spring camp?\n\n\"They understand the culture, understand the demands, understand the expectations of practice, they understand that we need them to change every single day and get better and not stay the same, at all,\" Fleck said. \"I think we're just a better football team, and that's what you want. I can't say we're ready to win the Rose Bowl today, but I can say we're a better football team than we were yesterday.\"\n\nAnd finally, Fleck was asked if he's getting excited for opening day.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to tonight's meetings,\" he said. \"I don't look much further than that.\"\n\nJottings\n\n*\u2002The Twins will open the season on the road next year, at Baltimore on March 29, and have their home opener with Seattle in early April.\n\n*\u2002The Twins drew two of their biggest crowds of the year on Monday and Tuesday against Milwaukee with 31,339 and 34,185 respectively. But they rank 23rd overall in baseball with an average of 25,062 fans per night. The teams drawing fewer fans are Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Cincinnati, the Chicago White Sox, Miami, Oakland and Tampa Bay.\n\n*\u2002Fleck may be responsible for the sale of 1,200 new Gophers football season tickets\n\n*\u2002Tickets are selling well for the Sept. 23 football game at Target Field between St. John's and St. Thomas, which starts at 1:10 p.m.\n\n*\u2002Andy MacPhail and Michael Cuddyer will be inducted into the Twins Hall of Fame during the weekend series Aug. 18-20 vs. the Arizona Diamondbacks.\n\n*\u2002Tuesday night marked the anniversary of Twins manager Paul Molitor stealing his 500th base, which he did in a game against Baltimore in 1998, becoming just the fifth player in baseball history to record 3,000 hits and 500 steals. There are seven members in the group today. ... Byron Buxton was named the winner of the Heart and Hustle Award for the Twins, which is given to one player on each team who embodies the values, spirit and traditions of the game. Previous winners for the Twins were Eduardo Nunez last season and Brian Dozier in 2014 and 2015.\n\nSid Hartman can be heard on WCCO AM-830 at 8:40 a.m. Monday and Friday, 2 p.m. Friday and 10:30 a.m. Sunday. shartman@startribune.com", "timeCrawl": "01:47:00", "sim": 0.6980392336845398, "extractedDates": [{"dateEnd": "2017-08-20", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 5860, "date": "2017-08-18", "textStart": 5850}, {"date": "-03-29", "textStart": 5109, "amb": false, "textEnd": 5117}, {"textStart": 5640, "date": "2017-09-23", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 5648}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-10", "id": "8303087", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "id": 31, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "id": 32, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "id": 447, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/AFC", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/AFC", "id": 673, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Fleck has the goal of getting more national exposure for his program, and Wednesday offered a prime example of that.\n\nFirst, Fleck released a video on Twitter documenting the creative method he used to announce that senior kicker Justin Juenemann -- who has yet to see action for the Gophers -- was receiving a scholarship.\n\nFleck brought Kyle Tanner, a patient at the University of Minnesota's Masonic Children's Hospital, into his team's meeting room, handed Tanner an air cannon loaded with a T-shirt and had Tanner shoot the T-shirt to Juenemann, who had befriend the patient during hospital visits. The T-shirt read, \"Justin, congratulations on earning a scholarship!''\n\nThe video is a big hit on social media, and a variety of national outlets picked it up.\n\nThe timing of the video dovetailed neatly with Wednesday night's airing on ESPNU of the second episode of \"Being P.J. Fleck'', a behind-the-scenes look at the coach's transition to Minnesota leading into his first season as Gophers coach.\n\nIncluded in that episode were visits to the children's hospital, and players checking in on Tanner was one of those. One has to think that the Tanner-to-Juenemann air cannon connection will be included in one of the two remaining episodes, which air the next two Wednesdays.\n\nBut the documentary wasn't only features. It also delved into the controversy Fleck faced late this spring when he released a Twitter video that showed footage of his football camps that included current recruits.\n\nThat quickly got the attention of other programs, who, according to 24/7Sports, alerted the NCAA to what they believed was a recruiting violation. NCAA rules do not allow schools to post videos of recruits.\n\n\"Seventy coaches turned me in,'' Fleck said.\n\nBut it wasn't a violation. Since video was an advertisement for Fleck's football camps, it was permitted under NCAA rules at the time. The NCAA has closed that loophole since.\n\nAlso included in the documentary was a scene from last spring, when the coach had his players pair up -- complete with wrists taped together -- for an Easter egg hunt. It concluded with players opening plastic eggs, which revealed that walk-on linebacker Blake Cashman had received a full scholarship.\n\nMore exposure for the Gophers came Thursday morning when ESPN interviewed Juenemann on its morning \"SportsCenter'' show.\n\n\"Twenty-four hours ago I never would have thought I'd be in this position,'' Juenemann said. \"... It didn't matter if I was a scholarship or walk-on, if I was a kicker or quarterback. I just love giving, serving and reaching out to the community, and Masonic Children's Hospital was a great opportunity for myself to reach out there and meet Kyle and meet this different people that I never would have thought I'd be able to.\n\n''... Just to be able to see the smile on their face and the joy that is in the room, it's the best feeling.''\n\nNotes\n\n* Wide receiver Isaiah Gentry announced via Instagram that he has left the Gophers program. Gentry, a fourth-year junior, did not see game action last year. He played in three games in 2015, catching two passes for 36 yards. He missed 10 games because of injury that year.\n\n* Wisconsin senior inside linebacker Jack Cichy, a former Hill-Murray standout, tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee and will miss the season, the school announced. Cichy, who missed the final seven games of the 2016 season because of a torn pectoral muscle, injured his knee during practice Tuesday. He returned to practice with a protective sleeve on the knee and also went through Wednesday's walk-through, the Wisconsin State Journal reported. Cichy will have surgery on Friday.\n\nOlder Post Gophers kicker gets surprise scholarship, news delivered via T-shirt", "timeCrawl": "16:24:00", "sim": 0.6941176652908325, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-10", "id": "8442462", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Recordings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Recordings", "id": 57, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Casual", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Casual", "id": 182, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Players", "id": 448, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "id": 485, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "id": 487, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Video", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Video", "id": 762, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

But if you use it as a marketing tool for your camp, you can.\n\n\"There is a little loophole in there,\" he added before his wife, Heather, asked him if he'd like some avocado toast for breakfast.\n\nFleck continued that his staff has been working on the high school camp video for weeks, adding that the U's compliance department \"is one of the toughest in the country, I think.\n\n\"For them to be able to say, 'yes,' it was like all right yeah, that will work, so we put it out there,\" Fleck said. \"And everybody was like, 'wow,' and everybody freaked out.\"\n\n\"It was good for us because -- you know, again -- it was finding new ways to do things,\" he added.\n\nAfter the introductory episode last week that dove into Fleck's background, the second episode started with him wrestling wide receiver Tyler Johnson for a football during spring practice.\n\nThe episode touches on the creative ways Fleck has invigorated the Gophers from an Easter egg hunt for players to making routine visits to the University of Minnesota Masonic Children's Hospital.\n\nFleck shared more details about how \"Row the Boat\" has been his life mantra since the death of his infant son Colt to a heart condition, which happened with his first wife, Tracie, in 2011.\n\n\"That was probably the worst day of my life,\" Fleck described. \"But also the best day because it was the ability for me to invent that, create (Row the Boat).\"\n\nFleck explained that there were problems early in the pregnancy with Colt that continued into the final weeks. His son's lungs had stopped developing, a problem because the planned heart surgery first needed that advancement.\n\n\"We knew that he would be born, and we knew he wouldn't make it past a few minutes,\" Fleck said. \"That was really hard because you have a full turn and you go through the series of emotions and you feel him kicking, you feel him moving, and you spend as many minutes as you can with him.

Some use more explicit words, some come with softer phrasing. All, though, sound similar.\n\n\"What the hell is wrong with P.J. Fleck?\"\n\nBut colleagues, supporters, doubters and reporters in the Twin Cities, home to a historically frigid college football scene, begin most conversations about Minnesota's new coach with some variation of another, more important question: Is he for real?\n\nAnd that's an expected reaction to the 5-foot-10, triple-espresso-shot-of-a-coach who said he \"eats difficult conversations for breakfast,\" enjoyed \"running into the fire, not away from the fire\" and planned to \"change the culture\" of a program without a Rose Bowl appearance in more than 50 years -- all during his introductory news conference after leaving Western Michigan, where he finished 13-1 last season.\n\nAt the time, his new team had not yet learned the full ramifications of a sexual assault investigation involving multiple players. Yet there was the 36-year-old extrovert on a dais in Minneapolis, urging his new fan base to \"Row the Boat,\" a motivating phrase he started using after his newborn son died of a heart condition while Fleck was a coach at Rutgers.\n\nFleck and Minnesota actually had to work out an agreement to allow him to use the phrase with the Golden Gophers. Fleck will give Western Michigan at least $50,000 through five payments of $10,000 to endow a scholarship for a football player.\n\n\"I think the first thing you notice is Hurricane Fleck just came through,\" said Nadine Babu, a longtime fan who attended the coach's first news conference in January and runs Gopherhole.com, the team's largest message board. \"It seems like he's prepared himself for a role like this all of his life.\"\n\nIn a brief stretch, Fleck has forced Minnesota football into the national dialogue with his \"Row the Boat\" catchphrase, energetic interviews and his reality show on ESPNU, \"Being P.J. Fleck.\"\n\nBut he does not know what he'll face in the Twin Cities. Yet.\n\nYou have to live here to understand the layered vibe around Minnesota football.\n\nThe program last won a share of the Big Ten title in 1967, the final season of the \"glory years\" portion of its Wikipedia page. Struggling coaches have spent the past five decades encouraging pessimism and apathy through multiple generations of fans who want to win big but brace for the worst.\n\nLast year's promising campaign was the squad's first nine-win season since 2003.\n\n\"People have been incredibly warm and open to change,\" Fleck said during Big Ten media day in Chicago last month. \"When you haven't won a championship in 50 years, that can take a toll on a program. That can take a toll on a fan base. That can take a toll on how you believe. And then also what it breeds is comparisons. And it's almost like the movie 'Major League.' 'Oh, we'll blow it in the ninth.'\"\n\nThat's what Fleck is fighting in Minneapolis.\n\nHis Joel Osteen-meets-Vince Lombardi persona aims to entice hungry supporters.\n\nBut they've drowned in the platitudes and promises of former coaches, so they're cautious. Lou Holtz wooed a desperate fan base before he bolted for Notre Dame in the 1980s after two seasons. Glen Mason reneged on a deal to accept Georgia's head-coaching job prior to his stint with Minnesota.\n\nHe later said, \"Not a day goes by that I don't think about that Georgia job and the bad decision I made.\"\n\nHe was still Minnesota's head coach at the time.\n\nBut when Fleck talks about \"comparisons,\" he's referencing one man.\n\nA decade ago, Tim Brewster walked into a news conference in Minneapolis and talked about a bright future and renewed vision.\n\nBrewster, then a tight ends coach with the Denver Broncos who had no prior head-coaching experience, spoke in the third person.\n\n\"The No. 1 thing everyone says about Tim Brewster is that he's a great salesman,\" said Brewster, now an assistant at Florida State. \"Well, I tell you what: You're not going to be a great salesman if you don't have a great product.\"\n\nHe then said he would recruit the best kids in the state, players who would help the team reach the Rose Bowl.\n\n\"Our expectation is to win a Big Ten championship now,\" Brewster said then. \"We're not interested in any rebuilding process.\"\n\nHe finished 1-11 his first year and lost every Big Ten game.\n\nMinnesota fired Brewster in 2010, midway through the third year of his tenure.\n\n\"It's absolutely not fair to [Fleck], but I can see how he's compared to [Brewster],\" said Babu, a longtime fan.\n\nFleck is not Brewster.\n\nHe's a proven leader who finished 1-11 in his first season with Western Michigan in 2013. Four years later, the Broncos went 13-1.\n\nThe Tennessee Titans picked WMU wide receiver Corey Davis with the fifth pick in the NFL draft. Fleck can coach and develop talent.\n\nAnd by now, it's clear, his positivity -- a significant element of his success -- is constant.\n\n\"He had to overcome a lot,\" said Randee Drew, Fleck's teammate at Northern Illinois. \"He wasn't tall. He had to be scrappy. I think when you first meet him, you think he's over the top. But that really is him.\"\n\nCan he use those traits to convince the masses to join the Church of Fleck in a region that hasn't had a lot to celebrate since the Minnesota Twins won the World Series in 1991? That's his mission.\n\n\"Can you imagine when the Twins win the World Series, the Timberwolves -- and we're young, we just got Jimmy Butler -- win the NBA Finals, they're able to win an NBA championship, the Wild get over the Chicago [Blackhawks] hump and we win the Stanley Cup?\" Fleck asked.\n\n\"And you can go on and on. The Vikings, they win a Super Bowl, and then the Gophers win a Big Ten championship? Can you imagine what the city would look like? Can you imagine that? That is why I came here. Because yes, I know people are [saying], 'That'll never happen.' But that's why I came.\"\n\nThe Big Ten's football media day, like the rest, offered more pageantry than substance.\n\nIn late July, the league's coaches were paraded through a Chicago convention center with their spokespersons and the conference-assigned support staff. These coaches spent hours promoting their squads and presenting optimistic outlooks, which the weight of the season could pulverize within the first month.\n\nThirteen coaches wore tailored suits.\n\nJim Harbaugh wore khakis, a long-sleeved Jordan Brand shirt, a Michigan cap and his Clark Kent glasses.\n\nOf course.\n\nOhio State's Urban Meyer, Maryland's D.J. Durkin and Michigan State's Mark Dantonio had a deep conversation about a Luke Bryan concert Meyer attended over the summer.\n\nThe coaches don't attend media days to provide any program-altering insight. And reporters anticipate two days of clich\u00e9s and catchphrases in the year's most relaxed atmosphere.\n\nBut P.J. Fleck couldn't help himself. He would quickly burst into 2 a.m. infomercial mode.\n\nTucked into a corner at McCormick Place a full 24 hours before his scheduled slot on the dais, Fleck spoke to a group of reporters about the job and his mission.\n\nHe waved his hands and fervently defended his vision. He seemed game-ready. Like, ready to play in a game in the convention center lobby if anyone had asked.\n\n\"Good morning,\" Fleck said in his opening remarks the next day. \"I'm not sure if this was by design, to make me go first by waking everybody up.\"\n\nHis players love his fiery demeanor and say there is more to him than his energy.\n\n\"He actually talks to us and we're actually getting to know him,\" linebacker Jonathan Celestin said. \"And when he's actually out there practicing, running around with receivers ... that actually helps players, like 'Oh, he's actually for us.'\n\n\"He's always like that. Every time I see him, sometimes I have to wake up just to make sure I'm on his level. You just have to actually get to know him.\"\n\nIn the early 2000s, Fleck starred as a wide receiver at Northern Illinois, an hour outside Chicago. He finished his career with 179 receptions, 2,162 yards, 11 touchdowns and a relentless optimism some of his teammates did not always understand.\n\nAfter a 34-18 loss to Bowling Green in 2003 that ruined NIU's chances of a BCS bid, Randee Drew -- a co-captain with Fleck that year -- dragged himself to the postgame interview room. He said the entire squad sulked about the missed opportunity and had no interest in talking about the game.\n\nBut Fleck praised his teammates and looked forward as he talked to reporters while sitting next to Drew after the loss.\n\n\"He was still so positive,\" Drew recalled. \"That's just him. And I'm over here looking at him like, 'Dude ... really, man?'\"\n\nFleck never changed, Drew said. He remained positive in all situations.\n\nAnd that's how Fleck has become a marketing machine for Minnesota football.\n\nWith that confidence, he has attracted the national spotlight before he has even coached a game at Minnesota.\n\n\"I am just me,\" Fleck said. \"Same guy one year at Western Michigan. Go back 10 years and see what I was like. Go back 20 years and see what I was like. I haven't changed a ton. I've always had a ton of energy. I love life.\"\n\nHe's also honest about the job. Yes, he wants to win. Yes, he wants to elevate the program.\n\nBut college football is a multibillion-dollar pitch to fans.\n\nAnd Fleck is here to Make! You! Believe! In! Minnesota! Football!\n\n\"I don't think you ever learn to sell a program,\" Fleck said. \"I think you're just, you are yourself. I think a lot of people talk about self-promotion or self-promoters. Isn't every head football coach in Division I, especially in this league, a self-promoter for their program or their culture? I think that's really important to understand because that's what we're paid to do.\"\n\nAnd now he has an opportunity to prove he is far more than talk and can grow Minnesota into a relevant, stable contender in the Big Ten.\n\nIf he achieves the goal, people in and around Minnesota will wear \"Row the Boat\" shirts, hats, mittens and parkas to their cabins that decorate small towns around the state.\n\nAnd if he fails, they'll say, \"I told you so,\" as Fleck joins a group of former coaches who've also fallen short in Minneapolis.\n\n\"Just because we're having the attention, that does not equal and promise success, right, in terms of wins and losses, but what it does is ... it does promise that the culture is going to continue to go the way we want it to go,\" Fleck said. \"And when we're ready to win championships, that will happen.\"\n\nBrewster made similar claims when Minnesota hired him.\n\nOn the day the school fired him, his wife refused to open the door to their suburban home as reporters searched for him.\n\nBrewster, a flytrap for attention early in his tenure, had disappeared after enduring a lesson only a Minnesotan would understand.

Feck.\"\n\nHere are a few of the highlights from \"Just Keeping Rowing\":\n\n\"There are no trap games with Coach Fleck.\" Each week, Fleck uses a different overarching message or theme to engage the players. The idea is to keep players focused week-to-week and avoid looking ahead to an upcoming game or letting a previous week's linger. It also helps fulfill his role as an educator, which is very important to Fleck.\n\nFleck believes being a coach is about creating moments and memories. We all remember the Easter egg hunt that led to former walk-on linebacker Blake Cashman receiving his scholarship. Fleck cites this as an example of how he is trying to create moments and memories for his players. He believes the key to achieving a pure reaction is complete surprise, which is easier said than done. \"It might've been silly. People might've laughed at it. They can't call it 'phony' all they want. But Blake Cashman will never forget that moment,\" he said.\n\nThe new recruiting philosophy is all about finding \"How-phers.\" Fleck was asked about his recruiting philosophy, and he talked about emphasizing heart, spirit, will, passion, energy, purpose, and determination -- the things that you can't measure. He doesn't put much stock in the star ratings from recruiting services, and believes that recruiting is less about talent and more about finding the player that fits your culture. Fleck wants them to be able to succeed athletically, academically, socially, and spiritually at Minnesota.\n\nHe also made mention of how 70 different programs across the country reported him to the NCAA for a (non-)recruiting violation, which made headlines earlier this summer.\n\nServing and giving are essential to the new culture. Once a week or once every other week, Fleck and a group of players will volunteer and visit with patients at the Masonic Children's Hospital. He believes that it provides the players with some much-needed perspective. It was also cool to see that each patient is presented with a \"compass coin,\" which is something each member of the football program already owns. The patients are encouraged to hold it in their palm whenever they're feeling down, as it signifies that they are part of the Gopher family.\n\nThe \"Row the Boat\" culture was born after the worst day of his life. We've covered this ad nauseam here on the blog, but Fleck talked about how he developed the \"Row the Boat\" mantra following the death of his newborn son on Feb. 9, 2011, due to a heart condition. Fleck describes it as the \"worst day of his life,\" but talks about how he now lives two lives -- one for him and one for his late son. While some will dismiss it as a marketing gimmick, he also points out that he doesn't profit from the trademark -- all proceeds from the merchandise sales go toward the Masonic Children's Hospital.\n\nAvocado toast and hard-boiled eggs are a breakfast staple in the Fleck household.

Half the roster is composed of redshirt or true freshmen. New schemes have been installed on both sides of the ball.\n\nThere is no team in the Big Ten undergoing more drastic change this season than the Gophers, starting with their 36-year-old whirlwind coach, P.J. Fleck.\n\n\"A lot of energy has been brought to this complex,\" defensive tackle Steven Richardson said.\n\n\"With the other coaches I was very calm. I always kind of kept to myself, but it definitely brought a leadership role out of me.\"\n\nFleck brought his unabashed optimism and bounty of buzzwords, including the trademarked \"Row the Boat\" slogan to preach perseverance and unity, from Western Michigan after an improbable Cotton Bowl appearance and a 13-1 record.\n\nFleck replaced Tracy Claeys, who was fired after a clash between the team and the administration over the process behind the bowl-game suspension of 10 players in connection with alleged sexual misconduct.\n\nThere's hardly another coach in country more wired to handle a fresh start.\n\n\"They're all over the place,\" linebacker Blake Cashman said. \"It fuels us, gets us going, and makes practice a lot of fun.\"\n\nCashman, whose team-high 7 1/2 sacks all came over the last eight games, was put on scholarship for his junior season. He learned of the honor after a team-wide egg hunt at the facility this spring.\n\n\"It really shows where Coach Fleck's heart's at,\" Cashman said.\n\nFifth-year walk-on Justin Juenemann, the third-string kicker, was rewarded in similar fashion this week through a message shot from a T-shirt gun.\n\nThe Gophers will enter 2017 with many unproven players, notably wide receivers and defensive backs. They will ride running backs Rodney Smith and Shannon Brooks as much as they can and rely on a rich collection of linebackers to steer the defense.\n\n\"We could go 12-0 or 0-12. I'm not worried about the 'W' or the 'L,' what that looks like. I'm worried about this team doing everything they can to become their best,\" Fleck said.\n\nExtra points\n\nA judge has ordered Baylor University to turn over information -- including interview recordings and documents -- provided to a law firm hired amid a sexual assault scandal that rocked the nation's largest Baptist school.\n\nU.S. District Judge Robert Pitman in Austin ruledmaterials must be provided to attorneys representing women suing Baylor because the university had attorney-client privilege protections when it made public a summary of the law firm's investigation.\n\nChad Dunn, one attorney for the women, called the ruling a \"very important step\" in understanding what Baylor's policies were.\n\nA Baylor spokeswoman didn't immediately return a call seeking comment.\n\nBaylor faces federal lawsuits from more than a dozen women who contend school officials ignored or suppressed assault claims and fostered a rape culture within the football program.\n\n... Adidas and Nebraska have agreed to a new sponsorship deal that will funnel more than $128 million in cash and goods to the athletic department over the next 11 years.\n\nThe university's Board of Regents unanimously approved the contract extension. Adidas will pay $64 million in cash and provide $64.7 million in apparel and equipment.\n\nA 2015 agreement was to run through next June, but the new deal begins immediately. That means Adidas will pay $3.5 million in cash in 2017-18 instead of the $1 million promised under the previous agreement.\n\nAdidas has been Nebraska's apparel sponsor since 1995.\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE", "timeCrawl": "01:37:00", "sim": 0.6117647290229797, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8729922", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports", "id": 14, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "id": 30, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "id": 31, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "id": 32, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "id": 122, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "id": 319, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

For one, I'm a sucker for the videos of walk-ons who are awarded a scholarship. And secondly, this is an example where Fleck is showing that he's preaching more than football and showing it by rewarding a kid for giving and serving.\n\nWATCH...\n\nFirst of all, I really do enjoy these videos. We often forget that these guys are kids, they work a lot at their craft and have responsibilities & demands of their time like none of us experienced in college. Justin Juenemann does it while paying for school, along with many other walk-ons. And the part where he's telling his mother, that's just awesome.\n\nSecondly, it is really interesting that Fleck chose to give the recently opened scholarship to Jueneman. While one may cynically roll his/her eyes at this gesture, thinking it's easy to give away a scholarship the day after you lose a scholarship player. But the point is that there are other walk-ons who may actually end up earning playing time and contribute to the team on the field. Juenemann is likely not to be one who contributes on any regular basis barring injuries.\n\nThis scholarship was given to the back-up kicker. The Gophers now have 3 kickers on scholarship, which is very rare. This was given to him because he's a senior, he's earned it by being a leader as a servant and giving back to the community.", "timeCrawl": "22:37:00", "sim": 0.545098066329956, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-09", "id": "8284348", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "id": 31, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "id": 32, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges_and_Universities", "label": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges and Universities", "id": 143, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "id": 447, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty_Travel", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty Travel", "id": 704, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

He was preparing to do the same for new coach Jerry Kill for the first time in December 2010, when he learned that blizzard-like weather was preventing the Gophers coaches and recruits from getting to TCF Bank Stadium.\n\nCoaches asked Nicklow if he could bring it to the Bierman Field Athletic Building, and the owner of Tony's Diner drove his car four blocks in a Dinkytown whiteout.\n\nAfter the dinner, Kill and other coaches pushed Nicklow's vehicle out of the snow.\n\n\"Whatever they want,\" Nicklow said, \"I never said no.\"\n\nNicklow missed a friend's wedding in Omaha to cater for the team. He was on vacation in China when P.J. Fleck became the team's coach in January, so he came back to the United States about a week early to make sure he kept his gig.\n\nTony's Diner, before the sun rises or a customer arrives, makes breakfast for 120 -- the Gophers football team -- every day during training camp and five days per week during the season.\n\nIt's unclear if Nicklow's restaurant will remain involved with the Gophers next year when the Athletes Village will open with a dining area and nutrition center. But Nicklow is hopeful he'll continue cooking for the Gophers in some capacity. His catering for football and other Gophers sports is a financial boost and a connection to the university for a man who grew up attending Gophers football games after working at his father's steakhouse at the corner of Oak St. and Washington Ave.\n\nNicklow even prepares his body physically for the job.\n\n\"You have to go to bed and get your rest just like these guys,\" he said. \"It's not a joke.\"\n\nHats off to the cook\n\nThe diner sets up breakfast for the football team -- including a live omelet station -- seven days per week during training camp. Wilson Apuparo, a cook who started working at the restaurant when it opened in 2001, arrives as early as 3:45 a.m. to begin cooking, and he stays at the diner until about 4 p.m. Some of the menu changes daily -- such as the flavor of French toast or the type of sausage available for omelets -- but there are mainstays, including 40 pounds of hash browns.\n\nApuparo has seen one Gophers football game. He prefers to watch Minnesota United FC. The cook said he's often so tired when he comes home he doesn't even think about eating.\n\nBut in the early morning Tuesday, he moved from task to task with no break: laying French toast on the griddle; opening the oven, where ham and sausage filled all three racks; stirring grits on a stovetop. Ecuadorean music played from a speaker plugged into Apuparo's iPhone.\n\nHe is often the only person in the restaurant until about 6:30 a.m., when Nicklow and a couple of other employees arrive to pack the diner's yellow van.\n\n\"He's not just a vendor,\" former Gophers tight end Drew Goodger said of Nicklow, who prepares omelets for players. \"He's kind of a face that you always look forward to seeing.\"\n\nIn with the team\n\nNicklow said his restaurant reminded Greg Davis, a former member of the football program's video staff, of the Greek diners in Davis' hometown of Chicago. Nicklow started doing business with the Gophers about seven years ago, after a member of the team's recruiting staff asked Davis about the chicken sandwich he had delivered. He began catering recruiting dinners.\n\nOnce the NCAA approved unlimited meals for athletes in 2014, Nicklow catered breakfasts, too. Cooking for football led to working with other teams -- basketball, hockey, volleyball, swimming, wrestling.\n\n\"Those gyros,\" former punter Peter Mortell said. \"I'm starting to salivate thinking about those.\"\n\nThree years ago, Nicklow asked the team for a ticket to a game, and he received a field pass to Minnesota's win over Michigan in Ann Arbor. He said his flight to Michigan got canceled, but the trip meant enough to him to take a Greyhound bus with a midnight stop in Chicago. When the team's director of operations learned about his journey, he told Nicklow to fly back on the team plane. The diner owner calls it the greatest day of his life.\n\n\"I would have a hard time believing that relationship with Tony is going to be completely lost throughout the whole kind of transition into the Village,\" said Goodger, who joked that he ate Nicklow's pancakes for all three meals. \"It'd be a shame if it was. He's so ingrained in the program.\"\n\nCompany man\n\nThe diner creates a college town vibe for a team inside a major city. Nicklow, after so many mornings, recognizes players who step inside his restaurant. An oar signed by Fleck hangs from a wall.\n\n\"Gopher athletics and Tony kind of go hand-in-hand,\" Goodger said.\n\nNicklow has bought into the hype surrounding this year's team -- most of which is because of Fleck. He wears a \"Row the Boat\" wristband, and he said he knows the coach \"exudes that excellence he wants, that eliteness\" because Fleck once told him to make sure every Gopher thanked Nicklow for the food.\n\nHow do the current players like the food? The Gophers athletic department did not provide the Star Tribune access to the breakfast service.\n\nBefore Fleck arrived, breakfast service lasted about 90 minutes. Now, because Fleck moves at \"hyper speed,\" according to Nicklow, it's only about half an hour long.\n\nThe diner crew hastened its pace just before 7 a.m., when Nicklow began loading insulated crates of food into a yellow van. He and Apuparo threw broken-down boxes into a dumpster, and Nicklow jogged across his restaurant's back parking lot.\n\n\"All right,\" he said before hopping in the car. \"Right on time.\"", "timeCrawl": "02:58:00", "sim": 0.5411764979362488, "extractedDates": [{"date": "2010-12-", "textStart": 286, "amb": false, "textEnd": 299}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-10", "id": "8309060", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "id": 31, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "id": 32, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "id": 447, "wgt": 100}], "details": {"liCnt": 65}}

Much of that is because he is a compact 292 pounds, powered by tree stumps for thighs and a motor that has made him one of the better defensive linemen in the country.\n\n\"I'm glad he's on our side, let's put it that way,\" said Gophers defensive coordinator Robb Smith, who is coaching Richardson for the first time. \"He's made strides even from the spring to where is now in terms of learning the system and mastering the system.\"\n\nRichardson enters his final season with the Gophers on the watch lists for Outland Trophy (outstanding interior lineman) and Bronko Nagurski Trophy (national defensive player of the year). He's coming off a junior season in which he had 31 tackles, a team-leading 11 tackles for loss and seven sacks. His presence helped the Gophers hold opponents to 3.4 yards per rush, which ranked among the nation's top 20.\n\nWhat's also impressive is the steam he's getting from the analytics crowd.\n\nPro Football Focus lists Richardson second to Houston sophomore Ed Oliver as the highest-rated interior defensive player. And Richardson's 41 quarterback pressures from last year are the most among returning Big Ten defensive tackles, PFF reports. Michigan's Maurice Hurst, with 34, is a distant second. The website also lists him as No. 4 on its list of top returning Big Ten players.\n\nRichardson credits much of his success to the fact he is short compared with other linemen.\n\n\"The height I use to my advantage, because a lot of D linemen have a hard time just getting low,\" he said. \"That's the main key to being a good defensive lineman, and I'm already built that way.\"\n\nAdded Smith: \"He plays with unbelievable leverage. ... They call him a 'Stove' for a reason.\"\n\nGophers coach P.J. Fleck sees an improving player.\n\n\"He's playing at higher level than I've seen him play at,\" Fleck said. \"He's leading a lot more, opening his mouth a lot more, making other people around him better. ... He's taking care of his body at an all-time high, and you're seeing the finished product on the field.\"\n\nProving them wrong\n\nRichardson making an impact on the field is nothing new. Nor is people underestimating him.\n\nAt Mount Carmel High School in Chicago, he helped lead the Caravan to back-to-back state championships in 2012 and '13. Yet the Gophers, under then-coach Jerry Kill, were the only Power Five conference team to offer him a scholarship. His other FBS offers came from Northern Illinois and Western Michigan.\n\nHis lack of height, of course, had a lot to do with that.\n\nRichardson speaks softly and deliberately off the field, but he let it be known there was a bur under his saddle regarding the recruiting process after last year's game against the Chicago area's Big Ten team.\n\nAfter Richardson had two sacks and forced a fumble in the Gophers' 29-12 victory over Northwestern last year, he deliciously tweeted: \"Hey, @Northwestern am I still too short to play Big Ten football?\"\n\nBut he says he's put that type of motivation in the past, instead focusing on the upcoming season.\n\n\"With these coaches, you're not allowed to really have a chip on your shoulder,\" he said of Fleck and his staff. \"You just play your best ball and everything will work out for you.\"\n\nRichardson made an immediate impact with the Gophers as a true freshman, starting 12 of 13 games and collecting 23 tackles, six tackles for loss and two sacks. He increased those totals to 26 tackles, eight for loss, and 3.5 sacks as a sophomore, and had 31 tackles, a team-leading 11 for loss, and seven sacks last year on the way to third-team All-Big Ten honors.\n\nHe estimates he was double-teamed about \"95 percent of the time\" last year. \"You do [get frustrated], but it's just part of the job. You just stay low and get through it.\"\n\nRichardson has adjusted to the new scheme and philosophy from Smith. Honing his hand-fighting skills has been a priority.\n\n\"His teaching style is a lot like Coach Fleck, very energetic and demanding,\" Richardson said. \"But what I learned from him is getting my hands up quicker.\"\n\nSpeaking up\n\nAlong with his performance on the field, Richardson has stepped forward to become a leader for Fleck.\n\n\"It's an entirely different way that he coaches,\" Richardson said, comparing Fleck's style with that of predecessor Tracy Claeys. \"It's a lot of energy he's brought to this complex. ... It's definitely brought out a leadership role for me.\"\n\nSophomore defensive lineman Winston DeLattiboudere sees the changes in Richardson's role as a mentor.\n\n\"Steve Richardson has been a leader since I got here, but he hasn't been as vocal until now,\" DeLattiboudere said. \"Coach Fleck really tries to get you to pull the vocalness out of you so you can be a leader both by your actions and how you speak to other people.\"\n\nAnd Richardson will put those leadership skills to use for one final season with the Gophers.\n\n\"It's definitely gone fast. I'd love to go back to my freshman year. I always think about it -- the memories on the football field and off it,\" he said. \"I'm going to cherish this last fall camp and everything that goes into it. ... With the way everybody's working out here, I see some great things coming.''", "timeCrawl": "02:03:00", "sim": 0.4980392158031464, "extractedDates": [{"dateEnd": "-06-04", "date": "-06-02", "textStart": 395, "amb": false, "textEnd": 405}, {"textStart": 72, "date": "2017-08-11", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 79}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8862409", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "id": 319, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "id": 487, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

For the Gophers, Nichol is the intersection of where encouraging shouts in the weight room meets the calming salutation \"namaste\" on the yoga mat.\n\n\"Breathing is where you are gonna grow,\" Nichol explained to the Pioneer Press in hushed tones. \"Let the body relax and stretch out and mobilize.\"\n\nOne of the many coaching tools new head coach P.J. Fleck has brought from Western Michigan to Minnesota is the concept of Zen Wednesdays.\n\nEach week, the players go through different stations. They use foam rollers and balls to work out muscle tightness. They strap on elastic bands to isolate and activate other muscles. They go through yoga positions and pilates moves to improve balance, flexibility and core muscle strength.\n\nThe players also slip into a dark room to meditate with soothing music playing in the background. They don't utter mantras.\n\n\"You get to really focus on yourself and your body,\" junior running back Rodney Smith said.\n\nWhen Nichol joined Fleck for their first year at Western Michigan in 2013, the Broncos had a rash of injuries and surgeries decimating the roster. That's when Fleck said they started \"doing our homework\" on yoga, pilates, rest and relaxation.\n\n\"I believe in mind, body, spirit,\" Fleck said. \"I believe in that all being aligned, and it's about the player.\"\n\nWhen Fleck and his staff arrived in Minnesota this winter, he inherited a roster with 22 players rehabbing injuries and surgeries. He and Nichol plugged in a similar, crafted formula that helped Western Michigan improve from 1-11 in 2013 to 13-1 and the Cotton Bowl last season.\n\n\"(Nichol was) one of the main reasons, might be one of the sole reasons, why we had so much success at our last stop,\" Fleck said.\n\nTo help minimize injuries in a violent sport, the Gophers aren't alone in incorporating yoga. Big Ten powers Michigan and Ohio State have conducted similar sessions the past two years. Notre Dame coach Brian Kelly incorporates yoga into his daily regime, and Kansas has implemented it.\n\nIn 2014, the former Gophers staff added it to summer workouts after seeing what it did for the Seattle Seahawks, which added a yoga program before their run to a Super Bowl title.\n\nIn the new, under-construction football performance center, former coach Tracy Claeys had a 1,000-square-foot additional space adjacent to the main weight room set aside for additional weight equipment and cardio machines.\n\nWhen Fleck was hired in January, he decided to use that space for yoga, pilates, stretching and meditation. A sound system in the weight room will carry into the space, providing a calming atmosphere for yoga.\n\nGophers offensive tackle Donnell Greene, who is 6-foot-7 and 320 pounds, \"didn't really get the point\" of the yoga and extensive stretching when it was introduced last winter. That's before he was one of only four healthy offensive lineman during some spring practices in April.\n\n\"Taking all those plays, I (now) love doing the yoga and every stretch I can,\" Greene said. \"It made me feel a lot better.\"\n\nDefensive tackle Steven Richardson, a third-team all-Big Ten honoree in 2016, estimated that he faces double teams from opponents on 95 percent of snaps during the season. He said the pre-camp preparations have set him up for a strong senior season.\n\n\"I'm a stout kind of guy and my muscles get tight, and yoga seemed to help out a lot,\" said Richardson, who is generously listed 6 feet, 292 pounds. \"I haven't felt this well in a long time.\"\n\nAfter practices, the Gophers break up into position groups to use the foam rollers on their achy muscles, undergoing coordinated stretching routines on the field before stiffness can set in.\n\nWhile players have put in long hours, sometimes from 6 a.m. to 10:45 p.m. during camp, they rest on Sundays and only do walk-throughs on Wednesdays.\n\n\"It's extremely important in how we build these guys,\" Nichol said. \"If you break them down, you have to build them back up and recover.\"", "timeCrawl": "17:16:00", "sim": 0.47843137383461, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8821583", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "id": 485, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Yoga", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Yoga", "id": 1584, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Fleck on his Sunday morning WCCO Radio appearance said that both Demry Croft and Conor Rhoda \"did a lot of really good things'' during Saturday's scrimmage, but neither has won the starting job as the Aug. 31 season opener against Buffalo approaches.\n\n\"There still hasn't been that one guy who's said, 'This is my job. I do this way better than the other guy,' '' Fleck said.\n\n\"The decision is getting tougher because they are both improving,'' Fleck added. \"... Hopefully we'll be able to make that decision in a reasonable time coming up.''\n\nSaturday's scrimmage, which was closed to the public and media, ran about 130 plays. \"We had to be able to get our young kids reps,'' Fleck said \"We had to put our quarterbacks in a lot of tough situations.''\n\nFleck emphasized that being decisive and avoiding turnovers will be key for whichever quarterback wins the starting job. \"The teams that usually are at the top of their divisions, they win the turnover margin,'' he said. \"... Whenever the quarterback touches [the ball] every single play, the decisions he makes, decisively, end up being the difference of the season.''\n\nOverall, Fleck was pleased with the scrimmage.\n\n\"I'm really proud of the progress we've made,'' he said. \"Does it mean we're fifth-year seniors across the board and we have depth everywhere? No. But we've gotten better since the beginning of training camp to now.''\n\nNotes\n\n** Fleck lauded true freshman receiver Demetrius Douglas for his performance in the scrimmage.\n\n\"He has been outstanding,'' Fleck. \"... Incredible leader. It looks like he's been here three years.''\n\n** Fleck liked what he saw from true freshman Rey Estes at cornerback and expects the former quarterback to provide needed depth in the secondary. The coach also said Justus Harris, another true freshman, could help at nickelback.\n\n** Fleck on true freshman offensive tackle Blaise Andries: \"If we can play him, and he's going to play [extensively], we'll play him. You never want to play a kid to kind of be a backup and he plays the ninth game one rep.''\n\nFleck sees Andries improving while taking his lumps. \"He's gotta get used to getting his butt kicked at times but also knowing to look at it from the positive side,'' he said.\n\nOlder Post Gophers kicker Juenemann enjoys 'whirlwind' 24 hours", "timeCrawl": "18:00:00", "sim": 0.7254902124404907, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 291, "date": "2017-08-31", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 298}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8950248", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "id": 51, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre", "id": 114, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "id": 284, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Sound_Files", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Sound Files", "id": 922, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job_Search", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job Search", "id": 948, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}], "page": 1, "pages": 21, "totalResults": 21}}}

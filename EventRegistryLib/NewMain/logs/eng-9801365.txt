(WMC) - Tuesday is \"National Night Out\" in Memphis and other parts of the country.\n\nIt's a national campaign in which communities and police departments all over the country come together to find ways to control crime and build better trust.\n\nThe goal of National Night Out is to make our neighborhoods safer and more caring places to live.\n\nAccording to the Memphis Shelby Crime Commission, the overall crime rate is down in Memphis by 14% compared to this time last year.\n\nViolent crime was down by almost 10% and major property crime was down by over 22%.\n\nAccording to the Crime Commission, the recidivism rate for juvenile crime was up by 3.7% in just the first quarter of 2024.\n\nMPD says 124 juveniles and 102 adults between the ages of 18 and 20 were arrested for auto theft during that time frame.\n\nIn hopes of bringing numbers down even more, the National Night Out campaign hosted these neighborhood block parties, cookouts, and youth events to build a better bond between law enforcement and the community.\n\n\"It's already crazy out here,\" said Memphis resident James McClora. \"Imagine what it would be like without them.\"\n\nMcClora has been living in Memphis for nearly 70 years.\n\nHe says he wants to see more police in his neighborhood, and National Night Out is his chance to show them some support.\n\n\"I've never had a bad run, so we need to get back to the community and the police working together to get our neighborhood back,\" said McClora.\n\nMemphis' Bethel Grove, Castalia Heights, Cherokee and Orange Mound neighborhoods are areas hit hard by violent crime this year.\n\n\"It can't just be us responding to bad situations all the time. It has to be us in the schools,\" said Airways station Colonel Andrew Brown. \"It has to be us in the community, being seen in a positive light, checking on our elderly, checking on her young folks, being seen as humans first of all. And then being seen as protectors.\"\n\nOfficer Destine Yos says it's important to connect Memphis' Asian American community with police as well.\n\n\"They really appreciate our presence in the community, not just as police officers, but also as members of the community itself,\" Yos said.\n\nMemphis' Tillman station patrols Binghampton, the outskirts of Midtown, East Memphis and the University of Memphis area.\n\nStudents like UofM women's basketball forward Bailey Gilmore believe community involvement is the key to moving Memphis forward.\n\n\"A big part of making the community better is just showing that we're here for one another, and I also believe that social media paints a bad light on Memphis and people just automatically believe this is a bad city to live in, but I think it's very important to bring Memphis in a positive light and uplift each other,\" she said.\n\nResidents say events like this can bring neighbors together, but it takes an effort from everyone to make the community better.\n\n\"It's not just District Attorney Mulroy's duty,\" said Memphis resident and MPD ambassador Leverne Gray. \"It's not the police. It's like they say: if you see something, say something.\"\n\nThe manager for the city's neighborhood watch program is hoping to get from 500 active programs to 1,000.\n\nClick here to sign up for our

Their respective journeys brought them home.\n\nRubin's journey is a testament of unwavering commitment. A three-star cornerback in the class of 2019, the 5-foot-11, 190-pound Rubin chose the Tigers out of White Station over multiple SEC schools, citing his plethora of family having attended Memphis and familiarity with the program that stretched back years.\n\nRubin made 11 starts, recorded 58 tackles and had a team-best 14 pass breakups as a freshman. He's ignored NIL and transfer portal temptations in his four years at Memphis, but as a preseason third-team All-AAC selection, he believes he's grown most as a vocal leader.\n\n\"Before, I've kind of stepped the back, even though I was playing, I'd just play my role,\" said Rubin. \"But now, stepping up, verbally, leading the young guys, and even the vets. Just trying to put the team together and be able to do whatever I can to make us the best team we can imagine.\"\n\nHamilton's path to Memphis was multi-directional but equally compelling. Committing to Ohio State from Whitehaven in 2019 as a tight end, a pandemic, inconsistent playing time, and a position change led the 6-3, 265-pound Hamilton back home. It didn't hurt that he had somebody in Memphis reminding him what could be.\n\n\"We've always been tight, even when he was at Ohio State, we used to talk,\" Rubin said about his close relationship with Hamilton. \"When he came here, I felt like I was able to show and bring more people onto the Memphis culture, how Memphis folks carry themselves, and how passionate we are about this.\"\n\nIn his return home, Hamilton had conversations with former Tigers about handling the program with the proper care.\n\n\"I take that under my chin every day, leaving my legacy behind, and respecting players before me that I know history about,\" said Hamilton. \"They're the ones that really established Memphis, and I've gotta keep that going. I talked to Calvin Austin a bit, through Instagram, and whenever he comes through the facility, and, he tells me how much he loves and cares for Memphis. He told me, 'I'm giving you the keys.' So, like, really own it. Yeah, you're from Memphis, but you didn't start off here. We established Memphis, and we want you to keep that going.\"\n\nHamilton's time with the Tigers has been nothing short of impactful. In two years since transferring, Hamilton has 6.5 sacks and 77 tackles in his 23 starts. However, what he values most is his ability to communicate the ethos and principles of the city to his teammates.\n\n\"What I do, is more so a culture thing. Letting everybody know, what Memphis really is, and how being in Memphis and knowing the history of the university and the people that came through here (is connected),\" said Hamilton. \"Letting them know, like this is really a grind city. People say that, but, if you're not from Memphis, you're not gonna feel it for real. Like whatever you do, you have to get it out the mud.\"\n\nRubin echoed Hamilton's sentiment.\n\n\"You ask anybody from Memphis about Memphis, and people may say this and that about the city,\" said Rubin. \"But, if you're from Memphis, you know what this means, what the city means to us, and what we do for each other.\"", "source": {"uri": "commercialappeal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Commercial Appeal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton,_Ontario", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamilton, Ontario"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hamilton, Ontario"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Memphis, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Memphis, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Silverfield", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Silverfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Station_High_School", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White Station High School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_Buckeyes_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio State Buckeyes football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southeastern Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Athletic_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Athletic Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freshman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitehaven", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Whitehaven"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Whitehaven"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_Austin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Calvin Austin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Folklore/Products_and_Services", "label": "dmoz/Society/Folklore/Products and Services", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/08/06/PMCA/74683426007-e-28-db-87-d-31-ca-46-bbaec-79-d-6-b-268-b-9823.jpg?auto=webp&crop=799,450,x0,y0&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801365", "eventUri": "eng-9801365", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

Roughly a million people live in what we might call \"Greater Memphis,\" a hub that stretches east to Germantown and Collierville, and even across state borders (and a mighty river) if we include West Memphis and Southaven. But here's the charm of a city as distinctive as Memphis, Tennessee: It's a different home for every one of us. There are residents of Midtown who feel like they need to pack a suitcase if they travel east of Highland. Likewise, some East Memphians schedule trips Downtown like a special event. What makes Memphis home for you? If you had to identify one place or thing that makes the Bluff City singular, what would it be?\n\nWe asked eight writers to define \"My Memphis\" in a single essay. While it's impossible to answer such a challenge on a single page, it's a start. And we hope it reminds you of a place (or thing) that makes this amazing city your home too. Feel free to share your version of \"My Memphis\" with us.\n\nSymbols are important to a city, and this is especially the case with public statues. Memphis could not become the city it strives to be until statues of Jefferson Davis and Nathan Bedford Forrest -- icons of the Confederacy -- came down. And they finally did in December 2017. Less than four years later, on October 28, 2021, a new statue was unveiled on the South Campus at the University of Memphis. Rising for a jump shot in his bronze prime as a Tiger basketball player is Larry Finch. The centerpiece of what we now call Larry Finch Plaza, the statue makes Memphis a better version of itself, and lifts me with every glance I take. A drive to the airport -- south on Getwell, right by this plaza -- has become a new kind of joy.\n\nThe plaza includes four weatherproof panels with photos and descriptions of Finch at various stages: \"The Beginning,\" \"The Player,\" \"The Coach,\" and \"The Leader.\" It's a reminder of how one life can lift so many others, whether it's near a basketball court or not.\n\nPlans for the commemoration were announced by University of Memphis president David Rudd in the fall of 2018, only to have a pandemic interrupt and delay construction. But there's something perfectly cosmic about the last man to wear number 21 as a Tiger being saluted in the year 2021, shortly before his alma mater's basketball season began. Current Tiger coach Penny Hardaway -- an All-America player during Finch's days as head coach -- needed several minutes to catch his breath for remarks before a gathering of friends and supporters at the unveiling. We lost Finch much too soon, in 2011, but Larry Finch Plaza brings a form of life and yes, chokes up those of us impacted by the man's 60 years in Memphis.\n\nThe plaza includes four weatherproof panels with photos and descriptions of Finch at various stages: \"The Beginning,\" \"The Player,\" \"The Coach,\" and \"The Leader.\" It's a reminder of how one life can lift so many others, whether it's near a basketball court or not. (For some perspective, consider that Hardaway was older when he coached his first college game than Larry Finch was when he coached his last.) But the statue itself -- sculpted by William Behrends -- is the jaw-dropper. In full flight, Finch has the basketball primed for release, his eyes on the target, as confident as all his fans that two points will follow.\n\nI like to sit on the brick bench that surrounds the statue, little more than 100 yards from the Laurie-Walton Family Basketball Center where Hardaway now trains players with hopes of approximating Larry Finch's glorious time in blue and gray. This is where symbols are also important. We must live in the moment, all of us. All the while steering our hopes and dreams toward a future mostly unknown. But when the right kind of man -- even that man's statue -- reminds us how high we might jump ourselves? Well, that target seems closer than ever.", "source": {"uri": "memphismagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Memphis magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "frank_murtaugh@memphismagazine.com", "name": "Frank Murtaugh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Finch", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Larry Finch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Memphis, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Memphis, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Memphis", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Memphis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis_metropolitan_area", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Memphis metropolitan area"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germantown,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germantown, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Germantown, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collierville,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Collierville, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Collierville, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southaven,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southaven, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southaven, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Memphis,_Arkansas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Memphis, Arkansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Memphis, Arkansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_Hardaway", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penny Hardaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Bedford_Forrest", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nathan Bedford Forrest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_shot_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jump shot (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Davis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jefferson Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alma_mater", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alma mater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-America", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://memphismagazine.com/downloads/37145/download/FinchPlaza.jpeg?cb=b6e0dc968fe24ec2d22a7bc2d8fe393c&w=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801365", "eventUri": "eng-9801365", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-12-", "textStart": 1425, "textEnd": 1438}], "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

Defendants are generally expected to pay 10% of their bail to a bonding company for their release from jail. But Frederick Agee, district attorney for Tennessee's 28th judicial district, said bonding companies are allowed by state law to charge much less, and historically, there's been no accountability for those companies when a defendant misses court. The Daily Memphian located five local companies that are charging less. Among them is Tiger Bonding, and the company's vice president, Andrew Banyon, said the low rates are often a defendant's only option and that their families are expected to put up collateral, usually wages or property, to get their loved ones out of jail.\n\nNeed a flight out of here, like, today?

The Celtics' 17 championships are currently tied with the Los Angeles Lakers for the most in the history of the 77-year-old NBA.\n\n\"We only hang NBA championship banners, right? Seventeen of them,\" Tatum said. \"Some of the greatest players to ever play this game wore this uniform. All of us are honored to follow in their footsteps, the way they paved for us to live out our dream.\n\n\"Essentially, if you want to be one of the greats to put on this uniform, every great before you won a championship. That's what we try to play for every single season. The expectations are obviously different here. It takes special players to be here and to be a part of an environment like that.\"\n\nSwitching sides\n\nTatum, fellow Celtics forward Jaylen Brown and center Al Horford remain as the top players on the Celtics roster who also were present during their previous playoff runs over the last seven years. Five of their previous six postseason trips ended without trips to the NBA Finals. They lost to the Golden State Warriors in six games during their last title series appearance in 2022.\n\n\"We've been able to go through the experiences of having success, but not having success at the same time,\" Brown said. \"I think to solidify the ultimate goal is to get over the hump and win. I think that will add a lot to our legacy. But as of right now, that story is kind of still untold.\"\n\nThe told aspects are the narrative include other major changes to both the Celtics and Mavericks rosters -- but the names are very familiar.\n\nGrant Williams, Marcus Smart, Malcolm Brogdon, Terry Rozier, Robert Williams and Marcus Morris are among the players who were previously part of the Celtics' runs, but now play elsewhere. Another former Celtics star, Kyrie Irving, is now leading the Mavericks with his championship-caliber experience.\n\n\"His leadership is amazing,\" Mavericks All-NBA guard Luka Doncic said of Irving. \"The way he connects us. I think me and Kyrie are the leaders of this team, but he's the one that's been in the Finals. He's the one that won in the Finals. He's the one that is really leading it. He's keeping us all together and motivated.\"\n\nThe Celtics also roster a former Mavericks contributor, with center Kristaps Porzingis set to face his former team in the NBA Finals. Tatum and his teammates have also said the off-season addition of Jrue Holiday, an NBA champion in 2021, has largely improved their depth.\n\n\"They've gotten tremendously better,\" Irving said of the Mavericks. \"They've led their team to this point. So I'm proud of them. I'm looking forward to the competition because this is what we've all strived for since we were kids, basketball at this level playing against the best of the best.\n\n\"They have a great team over there, led by a great coach. So we're going to be in for a great series, hard, tough series. They're going to give us their best. I know they're not going to slow down when they see me. They're going to come at me even more. This is what I've been preparing for since last summer or when our season ended last year of putting in the time to prepare for moments like this.\"\n\nDoncic piled up personal accolades during his first five seasons in the league, but also went to the Western Conference finals just once through his first three postseason appearances. Irving's presence, paired with newcomer P.J. Washington and Williams -- another former Celtics contributor -- helped lead the Mavericks back to the NBA Finals for the first time since 2011.\n\nWho and how to watch\n\nThe favored Celtics also are 6.5-point favorites to win Game 1. Tatum, who is averaging 26 points per game this postseason, is the leading contender to claim NBA Finals MVP honors.\n\nDoncic, who led the NBA with 33.9 points per game this season and logged 28.8 points per game this postseason, Irving and Brown are among the other players sportsbooks expect to vie for the hardware.\n\nThe Celtics beat the Mavericks (50-32) in both of their regular-season matchups. Doncic logged triple-doubles in both Mavericks losses. He first totaled 33 points, 13 assists and 18 rebounds in a 119-110 setback Jan. 22 in Dallas. He later recorded 37 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists in a 138-110 loss March 1 in Boston.\n\nThe Celtics outshot the Mavericks 46% to 44% and 55% to 46% in those respective meetings.\n\n\"This is the best of the best at the highest level,\" Mavericks coach Jason Kidd said of the NBA Finals matchup. \"It's fun. That's what the Finals are all about, is seeing what team is going to step forward and take advantage of mistakes.\"\n\nThe least expensive tickets for Game 1 were about $550, before taxes, on the secondary market as of Thursday morning. The most-expensive tickets were listed for in excess of $35,000. Ticket prices for Game 3 in Dallas range from about $670 to more than $45,000.\n\nFor those who don't travel to the games, ABC will follow its Thursday broadcast at 8 p.m. Sunday with Game 2 in Boston. Respective Game 3 and Game 4 broadcasts will air at 8:30 p.m. Wednesday and June 14 from Dallas. Game 5, if necessary, will be at 8:30 p.m. June 17 in Boston.\n\nGame 6 will be at 8:30 p.m. June 20 in Dallas. Game 7 is set for 8 p.m. June 23 in Boston.", "source": {"uri": "miamiherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Miami Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_butler@miamiherald.com", "name": "Alex

What many did not expect was for the Dallas Mavericks to evolve into one of the most solidified teams in the league. The Mavs made excellent moves to bring in Daniel Gafford and PJ Washington at the trade deadline, but the story for this group has been the backcourt duo of Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving, a duo many are calling the most dynamic pairing in NBA history. Now, on the verge of the 2024 NBA Finals beginning, we are given a matchup that features several storybook-like headlines.\n\nJayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are looking to end all the criticism that surrounds them by claiming their first championship. Porzingis will be facing the Mavs, with whom he spent three seasons. Irving will head back to Boston, where he is public enemy No. 1 after leaving the organization for the Brooklyn Nets in 2019. There is also a spotlight being cast on Doncic, as he can cement his legacy as one of the greatest international players this league has ever seen with his first championship and NBA Finals MVP award at just 25 years old.\n\nIf there is one thing that is apparent before this series even begins, it is that this championship means a lot to both organizations. Whereas the Celtics are looking to claim the 18th title in team history and their first since 2008, the Mavericks are looking to capture their second championship in franchise history. In doing so, Dallas would become the 12th team in the league with multiple titles.\n\nFunny enough, the last time the Mavs won the NBA Finals, Jason Kidd was helping lead the way next to Dirk Nowitzki, who many tend to call the greatest international player ever. Now, Kidd has a chance to lead Dallas to their second championship, only this time he is their head coach and may be witnessing the start of Doncic's reign as the greatest basketball player from Europe.\n\nThe 2024 NBA Finals are about to begin, and there is still a lot to discuss regarding this championship series. Only four wins separate one of these two teams from the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy, but there will be nothing easy about staking claim to four victories. So much can happen over the course of the next two weeks, and these five factors will directly influence whether the Celtics or Mavericks win the 2024 NBA Finals.\n\nWho is going to guard Luka Doncic?\n\nThis isn't just a question the Celtics have pondered since advancing to the NBA Finals, but a question the entire league has been trying to figure out for quite some time. Quite simply, there is no stopping Luka Doncic. He has earned the right to be called one of the best players in the league, and he is going to put up impressive numbers every time he takes the court. You can't stop greatness, yet you can look to contain it.\n\nThat has to be Boston's mindset regarding Luka in this series.\n\nIf the Celtics let Doncic have his way in one-on-one situations, regardless of who is guarding him, he is going to have 30-point, possibly even 40-point, nights. Not to mention, he's capable of registering a triple-double in any game, which would be bad news for the Celtics, seeing as he would be getting others involved on offense, specifically from the perimeter.\n\nThe Mavericks' offense operates out of pick-and-roll sets where Doncic is the decision-maker with the ball in his hands. Jrue Holiday, Derrick White, and Jaylen Brown may all take turns guarding Doncic, but the premise of the Celtics' defense must be focused on doubling Luka on every single pick-and-roll set. If Boston fails to do so and they opt to play one-on-one, they will be playing with fire.\n\nThere is no right way to guard Doncic. You can't force him to one side over the other, and you can't extend too far out on him because of his ability to throw lobs towards the rim for Daniel Gafford and Dereck Lively II. The key for the Celtics is simply being physical with him and setting a defensive tone early on. Doncic is never shy about voicing his opinions to the officials, so if the Celtics can get under his skin and be smart with their fouls against him, they will be able to set a physical tone for the entire series.\n\nBoston has the capability to switch everything on Doncic, as well as double him and recover in the half-court. This must be the mindset to begin Game 1 on Thursday night.\n\nThe battle of the glass\n\nThe Celtics ranked first in defensive rebounding and second in total rebounds during the regular season. The Mavericks, during the playoffs, have ranked fourth in offensive rebounding and total rebounds. If you aren't following along with what is being said here, let me make it very simple: Rebounding is going to play a huge role in how this series plays out.\n\nEn route to the NBA Finals, the Celtics have lost just two games. Coincidentally enough, they were outrebounded in both of these losses. Although they were without Kristaps Porzingis for a vast majority of the playoffs, the fact of the matter is that Boston can be vulnerable on the glass against physical teams.\n\nWell, Lively and Gafford have been putting in work on the glass, as have PJ Washington and Derrick Jones Jr. The Mavs, although the numbers may not say so, are a talented rebounding team that can create second- and third-chance scoring opportunities. With Doncic and Irving waiting to hunt their shots, this is something the Celtics cannot have happen.\n\nOn the flip side, the Mavs must find a way to crash the offensive glass in this series because the Celtics are too talented of an offense to go possession-for-possession with.\n\nJaylen Brown must lead Celtics' offense\n\nAs good as Jayson Tatum is, he has disappeared in big moments before. Tatum struggled in the 2022 NBA Finals against the Golden State Warriors, and he did not have that great of performances against the Miami Heat in the 2023 Eastern Conference Finals. While he has really looked good in the postseason to this point, the Mavericks are going to do everything they can to get the ball out of Tatum's hands.\n\nThat is why Jaylen Brown must step up and continue to lead the Celtics' offense in this NBA Finals series against the Mavs. Brown, one of the better two-way players in the league, was recently named Eastern Conference Finals MVP over Tatum after averaging 29.8 points and 5.0 rebounds per game while shooting 51.7 percent from the floor against the Indiana Pacers.\n\nHe also shot 37 percent from three-point range. With the ability to put the ball on the ground and get to his spots, Brown has been rolling as of late as a scorer.\n\nThis kind of efficiency will help set the Celtics apart from the Mavericks in the championship series.\n\nCeltics' struggles winning back-to-back home games\n\nThe Celtics went 64-18 this season. Boston was by far the best team at home this year, with a 37-4 record in TD Garden. This has been the case over the last few seasons, as the Celtics always do a great job at defending their home floor.\n\nHowever, that has not been the case in the playoffs. In fact, the Celtics have put together back-to-back wins on their home floor, without a road game in between, just three times in their last 10 playoff series dating back to 2022. Only one of these back-to-back home wins has come past the first round of the playoffs, this season in the Eastern Conference Finals against the Pacers.\n\nFor some odd reason, the Celtics have had trouble winning two straight playoff games on their home court, which doesn't bode well for them against a Mavericks team that was 25-16 on the road this season and has won seven of their nine road playoff games this year.\n\nDefending their home court is going to be critical for both teams in this series, as that is where the momentum can sway for two very even teams. Should the Celtics win Game 1 and lose Game 2 on their home floor, they will be in trouble heading to Dallas for two games.\n\nKristaps Porzingis' health\n\nOf course, one of the main talking points heading into the 2024 NBA Finals is Kristaps Porzingis' calf injury. Porzingis has not played since April 28, when he suffered a right soleus strain in Game 4 against the Miami Heat.\n\nAlthough there was a sense of optimism that he would be able to return against the Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals, the Celtics elected to keep him sidelined and get extra time to rest before the NBA Finals.\n\nNow, all indications point in the direction of Porzingis being healthy enough to start Game 1 on Thursday night. This is a huge deal for Boston simply because of how the star big man has helped evolve their play on both offense and defense. Aside from being able to knock down shots after setting screens in pick-and-roll sets, Porzingis is great at getting to his spots in the mid-range area and hitting jumpers. As a result, this opens up more driving opportunities for Brown and Tatum since opposing teams need to stay linked to Porzingis and respect his shooting abilities.\n\nOn defense, Porzingis has been the Celtics' anchor. He not only averaged 1.9 blocks per game during the regular season, but teams think twice about driving to the rim when Porzingis is standing in the paint. The Latvian big man's ability to alter shots and force his opponents in other directions makes Jrue Holiday and Derrick White even stronger perimeter defenders than they already are.\n\nPorzingis is the ultimate X-factor in this series for the Celtics. If he is available for every game, Dallas is going to have a hard time matching up with him because they won't want Dereck Lively II or Daniel Gafford hanging out on the perimeter, as this leaves no rim protection in the paint defensively. It may be a longshot, but Porzingis claiming the Finals MVP award may not be as crazy as it sounds right now if Boston goes on to defeat Dallas.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType":

A series win would mark the Celtics' 18th championship, breaking a tie with the Los Angeles Lakers for most in NBA history, but their first since 2008. A championship win would be the Mavericks' second in franchise history.\n\nThe series is expected to potentially get fiery. Irving previously played for the Celtics during the 2017-2019 seasons, but left a year after vowing to re-sign with the team.\n\nHe returned to Boston's home court as a Brooklyn Net for a playoff game in 2021, when a Boston fan was accused of throwing a water bottle at him and was arrested. During the 2022 playoff series between the two teams, the league fined Irving $50,000 for flipping off Celtics fans.\n\nIrving said recently he has grown since those incidents and looks forward to some competitive play against Boston.\n\n\"I'm built for these moments, to be able to handle circumstances like that, and I've been able to grow since then,\" he said after a recent practice session, according to Mavs.com. \"So of course it's going to be a hectic environment, but I'm looking forward to it and I see it as a healthy relationship that I have with the fans. I almost think about 'Gladiator,' just winning the crowd over. It is good to hear the TD Garden silent when you're playing well. They still respect great basketball.\"\n\nHere's everything to know about the 2024 NBA Finals between the Boston Celtics and the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nThe NBA Finals begin Thursday, June 6.\n\nThe series will be broadcast on ABC beginning 8 p.m. ET or 8:30 p.m. ET, depending on the game.\n\nThe Mavericks beat the Los Angeles Clippers and the Oklahoma City Thunder 4-2 in the first and second rounds of the playoffs, respectively.

Boston possesses the tools to counter Dallas' star players, and their path to the Finals proves they are the favorite to win.\n\nThe entire roller coaster that is the NBA season leads up to one moment: the NBA Finals. That moment has come as the 2024 NBA Finals are set to kick off between the Dallas Mavericks and Boston Celtics. The other twenty-eight teams are left on the outside looking in.\n\nThis first-time matchup pins together two even-strength teams, both similar in nature and construction. But as the order of natural law pertains, only one of them can take home the prestige that is the NBA Championship.\n\nOnly one of either the Celtics or Mavericks will be the last team standing, possessing the ability to lift the trophy and banner at the end of the postseason. Although the series is expected to be even for the most part, Boston is the favorite to win the title. Here is why the Celtics will finish their mission and win the 2024 NBA Finals.\n\nRoad to the Finals How the Celtics got here\n\nIt goes without saying that the journey to the NBA Finals is not easy for any team, but the 2023-24 Celtics sure made it look so. They cruised to a record of 64-18, a mark that was seven games higher than any other team in the NBA (the Denver Nuggets and Oklahoma City Thunder finished with 57) and 14 games higher than the next Eastern team, the New York Knicks, who finished 50-32.\n\nTheir impressive record that stood out above all allowed the Celtics to lock down the number one seed in the entire NBA Playoffs, securing home court for every series. They were the first team to lock down a playoff spot, and were able to sit back and wait for their first opponent to emerge.\n\nThe Celtics pounded the Miami Heat in the first round, getting revenge on last year's Eastern Conference Finals which saw the Heat defeat Boston in seven. Granted, the Heat were without Jimmy Butler, who suffered an injury in the Play-In Game, but the reality is that the Celtics were heavy favorites anyway, and defeated Miami in five to advance to the Conference Semifinals.\n\nBoston Celtics - 2023-24 Stat Comparison\n\nCategory\n\nRegular Season\n\nPlayoffs\n\nPTS\n\n120.6\n\n111.4\n\nOPP PTS\n\n109.2\n\n101.3\n\nORTG\n\n122.2\n\n119.6\n\nDRTG\n\n110.6\n\n108.7\n\nIn the Conference Semifinals, the Celtics took the same approach towards the Cleveland Cavaliers as they did the Heat: setback threes. The Cavaliers were also not blessed by luck in the series as they lacked their best defender, Jarrett Allen, for the entire series, and their lead scorer and superstar Donovan Mitchell missed the final two games with a calf injury.\n\nBoston took advantage of Cleveland's woes as they did with the Heat, and defeated them in five to punch their ticket to the Conference Finals. They then did the exact same for the Indiana Pacers, whom they faced in the Conference Finals, as they lacked Tyrese Haliburton for the final two games of the series.\n\nDespite most of the games in that series being close, the series was overall much more lopsided. Boston ended the Pacers' season in a sweep, taking all four games including both at home and on the road, to advance to their second NBA Finals in three seasons.\n\nRoad to the Championship How the Celtics can defeat the Mavericks\n\nThe Celtics are facing a relatively unfamiliar opponent in the Mavericks. They only faced each other twice in the regular season, in which Boston won both games. The first game was played in Dallas on January 22, and the Celtics won that game by a score of 119-110. The second game was played in Boston on March 1, and the Celtics blew the Mavericks out by a score of 138-110.\n\nThat, however, was a while back, before the Mavericks hit their stride. They, of course, were always a contender, but they have elevated their game to another level in these playoffs. But head-to-head record should not be merely overlooked, and the Celtics were clearly the better team in the small sample size.\n\nAll the Celtics have done so far, from the beginning of the season to the present moment, is win. That is thanks to both the solid nature of their roster and the fact that they have not had to deal with the injury bug, aside from Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is.\n\nPorzi\u0146\u0123is, however, will most likely be returning for this series, giving Boston a huge advantage over a Mavericks team where advantages are sorely needed. He was sidelined for most of the playoffs due to a calf injury, but if he returns to his previous form, the Celtics will be able to spread the Mavericks out.\n\nThe Mavericks possess a deadly one-two in Luka Don\u010di\u0107 and Kyrie Irving that many teams simply cannot counter, but one team that can counter them is the Boston Celtics. The Celtics possess a one-two punch of their own in Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, who are averaging the same amount of points combined to Dallas' duo (51.8 points versus 51 points) in these playoffs.\n\nNBA Finals Superstar Duo Comparison (Combined Playoff Averages)\n\nCategory\n\nDon\u010di\u0107-Irving\n\nTatum-Brown\n\nPTS\n\n25.8\n\n25.5\n\nAST\n\n7.0\n\n4.2\n\nFG%\n\n46.1\n\n49.1\n\n3PT%\n\n38.2\n\n32.9\n\nThe key to the Celtics' winning the title will be their ability to continue what they have been doing all season and playoffs. The case can be made that the Celtics' path to the Finals has been \"easy\" thanks to the injured teams they had to face, but it can also be argued that the Celtics made those series look easy thanks to their sheer skill.\n\nBut what is undeniable is that the Mavericks will be the Celtics' toughest test yet. There is no stopping the Mavericks, only slowing them down, but if any team is equipped to do that, it can and will be the Celtics.

The 2024 NBA Finals will be packed with intrigue, as Kyrie Irving returns to Boston, where he played from 2017 to 2019 while Kristaps Porzingis will wear the Celtics' uniform in a return to Dallas, where he played from 2018 to 2022.\n\nA new champion will be crowned for the sixth consecutive season in the 2024 NBA Finals, tied for the longest streak without a repeat champion. This same streak was last seen from 1974 to the 1980 NBA Finals and was guaranteed this season after the reigning champions Denver Nuggets were eliminated in the Western Conference Semi-Finals.\n\nThe NBA Finals feature a matchup between two, five-time NBA All-Stars and 2023-24 and All-NBA First Team selections who are trying to win an NBA championship for the first time: Luka Don\u010di\u0107, 25, of Dallas Mavericks and Jayson Tatum, 26, of Boston Celtics.\n\nThe Celtics head coach Joe Mazzulla is the youngest head coach to make it to the NBA Finals since Bill Russell, who achieved the feat in 1969, at the age of 35. Mazzula is of the same age as Russell was in 1969. Interestingly, both coached the Boston Celtics, with the Celtics winning the championship back in 1969.\n\nThe Mavericks head coach Jason Kidd is looking to become the eighth head coach in NBA history to win a title with the same franchise as a player and a head coach, as he was the starting point guard on the title-winning Mavericks in 2011.\n\nThe NBA Finals will be broadcast on JioCinema, Sports18 - 1 (HD & SD), Sports18 - 3, Sports18 Khel, and NBA League Pass in India from 6am IST.", "source": {"uri": "socialnews.xyz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Social News XYZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_advantage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home advantage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports18", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sports18"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Mazzulla", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Mazzulla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_League_Pass", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA League Pass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Russell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bill Russell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kidd", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jason Kidd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://boxoffice.socialnews.xyz/get_ians_img.php.jpg?url=Boston+Celtics+to+face+off+against+Dallas+Mavericks+in+NBA+Finals", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 8, "textEnd": 14}], "sentiment": 0.4745098039215687, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

Writers from Dallas, Boston make their predictions - West Hawaii Today", "body": "Ahead of the NBA Finals between the Dallas Mavericks and the Boston Celtics, columnists and beat writers from The Dallas Morning News and The Boston Globe collaborated to answer several questions and predict an outcome for the series, which starts Thursday in Boston.\n\nI've been 3 for 3 in predictions over the last three series, even though I was off by one game in the second and third rounds. The Celtics will be the toughest opponent the Mavs have faced during these playoffs, and the same can be said for Boston because of Dallas' superstar backcourt and versatility on both ends of the floor. Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving are in a good rhythm, and if their offense is taken away, they can resort to a potent lob game with their two big men, Daniel Gafford and Dereck Lively II.\n\nI don't foresee many blowouts, and I think almost every game will go the distance, but I'm choosing the Mavericks in six games.\n\nTim Cowlishaw\n\nDallas goes where Luka goes, and Luka is the best player in the league today. Certainly he's the best player in the league still active. I think the Celtics can do a better job on Kyrie Irving than the Wolves did -- probably with Jrue Holiday guarding him -- but there's not that much to be done against Luka.\n\nThe teams have had a week or more to rest, and there's an extra off day in the Finals between all games except 3 and 4 here in Dallas. That's to Luka's benefit more than anyone's. The Celtics have had a soft playoff run against Miami without Jimmy Butler and others, Cleveland without Donovan Mitchell and an Indiana team that's new to the playoff hunt.\n\nBoston has been just as good as Dallas (maybe better) at closing out games, but I'll still take Doncic with the ball in his hands for the final shot over Tatum, Brown and the rest. Sometimes teams just get on a roll, and Dallas is on one. Mavericks in five.\n\nShawn McFarland\n\nCeltics in seven games. That's no disrespect to the Mavericks, either. The Celtics had the best net rating in the regular season and postseason, Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are playoff-tested, and Boston has lost just twice in three rounds.\n\nThis clearly isn't the same Mavericks team that Boston beat twice in the regular season, of course, which sets up a competitive series. Don't be surprised if Dallas takes one of the first two road games, though, to create a pivotal stretch at American Airlines Center.\n\nKevin Sherrington\n\nPicking the Mavs to beat the Celtics feels like an affront to logic. Boston was, by record, the league's best team and has been one of the best three years running. Some of us can still remember when the Mavs lost five of six after the deadline and Kidd's job seemed in jeopardy. Still like to know what all went down in that famous team meeting.\n\nEven as well as they played against Oklahoma City and Minnesota, the Mavs benefited from facing unseasoned players. Boston is a different story. But, these days, so is Dallas. I don't think the Mavs will beat the Celtics, but I'm tired of being wrong. Mavs in seven.\n\nBrad Townsend\n\nBoston was the best NBA team over the course of the season, but Dallas has been the best team of the past 2.5 months.\n\nThe Celtics' 10-day layover between games, and [Kristaps] Porzingis not having played in two months, will be factors early in the series -- along with the fact that Boston hasn't faced competition of Dallas' caliber since the regular season, as the Celtics' playoff path has been paved against injury-racked opponents.\n\nThose factors will help Dallas win one of the first two games in Boston. After that, the series will come down to the Mavericks having the series' best player, Doncic, and the series' best two closers, Doncic and Irving. Mavericks in six.\n\nChad Finn\n\nCeltics in 6. The Mavericks have the best player in the series in Luka Doncic, and the biggest wild-card in Kyrie Irving, who has been playing magnificent basketball but has some, uh, baggage with the Celtics. They are a duo to be reckoned with, capable of stealing games on their own. But they will not steal the series, because the Celtics are the better team. Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are a dynamic duo, but it's the depth and versatility of the Celtics' top six that will deliver Banner 18 to Boston, particularly the selfless backcourt duo of Jrue Holiday and Derrick White.\n\nAdam Himmelsbach\n\nCeltics in 5. I think this is the first time I've ever picked the Celtics to win a title. But it's going to happen. There's a reason they won 14 more games than the Mavericks during the regular season, and even though they've traveled a smoother road during these playoffs, they've mostly dismantled their competition.\n\nEveryone will be watching Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving and their wizardry with the basketball, but the other end of the floor will be most important, as the Celtics relentlessly hunt mismatches against both players, tiring them out in the process.\n\nChristopher L. Gasper\n\nCeltics in 6. The Celtics finally face a team with its full complement of talent. The dynamic duos of Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown and Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving cross each other out. But Boston's path to Banner 18 is strength in numbers. The Celtics have multiple players who can form a Big Three with The Jays any given night -- Jrue Holiday, Derrick White, Al Horford, and a returning Kristaps Porzingis, who like Irving is seeking Finals redemption against a former team. The Celtics margin for error and victory is simply greater than that of the peaking Mavs.\n\nDan Shaughnessy\n\nMavericks in 7. Please don't be offended. It's Jayson Tatum's time. It's Jaylen Brown's time. The Celtics have the best roster, won the most games, and are 12-2 in the playoffs. But I still don't trust them and have nightmares about Kyrie Irving winning it here.\n\nKhari Thompson\n\nCeltics in 6. The Celtics have too much depth on both ends of the floor for Dallas to match. All five starters, plus Al Horford, have shown that they can take over a game offensively. They've rolled through the first three rounds without Kristaps Porzingis. Jayson Tatum's 3-point shot isn't falling, but his game is so well-rounded that it hasn't mattered much. Stopping Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving will be a tall task, but there's arguably no team better equipped to contain them than the Celtics, who have one of the league's best defensive backcourts in Jrue Holiday and Derrick White.\n\nGary Washburn\n\nCeltics in 6. The Celtics have a deeper team, have had more than a week to prepare and appear ready for this moment. There are no excuses. They are healthy with Kristaps Porzingis returning, rested, and motivated.

For Boston, this is their second NBA Finals in three years, with an experienced team eager to finally taste victory amidst a shower of confetti.\n\nHowever, the narrative is different for Dallas. The Mavs haven't had a whiff of the championship since Dirk Nowitzki led them to triumph in 2011. Now, with European sensation Luka Doncic at the helm, they're back in the game. Kyrie Irving has been instrumental, while rookie Dereck Lively has made a name for himself alongside Daniel Gafford and P. J. Washington.\n\nREAD MORE: LeBron James' verdict on Kyrie Irving says everything about Mavericks star\n\nREAD MORE: NBA star Dennis Schroder makes professional football debut in Germany's sixth-tier\n\nAfter securing Jrue Holiday and Kristaps Porzingis in the offseason, the Celtics have ruled the 2023-24 NBA season from start to finish. But all that will be for naught if they can't cross the finish line. Here are the four players who will play a crucial role in determining the outcome of the 2024 NBA Finals:\n\nLuka Doncic\n\nIn Game 5 of the Western Conference Finals, Doncic racked up 36 points - including a staggering 20 points on 8-of-11 shooting in the first quarter alone, outscoring the entire Minnesota Timberwolves team. Impressively, this marked the second time in Doncic's budding career that he's scored 20 points in a single postseason quarter, underlining his formidable talent.\n\nLike Nowitzki in 2011, Doncic has been a powerhouse for Dallas, averaging an impressive 28.6 points, 9.6 rebounds, and 8.8 assists during this playoff run to the NBA Finals. If he keeps up these stats, the Slovenian star could become only the third player to average at least 28/8/8 in 15 or more playoff games, joining the ranks of LeBron James (2015 and 2018) and Nikola Jokic (2023).\n\nLast season, Jokic made history as the first player to lead the playoffs in points, rebounds, and assists, helping the Denver Nuggets clinch the championship. Even if Dallas doesn't win, Doncic is likely to achieve the same feat as he currently leads the playoffs in points and assists, and is just nine rebounds behind Jokic.\n\nDoncic also has the chance to become the sixth player in NBA history to win both a scoring title and a championship in the same season, following in the footsteps of Joe Fulks, George Mikan, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Michael Jordan, and Shaquille O'Neal. At just 25, Doncic is already considered one of the all-time greats and is currently enjoying an exceptional run.\n\nIf the Mavericks are to secure their second Larry O'Brien trophy, they'll need Doncic to continue his mesmerising performance - and there's no reason to believe he won't.\n\nJayson Tatum\n\nJayson Tatum, the NBA superstar who somehow manages to split opinions, is a force to be reckoned with on both ends of the court. His all-round game, including his often-underestimated passing and rebounding skills, are key to his scoring prowess.\n\nDespite facing challenges in this playoff run, Tatum remains a consistent contributor for the Celtics. He's leading the playoffs in cumulative plus-minus, with the Celtics outscoring their rivals by 141 points when he's playing.\n\nSince his rookie days seven years ago, Tatum has carried the weight of being the face of one of the NBA's most iconic teams. If he can guide Boston to their first championship in 16 years, he'll secure his place as a legend.\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US .\n\nJaylen Brown\n\nIn the 2022 NBA Finals, Jaylen Brown was the top scorer for the Celtics, averaging 23.5 points per game over the six-game series against the Golden State Warriors. He shone in the Eastern Conference Finals, scoring 40 in Game 2 as the Celtics swept the Indiana Pacers. The guard was awarded the Larry Bird Trophy, beating teammate Jayson Tatum to the honour.\n\nHowever, Brown's game isn't just about the numbers. He has a knack for stepping up in crucial moments; his three-pointer with less than six seconds left in regulation sent Game 1 against the Pacers into overtime. He also shone during the Celtics' NBA Finals loss two years ago, proving himself to be more than just Tatum's sidekick. With a roster full of stars, the Celtics have plenty of options, but they'll be counting on Brown to bring home their 18th championship.\n\nKyrie Irving\n\nKyrie Irving could potentially clinch a championship against his former team, as Boston fans gear up to give him a frosty welcome at TD Garden. Despite his turbulent tenure with the Celtics, Irving was an All-Star in both seasons he spent in Boston, having arrived after requesting a trade from the Cleveland Cavaliers. His departure to the Brooklyn Nets in free agency was far from amicable, leading to tense encounters every time he faced off against the Celtics in the playoffs.\n\nNow with the Mavs, Irving has assumed a veteran role. Since joining the team midway through last season, he's been hailed by teammates as the squad's vocal leader. The eight-time All-Star has been a revelation on the court, forming a formidable backcourt duo with Doncic that rivals some of the greatest in NBA history.\n\nThe Mavs have seen a significant improvement of 27.6 points per 100 possessions when Irving is on the court, compared to when he's off - the largest on-off differential among 52 players who've clocked at least 250 minutes in the playoffs. The influence of Irving, who famously netted a 3-pointer over Steph Curry to clinch the 2016 NBA Finals, is evident as he aims for a second championship title.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_gamble@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Andrew Gamble", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirk_Nowitzki", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dirk Nowitzki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._J._Washington", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "P.

Jayson Tatum and Co. were also expected to be here after finishing the regular season with an NBA-best 64-18 record. As for Luka Doncic and the Mavericks, they finished as the fifth seed out west.\n\nBoston remains slight favorites to come away with the franchise's 18th Larry O'Brien Trophy. Dallas is looking to win just its second NBA title after coming away with the hardware back in 2011.\n\nHere, we preview this NBA Finals series with a look at key matchups, storylines and a final prediction. But first, let's check in on the logistics.\n\nHere, we look at some key matchups for the championship round.\n\nKyrie Irving vs Jrue Holiday\n\nIf Boston is going to come away with the Larry O'Brien, it will have to limit what Irving does on offense. Luka Doncic is going to get his. We already know that. It's all about making sure no one else on the Mavericks' roster helps out.\n\nIn games that Irving has gone for 20 points or less thus far in the postseason, the Mavericks find themselves at a mere 3-3. That's where Holiday comes into play. The guard is a six-time All-NBA Defensive Team player for a reason. He also helped limit fellow point guard Tyrese Haliburton to less than 18 points per game in the Eastern Conference Finals against the Indiana Pacers.\n\nWe're pretty darn sure that Celtics head coach Joe Mazzulla will use several players in an attempt to at least contain Doncic in the 2024 NBA Finals. Derrick White will obviously play a big role in this regard.\n\nWhite actually finished second on the Celtics in defensive win shares at 3.3. However, Tatum's brilliance on that end can't be denied (4.1 defensive win shares).\n\nWe know full well that Doncic will get his. But it's all about making one of the NBA's best players more of a volume scorer than anything else.\n\nIf the Celtics can hold Doncic to roughly 40% shooting in this series, it gives them a much better chance of coming out on top.\n\nRelated: Best NBA Finals series ever\n\nAlready seen as one of the greatest players in modern NBA history, Doncic can etch his name in stone if he's able to lead Dallas to an upset win over Boston. The dude just turned 25 years old back in February. He has five All-Star appearances and five All-NBA honors to his name.\n\nA win this June could be the start of a run that will see him finish mentioned with the likes of Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, LeBron James and Stephen Curry. That really is not hyperbole.\n\nPorzingis has been sidelined since the first round of the NBA Playoffs with a right a calf strain. The big man indicated ahead of the 2024 NBA Finals that he plans to play Game 1 Thursday night. But it came with a caveat.\n\n\"Good question. I don't know. We'll see,\" Porzingis said when asked if he's 100%. \"Done a lot of work up until this point. Done everything needed to get back into playing shape. We'll see.\"\n\nEven if Porzingis is near 100%, it makes much more sense for the Celtics to keep Al Horford in the starting five. He's done a great job stretching the floor in the playoffs (35% from three-point range). This would also give the Celtics another scorer off the bench.\n\nRelated: 10 best Boston Celtics players ever\n\nWe already know that this is a major storyline heading into the 2024 NBA Finals. Irving suited up with the Celtics for two seasons from 2017-19. It did not end swimmingly with drama being the name of the game.\n\nIrving acknowledges that his stint in Boston did not paint the NBA champion in the best of lights.\n\n\"It was just a chapter in my life that I got to enjoy for the most part. We had a great opportunity to do some special things, but it was cut short, just based off personal reasons on my end.\n\nOne thing I look back on my time in Boston -- I've said this over the past few years, but somehow it gets tossed under the rug -- but the greatest thing I learned from Boston was just being able to manage not only my emotions or just what's going on on a day-to-day basis of being a leader of a team or being one of the leaders, and having young guys around you that have their own goals, but you have to learn how to put the big picture first.\"\n\nIrving also admitted that \"it's going to be hell in Boston.\" That might very well be the understatement of the year. It will be interesting to see how Irving controls his emotions within the confines of such a hostile environment.", "source": {"uri": "sportsnaut.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportsnaut.com"},

This is the sixth time in eight years the franchise has reached at least the Conference Finals and the second time in three years Boston has reached the Finals. The coveted Larry O'Brien Trophy, however, has so far eluded them.\n\nVictory in this year's Finals would give the Celtics a record-breaking 18th NBA title, taking them past the Los Angeles Lakers as the most successful franchise in the league.\n\nJayson Tatum is heading to his second Finals.\n\nJason Miller/Getty Images\n\nCritics and opponents have at times maligned the Celtics as having a soft underbelly, with key players or the team as a whole struggling in the biggest moments; both last year's shock loss to the No. 8 seed Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference Finals and Jayson Tatum's performances in the 2022 NBA Finals being examples of these concerns.\n\n\"There's a lot that myself and we can learn from that experience, being in the Finals,\" Tatum told reporters. \"This go-around is a lot different. Obviously, we've been there before and we came up short. It's a great opportunity to make it to Finals again, you don't always get a second chance.\n\n\"I'm really just looking at it as a second chance, trying to simplify things as much as we can. It's another series that we gotta win.\n\n\"Having nine days off [before the Finals] is good for your body and for everybody to get healthy, but we're in the NBA Finals and we're all so anxious and excited to play. I wish it did start a little bit earlier, so we could get after it, but we have a lot of guys of who been here before and we understand the magnitude of this moment and saying sharp, fresh and staying ready.\"\n\nBut the team has shown impressive mettle this postseason, in particular in the Conference Finals against the Indiana Pacers. Three times in that series, the Celtics found themselves down late but turned each of the games around to earn a sweep, thanks largely to series MVP Jaylen Brown.\n\nAccording to ESPN Stats and Info, the Pacers had at least a 90% win probability during the fourth quarters of Games 1, 3 and 4.\n\nJaylen Brown was voted ECF MVP.\n\nJustin Casterline/Getty Images\n\nCan Luka emulate Dirk?\n\nWhile the Celtics have been on a roll since day one, the Dallas Mavericks didn't really turn their season around until February's trade deadline.\n\nThe addition of more size and length in Daniel Gafford and PJ Washington has perfectly complimented the superstar backcourt of Luka Don\u010di\u0107 and Kyrie Irving, who have taken turns carrying the team throughout this playoff run.\n\nMeanwhile, Dereck Lively II is capping off a mightily impressive rookie season by becoming a valuable rotation piece for the Mavericks this playoff run, while Derrick Jones Jr. has grown as a player and made some huge buckets in the postseason.\n\nThough Don\u010di\u0107, who finished third in MVP voting, is still performing at a high level, a knee injury means he has struggled at times to reach the heights of the regular season; so much of Dallas' success will rest on the Slovenian's fitness and form.\n\nHead coach Jason Kidd could further cement his place in Mavericks history by leading the team to the title. It has been 13 years since Kidd helped bring the franchise its first and only Larry O'Brien trophy as a player, assisting Dirk Nowitzki in a stunning Finals win over the Miami Heat.\n\nKyrie Irving has carried the Mavericks at times with Don\u010di\u0107 struggling with injury.\n\nDavid Berding/Getty Images\n\n\"It was a tough road to get back here [the Finals],\" Irving told reporters. \"So I'm just appreciating all of the little steps that it took, appreciating all the people who helped me grow. It was a great reflection period the last couple of days just thinking about not only the past few years, but what we were able to accomplish this year in such a short period of time.\n\n\"How we galvanized the city of Dallas and our fans, and it just feels like we've got the whole world supporting us throughout this endeavor, so I'm appreciative and grateful for everything that I had to go through and everything my teammates had to go through in order to get here with me.\"\n\nFull schedule\n\nAll games are away vs. home\n\n* Game 1: Mavericks vs. Celtics, June 6 - 8:30 p.m. ET\n\n* Game 2: Mavericks vs. Celtics, June 9 - 8:00 p.m. ET\n\n* Game 3: Celtics vs. Mavericks, June 12 - 8:30 p.m. ET\n\n* Game 4: Celtics vs. Mavericks, June 14 - 8:30 p.m. ET\n\n* *Game 5: Mavericks vs. Celtics, June 17 - 8:30 p.m. ET\n\n* *Game 6: Celtics vs. Mavericks, June 20 - 8:30 p.m. ET\n\n* *Game 7: Mavericks vs. Celtics, June 23 - 8:00 p.m. ET\n\n* If needed", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matias_grez@cnn.com", "name": "Matias Grez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

Garden.\n\nMany predicted and prognosticate that the Celtics getting to the Finals following a league-best 64-18 record in the regular season.\n\nBoston held up its end of the bargain and has yet to slow down this postseason, winning 12 of 14 games with no series going beyond Game 5 so far.\n\nMeanwhile, the Mavericks have been much more battle tested, as they've pulled off the upset as the lower seed in each series, including taking down the No. 1 seed Oklahoma City Thunder in the Western Conference semifinals in six games.\n\nWill the Celtics win an NBA record 18th Larry O'Brien trophy or can the Mavericks pull off the upset and claim their second title in franchise history?\n\nHere are the betting odds, our picks and prediction on who will win the NBA championship and Finals MVP:\n\n2024 NBA Finals: What are the odds for the series heading into Game 1?\n\nWith tip-off rapidly approaching, the oddsmakers have stayed keen on keeping the Celtics as favorites to win the title.\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, Boston's a consensus -220 (Bet $220 to win $100) to be victorious in the Finals.\n\nThe cheapest price you could find for the Celtics right now on sportsbooks in New Jersey is at -210 (Bet $210 to win $200) on DraftKings Sportsbook.\n\nOn the other hand, the Mavericks have +180 (Bet $100 to win $180) consensus odds to pull off the upset.\n\nThose looking to wager in the Garden State on Dallas to emerge victorious in this series can be wagered at +190 (Bet $100 to win $190) on bet365.\n\nWhat are the betting favorites for 2024 NBA Finals MVP?\n\nOut of the two teams, there's seven combined players that the sportsbooks realistically see taking home Finals MVP.\n\nAfter Holiday at 100/1, the next closest player on the board is P.J. Washington at a whopping 500/1 odds.\n\nAs the oddsmakers' see Boston with the advantage in this series, it shouldn't come as a surprise that five of the seven players listed above (Tatum, Brown, White, Porzingis and Holiday) are on the Celtics with Doncic and Irving being the lone exceptions.\n\nCeltics vs. Mavericks: Who will win the title, Finals MVP?\n\nThis is truly a fascinating matchup of two of the best duos in the NBA with Tatum and Brown vs. Doncic and Irving.\n\nThese four, elite playmakers have each put on a show during these playoffs to get their team's to the spot now to win a championship.\n\nSo you may be asking yourself, what's the difference maker here? It's one word\n\nDepth.\n\nYes, Kyrie and Luka have displayed some of the best basketball we've seen from a backcourt in quite some time, including each of them scoring 36 points in the Game 5 closeout winner in Minnesota to win the West.\n\nAlthough, having the extra pieces flanking the dynamic duo of Tatum and Brown like a White or Holiday, who can either step up and score when needed or get a stop defensively is to me the biggest difference here.\n\nHeck, even a 38-year-old Al Horford has had two 20+ point performances over the last two rounds, including a playoff-high 23 points in a 114-111 victory over the Pacers in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference semifinals.\n\nThen you add in the fact that Boston's gaining more depth with Kristaps Porzingis, the former No. 4 overall pick by the Knicks in the 2015 NBA Draft, expected to make his return to the Celtics' lineup for Game 1 after missing the previous two series with a calf injury.\n\nThere's no denying that Irving and Doncic have been sensational, leading Dallas to its first title appearance in 13 years.\n\nWhile I anticipate the Mavericks will no doubt give Boston its hardest challenge of the postseason, it won't be enough as the Celtics take the crown, surpassing the Lakers with a 18th Larry O'Brien trophy, winning the NBA Finals in six games.\n\nWith the confetti raining down, it'll be Brown, not the heavy odds-on-favorite Tatum, who takes home the Bill Russell award, aka NBA Finals MVP, currently at 7/1 (+700) on FanDuel Sportsbook.\n\nPrediction: Celtics defeat Mavericks in six games, Brown wins

That's A Bad Idea\"", "body": "The Boston Celtics are back in the NBA Finals and looking for their 18th NBA Championship. As we approach Game 1 of the Finals, the Celtics dropped a hype video for their fans narrated by NFL and Massachusets legend, Tom Brady. The video poked fun at opposing fans who chanted 'We want Boston' en route to being eliminated,\n\n\"Really? You want Boston? Take it from me, that's a bad idea. The (Heat culture? History. Cleveland? Done for. And Indy? Over with. But us? We're still here. Right now, you're going to want anyone but Boston.\"\n\nThe Celtics are entering the NBA Finals as favorites after having put together a season with 64 regular season wins and a 12-2 Playoff record. Their Playoff success has also come without starting center Kristaps Porzingis, who will be returning to action in Game 1 of the Finals.\n\nThe Celtics are facing the Dallas Mavericks, who haven't been juggernauts all season like the Celtics have. They won just 50 games, dramatically changing their fortunes after a mid-season trade, and became the best defense in the NBA for the final quarter of the season. They are 12-5 in the Playoffs but possess arguably the best player in the series, Luka Doncic.\n\nThe Celtics didn't include a video of Mavericks fans chanting 'We want Boston,' probably because fans in Dallas haven't been engaging in that trash talk yet. But by the time the series comes to Texas in Game 3, fans might be fired up enough to talk trash against a fanbase most didn't think they'd get to face in the Finals.\n\nMagic Johnson Doesn't Want The Celtics To Underestimate The Mavericks\n\nWith the road both teams have had to the NBA Finals, many are picking the Celtics to win the series and lift the title. The Mavericks have had a more bruising time through the West and have overperformed on expectations, whereas the Celtics have been title favorites all season long and have a net rating (11.6) which is among the highest in NBA history over a season.\n\nDespite the apparent mismatch, Lakers legend Magic Johnson doesn't want the Celtics to make the mistake the 2004 Lakers did with the Pistons and underestimate their opponents.\n\n\"The Celtics are supposed to win the Series, but I've seen the team with the most talent lose before. Remember the 2004 Finals between the Lakers and Pistons? Chauncey Billups, Richard Hamilton, and Ben Wallace upset my Lakers with 4 Hall of Fame players: Kobe Bryant, Shaq, Gary Payton, and Karl Malone. They even had Horace Grant!\"\"\n\nThrough his analysis, Magic made it clear he thinks the Celtics have a larger roster advantage, backing the Celtics to win.\n\n\"The Mavericks definitely have an opportunity to win the championship as the team that's hot right now and playing with a lot of confidence and swagger! Luka and Kyrie won't have the same luxury of resting on defense like they did against the Timberwolves, because every starter on the Celtics team is a scoring threat.\"\n\n\"Another big difference in this series is Dallas can't afford for Luka and Kyrie to get into foul trouble, but on the other side, the Celtics can handle Jaylen or Jayson getting in foul trouble and having to sit out because they have depth on their bench!\"\n\nThe Mavericks will tip off Game 1 of the Finals against the Celtics in Boston's TD Garden. It'll be a fierce environment, especially with Kyrie Irving returning to the arena to play against the Celtics in the Finals.\n\nRelated: 2024 NBA Finals: Celtics vs. Mavericks (Analysis, Comparison, Prediction)\n\nThank you for being a valued reader of Fadeaway World.

This is the sixth time in eight years the franchise has reached at least the Conference Finals and the second time in three years Boston has reached the Finals. The coveted Larry O'Brien Trophy, however, has so far eluded them.\n\nVictory in this year's Finals would give the Celtics a record-breaking 18th NBA title, taking them past the Los Angeles Lakers as the most successful franchise in the league.\n\nCritics and opponents have at times maligned the Celtics as having a soft underbelly, with key players or the team as a whole struggling in the biggest moments; both last year's shock loss to the No. 8 seed Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference Finals and Jayson Tatum's performances in the 2022 NBA Finals being examples of these concerns.\n\n\"There's a lot that myself and we can learn from that experience, being in the Finals,\" Tatum told reporters. \"This go-around is a lot different. Obviously, we've been there before and we came up short. It's a great opportunity to make it to Finals again, you don't always get a second chance.\n\n\"I'm really just looking at it as a second chance, trying to simplify things as much as we can. It's another series that we gotta win.\n\n\"Having nine days off [before the Finals] is good for your body and for everybody to get healthy, but we're in the NBA Finals and we're all so anxious and excited to play. I wish it did start a little bit earlier, so we could get after it, but we have a lot of guys of who been here before and we understand the magnitude of this moment and saying sharp, fresh and staying ready.\"\n\nBut the team has shown impressive mettle this postseason, in particular in the Conference Finals against the Indiana Pacers. Three times in that series, the Celtics found themselves down late but turned each of the games around to earn a sweep, thanks largely to series MVP Jaylen Brown.\n\nAccording to ESPN Stats and Info, the Pacers had at least a 90% win probability during the fourth quarters of Games 1, 3 and 4.\n\nCan Luka emulate Dirk?\n\nWhile the Celtics have been on a roll since day one, the Dallas Mavericks didn't really turn their season around until February's trade deadline.\n\nThe addition of more size and length in Daniel Gafford and PJ Washington has perfectly complimented the superstar backcourt of Luka Don\u010di\u0107 and Kyrie Irving, who have taken turns carrying the team throughout this playoff run.\n\nMeanwhile, Dereck Lively II is capping off a mightily impressive rookie season by becoming a valuable rotation piece for the Mavericks this playoff run, while Derrick Jones Jr. has grown as a player and made some huge buckets in the postseason.\n\nThough Don\u010di\u0107, who finished third in MVP voting, is still performing at a high level, a knee injury means he has struggled at times to reach the heights of the regular season; so much of Dallas' success will rest on the Slovenian's fitness and form.\n\nHead coach Jason Kidd could further cement his place in Mavericks history by leading the team to the title. It has been 13 years since Kidd helped bring the franchise its first and only Larry O'Brien trophy as a player, assisting Dirk Nowitzki in a stunning Finals win over the Miami Heat.\n\n\"It was a tough road to get back here [the Finals],\" Irving told reporters. \"So I'm just appreciating all of the little steps that it took, appreciating all the people who helped me grow. It was a great reflection period the last couple of days just thinking about not only the past few years, but what we were able to accomplish this year in such a short period of time.\n\n\"How we galvanized the city of Dallas and our fans, and it just feels like we've got the whole world supporting us throughout this endeavor, so I'm appreciative and grateful for everything that I had to go through and everything my teammates had to go through in order to get here with me.\"\n\nFull schedule\n\nAll games are away vs. home\n\n* Game 1: Mavericks vs. Celtics, June 6 - 8:30 p.m. ET\n\n* Game 2: Mavericks vs. Celtics, June 9 - 8:00 p.m. ET\n\n* Game 3: Celtics vs. Mavericks, June 12 - 8:30 p.m. ET\n\n* Game 4: Celtics vs. Mavericks, June 14 - 8:30 p.m. ET\n\n* *Game 5: Mavericks vs. Celtics, June 17 - 8:30 p.m. ET\n\n* *Game 6: Celtics vs. Mavericks, June 20 - 8:30 p.m. ET\n\n* *Game 7: Mavericks vs. Celtics, June 23 - 8:00 p.m. ET\n\n* If needed\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matias_grez@aol.com", "name": "Matias Grez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

Now, here's another chance at glory against the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nDo the Celtics have what it takes to win it all? Absolutely. But, with Luka Doncic on the other side staring them down, a win is far from a guarantee.\n\nHere are three reasons why the Celtics will (and won't!) win the championship this year.\n\nWhy the Celtics will win it all\n\nFirst: The Celtics are the best team in the NBA by far. Boston has been at the top of the league all season.\n\nThe team's 11.7 net rating in the regular season blows everyone out the water. The team's 10.8 postseason net rating does the same.\n\nSecond: Kristaps Porzingis is back. And, with him healthy, the Celtics' five-out attack should thrive against the Mavericks' defense.\n\nFour of the five players in Boston's starting lineup shoot 37 percent from 3-point range while shooting at least 4.7 3-point shots per game. The Mavericks' defense will be stretched out like it hasn't been this postseason. The Celtics will matchup hunt with Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown and attack the rim. Dallas isn't built to stop that.\n\nThird: Defensively, the Celtics can dismantle the Mavericks in so many ways.\n\nObviously, Luka Doncic is one of the best players in the NBA right now. He will be a problem regardless of who you put on him. But Boston has two guards Derrick White and Jrue Holiday, who made the NBA All-Defense team this year. Kristaps Porzingis is averaging 1.9 blocks per game and is incredible on the weak side of the floor. Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are two huge guards who are stout defenders themselves. That's going to be a tough egg to crack for Dallas.\n\nWhy the Celtics won't win it all\n\nFirst: The Mavericks might be the Celtics' first test all postseason long.\n\nObviously, that 10.8 net rating is dominant. But if you were going to have any reservations about the Celtics in this one, it'd probably be because they haven't played anyone. Boston's first three rounds of the series came against:\n\nThe Heat without Jimmy Butler for the entire series. The Cavaliers without Donovan Mitchell and Jarrett Allen for most of the series The Pacers without Tyrese Haliburton for half of the series.\n\nLining up against real stars in Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving won't be easy. Boston should be up for the challenge, but we'll see.\n\nSecond: Luka Doncic is still the best player in the series, even if the Celtics are the better team.\n\nThat's pretty self-explanatory. Luka Doncic is one of the best three or four players in the NBA. Now, Jayson Tatum is pretty incredible in his own right. And Boston certainly has the better team from top-to-bottom in this one.\n\nBut we saw it in the 2022 NBA Finals when Steph Curry completely took over. Sometimes, there's just a guy who can flip an entire series upside-down. Luka Doncic can do that at any point here.\n\nThird: Kristaps Porzingis isn't healthy\n\nPorzingis injured his calf at the end of April. The Finals will start on June 6, giving him just about a month of recovery time. He's healthy enough to play and says he'll be ready for Game 1 of the series.\n\nPorzingis says he's moving without pain in his calf at this point, but his pause here is a curious one.\n\nIf he's not out there and able to move at the levels required to be effective on defense? The Mavericks will put a ton of pressure on him by forcing switching and putting him in action with Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving. That could be a bad look for Boston.\n\nThe 5 most hateful moments between Kyrie Irving and Celtics fans Lonzo Ball classily offers to pay for Angel Reese's fine after 'weak' ref ejected her NBA Finals 2024: Our brilliant staff's predictions for the winner and series MVP", "source": {"uri": "ftw.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "For The Win"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_d_sykes@ftw.usatoday.com", "name": "Mike D.

On the other end, you have the Dallas Mavericks, led by one of this year's MVP finalists, Luka Doncic, as well as a deep squad with plenty of size and that extra special dose of magic.\n\nREAD MORE: The Mavericks-Celtics Finals is an incredible flex by the NBA's scriptwriters.\n\nOn paper, this Finals series between Boston and Dallas is an intriguing matchup that should produce as much drama as you'd expect from the NBA's championship round. Below are the For The Win staff's picks and predictions for this climactic championship moment this season and what we can all expect over the next few weeks.\n\nPut another way: Buckle up, everyone.\n\nRobert Zeglinski: Mavericks over Celtics in 7\n\nFinals MVP: Luka Doncic\n\nI wavered and went back and forth so much, but I think Dallas has enough matchup advantages to give Boston real problems it hasn't faced all postseason. Between a healthy, rested Luka Doncic and depth and size at center, the Mavericks will push the Celtics to the ropes before pulling off the massive road Game 7 upset to win the title.\n\nThough, with the history of these specific Celtics, losing in that spot wouldn't be all that surprising.\n\nBlake Schuster: Mavericks over Celtics in 6\n\nFinals MVP: Luka Doncic\n\nDallas, right now, has the most effective backcourt we've seen in a postseason run in quite some time. It forces opponents to ask themselves if they want to get beaten by Luka or Kyrie Irving. I think the Mavs steal Game 1 in Boston after the Celtics' long-ish layoff and take control from there. I cannot wait to see what type of trash Luka talks with the courtside fans in Boston.\n\nPrince Grimes: Celtics over Mavericks in 6\n\nFinals MVP: Jayson Tatum\n\nI just look across these rosters and have a hard time seeing where Dallas has any advantages. Specifically, I don't know how they defend Boston. If the Celtics lose, it'll be just as much about them not playing up to their potential as it'll be about Luka Doncic being incredibly special. And while I realize how very possible that is (because we've seen it before), I think the Celtics might be too good to fail this time around.\n\nMeghan Hall: Celtics over Mavericks in 6\n\nFinals MVP: Jayson Tatum\n\nListen, the Celtics cannot walk out of the NBA Finals without a ring. It simply will not fly. They have entirely too much money invested in players like Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown for a ring not to happen. It would be utterly embarrassing to get run out of the gym by Luka, Kyrie, and the Mavs. Frankly, I'll probably be at the top of their hater list if that happens.\n\nPULL IT TOGETHER, BOSTON.\n\nCharles Curtis: Mavericks over Celtics in 7\n\nFinals MVP: Luka Doncic\n\nI love Jayson Tatum. I really do. And this Celtics team is built for this moment from top to bottom, especially with Kristaps Porzingis back. But Luka Doncic looks like the superstar to beat here. His supporting cast is better than ever, and Kyrie Irving knows how to win. I think Luka gets crowned in what should be a tight series, and the Celtics continue to look for answers.\n\nMike Sykes: Celtics over Mavericks in 5\n\nFinals MVP: Jayson Tatum\n\nI'm trying to do this while being respectful of the Dallas Mavericks and everything they've done to get to where they are. But Boston is far and away the better team, with more talent and fewer defensive liabilities. I just think Boston will be able to take advantage of a few matchups offensively that Dallas won't be able to mitigate. That's what the series boils down to.\n\nBryan Kalbrosky: Celtics over Mavericks in 6\n\nFinals MVP: Jaylen Brown\n\nSalute to Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving, but if I'm choosing between the head and the heart, I'm going with the numbers. Boston is simply destroying teams and owns the best net rating in the postseason.

This will be Boston's second shot at the title in the last three years -- they lost it to GSW in 2022 -- and Dallas' first time back at the finals since they won it all in 2011.\n\nDoncic, the Mavericks' 25-year-old scoring star, will be making his NBA Finals debut on Thursday. If he can lead his team to a win in the best-of-seven series, he could become the first player to win a national title and a scoring title in the same season since Shaquille O'Neal in 2000. He is already chasing Shaq's records during this postseason, after Doncic and Irving became the first pair of teammates to have more than 35+ points each in a playoffs performance since Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal in 2001.\n\nThe other most-talked-about tandem in the tournament, Tatum and Brown, both now have a chance to win the ring that has so-far eluded them. Pundits love to compare them, and even pit them against one another, but the pair have already proven they can come together to bring Boston wins this postseason, and will try to do it again in the Finals.\n\nThe Celtics are -230 to win game 1 and open as -210 favorites to win it all, according to DraftKings.

This is the sixth time in eight years the franchise has reached at least the Conference Finals and the second time in three years Boston has reached the Finals. The coveted Larry O'Brien Trophy, however, has so far eluded them.\n\nVictory in this year's Finals would give the Celtics a record-breaking 18th NBA title, taking them past the Los Angeles Lakers as the most successful franchise in the league.\n\nCritics and opponents have at times maligned the Celtics as having a soft underbelly, with key players or the team as a whole struggling in the biggest moments; both last year's shock loss to the No. 8 seed Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference Finals and Jayson Tatum's performances in the 2022 NBA Finals being examples of these concerns.\n\n\"There's a lot that myself and we can learn from that experience, being in the Finals,\" Tatum told reporters. \"This go-around is a lot different. Obviously, we've been there before and we came up short. It's a great opportunity to make it to Finals again, you don't always get a second chance.\n\n\"I'm really just looking at it as a second chance, trying to simplify things as much as we can. It's another series that we gotta win.\n\n\"Having nine days off [before the Finals] is good for your body and for everybody to get healthy, but we're in the NBA Finals and we're all so anxious and excited to play. I wish it did start a little bit earlier, so we could get after it, but we have a lot of guys of who been here before and we understand the magnitude of this moment and saying sharp, fresh and staying ready.\"\n\nBut the team has shown impressive mettle this postseason, in particular in the Conference Finals against the Indiana Pacers. Three times in that series, the Celtics found themselves down late but turned each of the games around to earn a sweep, thanks largely to series MVP Jaylen Brown.\n\nAccording to ESPN Stats and Info, the Pacers had at least a 90% win probability during the fourth quarters of Games 1, 3 and 4.\n\nCan Luka emulate Dirk?\n\nWhile the Celtics have been on a roll since day one, the Dallas Mavericks didn't really turn their season around until February's trade deadline.\n\nThe addition of more size and length in Daniel Gafford and PJ Washington has perfectly complimented the superstar backcourt of Luka Don\u010di\u0107 and Kyrie Irving, who have taken turns carrying the team throughout this playoff run.\n\nMeanwhile, Dereck Lively II is capping off a mightily impressive rookie season by becoming a valuable rotation piece for the Mavericks this playoff run, while Derrick Jones Jr. has grown as a player and made some huge buckets in the postseason.\n\nThough Don\u010di\u0107, who finished third in MVP voting, is still performing at a high level, a knee injury means he has struggled at times to reach the heights of the regular season; so much of Dallas' success will rest on the Slovenian's fitness and form.\n\nHead coach Jason Kidd could further cement his place in Mavericks history by leading the team to the title. It has been 13 years since Kidd helped bring the franchise its first and only Larry O'Brien trophy as a player, assisting Dirk Nowitzki in a stunning Finals win over the Miami Heat.\n\n\"It was a tough road to get back here [the Finals],\" Irving told reporters. \"So I'm just appreciating all of the little steps that it took, appreciating all the people who helped me grow. It was a great reflection period the last couple of days just thinking about not only the past few years, but what we were able to accomplish this year in such a short period of time.\n\n\"How we galvanized the city of Dallas and our fans, and it just feels like we've got the whole world supporting us throughout this endeavor, so I'm appreciative and grateful for everything that I had to go through and everything my teammates had to go through in order to get here with me.\"\n\nFull schedule\n\nAll games are away vs. home\n\n* Game 1: Mavericks vs. Celtics, June 6 - 8:30 p.m. ET\n\n* Game 2: Mavericks vs. Celtics, June 9 - 8:00 p.m. ET\n\n* Game 3: Celtics vs. Mavericks, June 12 - 8:30 p.m. ET\n\n* Game 4: Celtics vs. Mavericks, June 14 - 8:30 p.m. ET\n\n* *Game 5: Mavericks vs. Celtics, June 17 - 8:30 p.m. ET\n\n* *Game 6: Celtics vs. Mavericks, June 20 - 8:30 p.m. ET\n\n* *Game 7: Mavericks vs. Celtics, June 23 - 8:00 p.m. ET\n\n* If needed\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

They've got two of the best ever,\" he told Rachel Nichols and DeMarcus Cousins. \"Obviously, Jayson Tatum and those guys are really good. Jaylen Brown is really good. But Luka (Doncic) and Kyrie (Irving) are something we haven't seen. They are the best duo (in the Finals). They don't just have the best player.\"\n\nIrving is the only one out of Doncic, Brown and Tatum to have won an NBA title. It's been eight years since he last did so, but the 32-year-old has found new life in Dallas and elevated his game his game in the regular season. But he's seen a small dip in the playoffs averaging 22.8 points, 3.9 rebounds, 5.2 assists and 1.2 steals per game.\n\nThe eight-time All-Star has championship experience and has been able to be consistent throughout. In 13 Finals games, Irving averaged 27.7 points, 4.2 assists and as many rebounds.\n\nDoncic has also been a force for Dallas en route to the NBA Finals averaging 28.8 points, 9.6 assists and 8.8 rebounds.\n\nAfter Doncic and Irving, though, Thomas isn't sold on the rest of the Mavs' roster, noting \"the difference\" between the two teams is the Celtics' starting five \"is amazing.\" Because of the roster as a whole, Thomas believes his former Celtics team will take care of the Mavericks and win Banner 18.\n\nThe Mavericks will likely pose the tallest task for the Celtics. Despite only losing two games in their playoff run, their opponents have been without some of their star players due to injuries, causing some to believe they had an easy route to the Finals.\n\nBut Brown and Tatum have done everything right thus far. If Tatum had a down game, Brown, Al Horford and Derrick White were there to put up points.\n\nThere's already plenty of noise surrounding the series with Irving and Kristaps Porzingis playing their former teams. Celtics fans have never quite forgiven Irving for how he departed Boston, and there's reportedly \"real beef\" with Mavericks fans and Porzingis.\n\nThe NBA Finals begin Thursday night at TD Garden at 8:30 p.m. EST.", "source": {"uri": "masslive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MassLive"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Thomas_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Isaiah Thomas (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeMarcus_Cousins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DeMarcus Cousins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.masslive.com/resizer/v2/7UAKP2WTIZGZ7A7X4SHJSBXZAQ.jpg?auth=df57d87a8bb913fb9f2e46ab885658c6bbaae048170bb14b04b3bdaf5d03c221&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

The Celtics and the Mavericks should treat us to quite the battle, with a lot of star power ready to leave it all out there for a championship.\n\nJayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown have led the Celtics to the biggest stage for the second time in the last three years, and are determined to bring a banner (the organization's 18th) back to Boston. Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving are standing in their way, as the Mavs look to finish off their mid-season turnaround with Dallas' second title.\n\nThe top-seeded Celtics were the best team in basketball throughout the season and are well-rested heading into the NBA Finals after a lengthy break following their Eastern Conference Finals sweep of the Indiana Pacers. The Mavericks enjoyed a long break too after finishing off the Minnesota Timberwolves in the Western Conference Finals in five games. They are just the second fifth seed to make it to the NBA Finals.\n\nDallas will be the best team the Celtics face this postseason, with a two-headed monster in Doncic and Irving leading a talented and deadly offensive attack. The Mavs are battle-tested too, beating a trio of 50-plus win teams to get to the Finals.\n\nWhile the Celtics have pretty much rolled to their 76 wins this season (64 in the regular season before 12 more in the playoffs), the Mavericks morphed into a new team in the weeks following the trade deadline. Acquiring P.J. Washington and Daniel Gafford gave Dallas backbone on defense, and the Mavs have made incredible strides toward becoming a complete team.\n\nBut the Celtics are the better team from top to bottom, and their defense will likely be the difference in this matchup. Here's what we'll be watching for throughout the NBA Finals.\n\nWe'll start with the main attraction with this showdown, which is the star power on both sides. Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown vs. Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving is a pretty sweet Finals matchup.\n\nLuka and Kyrie are both insanely talented scorers who can put the ball in the hoop in a number of ways from just about anywhere on the floor. Tatum and Brown may not have the scoring prowess of those two but they are also pretty good at racking up points and setting up others. And the Jays are two-way stars who bring a big impact on the defensive end as well.\n\nDoncic is the best player in this series. He can sink shots from anywhere with just about anyone on him, and he does so in an incredibly crafty and unpredictable way. He is in no way the most athletic player on the floor, but he can pick apart just about any defense. It's in his DNA to want to rip out the hearts of his opposition. He logged a triple-double in both regular-season meetings with the Celtics.\n\nWith Irving and his three-level attack in the same backcourt as Doncic and his creativity, the Boston defense is in for a massive challenge this series. But the Celtics have the bodies to make life difficult on both of the Mavs stars, and Tatum and Brown will be part of that equation along with Jrue Holiday, Derrick White, and Kristaps Porzingis.\n\nOffensively, Tatum and Brown will have to have an efficient series for Boston to be at its best. And they were both excellent against the Mavs during the regular season, with Tatum averaging 35.5 points off 52.5 percent shooting and 41.2 percent from three. This matchup could be what he needs to get out of his shooting slump, and we could finally get one of the Tatum takeover games we've been clamoring for.\n\nBrown averaged just under 30 points over his two games against Dallas, hitting 57 percent from the floor. He's been incredible this postseason on both ends of the floor, and will have to keep that going against the Mavs. Brown will likely be spending a lot of time on Doncic on the defensive end, so his offense may dip a bit with that tough assignment.\n\nBut if Tatum and Brown have the likes of P.J. Washington, Derrick Jones Jr., or Josh Green guarding them, they should put up some Luka-Kryie-like stat lines for the Celtics.\n\nIf you like star power, this NBA Finals matchup will provide plenty.\n\nTatum and Brown should be hunting out Luka or Kyrie every time they have the ball in their hands, at least as much as they can without throwing off the flow and rhythm of the Boston offense. It will be a balancing act, but one the Celtics should try to work to their advantage.\n\nDoncic and Irving put in the work to become better defensive players down the stretch, but they are still liabilities on that end of the floor. The Celtics should test them 1-on-1 or make them run through a sea of screens, anything to make them work on defense. Make Luka run around on defense as much as possible, and take it to Kyrie in the post.\n\nThe more energy that duo expends on the defensive end, the less juice they'll have on the offensive end. Make them work on defense and they won't be energizer bunnies on offense. (In theory, at least. Even making Luka work on defense doesn't guarantee that he won't drop a triple-double on Boston.)\n\nOne of Doncic and Irving will go off on a given night. The goal for the Celtics is making sure it's not both of them, as the Mavs are 5-0 this postseason when both Doncic and Irving score 30 points. Making them both work on defense will go a long way toward accomplishing that goal.\n\nKristaps Porzingis is set to return and make the Celtics whole again in Game 1. The Celtics didn't miss him too much against the Heat, the Cavaliers, or the Pacers, but they'll need his floor-stretching and rim-protecting services against the Mavericks. He'll be a matchup nightmare for Dallas in the paint too, with the ability to post up or shoot over Mavs centers Daniel Gafford and Dereck Lively II.\n\nBut he's coming off a calf injury that forced him to miss 10 games and weeks of practice. The most work Porzingis has done over the last 37 days was taking part in scrimmages at practice. That is nowhere near the intensity he'll see in Game 1 of the NBA Finals.\n\nWe'll see how much rust Porzingis has to shake off and if he's on a minutes restriction his first few games back. It's almost a certainty that the Mavericks are going to test him early and often, so we'll see if he's ready for all that attention.\n\nRemember all that star power we talked about? Don't forget about that next tier of stars, which could be the difference in this series.\n\nAnd that benefits Boston, with Holiday and White forming a backcourt that is almost unfair. Both are defensive wizards and will go a long way in helping the Celtics \"contain\" Doncic and Irving. And with Luka and Kyrie likely combining for at least 70 points per game (that's what \"containing\" those two means, and that number could easily flirt with the 80s on some nights), both will have to drop some points of their own.\n\nQuality is more important than quantity for Holiday and White. Neither has to score 20 every night for Boston to win, but they have to be ready to make big shots when the time comes. Tatum and Brown are going to command a ton of defensive attention, which will leave Holiday and White with good looks.\n\nHoliday was the late-game hero in Game 3 against the Pacers with a clutch three-point play and steal on the defensive end. White wore the cape for Boston in Game 4 with the game-winning/series-sealing corner three in the final seconds. So in addition to being a game-changing defensive duo, they can also pack an offensive punch out of the backcourt.\n\nWashington was a solid deadline pickup for Dallas, giving the Mavs a versatile defender and scorer. He can defend multiple positions and will likely find himself spending a lot of time on Tatum during the Finals. He's also a talent scorer that can knock down threes and has a real solid floater.\n\nDerrick Jones Jr. can fly and send down some wild dunks, and rookie center Derek Lively II brings some size and defense off the bench.\n\nBoth teams are going to let it fly from downtown this series. Boston led the NBA in three-point attempts and makes during the regular season, and that has carried over to the playoffs, with the C's averaging 39.8 attempts and 14.6 makes from three-point and. Nearly half of Boston's shots this postseason have come from downtown, with 47.4 percent of their shot attempts coming from three.\n\nThe Mavs ranked second and third, respectively, in three-point attempts and makes in the regular season. They have taken the fifth-most three-point shots (33.9) and own the third-most makes (12.6) in the playoffs.\n\nThe corner three is a weapon for both teams, as the C's led the league by connecting on 43.6 percent of their shots from the corners. They did a great job taking that away from opponents, holding teams to a league-worst 35.2 percent on corner threes in the regular season and an NBA-low 23.5 percent in the playoffs, via ESPN.\n\nThe Celtics should be able to take away a big part of Dallas' drive-and-kick offense if they continue to defend those corners.\n\nSeriously, Celtics. You're in the NBA Finals. Now is not the time to lose any home games.\n\nBoth of Boston's losses this postseason were at TD Garden. The Celtics would have lost Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals if it weren't for Brown's heroics in the final seconds. Back in the 2022 NBA Finals, the Celtics lost two of their three home games to the Warriors, and were 6-6 at home that postseason.\n\nThe Celtics fought hard for the top seed to land home-court advantage throughout the playoffs. Don't let all that hard work go to waste by dropping one of the first two games of the NBA Finals.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [],

The Celtics or Mavericks will follow the Raptors (2018-19), Lakers (2019-20), Bucks (2020-21), Warriors (2021-22) and Nuggets (2022-23) as the most recent NBA champions.\n\nThe only other time in league history with six different champions in a six-season span was 1974-75 - 1979-1980.\n\nThe Celtics finished the regular season on top of the Eastern Conference, with the league's best 64-18, and have dropped only two games in this year's playoff campaign.\n\nThey are coming in fresh, with their last game played on 27 May, when they completed the sweep of the Indiana Pacers in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nJayson Tatum is leading the team in points (26 per game), rebounds (10.4 per game) and assists (5.9 per game) this postseason, and will look to take care of business once again when the battle for the Larry O'Brien Trophy begins in Boston tonight.\n\nHe realizes the enormity of the task at hand though.\n\n\"We only hang NBA championship banners, right? 17 of them. Some of the greatest players to ever play this game wore this uniform. All of us are honored to follow in their footsteps, the way they paved for us to live out our dream,\" he said during yesterday's media day.\n\nFor the Mavs, it is their first trip to the NBA Finals since their 2011 championship season. They can't ask for more of Doncic who has been dominating their playoffs campaign on both sides of the floor with 28.8 points, 9.6 rebounds, 8.8 assists and 1.6 steals per game.\n\nDoncic is the 2023-24 NBA scoring leader and his career playoff scoring average of 31.1 points per game is the second highest in NBA history, behind Michael Jordan (33.4 ppg).\n\n\"First time here. Hopefully it's not the last game. But never take it for granted. You never know if you are going to come back, so just enjoy the experience,\" he said yesterday.\n\nThe Celtics and Mavericks have both thrived on the road in the playoffs. Boston is unbeaten on the road (6-0), while Dallas has won five straight road playoff games and is 7-2 on the road this postseason.\n\nThe Celtics beat the Mavericks twice in the regular season, winning 119-110 on 22 Januaryin Dallas, and 138-110 on 1 March in Boston.\n\nThe 2024 NBA Finals presented by YouTube will air on ESPN (live), NBA League Pass live and on demand) and NTV (delayed) in

The Celtics will be the toughest opponent the Mavs have faced during these playoffs, and the same can be said for Boston because of Dallas' superstar backcourt and versatility on both ends of the floor. Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving are in a good rhythm, and if their offense is taken away, they can resort to a potent lob game with their two big men, Daniel Gafford and Dereck Lively II.\n\nI don't foresee many blowouts, and I think almost every game will go the distance, but I'm choosing the Mavericks in six games.\n\nTim Cowlishaw\n\nDallas goes where Luka goes, and Luka is the best player in the league today. Certainly he's the best player in the league still active. I think the Celtics can do a better job on Kyrie Irving than the Wolves did -- probably with Jrue Holiday guarding him -- but there's not that much to be done against Luka.\n\nThe teams have had a week or more to rest, and there's an extra off day in the Finals between all games except 3 and 4 here in Dallas. That's to Luka's benefit more than anyone's. The Celtics have had a soft playoff run against Miami without Jimmy Butler and others, Cleveland without Donovan Mitchell and an Indiana team that's new to the playoff hunt.\n\nBoston has been just as good as Dallas (maybe better) at closing out games, but I'll still take Doncic with the ball in his hands for the final shot over Tatum, Brown and the rest. Sometimes teams just get on a roll, and Dallas is on one. Mavericks in five.\n\nShawn McFarland\n\nCeltics in seven games. That's no disrespect to the Mavericks, either. The Celtics had the best net rating in the regular season and postseason, Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are playoff-tested, and Boston has lost just twice in three rounds.\n\nThis clearly isn't the same Mavericks team that Boston beat twice in the regular season, of course, which sets up a competitive series. Don't be surprised if Dallas takes one of the first two road games, though, to create a pivotal stretch at American Airlines Center.\n\nKevin Sherrington\n\nPicking the Mavs to beat the Celtics feels like an affront to logic. Boston was, by record, the league's best team and has been one of the best three years running. Some of us can still remember when the Mavs lost five of six after the deadline and Kidd's job seemed in jeopardy. Still like to know what all went down in that famous team meeting.\n\nEven as well as they played against Oklahoma City and Minnesota, the Mavs benefited from facing unseasoned players. Boston is a different story. But, these days, so is Dallas. I don't think the Mavs will beat the Celtics, but I'm tired of being wrong. Mavs in seven.\n\nBrad Townsend\n\nBoston was the best NBA team over the course of the season, but Dallas has been the best team of the past 2.5 months.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nThe Celtics' 10-day layover between games, and [Kristaps] Porzingis not having played in two months, will be factors early in the series -- along with the fact that Boston hasn't faced competition of Dallas' caliber since the regular season, as the Celtics' playoff path has been paved against injury-racked opponents.\n\nThose factors will help Dallas win one of the first two games in Boston. After that, the series will come down to the Mavericks having the series' best player, Doncic, and the series' best two closers, Doncic and Irving. Mavericks in six.\n\nChad Finn\n\nCeltics in 6. The Mavericks have the best player in the series in Luka Doncic, and the biggest wild-card in Kyrie Irving, who has been playing magnificent basketball but has some, uh, baggage with the Celtics. They are a duo to be reckoned with, capable of stealing games on their own. But they will not steal the series, because the Celtics are the better team. Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are a dynamic duo, but it's the depth and versatility of the Celtics' top six that will deliver Banner 18 to Boston, particularly the selfless backcourt duo of Jrue Holiday and Derrick White.\n\nAdam Himmelsbach\n\nCeltics in 5. I think this is the first time I've ever picked the Celtics to win a title. But it's going to happen. There's a reason they won 14 more games than the Mavericks during the regular season, and even though they've traveled a smoother road during these playoffs, they've mostly dismantled their competition.\n\nEveryone will be watching Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving and their wizardry with the basketball, but the other end of the floor will be most important, as the Celtics relentlessly hunt mismatches against both players, tiring them out in the process.\n\nChristopher L. Gasper\n\nCeltics in 6. The Celtics finally face a team with its full complement of talent. The dynamic duos of Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown and Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving cross each other out. But Boston's path to Banner 18 is strength in numbers. The Celtics have multiple players who can form a Big Three with The Jays any given night -- Jrue Holiday, Derrick White, Al Horford, and a returning Kristaps Porzingis, who like Irving is seeking Finals redemption against a former team. The Celtics margin for error and victory is simply greater than that of the peaking Mavs.\n\nDan Shaughnessy\n\nMavericks in 7. Please don't be offended. It's Jayson Tatum's time. It's Jaylen Brown's time. The Celtics have the best roster, won the most games, and are 12-2 in the playoffs. But I still don't trust them and have nightmares about Kyrie Irving winning it here.\n\nKhari Thompson\n\nCeltics in 6. The Celtics have too much depth on both ends of the floor for Dallas to match. All five starters, plus Al Horford, have shown that they can take over a game offensively. They've rolled through the first three rounds without Kristaps Porzingis. Jayson Tatum's 3-point shot isn't falling, but his game is so well-rounded that it hasn't mattered much. Stopping Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving will be a tall task, but there's arguably no team better equipped to contain them than the Celtics, who have one of the league's best defensive backcourts in Jrue Holiday and Derrick White.\n\nGary Washburn\n\nCeltics in 6. The Celtics have a deeper team, have had more than a week to prepare and appear ready for this moment. There are no excuses. They are healthy with Kristaps Porzingis returning, rested, and motivated. The Mavericks will be their biggest challenge and it will take more than this team has ever given to win a playoff series, but they are capable and it's their time.\n\n\u00a92024 The Dallas Morning News.

At 25, Doncic can add to his impressive basketball r\u00e9sum\u00e9 by capturing that elusive first title. A championship this early in his career would put him ahead of some of the greatest to play the game, including Michael Jordan (28), LeBron James (27), Stephen Curry (28) and Shaquille O'Neal (28). Despite a historic season, he finished third in voting for the regular season MVP award. He now has a chance to win a Finals MVP -- which he'd probably appreciate more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTim Cowlishaw: I don't know how Luka Doncic isn't the biggest storyline in everything he does. He already has set new regular-season statistical standards, and he has been dominant in the playoffs. In the conference finals, he badly outplayed Minnesota's Anthony Edwards, and few players have enjoyed hitting big shots or winning on the road stage quite like Luka.\n\nMavericks\n\nBe the smartest Mavericks fan. Get the latest news.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nOr with:\n\nGoogleFacebook\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nWell, a Finals in the Garden against the team with 17 championship banners is about as large as it's going to get. The accolades keep pouring in from national TV analysts, coaches, players. This series isn't quite Luka vs. the Celtics, but it's close to that, and he loves it. The extra days off in the Finals will allow Jason Kidd to play Luka close to 48 minutes a night.\n\nShawn McFarland: The impact a title could have on each team's star(s). Just consider the company of 1A players who have led teams to recent titles that either Doncic or Jayson Tatum could join: Nikola Jokic, Steph Curry, Giannis Antetokounmpo, LeBron James and Kawhi Leonard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Dallas win would cement Doncic and Dirk Nowitzki as the only two superstars to lead the Mavericks to a championship. An 18th banner for Boston would officially ensure that the Tatum-Jaylen Brown era is successful beyond deep-yet-ringless playoff runs, and it'd squash any leftover narrative that the two can't coexist. The NBA is a star-driven league, and this series has massive ramifications for those on both sides.\n\nKevin Sherrington: Kristaps Porzingis' return to Dallas will undoubtedly become a subtext, especially after Chandler Parsons' contention that Doncic didn't like playing next to him and that there's a \"beef\" there. Luka says there's nothing there.\n\nUnless KP goes off against the Mavs, the dominant storyline will be whether Luka carries the Mavs to a title. Boston has a better team, or at least more star-caliber players, but, all apologies to Tatum, none so bright as Luka. If he doesn't play at a superstar level in the Finals, it won't be because he shrank from the spotlight. He might be the most unflappable player in the league, if not all sports.\n\nAdvertisementAdvertisement\n\nBrad Townsend: It's Porzingis because there are so many layers to his expected return to the court. He hasn't played a game since April 11. How rusty will he be? How quickly will he and his teammates reacclimate to one another? There's no worse time than the NBA Finals for Porzingis and the Celtics to confront these unknowns and have, in effect, a breaking-in period.\n\nThen, let's say the transition goes smoothly and the Celtics win the first two games in Boston, Porzingis faces the hurdle of playing his first game in Dallas since the Mavericks traded him to Washington in February 2022.\n\nChad Finn: I think the most overlooked storyline in all of the analysis about this series is how the Mavericks intend to defend the Celtics. Dallas's defense has been terrific pretty much since the trade deadline, but it has also been lucky (catching an Oklahoma City team that went frigid from 3). Doncic and Irving are average defenders at best, and the Celtics are going to expose weaknesses that have been hidden so far.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdam Himmelsbach: This is an obvious one, but it's the health of Celtics center Kristaps Porzingis, who is expected to return for Game 1 after being sidelined since suffering a calf sprain against the Heat on April 28.\n\nWhen Porzingis was asked Tuesday whether he is running without pain, he had a long, long pause before finally answering yes. Maybe this was just a smokescreen, or maybe there is something there. The Celtics will welcome 3-point shooting to space the floor, along with his rim protection against the Mavericks' array of high-flying finishers.\n\nGary Washburn: How the Celtics defend Luka Doncic and approach one of the league's most talented and ball-dominant players. Do they allow Doncic to score but try to shut down his options for distributing the ball? Doncic has arguably been the best player in the playoffs and the Celtics have to devise a plan to slow him down so he doesn't turn into a scorer and distributor. If Doncic takes full control of this series, hits shots, gets to the free-throw line and is allowed to toss easy lobs to the Dallas big men, it could be a long series for the Celtics.\n\nAdvertisementRelated StoriesView MoreWhich players will step up for Mavs, Celtics?

The WBZ-TV and CBS Boston sports team makes their picks, and everyone is going Green with their predictions.\n\nDan Roche, WBZ-TV Sports\n\nI think THIS Celtics team has answered every question/situation thrown their way this postseason. It's their time.\n\nBoth of their losses -- Game 2 against Miami and Game 2 against Cleveland -- resulted in bounce back Game 3 victories on the road.\n\nNeed a big shot from your two best players? Game 1 against Indiana it was Jaylen Brown with a huge three to send it into overtime. Then Jayson Tatum delivered a three-point play followed by a dagger three with 43 seconds left in the extra session. Your two superstars delivered when it was needed most.\n\nGame 3 in Indiana was Jrue Holiday's turn to step up, and he did so on both ends of the floor in the final seconds. The ageless Al Horford also buried seven threes in that road victory.\n\nGame 4 was Derrick White, who came up with the clinching three late in the corner.\n\nThis is a t-e-a-m at its finest, and Joe Mazzulla has a team that listens and understands exactly what their head coach wants from them.\n\nBoston is also 12-2 in the postseason, a perfect 6-0 on the road and 6-2 at home. They're also 3-for-3 in series clinching opportunities.\n\nAnd now - Kristaps Porzingis is ready to return from a calf strain. Yet another weapon on both ends of the floor.\n\nLuka Doncic and Kyrie Irving are superstar players leading a Dallas team that learned to play championship defense the final months of the season. They deserve to be here.\n\nBut Boston has more weapons on offense and plays quality defense. It should be a battle, but I'll take the Celtics in six with Jayson Tatum earning MVP honors.\n\nNick Giovani, WBZ-TV Sports\n\nIt's been a postseason of gentlemen's sweeps and a complete sweep for the Celtics. That trend may not continue against the Mavericks, but with Kristaps Porzingis back I think it's only a matter of time before Banner 18 is in place.\n\nIt just comes down to how healthy KP really is. His 10-second pause when asked if he's still playing through some pain makes one wonder how close to 100 percent he really is. But his mere presence out on the Parquet is enough to make the Mavs think twice about trying to find their points in the paint.\n\nAs far as solving the problem of Luka and Kyrie, that's no small task. Just ask the Nuggets and Timberwolves. But, I think the Celtics collectively can keep both from going off with their NBA all-defensive second team backcourt of White and Holiday with some help from Jaylen Brown.\n\nIt's time for the Celtics to finish the job. This has been building for Tatum and Brown for years, and Brad Stevens gave Joe Mazzulla and company the missing pieces this offseason in Porzingis and Holiday. Now they're in the Finals after a dominant regular season and mostly dominant run in the playoffs. Having to win three close games against the Pacers in the Conference Finals proved the Celtics can come through in the clutch.\n\nThe Mavericks will be Boston's biggest test this postseason, and there's a good chance most of these games are going to be tight contests. That's a scary thought, considering Luka has made the Celtics pay late in games before. (Remember when he spoiled Kevin Garnett's special day at the Garden a few years ago? Yeah, I blacked that out of my brain too.)\n\nWhile the Mavs have the best player in the series, the Celtics have the better team from top to bottom and a much, much better defense. In the end, that will lead Boston to Banner 18.\n\nLuka is going to score a lot and Kyrie will get his points too. But I believe we're going to get at least one Tatum takeover game, another game-winner for D-White, a lot more ridiculous defense from Holiday, and Brown will break some more ankles on his way to adding another MVP trophy to his growing collection. Celtics in 6.\n\nJoe Weil, CBS Boston\n\nThe Celtics are 76-20 this season. I repeat...THE CELTICS ARE 76-20 THIS SEASON.\n\nLuka Don\u010di\u0107, Kyrie Irving, and this remade Mavericks defense are going to be a tough challenge, but I think it's important to put into context the historical uphill battle that Dallas is trying to climb. The last NBA Finals winner that was lower than a three seed was the 1995 Houston Rockets (and while they were a six seed that year, they won the championship the year before, they played a young Orlando Magic team in the 1995 Finals, and they added Hall-of-Famer Clyde Drexler via a midseason trade that year). And as C's aficionado Bill Simmons noted, there have been 10 teams over the last 50 years that had 20 losses or less by the time they made the Finals, and the 2015-16 Golden State Warriors are the only one in that group to lose the Finals.\n\nThe Celtics were the best team in the regular season. They posted the fifth-best regular season point differential ever. Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are playing the most complete basketball of their careers, Jrue Holiday and Derrick White are perfect role players for this team, Kristaps Porzingis appears healthy now, and Al Horford is somehow still a very useful player at age 38.\n\nThe C's playoff path has been easy, but that's the benefit of having the one seed. And even without Porzingis for most of the playoffs, the C's are still 12-2 this postseason.

The Mavericks have the best player in the series in Luka Doncic, and the biggest wild card in Kyrie Irving, who has been playing magnificent basketball but has some, uh, baggage with the Celtics. They are a duo to be reckoned with, capable of stealing games on their own. But they will not steal the series, because the Celtics are the better team. Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are a dynamic duo, but it's the depth and versatility of the Celtics' top six that will deliver Banner 18 to Boston, particularly the selfless backcourt duo of Jrue Holiday and Derrick White.\n\nCeltics in five. I think this is the first time I've ever picked the Celtics to win a title. But it's going to happen. There's a reason they won 14 more games than the Mavericks during the regular season, and even though they've traveled a smoother road during these playoffs, they've mostly dismantled their competition. Everyone will be watching Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving and their wizardry with the basketball, but the other end of the floor will be most important, as the Celtics relentlessly hunt mismatches against both players, tiring them out in the process.\n\nCeltics in six. The Celtics finally face a team with its full complement of talent. The dynamic duos of Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown and Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving cross each other out. But the Celtics' path to Banner 18 is strength in numbers. They have multiple players who can form a Big Three with The Jays any given night -- Jrue Holiday, Derrick White, Al Horford, and the returning Kristaps Porzingis, who like Irving is seeking Finals redemption against a former team. The Celtics' margin for error and victory is simply greater than that of the peaking Mavericks.\n\nMavericks in seven. Please don't be offended. It's Jayson Tatum's time. It's Jaylen Brown's time. The Celtics have the best roster, won the most games, and are 12-2 in the playoffs. But I still don't trust them and have nightmares about Kyrie Irving winning it here.\n\nCeltics in six. The Celtics have too much depth on both ends of the floor for Dallas to match. All five starters, plus Al Horford, have shown that they can take over a game offensively. They've rolled through the first three rounds without Kristaps Porzingis. Jayson Tatum's 3-point shot isn't falling, but his game is so well-rounded that it hasn't mattered much. Stopping Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving will be a tall task, but there's arguably no team better equipped to contain them than the Celtics, who have one of the league's best defensive backcourts in Jrue Holiday and Derrick White.\n\nCeltics in six. The Celtics have a deeper team, have had more than a week to prepare, and appear ready for this moment. There are no excuses. They are healthy with Kristaps Porzingis returning, rested, and motivated. The Mavericks will be their biggest challenge, and it will take more than this team has ever given to win a playoff series, but they are capable and it's their time.\n\nMavericks in six. I am 3 for 3 in predictions over the last three series, even though I was off by one game in the second and third rounds. The Celtics will be the toughest opponent the Mavericks have faced during these playoffs, and the same can be said for Boston because of Dallas's superstar backcourt and versatility on both ends of the floor. Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving are in a good rhythm, and if their offense is taken away, they can resort to a potent lob game with their two big men, Daniel Gafford and Dereck Lively II. I don't foresee many blowouts, and I think almost every game will go the distance.\n\nMavericks in five. Dallas goes where Luka goes, and Luka is the best player in the league today. Certainly he's the best in the league still playing. I think the Celtics can do a better job on Kyrie Irving than the Wolves did -- probably with Jrue Holiday guarding him -- but there's not that much to be done against Luka. The teams have had a week to rest, and there's an extra off day in the Finals between all games except 3 and 4. That's to Luka's benefit more than anyone else's. The Celtics have had a soft playoff run. Boston has been just as good as Dallas (maybe better) at closing out games, but I'll still take Doncic with the ball in his hands for the final shot over Tatum, Brown, and the rest. Sometimes teams just get on a roll, and Dallas is on one.\n\nCeltics in seven. That's no disrespect to the Mavericks. The Celtics had the best net rating in the regular season and postseason, Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are playoff-tested, and Boston has lost just twice in three rounds. This clearly isn't the same Mavericks team that Boston beat twice in the regular season, of course, which sets up a competitive series. Don't be surprised if Dallas takes one of the first two road games, though, to create a pivotal stretch at American Airlines Center.\n\nMavericks in seven. Picking the Mavericks to beat the Celtics feels like an affront to logic. Boston was, by record, the league's best team and has been one of the best three years running. Some of us can still remember when the Mavericks lost five of six after the deadline and Jason Kidd's job seemed in jeopardy. Still like to know what all went down in that famous team meeting. Even as well as they played against Oklahoma City and Minnesota, the Mavericks benefited from facing unseasoned players. Boston is a different story. But, these days, so is Dallas. I don't think the Mavericks will beat the Celtics, but I'm tired of being wrong.\n\nMavericks in six. Boston was the best team over the course of the season, but Dallas has been the best team of the past 2\u00bd months. The Celtics' 10-day layover between games and Porzingis not having played will be factors early in the series -- along with the fact that Boston hasn't faced competition of Dallas's caliber since the regular season, as the Celtics' playoff path has been paved with injury-racked opponents. Those factors will help Dallas win one of the first two games in Boston. After that, the series will come down to the Mavericks having the series' best player, Doncic, and the series' best two closers, Doncic and Irving.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Three_(Miami_Heat)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big Three (Miami Heat)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_State_Wolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Northern State Wolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brown Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Airlines Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kidd", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jason Kidd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Ethnic_and_Regional", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Ethnic and Regional", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/p_TxJioFZsw0RwYRjt4ldmEXrnE=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/NNMKJVTIZAI6HNJSJRJOBXTXKQ.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Boston's co-stars still recall the gut-wrenching ending of walking off the TD Garden's parquet as the Warriors celebrated, covered in confetti and champagne. Therefore, after a blockbuster-filled offseason, a league-best 64-win regular season, and a 12-2 run this postseason, it's up to the Celtics to rise to the occasion.\n\nWith Game 1 just hours away from its 8:30 p.m. ET scheduled tip-off at TD Garden, it's time to take a pre-Finals stance. Which team will come out victorious, hosting a Larry O'Brien Trophy, and who will win Finals MVP?\n\nHere are the official NESN Digital staff predictions before the Celtics and Mavericks square off in Game 1:\n\nGreg Dudek: Celtics over Mavericks in five games\n\nJust don't see how the Mavericks can consistently defend Boston's multitude of options who can all splash in 3-pointers. Plus, the Celtics are well-suited to match up with Kyrie Irving and Luka Doncic thanks to a strong defensive backcourt tandem in Derrick White and Jrue Holiday.\n\nJayson Tatum came up short in the Finals two years ago, but it won't be a repeat performance this time around for the Celtics star. Tatum has to be taking all the playoff criticism personally and with an all-around showing against the Mavs, will hold the trump card with Finals MVP in tow.\n\nGio Rivera: Celtics over Mavericks in five games\n\nSometimes destiny overrules all else, and there's no team more overdue than the Celtics this postseason. Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown have fended off the outside noise from Opening Night in October, the blockbuster additions of Kristaps Porzingis and Jrue Holiday have been (chefs kiss) spotless, and coming full circle with Boston enemy Kyrie Irving is Hollywoodesque.\n\nTatum coming up short of a second-career Eastern Conference finals MVP honor, Brown being questioned after signing a record-setting contract in the offseason, and 16 years without raising a banner at TD Garden should spark enough motivation. And with all that (presumed) hunger for redemption, Tatum is perfectly positioned to emerge as the MVP of the Finals.\n\nGayle Troiani: Celtics over Mavericks in six games\n\nI believe the Celtics will capture Banner No. 18 in six games. Boston has a lot more depth than Dallas on offense and defense, especially with Kristaps Porzingis reportedly returning. The MVP with be Jaylen Brown.\n\nKeagan Stiefel: Celtics over Mavericks in six games\n\nIt's always difficult picking against the best player in the series (Luka Doncic), but I haven't seen anything from the Celtics that leads me to believe they can't wipe the floor with this Mavericks team. I'm not sure it will be as close as a six-game series would indicate. Doncic will steal one or two games, but Boston is a better team.\n\nTim Crowley: Celtics over Mavericks in six games\n\nDallas can compete and has the talent to challenge Boston. Luka's late-game shot-making could steal at least a game and the Mavericks are going to make this a series. Ultimately, the Celtics went 12-2 this postseason and now get as good of a late-postseason addition as possible with Porzingis returning. Tatum and Brown rise to the occasion as the Celtics capture Banner 18.", "source": {"uri": "nesn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NESN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gio_rivera@nesn.com", "name": "Gio Rivera", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NESN", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NESN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_O'Brien_Championship_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://nesn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/06/Jayson-Tatum-5.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Then, they took down the Oklahoma City Thunder in six games. The Mavs finished their quest for the finals by beating the Minnesota Timberwolves in five games to seal their ticket.\n\nThe Celtics defeated the Miami Heat in five games in the first round. Next, they routed the Cleveland Cavaliers in five games in the Eastern Conference Semifinals. Boston swept the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals to seal their spot in the NBA Finals.\n\nThe Mavericks will be making their second appearance in the NBA Finals and first since 2011, when they won their only championship. Meanwhile, the Celtics will make their 23rd appearance in the NBA Finals. The Celtics are 17-5 in the NBA Finals, including a series loss to the Golden State Warriors two seasons ago.\n\nThe Celtics swept the season series against the Mavericks. Significantly, they destroyed the Mavs 138-110 at home and beat them 119-110 in Dallas. The Celtics have won four in a row, and gone 6-4 over the past 10 games against the Mavericks.\n\nThe Mavericks are heavy underdogs, but no one should count them out. Their great coaching staff has done everything to get the best out of their players. Now, Jason Kidd hopes to lead the Mavericks to their second championship as their head coach after leading them to their first title as the starting point guard.\n\nThere are many similarities to that series. First, Kidd overcame a heavily favored Miami Heat team, teaming up with Dirk Nowitzki to overcome a team that included LeBron James, Dwayne Wade, and Chris Bosh. Now, he will coach up stars Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving as they try and overcome a heavily favored Celtics team that includes Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Kristaps Porzingis, and Jrue Holiday.\n\nDoncic has been excellent in these playoffs, averaging 28.8 points per game. Furthermore, he averaged 32.4 points per game in the Western Conference Finals. Irving has also been good in the playoffs, averaging 22.8 points per game. Likewise, he turned it up a notch in the Western Conference Finals by averaging 27 points per game.\n\nBut PJ Washington is a player to keep an eye on. Ultimately, he has averaged 13.6 points per game in the postseason but has shown he was capable of putting up 25-30 points. Derrick Jones Jr. has been solid, averaging 9.8 points per game. Also, Daniel Gafford has contributed to the effort, averaging 9.2 points per game.\n\nThe Mavericks will cover the spread if Doncic and Irving can continue to play at a high level on offense and supporting players contribute with solid shots. Then, the defense must close out and force the Celtics to take bad shots.\n\nWhy The Celtics Could Win The Series\n\nWhile the Mavericks feel like heavy underdogs, the Celtics feel like they are attempting to finish their story. Unfortunately, they fell apart two seasons ago when they ran into the Warriors. The Celtics would like to remedy that defeat and take the lead for most championships in the NBA.\n\nTatum has been great in the playoffs, averaging 26 points per game. Yet, he likely needs to do more this time around than he did two years ago when he averaged 21.5 points, seven assists, and 6.8 assists per game in six games. Brown has averaged 25 points per game in the playoffs and 29.75 points per game in the Eastern Conference Finals. Additionally, he would like to improve on his stats from two seasons ago, when he averaged 23.5 points, 7.3 rebounds, and 3.7 assists per game in the NBA Finals.\n\nKristaps Porzingis wants revenge on his former team and is back after missing the last two rounds. Ultimately, his calf injury will be something to watch. Holiday was the other addition in the offseason, as the Celtics aimed to fix any issues they had. Meanwhile, Derrick White will hope to show he is ready to bounce back.\n\nThe Celtics will win this series if Tatum and Brown can take their game to the next level while Porzingis and Holiday produce. Then, they need to hit their shots from beyond the arc.\n\nThe Mavericks are the heavy underdogs. However, when looking at this series, you have to consider the player matchups and what the elite players will do. In this case, there are four elite players: Doncic, Irving, Tatum, and Brown. Porzingis can certainly make a difference. Yet, there are questions as to how his calf will hold up. While Porzingis is saying all the right things, his return may hinder the team if he is not at 100 percent. The Mavericks already overcame the two best teams in the Western Conference, dispatching the Thunder in six games and the Wolves in five games. It's certainly not a stretch to see them do it again, toppling the best team in the Eastern Conference to win their second title.\n\nClick here for more betting news and predictions", "source":

Writers from Dallas, Boston make their Mavs-Celtics predictions", "body": "Ahead of the NBA Finals between the Dallas Mavericks and the Boston Celtics, columnists and beat writers from The Dallas Morning News and The Boston Globe collaborated to answer several questions and predict an outcome for the series, which starts Thursday in Boston.\n\nHere are their predictions:\n\nAdvertisementMike Curtis\n\nI've been 3-for-3 in predictions over the last three series, even though I was off by one game in the second and third rounds. The Celtics will be the toughest opponent the Mavs have faced during these playoffs, and the same can be said for Boston because of Dallas' superstar backcourt and versatility on both ends of the floor. Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving are in a good rhythm, and if their offense is taken away, they can resort to a potent lob game with their two big men, Daniel Gafford and Dereck Lively II.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI don't foresee many blowouts, and I think almost every game will go the distance, but I'm choosing the Mavericks in six games.\n\nMavericks\n\nBe the smartest Mavericks fan. Get the latest news.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nOr with:\n\nGoogleFacebook\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nTim Cowlishaw\n\nDallas goes where Luka goes, and Luka is the best player in the league today. Certainly he's the best player in the league still active. I think the Celtics can do a better job on Kyrie Irving than the Wolves did -- probably with Jrue Holiday guarding him -- but there's not that much to be done against Luka.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe teams have had a week or more to rest, and there's an extra off day in the Finals between all games except 3 and 4 here in Dallas. That's to Luka's benefit more than anyone's. The Celtics have had a soft playoff run against Miami without Jimmy Butler and others, Cleveland without Donovan Mitchell and an Indiana team that's new to the playoff hunt.\n\nBoston has been just as good as Dallas (maybe better) at closing out games, but I'll still take Doncic with the ball in his hands for the final shot over Tatum, Brown and the rest. Sometimes teams just get on a roll, and Dallas is on one. Mavericks in five.\n\nShawn McFarland\n\nCeltics in seven games. That's no disrespect to the Mavericks, either. The Celtics had the best net rating in the regular season and postseason, Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are playoff-tested, and Boston has lost just twice in three rounds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis clearly isn't the same Mavericks team that Boston beat twice in the regular season, of course, which sets up a competitive series. Don't be surprised if Dallas takes one of the first two road games, though, to create a pivotal stretch at American Airlines Center.\n\nAdvertisementKevin Sherrington\n\nPicking the Mavs to beat the Celtics feels like an affront to logic. Boston was, by record, the league's best team and has been one of the best three years running. Some of us can still remember when the Mavs lost five of six after the deadline and Kidd's job seemed in jeopardy. Still like to know what all went down in that famous team meeting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven as well as they played against Oklahoma City and Minnesota, the Mavs benefited from facing unseasoned players. Boston is a different story. But, these days, so is Dallas. I don't think the Mavs will beat the Celtics, but I'm tired of being wrong. Mavs in seven.\n\nBrad Townsend\n\nBoston was the best NBA team over the course of the season, but Dallas has been the best team of the past 2.5 months.\n\nThe Celtics' 10-day layover between games, and [Kristaps] Porzingis not having played in two months, will be factors early in the series -- along with the fact that Boston hasn't faced competition of Dallas' caliber since the regular season, as the Celtics' playoff path has been paved against injury-racked opponents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose factors will help Dallas win one of the first two games in Boston. After that, the series will come down to the Mavericks having the series' best player, Doncic, and the series' best two closers, Doncic and Irving. Mavericks in six.\n\nChad Finn\n\nCeltics in 6. The Mavericks have the best player in the series in Luka Doncic, and the biggest wild-card in Kyrie Irving, who has been playing magnificent basketball but has some, uh, baggage with the Celtics. They are a duo to be reckoned with, capable of stealing games on their own. But they will not steal the series, because the Celtics are the better team. Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are a dynamic duo, but it's the depth and versatility of the Celtics' top six that will deliver Banner 18 to Boston, particularly the selfless backcourt duo of Jrue Holiday and Derrick White.\n\nAdam Himmelsbach\n\nCeltics in 5. I think this is the first time I've ever picked the Celtics to win a title. But it's going to happen. There's a reason they won 14 more games than the Mavericks during the regular season, and even though they've traveled a smoother road during these playoffs, they've mostly dismantled their competition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEveryone will be watching Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving and their wizardry with the basketball, but the other end of the floor will be most important, as the Celtics relentlessly hunt mismatches against both players, tiring them out in the process.\n\nChristopher L. Gasper\n\nCeltics in 6. The Celtics finally face a team with its full complement of talent. The dynamic duos of Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown and Luka Don\u010di\u0107 and Kyrie Irving cross each other out. But Boston's path to Banner 18 is strength in numbers. The Celtics have multiple players who can form a Big Three with The Jays any given night -- Jrue Holiday, Derrick White, Al Horford, and a returning Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is, who like Irving is seeking Finals redemption against a former team. The Celtics margin for error and victory is simply greater than that of the peaking Mavs.\n\nAdvertisementDan Shaughnessy\n\nMavericks in 7. Please don't be offended. It's Jayson Tatum's time. It's Jaylen Brown's time. The Celtics have the best roster, won the most games, and are 12-2 in the playoffs. But I still don't trust them and have nightmares about Kyrie Irving winning it here.\n\nKhari Thompson\n\nCeltics in 6. The Celtics have too much depth on both ends of the floor for Dallas to match. All five starters, plus Al Horford, have shown that they can take over a game offensively. They've rolled through the first three rounds without Kristaps Porzingis. Jayson Tatum's 3-point shot isn't falling, but his game is so well-rounded that it hasn't mattered much. Stopping Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving will be a tall task, but there's arguably no team better equipped to contain them than the Celtics, who have one of the league's best defensive backcourts in Jrue Holiday and Derrick White.\n\nAdvertisementGary Washburn\n\nCeltics in 6. The Celtics have a deeper team, have had more than a week to prepare and appear ready for this moment. There are no excuses. They are healthy with Kristaps Porzingis returning, rested, and motivated. The Mavericks will be their biggest challenge and it will take more than this team has ever given to win a playoff series, but they are capable and it's their time.\n\nRelated StoriesView MoreFrom

Mandatory Credit: David Butler II-USA TODAY Sports / David Butler II-USA TODAY Sports\n\nJayson Tatum sat on the Boston Celtics bench alone, distraught with a towel over his head as the Celtics were about to fall in Game 6 of the 2022 NBA Finals. The superstar did not perform up to standard, with the Celtics losing in a learning curve to the experienced Golden State Warriors.\n\nTwo years later with much more battles and reps under his belt along with his growth and improvement, Tatum is motivated for his second chance to prove himself on the game's biggest stage.\n\n\"I would say part of my motivation is I just love to win,\" Tatum said. \"Understanding the moment that I know how hard it is to get to the Finals. You think that you're young, if you've been once, you'll continue to keep going. We realized that last year. We kind of took it for granted at certain moments. We didn't make it to the Finals. This year, put things in perspective. I think you can see in our excitement when we won the conference. Obviously, that's not the end all, be all, but it really is tough to get to this moment.\"\n\nThe way last season ended in the East Finals is a primary fuel added to the fire of the new-look Celtics and their title quest. Tatum has averaged 29.6 points, 10.3 rebounds, and 6.4 assists in his last eight games.\n\n\"I think right now just staying present in the moment. I'm not thinking about what it would mean for my legacy or anything like that. Just excited to play some basketball after this long break and go out there and try to get the job done.\"\n\nGame 1 against the Dallas Mavericks begins Thursday night at 8:30 EST at TD Garden.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nCeltics Stars Reflect on Lessons Learned from 2022 NBA Finals\n\nKristaps Porzingis Details Mental Side of Rehab as He Readies for NBA Finals Return\n\nKyrie Irving Shares Regret and What He Takes from Playing in Boston\n\nCeltics' All-Defensive Guards Relishing Chance to Defend Kyrie Irving and Luka Doncic\n\nJayson Tatum Grateful for Second Chance in NBA Finals\n\nJoe Mazzulla Eviscerates Contrived Narrative about Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown\n\nCeltics-Mavericks NBA Finals Has Kyrie Irving Between Boston and Banner 18", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler_Bulldogs_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Butler Bulldogs men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Mazzulla", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Mazzulla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4361,h_2453,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/inside_the_celtics/01hznbs9zsy0v45bzx1n.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

The Celtics had the best regular-season record in the league and were a clear favorite to win the Eastern Conference side of the playoffs when the postseason began. The Dallas Mavericks were not expected to be here.\n\nNow, the two teams meet in Game 1 on Thursday. Boston is a significant favorite for both the opening game and the series.\n\nIt's a matchup of teams featuring star duos. Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown were drafted by the Celtics with the third pick in consecutive years (Brown in 2016, Tatum in 2017) and have been leading the team for several years. Luka Don\u010di\u0107 joined Dallas as the third pick in 2018, but only late last season got united with Kyrie Irving. That Dallas duo has started to click with the Mavs going on a 16-2 run late in the regular season before both sat out the final two games of the regular season. Dallas entered the postseason as the No. 5 seed in the Western Conference but has been playing much better than that for three months now.\n\nThe way these two teams have been playing this postseason makes it seem like this series should be competitive, but the odds are saying otherwise. The odds are implying a nearly 70 percent chance for Boston to win the series. The most likely series outcome in the odds is Boston in five games, which is +300 on BetMGM.\n\nBoston hasn't been tested this postseason. The Celtics are 12-2 in the playoffs and swept the Eastern Conference finals, although Indiana blew late leads in three of the four games in that series. Boston also played multiple games in every series with the opposing team missing arguably its best player. The Celtics have mostly cruised through the playoffs, but a healthy Dallas team should be a significant step up in competition.\n\nDallas has also avoided major drama this postseason. The Mavs beat Minnesota in five games in the Western Conference finals and won the first two rounds in six games. Dallas did this while also starting every series on the road.\n\nThese teams met twice in the regular season with Boston winning both games. Tatum averaged 35.5 points while Don\u010di\u0107 averaged 35 points per game. Buckle up.\n\nAny title is usually legacy-defining, but that might be especially true in this series. Tatum and Brown have not yet won a title despite being among the main contenders for the last few years. Boston made the NBA Finals two years ago but lost to Golden State in six games. Can they prove to be winners, or will this year end in another near-miss?\n\nDon\u010di\u0107 is taking part in his first NBA Finals. No one is doubting the ability of the Slovenian, who is arguably the best guard in the league, but he still has to win a title at some point to be among the true greats of the sport. He hasn't had a strong supporting cast for much of his young career, but with Irving on board, the Mavs are in the Finals. Irving already won with LeBron James in Cleveland in 2016 and was crucial in upsetting Golden State that year. If he wins with another team, he will cement his legacy as a winning player.\n\nFor all the talk of the stars, will any supporting cast members stand out in this series? P.J. Washington has had some standout games this playoffs for Dallas, mostly in the second round against Oklahoma City, and Derrick White had some heaters for Boston. Will those two play decisive roles in any games this series or will it all be about the star duos?\n\nCeltics vs. Mavericks: How this intriguing NBA Finals matchup will be won on the court\n\nHow Luka

Raphielle Johnson, Noah Rubin, Zak Hanshew, and Ameer Tyree offered their thoughts on what's sure to be a thrilling conclusion to the NBA season.\n\nQ: Who are you picking to win and why?\n\nRaphielle Johnson: I'm taking the Celtics in six games. They've been the best team in the NBA all season long, and during the conference finals, they displayed solid growth regarding how they close games offensively. The addition of Jrue Holiday and his defensive impact will help the Celtics attack the Doncic/Irving tandem, and they have options that the teams Dallas eliminated to reach this point lacked. Also, the time off should help Kristaps Porzingis; he's reportedly on track to be available for Game 1, which will give Boston a welcome boost in the frontcourt.\n\nNoah Rubin: Celtics in five. Full disclosure, I'll be rooting for Dallas to win and for the series to go seven games. However, this Boston team just feels inevitable. While they haven't faced much healthy competition yet this postseason, they were able to make quick work of every team they have played. The moves they made this summer gave them the best top six in the league, and it has shown all year. The extra rest has given time for Kristaps Porzingis to heal up, and with both teams pretty healthy, it will come down to talent. Simply put, the Celtics are the better team on paper, and I think their defense is set up perfectly to try and slow down Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving. Boston has won their last ten games against Kyrie, including their sweep of the Nets in 2022. I don't expect the Celtics to dominate every game, but this team has been the title favorite all year for a reason.\n\nZak Hanshew: I'm going Dallas in six. Boston comfortably led the NBA in games won this season, and the team has arguably the most talented starting five from top to bottom. This isn't a Tuesday in March... this is the NBA Finals. Imagine it's a two-point game with three minutes to play. Which Celtic is taking over? Will it be Jayson Tatum, who's having one of his worst playoff runs in recent memory? Will it be Jaylen Brown, who won the Eastern Conference Finals MVP award? Will it be Derrick White or Jrue Holiday, who can get hot at times? Maybe Kristaps Porzingis gets hot in his first game back. There are no questions when we look at the Mavericks. Dallas has a killer who wants the ball in his hands at the end of the game and is not afraid of the brightest lights. I'm picking the team with the best player on the court in Luka Doncic. Don't forget about Kyrie Irving, another one of the best closers in the Association who has already proven himself when he hit the go-ahead triple in Game 7 of the 2016 Finals in Golden State.\n\nAmeer Tyree: The Celtics should get the job done this time around. I'm picking the Celtics to win in six games. They were far and away the best team at home in 2023-24, are set to get Kristaps Porzingis back, and have had plenty of time to rest and prepare for the Mavericks. Boston has more offensive options and a more capable defense, so I'm backing them to take care of business. They've long been considered the most well-rounded team in basketball and should benefit from having an abundance of youth and big-time playoff game experience. Boston added a player with championship pedigree in Jrue Holiday and its perimeter defense is built to slow down the Mavericks' guard-centered offense.\n\nQ: Who is your Finals MVP and why?\n\nRaphielle Johnson: Jayson Tatum. There was some controversy regarding the Eastern Conference Finals MVP; I personally did not have a problem with Jaylen Brown winning it. Tatum wasn't his most efficient self against the Pacers, but he still produced solid numbers. I expect him to be better against the Mavericks, and a Boston championship would likely net him the Bill Russell Most Valuable Player award.\n\nNoah Rubin: Jayson Tatum. Even if Luka Doncic averages 40/10/10, the best player on the winning team is going to get this award. Jaylen Brown won the Eastern Conference Finals MVP despite Tatum having more points, rebounds and assists in the series. Not to say that the voters got it wrong, but I don't expect that result to repeat if Tatum has better numbers once again. Tatum wasn't great the last time they made the Finals, so I expect him to be much better this time around.\n\nZak Hanshew: I'm picking Dallas because they have the best player in the series and a man who should have received more love as the league's MVP. Of course, I'm picking Luka Doncic to win Finals MVP.\n\nRaphielle Johnson: I'm going with Al Horford. Even though Kristaps Porzingis is expected back for Game 1, Horford's presence within the rotation will remain important. The veteran center is better equipped to punish Dallas' bigs offensively than Rudy Gobert, as evidenced by the seven 3-pointers Horford made in Game 3 of the conference Finals. Against Indiana, he averaged 12.8 points, 7.3 rebounds, 1.5 assists, 1.0 steals, 1.8 blocks, and 2.8 3-pointers in 35 minutes, shooting 46.2% from the field and 80.0% from the foul line. Horford's play/production has improved by the round, out of necessity due to the Porzingis injury, but it's a clear sign that he still has plenty to give. If he can continue on that path, Boston will be well-positioned to win the title.\n\nNoah Rubin: Kristaps Porzingis. One advantage that Dallas can exploit is forcing Porzingis to switch onto Luka and Kyrie. Doncic obviously had a number of big shots over Rudy Gobert in the conference finals, and Boston will need to avoid that matchup as much as possible. Porzingis needs to be able to hold his own in those situations and force Daniel Gafford to guard him on the perimeter, which will open up driving lines for their star scorers. However, things will get difficult for the Celtics if the Mavs are able to take advantage of Porzingis as a defender, since everyone else can be effective when switched onto Luka or Kyrie.\n\nZak Hanshew: Dereck Lively II immediately springs to mind here following an impressive rookie campaign and even more impressive postseason performance. The X factor here, however, is Kyrie Irving. Despite boasting a number of quality defenders, Boston will have its hands full with Luka Doncic, and the team will have to settle for slowing him down or wearing him out rather than completely neutralizing him. In two matchups with the Celtics in the regular season, Luka averaged 35.0 points, 15.0 rebounds and 12.0 assists on 47.3% shooting. Irving, on the other hand, averaged just 21.0 points, 5.0 rebounds and 2.5 assists on just 41.8% shooting. This year's playoffs did a phenomenal job in showing how important role players are, but both Luka AND Kyrie will need to be elite to slay the Eastern Conference's 65-win juggernaut. Irving is not liked in Boston, so there will be an added element of vitriol when he faces his former team in Boston.\n\nAmeer Tyree: Derrick White has been as hot as any Celtic on offense at times this postseason while also being a defensive linchpin. If his shotmaking pop early in this series he could be the player who makes Boston overwhelming. Especially because he'll likely end up getting a Kyrie Irving matchup assignment.\n\nQ: Which team/player is under the most pressure?\n\nRaphielle Johnson: Tatum, Brown, and the Celtics. We've seen these two stars come up short multiple times in their respective careers. While Tatum is still 26 and Brown 27, patience isn't exactly a strength of most fans and analysts. Add in the fact that the Celtics rolled through the regular season and the playoffs, and they're no denying who will be under the most pressure in this series.\n\nNoah Rubin: Celtics/Jayson Tatum. Boston has made the Eastern Conference Finals six times in the past eight seasons and in five of Tatum's seven years in the league. That is an impressive feat, but this is only their second appearance in the NBA Finals during that stretch. After losing to the Heat in the conference finals last year, they reloaded by adding Porzingis and Holiday, and White has been incredible this season. They've even had players like Payton Pritchard step up this year in an expanded role. This is a stacked team that was built to win the championship, and it would be a disappointment if they didn't get it done. On the other side, this is the Mavs first trip to the NBA Finals without Dirk Nowitzki. Dallas wasn't even in the Play-In Tournament last year, and now they're four wins away from a ring. Doncic will eventually have pressure on him to win a ring every year, but it's only his first appearance. Boston has to get it done this year, or the narratives will get ugly.\n\nZak Hanshew: I've got to concur with Raph, here. Boston continues to win in the regular season and in the playoffs, but the core of Tatum and Brown has yet to bring home any hardware. This is arguably the most talented roster the duo has ever played with, and if they can't get it done after going 12-2 in the Eastern Conference, this season will be seen as a massive failure. Tatum's name is often mentioned when NBA fans and analysts try to name the top-5 or top-10 players in the league, though he's gotten a reputation as someone who wilts in big games. Can he overcome that reputation and change the narrative on what's been an otherwise phenomenally successful career to date?\n\nAmeer Tyree: Jayson Tatum is the player facing the most pressure. The young star is 0-1 in the NBA Finals and has benefited from amazing team structure for years.\n\nQ: What does this mean for X player legacy?\n\nRaphielle Johnson: Luka Doncic will be the new face of the NBA if the Mavericks win the title. He's never been \"disrespected\" in the conversations regarding the league's best players, but maybe his name should be mentioned more with regard to who will lead the league in the post-LeBron/Curry/KD years. Doncic has been playing at a high level since his early teenage years at Real Madrid, and he didn't skip a beat once he arrived in Dallas. However, the difference now is that he has a team that's built to win a championship. Get it done now, and this may signal the beginning of the \"Doncic Era\" in the NBA.\n\nNoah Rubin: Al Horford is a Hall of Famer with a ring. This take feels a little bold to me, which is why I like it. Horford won two rings in college at Florida and has made the All-Star Game five times as a pro. He also has one All-NBA third team, one All-Defensive second team and made the All-Rookie first team. Add in another ring to his resume, and the case gets stronger. Entering this series, Basketball Reference has him at a 12.2% chance to make the Hall of Fame, so a ring would give him a fighting chance. He isn't a lock to make it, but I think he has a strong case with a ring, especially if he continues to play past this season.\n\nZak Hanshew: Kyrie Irving is a top-5 PG of all time. Magic Johnson and Steph Curry are cemented among the top-5 at the position, and guys like John Stockton, Allen Iverson and Oscar Robertson often make their way into the discussion. Irving is regarded as arguably the best ball handler ever, but he can etch his name into another all-time list with four more wins. With a second Finals victory for a second team and a strong Finals performance, it will be tough to exclude Irving from the top-5 PG conversation.\n\nAmeer Tyree: Tatum wants to take another step and become an undisputed top-5 player. The discussion could shift from him being a promising, young superstar to a disappointment with another championship loss.\n\nQ: Which of these guys (if any) can boost/diminish his 2024-25 fantasy stock with a big/poor performance?\n\nRaphielle Johnson: A player who could potentially boost his 2024-25 fantasy stock in this series is PJ Washington. Based on his Yahoo ADP (128.1), he wasn't a player most managers expected to see produce a top-100 season. However, he was a top 100 player after being traded to Dallas, finishing just outside of that threshold in season-long value. Playing off of Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving did result in a slight decrease in Washington's scoring, but the rebounds, steals, and blocks all increased.\n\nNoah Rubin: Daniel Gafford/Dereck Lively II. They both have helped their stock already, and now they'll have one more series for us to evaluate. Will one of them seize control of the starting center minutes? Will one of them falter, forcing the other to play more minutes? Will they both play well enough to provide value in a minutes split. This four-game series shouldn't be the only factor ahead of drafts next season, but if one of them plays noticeably better, the rotation could swing in favor of either big heading into next season.\n\nZak Hanshew: It's got to be PJ Washington. At this point, fantasy managers know what they'll get from Dereck Lively II and Daniel Gafford. Both guys will be great rebounders and blockers with the occasional scoring outburst when the lobs are plentiful. Can Washington consistently be the guy we hoped he would be for Charlotte? Can he score and rebound at a high level while hitting threes and making a concerted effort on defense?\n\nAmeer Tyree: PJ Washington's long-range shooting was huge in the Western Conference Finals and he's effectively working as his team's third option on offense. An impressive NBA Finals performance could help him lock in a significant role in 2024-25 after falling by the wayside in his last run with the Hornets.", "source": {"uri": "nbcsports.com",

It's tough to judge them because just about anything can happen during a series. Certain players can go off. Certain role players might step up.\n\nThe best way to get an idea of how things might go, though, is to look at the matchup in the regular season. Is it a perfect way to inform how the NBA Finals will go? No, of course not. But it's a solid start.\n\nIf we're looking at the head-to-head matchups between the Mavericks and Celtics to try and glean anything about these upcoming NBA Finals, it seems like Boston has a pretty solid advantage at this point.\n\nThe Celtics beat the Mavericks both times they saw each other during the regular season this year.\n\nOne win came ahead of the trade deadline on January 22 with Boston winning 119-110 The other win came a bit after the deadline on March 1 with Boston destroying Dallas in a 138-110 win.\n\nDuring both wins, the All-Star players for both sides were healthy. Luka Doncic had his way for the most part, averaging 35 points, 15 rebounds and 12 assists through two games against Boston. But the Celtics picked Dallas' defense apart, hitting a total of 36 3-pointers between the two games played.\n\nThis doesn't necessarily mean anything one way or another. The Mavericks are a different team with better chemistry since that moment. The Celtics also aren't necessarily the most healthy with Kristaps Porzingis potentially missing time in this series.\n\nBut this is just here to serve as a quick glance in what we've already seen from these two teams going up against each other.\n\nWhy Kyrie Irving left the Boston Celtics, explained Here's how Grant Williams could get a championship ring from the Celtics-Mavericks NBA Finals The Lakers are reportedly targeting Dan Hurley as coach and fans were stunned at the turn of events", "source": {"uri": "ftw.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "For The Win"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_d_sykes@ftw.usatoday.com", "name": "Mike D.

Meanwhile, the Mavericks seek to steal home-court advantage in their quest for the franchise's first NBA title since 2011.\n\nTRENDING\n\nThe underdog Mavs have been popular with the public ahead of Game 1, which is understandable considering Dallas has covered the spread in seven of its past eight road games. The Mavs have been backed by 74 percent of the spread-line money at BetRivers, where they have also drawn 57 percent of the moneyline handle at +200.\n\nBoston has won eight consecutive games against Western Conference opponents, and the Celtics have won the first half in each of their past five meetings against the Mavs.\n\nThe Over/Under at the book was at 215.5 on Thursday morning, with the Over heavily supported with 84 percent of the money.\n\nPROP PICKS\n\n--Luka Doncic Over 31.5 Points (-110 at DraftKings): This has been the most popular player point total prop at the book, and Dallas' superstar averaged 32.4 points in the team's five-game win over the Minnesota Timberwolves in the Western Conference Finals. That was a significant uptick from averaging 24.7 points in the six-game series win over Oklahoma City in the semis.\n\n--Jaylen Brown Over 20.5 Points (-265 at BetRivers): The book reported 4.7 percent of the total player prop bets ahead of Game 1 have backed the Over on Brown's point total. Dallas has a superior defense to Indiana's, but Brown did average 29.8 points in the sweep of the Pacers while scoring at least 24 in each game.\n\nSTARS REBORN\n\nDallas guard Kyrie Irving and Boston big man Kristaps Porzingis find themselves pitted against their former teams, with Irving's breakup with the Celtics much messier than Porzingis' departure from the Mavericks.\n\nIrving spent two seasons in Boston (2017-19) and told fans that he planned on re-signing with the Celtics.\n\nThat didn't happen, though, and Irving broke for the Brooklyn Nets once the summer rolled around. He has been met with boos when playing in Boston ever since, and his teams have lost the past six games against the Celtics.\n\nBut a hostile environment is the last thing Irving is worried about on the NBA's biggest stage.\n\n\"There's no fear out here, man. It's basketball,\" Irving said. \"The fans are going to say what they're going to say. I appreciate them and their relationship they have to the game. But it's about the players at the end of the day.\"\n\nDallas moved on from Porzingis at the 2022 trade deadline, shipping him to the Washington Wizards after deciding that he wasn't the right piece to pair with Doncic.\n\n\"I don't know why it didn't work out,\" Doncic said. \"We were still both young. We tried to make it work, but it just didn't work.\"\n\nDROUGHT STRICKEN\n\nBoth teams are trying to win a championship for the first time in over a decade. The Mavericks' last title came in 2011, while Boston hasn't gone all the way since 2008.\n\nThe Celtics had a golden opportunity to secure their 18th title in franchise history just two years ago, but they fell 4-2 to the Golden State Warriors in the Finals. Looking back on it now, Boston star Jayson Tatum thinks there was a silver lining in coming up short.\n\n\"It was a lesson to be learned,\" Tatum said. \"I told myself that if I ever got the opportunity again to make it to the Finals, that (I'd) never take it for granted. Obviously, we're here now and thankful to be here.\n\n\"I'm excited to get ready to play and have fun (Thursday).\"\n\nDallas, on the other hand, will be appearing in the Finals for the first time since its title run 13 years ago. Irving, Markieff Morris and Derrick Jones Jr. are the only Mavericks with experience in this stage of the postseason.\n\n\"Some of us for the Mavs have been here, some of us haven't,\" said Dallas coach Jason Kidd, who was the starting point guard on the Mavericks' 2011 championship team. \"We're going to embrace that and find a way to hopefully win a series.\"\n\nINJURY REPORT\n\nBeating the Celtics could get a lot harder depending on the health of Porzingis, who has missed the past 10 games due to a right soleus (calf) strain. Porzingis will be good to go for Game 1, but he's unsure if he will be operating at 100 percent.\n\n\"I did as much as I could to prepare for this moment, but there's nothing like game minutes and game experience that I'm going to get (Thursday),\" Porzingis said. \"It will be tough to jump into the Finals like this.\"\n\nPREDICTION\n\nThe Celtics have been riding a high since their improbable final-minute comeback against Indiana to kick off the conference finals. The 6.5-point line is a big one to swallow, so we're more focused on Game 1 odds contributing to a slow start and backing the Under at 215.5 points. -- Celtics 109, Mavericks 104", "source": {"uri":

Mavericks vs. Celtics picks, predictions and odds", "body": "Who will win 2024 NBA Finals? Mavericks vs. Celtics picks, predictions and odds\n\nJeff Zillgitt, USA TODAY\n\nJune 5, 2024 at 1:05 PM\n\nDallas' run to the NBA Finals is impressive.\n\nThe Mavericks beat the 51-win Los Angeles Clippers, 57-win Oklahoma City Thunder and 56-win Minnesota Timberwolves with Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving starring and a capable cast of know-their-role guys providing support, including trade-deadline acquisitions P.J. Washington from Charlotte and Daniel Gafford from Washington.\n\nSince the deadline the Mavs have been one of the best teams in the league, showing marked improvement offensively and defensively. They rely on Doncic's playmaking but they have other capable scorers, make enough 3s and love alley-oop lobs.\n\nBoston is a force. The Celtics possessed the NBA's best offense and No. 2 defense and had a league-best 64 victories. When Kristaps Porzingis is in the lineup, the Celtics have the best starting five in the league and are the best two-way team in the league. They have multiple scorers, led by Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum, and it's not unusual for a third player (Jrue Holiday, Derrick White, Porzingis) to score 20 in a game. Defensively, they have size, strength and length and two All-Defense selections in Holiday and White. They come at an opponent several different ways, and the pressure is constant.\n\nThe Celtics like their 3s, and they're proficient at making them. When 3s are going in and Brown and Tatum are both in the 20s, the Celtics are tough to beat.\n\nHere are USA TODAY Sports' NBA experts' picks and predictions for the 2024 Finals:\n\nNBA Finals predictions\n\nScooby Axson\n\nThis potentially will come down to which duo plays better: Kyrie and Luka or Tatum and Brown? But the X-factor is Kristaps Porzingis. If he can give them anything after coming back from a 10-game absence because of a calf injury, the Celtics should hoist banner No. 18, because they are just too deep and too good.\n\nCeltics in six\n\nCydney Henderson\n\nThe Celtics had a fairly uncontested route to the NBA Finals, facing the Miami Heat, Cleveland Cavaliers and Indiana Pacers, all of whom were missing major star power, including Jimmy Butler (Heat), Donovan Mitchell (Cavaliers), Jarrett Allen (Cavaliers) and Tyrese Haliburton (Pacers). But the Celtics will face a superstar pair in Doncic and Irving. The series will be a close one, but the Mavericks have the closers to get this done.\n\nMavericks in six\n\nLindsay Schnell\n\nI believe in underdogs - and particularly in Luka's ability to break hearts.\n\nMavericks in seven\n\nJeff Zillgitt\n\nThe Celtics have too many offensive weapons and too many defensive options so unless their offense takes a dip for an extended time, the Celtics will win the title.\n\nCeltics in six\n\n2024 NBA Finals odds\n\nHere are the betting odds for the NBA Finals, per BetMGM:\n\nCeltics: -225\n\nMavericks: +180\n\nGannett may earn revenue from sports betting operators for audience referrals to betting services.

Kevin Garnett says that has more to do with the Celtics than their competition.\n\nHighlights Celtics cruised through the Eastern Conference and are headed to the NBA Finals to face the Dallas Mavericks. Critics argue path was easy for Boston due to injuries to opposing teams as the Celtics face their toughest test yet. Kevin Garnett defended the Celtics, says road wins and close-outs have been impressive in playoffs.\n\nThe Boston Celtics dominated their way through the Eastern Conference during their run to the NBA Finals.\n\nEn route to their upcoming championship series against the Dallas Mavericks, the Celtics have a 12-2 record so far in the postseason, with no opposing team ever leading them in a playoff series or winning more than one game against them.\n\nSome critics of the Celtics have argued that they've had a bit of a cakewalk to the Finals. In every series they've played thus far, the Celtics' opposition have dealt with injuries that forced star players to miss a few games: the Miami Heat lost Jimmy Butler, the Cleveland Cavaliers lost Donovan Mitchell, and the Indiana Pacers lost Tyrese Haliburton.\n\nGoing up against the Mavericks, the Celtics will undoubtedly face their toughest test so far in the playoffs, but just because Boston dominated their way through the East doesn't mean their path was easy.\n\nSpeaking on his podcast \"Ticket & The Truth,\" former Celtics star big man Kevin Garnett blasted critics who claimed Boston's path to the Finals wasn't challenging enough.\n\n\"I think people want this big-ass f------ drama or something because all of the other series have been like this,\" Garnett said. \"'Oh, when LeBron made it and when Kobe did this and Michael Jordan.' Listen, man. Their path is their path. First off, it's not on the Celtics that guys are getting hurt, not playing, falling out of the lineup, etc. There are still other professionals coming in, playing hard as s--- and still trying to win. And to close out a game on the road? Man, I don't know what people want.\"\n\nGarnett argued that if you want a dramatic playoff series, it takes two to tango, and that the Celtics' performance on the road and in close-out games has been as impressive as what any team has done in the postseason.\n\n\"They think you can just hit a button and all of a sudden you're tied. No, man. You have to go win on the road and it's hard as s--- to go win on the road, and it's even more hard to close out a team,\" Garnett said. \"But for all this other s--- they can't control and that's out of their control -- get the f--- out of here with that. This is what it is.\"\n\nCeltics Are on the Cusp of Their First Title Since Garnett's Run to the Championship There's a new generation of stars in Boston.\n\nThe Celtics haven't won an NBA title since 2008, when the \"Big 3\" of Garnett, Paul Pierce, and Ray Allen took down Kobe Bryant and the Los Angeles Lakers in six games.\n\nSince then, a new era has blossomed in Boston, with the star duo of Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown set to lead the franchise for years to come. Tatum and Brown have already led the Celtics to a lot of success, including a Finals appearance two years ago. This year, they were the best team in the East through the regular season by a whopping 14 games.\n\nWith all that success, they still have yet to raise a championship banner. They'll get the chance to change that starting Thursday with Game 1 of the NBA Finals in Boston.\n\nRelated Jayson Tatum's Defense for Celtics a Key to Storyline To Watch in NBA Finals Jayson Tatum's defense for the Boston Celtics may be flying a bit under the radar right now.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Garnett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Garnett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Butler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Butler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donovan_Mitchell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donovan Mitchell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_Bryant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kobe Bryant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Pierce", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Pierce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Allen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ray Allen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Ethnic_and_Regional", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Ethnic and Regional", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Highland_Games", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Highland Games", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/jayson-tatum-board.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

The Mavericks' previous NBA Finals appearances both came against the Miami Heat. They lost in six games in 2006 but upset the heavily favored, LeBron James-led Heat in six games in 2011 for the franchise's first championship. Conversely, the Celtics can take the NBA's all-time lead in titles with 18 should they prevail in the 2024 NBA Finals.\n\nTipoff is set for 8:30 p.m. ET from TD Garden. Boston is a 6.5-point favorite and the over/under for total points scored is 215.5 in the latest Celtics vs. Mavericks odds from the SportsLine consensus. Before making any Mavericks vs. Celtics picks for Game 1 of the 2024 NBA Finals, be sure to check out what legendary handicapper Bruce Marshall has to say.\n\nMarshall, who for years was synonymous with the Gold Sheet, a famed sports betting newsletter, is an in-demand guest on numerous sports talk radio and TV shows across the country. Marshall's vast array of editorial work has been featured in the Las Vegas Review-Journal, the New York Post and many other outlets.\n\nHe has won various handicapping titles and also has emerged as a top analyst for SportsLine. Marshall has crushed his NBA picks this season for SportsLine members, entering this matchup on a 196-144 run that has returned more than $3,800 for $100 players. Anyone following him already has seen massive returns.\n\nNow, he has set his sights on Mavericks vs. Celtics and locked in his picks and NBA Finals predictions. You can visit SportsLine now to see his picks. Here are several NBA odds and betting lines for Celtics vs. Mavericks:\n\nMavericks vs. Celtics point spread: Celtics -6.5Mavericks vs. Celtics over/under: 215.5 pointsMavericks vs. Celtics money line: Celtics -250, Mavs +200DAL: The Mavericks are 11-6 against the spread in the 2024 NBA playoffs.BOS: The Celtics are 31-23-3 ATS as a favorite of 6.5 or more points this season. Mavericks vs. Celtics picks: See picks at SportsLineWhy the Celtics can cover\n\nThe Celtics already stood to have a significant depth advantage over the Mavericks in the NBA Finals, but that gap stands to perhaps get even wider with the anticipated return of versatile big man Kristaps Porzingis. Porzingis was injured late in Boston's first-round series against the Miami Heat and was projected to return during the conference finals. But when the Celtics took control of that series, they chose to take a risk-averse approach and give the seventh-year pro even more rest ahead of the NBA Finals.\n\nAccording to numerous reports, Porzingis has participated in multiple full-contact scrimmages in recent practices ahead of Game 1 and is on track to return to live action. Whether he resumes his role as a starter remains to be seen, but he emerged as one of Boston's most important pieces throughout the season. Porzingis averaged 20.1 points, 7.2 rebounds and 2.0 assists per game in 57 regular-season games. See which team to pick here.\n\nWhy the Mavericks can cover\n\nDallas' trade-deadline acquisitions of both versatile forward P.J. Washington and defensive stalwart Daniel Gafford have been an enormous boost, as both have repeatedly come up big in the postseason. In addition, the insertion of journeyman Derrick Jones Jr. into the starting lineup was a catalyst behind Dallas leading the NBA in defensive efficiency for the last month-plus of the season.\n\nThe late evolution of perhaps the best supporting cast in the NBA served as a buffer for the emergence of Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving as one of the most dominant backcourts in playoff history. The playmakers have alternated taking over games in clutch time during the playoffs, and such an effort wasn't necessary as they led wire to wire in their 124-103 Game 5 closeout win over the Timberwolves in Minnesota. Doncic is averaging nearly a triple-double in the postseason, with averages of 28.8 points, 9.6 rebounds and 8.8 assists. Irving is putting up 22.8 points, 3.9 rebounds and 5.2 assists per game.

He has also identified a critical X-factor that makes one side of the spread a must-back.

It's the Boston Celtics against the Dallas Mavericks for this year's title. The Celtics swept the sixth-seeded Indiana Pacers to win the East, before the Mavericks eliminated the third-seeded Minnesota Timberwolves in five games. Either the Celtics or Mavs will win their first title in more than 10 years, and the full NBA Finals schedule is set.\n\nGame 1 is slated for Thursday, June 6, and this year's NBA Finals could run through Sunday, June 23. After a pair of quick conference finals, NBA fans wlll have gone six days without playoff basketball before the Finals tip off in Boston.\n\nThe Celtics, who won 64 games in the regular season, will have home-court advantage against the Mavs. Dallas did not have home-court advantage in any series in these playoffs as the West's No. 5 seed.\n\nThe Mavs knocked out the fourth-seeded Clippers, the top-seeded Thunder and third-seeded Wolves to win the West. The Celtics are 12-2 so far in these playoffs and knocked out the Heat, Cavaliers and Pacers to win the East for the second time in three years. Boston lost in six games to the Golden State Warriors in 2022.\n\n\"It's a lot that myself, and we, can learn from that experience being in the Finals, and this time, this go-around is a lot different,\" Celtics star Jayson Tatum said about his second trip to the Finals. \"Obviously, we've been there before, we came up short. And a great opportunity to make it to the Finals again. You don't always get a second chance, so really just looking at it as a second chance and trying to simplify things as much as we can.\"\n\nEvery 2024 NBA Finals game will air on ABC and will be streaming on fubo (try for free).

It was also their last appearance in the NBA Finals.\n\nThe Celtics have won 17 championships in their franchise history, but they actually have a longer title drought than the Mavs. Boston's last NBA title came in 2008. The Celtics -- who fell in the conference finals to the Heat last season -- last made the NBA Finals in 2022, but they lost against the Warriors in six games.\n\n2024 NBA Finals oddsCeltics: -230Mavericks: +180Game 1 pick, prediction\n\nI'm going Dallas across the board in Game 1. Until I have visual evidence that Kristaps Porzingis is healthy and able to move as well as he did defensively during the regular season, I just view him as a target for Luka Doncic to hunt in pick-and-roll. Immobile big men have no chance against him, and on an injured calf, Porzingis would be a constant switch target. Boston hasn't lost a road game yet this postseason, but the Celtics have looked surprisingly vulnerable at home, losing games to the Heat and Cavaliers and coming close in Game 1 against the Pacers. Worst-case scenario, the Mavericks haven't lost by seven or more points since Game 1 against the Thunder. With the points, I feel relatively safe. The Pick: Mavericks +6.5\n\n-- Sam Quinn", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brad_botkin@cbssports.com", "name": "Brad Botkin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_advantage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Home advantage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirk_Nowitzki", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dirk Nowitzki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "label": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/05/29/6edbf384-3ee7-4c65-a24b-6d800aad5374/thumbnail/1200x675/5d6e2aa466a5d0ce179f0f4fee6f4b39/luka-celtics-mavs-getty.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 60, "textEnd": 66, "freq": 3}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-23", "textStart": 552, "textEnd": 559, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-09", "textStart": 1913, "textEnd": 1919}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-12", "textStart": 1973, "textEnd": 1980}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-14", "textStart": 2031, "textEnd": 2038}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-17", "textStart": 2090, "textEnd": 2097}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 2151, "textEnd": 2158}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

How much do you have to pay to see it?\n\nThe 2024 NBA Finals will pit two of the marquee franchises in professional sports against one another on the grandest stage in basketball. The Boston Celtics will host the Dallas Mavericks in Game 1 of a series that will usher in a new era, led by a fresh slate of headlining talent.\n\nWith Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum leading Boston against Luka Doncic, Kyrie Irving and the Mavericks, all eyes will be on the new generation of prime-year superstars.\n\nIn order to get close eyes on this monumental showdown, however, you will need to pay a pretty penny. Not only is it the championship round in the NBA Playoffs, but Boston and Dallas are among the most recognizable organizations in North American sports.\n\nIn an article published by Sportico, the Celtics were listed as having a valuation of $5.12 billion, while Dallas at comfortably at $4.03 billion -- each in the top-11 of the NBA.\n\nThat valuation is influenced in large part by the fact that both organizations will be looking to win their second championship in less than 20 years. They're also led by All-NBA First Team stars in Doncic and Tatum who are looking to cement their status as the possible faces of the Association.\n\nIn a clash that will crown a new champion and a first-time Finals MVP, Boston and Dallas will prove how massive an event the NBA's highest level is.\n\nThe Celtics will host the Mavericks in Game 1 of the 2024 NBA Finals on Thursday, June 6 at TD Garden. As one might expect, the first three games are on pace to be far lower in cost than the rest.\n\nAs suspense builds and a championship grows nearer, the cost will reflect the likely increase in demand. As Game 6 and Game 7 ticket prices show, the market is already preparing for a likely clinching encounter.\n\nBased on the prices listed on Gametime, an interested fan can find a ticket to a game of the 2024 NBA Finals at the following rates:\n\nGame 7 comes in at $1,309. If you're willing to pay the price, you could be in for one of the greatest live experiences in all of sports -- assuming the game is necessary.\n\nWhile affordable tickets are often the preference, perhaps you prefer the finer things in life. The 2024 NBA Finals can certainly accommodate you, as the high range of ticket costs would enable you to purchase cars at market price.\n\nIt's a tall price to pay, but one that would likely enable you to witness the 2024 NBA Finals as closely as possible as Doncic and Irving go head to head with Brown and Tatum in a legacy-defining battle.\n\nAccording to StubHub, the following are the most expensive tickets to attend the 2024 NBA Finals.\n\nSuffice it to say, the level of excitement for the 2024 NBA Finals is astronomical for encounters that are likely to be sold out all the way through.", "source": {"uri": "hardwoodhoudini.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hardwood Houdini"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Tickets", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Tickets", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_8192,h_4608,x_0,y_508/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/18/01hzn052efe09jzerx85.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 1584, "textEnd": 1590}], "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

This is a much more dominant Celtics team than the unit from two years ago, as Boston finished with the league's best record and handled the Eastern Conference with ease during its playoff run.\n\nJayson Tatum and Eastern Conference Finals MVP Jaylen Brown have solidified themselves as the league's top two-way duo. Tatum and Brown, along with Jrue Holiday and Derrick White, have pushed the Celtics to the championship series. Al Horford has stepped up in the absence of Kristaps Porzingis, who missed the previous two rounds with a calf injury, but Porzingis is expected to be back for this series.\n\nDallas went through quite the gauntlet in the Western Conference to make it here, taking down the higher seed in each matchup. Behind the stellar play of Western Conference Finals MVP Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving, the Mavericks are in the NBA Finals for the first time since winning it all in 2011.\n\nThese teams have been built in a similar fashion with two stars surrounded by strong complementary pieces.

Will Jayson Tatum and the Celtics surpass the Lakers for most titles won, or will Luka and the Mavs bring home Dallas' first championship since 2011?\n\nThe Boston Celtics should win this year's NBA Finals over the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nLed by Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, they have the league's best record.\n\nThe Celtics are the best 3-point shooting team in terms of makes and boast one of the top defenses led by two NBA All-Defensive selections in Derrick White and Jrue Holiday.\n\nThey just have one problem. Well, two - Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving.\n\nThose two can break down any defense and close the close games like no others in the NBA.\n\nI'm still predicting the Celtics to win in six games, but it should be a great series that begins Thursday in Boston at 5:30 p.m. (Arizona time), on ABC. Love the coaching matchup between Joe Mazzulla, the 35-year-old coaching wiz, and Jason Kidd, one of the all-time greats as an NBA player who is proving he also can coach at the highest level.\n\nHoliday, White, Brown and Tatum enable Boston to switch on the perimeter, but Holiday and Brown also take pride in guarding their man through the screen.\n\nInterested in seeing who takes on the challenge of guarding Doncic and Irving. Thinking White checks Irving and Holiday guards Doncic when looking at the size Dallas has with P.J. Washington and Derrick Jones Jr., but maybe Boston decides to put White on, say, Jones Jr. and has Brown guard Doncic.\n\nHowever, the Mavs will target Kristaps Porzingis, who is returning from a right calf strain suffered in Game 4 of Boston's first round series against Miami, and Al Horford, who struggles at times defending the pick-and-roll.\n\nIt's tough enough guarding Doncic and Irving one-on-one, but if they're able to play downhill with Porzingis and Horford being the last line of defense, uh oh. Boston must present consistent perimeter resistance whether it's trapping Doncic or Irving, ball denial or just straight up man-to-man defense.\n\nIf the 3 isn't falling\n\nBoston not only led the NBA in 3-pointers made per game in the regular season at 16.5, but also in attempts at 42.5. They're the only team in the league to hoist 40-plus.\n\nNothing has changed in the postseason. The Celtics once again are first in the playoffs in made 3s at 14.6 and launched ones at 39.8, but they failed to reach those numbers in their two postseason defeats.\n\nThe Mavericks were 18 in defensive rating in the regular season at 114.9, as teams shot 36.8% against them from 3. They've improved those numbers in the playoffs - seventh (out of 16 teams) in defensive rating at 111.1 with opponents connecting on 35.6% of their 3s.\n\nCan the Mavs continue that trend against the NBA's top 3-point team?\n\nTatum settling?\n\nBoston generates great catch-and-shoot looks off ball movement, but takes its share off the bounce starting with Tatum. He has a frequency of 11.3 on 3s with zero dribbles and 9.9 on seven-plus dribbles.\n\nHe's shooting 25% from deep in both cases.\n\nTatum has taken 274 shots in the playoffs with 100 coming from 3. He's only made 29 of those 3s, but the All-NBA first team selection is a career 37.5% shooter from deep.\n\nBeing 6-8 with handles, Tatum could be just as much as a matchup problem for Dallas as Irving and Doncic will be for Boston. He's attempting 7.9 free throws in the playoffs, the most of any player in the finals. An attacking Tatum is a problem, but it's on him to consistently have that mentality.\n\nNo worries. The Celtics know how important he is, but not making All-NBA has Brown in even more of a show-and-prove mode.\n\nNow, that can work in two ways. Brown can either come out and play his best basketball or try to do too much at the expense of the team and turning the ball over.\n\nWinning Eastern Conference Finals MVP brings him some validation. Winning an NBA championship will add to that, but there's a fine line between wanting to answer doubters and playing your role.\n\nBrown's approach to the series is just as important as how he plays in it.\n\nWhich role players will step up?\n\nHoliday is the first name that comes to mind. He's not only won an NBA title, but Holiday provides what is required of him to help the Celtics.\n\nDefend one game. Score the next. Hit the open shot.\n\nFor Dallas, Daniel Gafford and rookie Dereck Lively II are lob threats on offense, but they must defend the paint to the point the Celtics, particularly Brown, aren't getting straight-line drives to the rim.\n\nIt's not always about blocking the shot. Altering them is just as effective.\n\nOne more - Doncic time\n\nHe made All-NBA first team for a fifth consecutive time after leading the NBA in scoring this season at 33.9 points a game. Finished third in the MVP voting.\n\nHit the most exciting shot of the playoffs in Game 2 at Minnesota - an icy, mean-mugging stepback 3 over now four-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year, 7-footer Rudy Gobert, with three seconds left to complete a comeback win and give Dallas a 2-0 series lead in the Western Conference Finals.\n\nThe word 'superstar' is used too loosely these days, but Doncic is one of them in the league. He controls pace without having tremendous speed or quickness, facilitates, rebounds and delivers in the clutch.\n\nThe only thing he's not is an NBA champion.\n\nDoncic is four wins away from that surrounded by his best collection of teammates since coming into the NBA with the best version of Irving on a redemption tour to show how great of a player he is.\n\nBoston isn't going to give him the championship. Doncic is going to have to earn it.\n\nThat's what the greatest ones have done. It's on you, Luka. Make it happen.", "source": {"uri": "azcentral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AZ Central"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arizona_republic@azcentral.com", "name": "Arizona Republic", "type": "author",

The storylines for the Boston Celtics vs. Dallas Mavericks are epic. Kyrie Irving and Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is battling against their former teams. Two uncrowned head coaches going head-to-head. Boston going for a league-record total of championships. Stars aiming to get their first ring.\n\nToday, we're breaking down some of these narratives in the context of the betting odds and polled our NBA experts to get their picks for the series winner, total games and NBA Finals MVP before the series officially kicks off.\n\nGame 1 is Thursday at 8:30 p.m. ET on ABC. Keep an eye out for odds previews and picks for each game, coming soon.\n\nThe Celtics, who start the series with home-court advantage, are favored to win the NBA Finals. If they do win, Boston will set a record for total NBA titles. They're currently tied with the rival Los Angeles Lakers with 17 NBA championships. But it would be the first for this specific squad, as the Celtics haven't won a championship since 2008.\n\nIn fact, regardless of which team wins this Finals, the championship will be a first-time coronation for some of the league's best players. Jayson Tatum, Luka Don\u010di\u0107 and Jaylen Brown are among the league's brightest stars right now, and none of them have a ring yet. This will be Don\u010di\u0107's first NBA Finals.\n\nSo, how do the Celtics and Mavericks stack up? Dallas is the sixth team in NBA history to make it to the Finals as a fifth seed or lower. They've delivered on the promise of being the scariest lower-seeded team, eliminating the No. 4 Clippers, No. 1 Thunder and No. 3 Timberwolves. Their two stars, Don\u010di\u0107 and Kyrie Irving, have proven to be elite closers.\n\nOn the other hand, Celtics coach Joe Mazulla has never lost to the Mavericks. He is 4-0 against Dallas head coach Jason Kidd. In their two matchups during the regular season, Boston put away Dallas by nine points in January and 28 points in March. And that was with Dallas at full strength both times.\n\nIf Porzi\u0146\u0123is comes back at 100 percent, the Celtics should be able to spread out the Mavericks better than any of the teams they've faced thus far. But will he be at 100 percent? Will incorporating him back into the lineup cause friction? The Mavericks will surely be testing for weak points.\n\nI like these odds for the Mavs right now. They're proving their clutch factor at the right time, though the Celtics have yet to give us any reason to think they're not the best team in the league.\n\nPrior to the first game on Thursday, the odds are very close for this series to go either five or six games. A sweep is far less likely with double the odds compared to seven games.\n\nIf both teams play at the level we've seen them in these playoffs, this should be a very competitive, exciting series. Most of our experts are predicting as much, going with six or seven games total.\n\nTatum is the favorite to win NBA Finals MVP, with Don\u010di\u0107 logically next in the odds. These are great odds for Don\u010di\u0107, who played lights-out in the Mavs' last series. Brown has been close to Tatum statistically in this postseason thus far. Of the top two favorites, Don\u010di\u0107 is averaging 28.8 points, 8.8 assists and 9.6 rebounds per game through the postseason, and Tatum is averaging 26 points, 5.9 assists and 10 rebounds per game.\n\nOur experts who picked the Celtics are divided on which player might get MVP, split between Tatum, Brown and even Jrue Holiday.\n\nEveryone picking the Mavs is picking Don\u010di\u0107.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hannah_vanbiber@nytimes.com", "name": "Hannah Vanbiber", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_advantage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home advantage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kidd", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jason Kidd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/06/05131830/GettyImages-2154456146-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

That's not a massive cloud of pollen, but the hype for the NBA Finals as the Celtics will finally tip off their championship showdown with the Dallas Mavericks on Thursday night.\n\nFinals Fever is everywhere. Kids are going to school decked out in green, and Celtics superfans are readying their attire for later this evening. Establishments around the commonwealth are gearing up for watch parties that will bring fans together for Boston's quest for a title. The Celtics even got Tom Brady to narrate a hype video that will really get Boston fans amped for the upcoming series.\n\nThe Celtics made it to the Finals two years ago, but this year feels different. It is different. Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are older and wiser (and much more skilled) as they enter their primes. Derrick White is much more comfortable in his role, and Kristaps Porzingis is returning to put the Celtics back at full strength. And you cannot discount Jrue Holiday, who not only brought shutdown defense and veteran leadership, but a ring that everyone could envy in the Boston locker room.\n\n\"I think this is a special group. I really do,\" Brown said at Wednesday's media day. \"The core group of it has been here for a few years now. We've been able to go through the experiences of having success but not having success at the same time.\n\n\"I think to solidify the ultimate goal is to get over the hump and win. I think that will add a lot to our legacy,\" added Brown. \"But as of right now, that story is kind of still untold.\"\n\nIt's hard not go get hyped up for this matchup, as the Celtics look to end a 16-year title drought. We'll be treated to four incredible stars of the league battling on the biggest stage, with Tatum and Brown set to square off against Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving. Doncic is a superstar scorer who can hit shots from anywhere at any time, and we all know the extra baggage Kyrie will bring to the series.\n\nBut will Dallas' offensive firepower be enough against Boston's stellar defense? We'll find out over the next few weeks.\n\nAll the hoopla is over. And now it's down to basketball. The Celtics weren't ready for this moment two years ago, but this definitely feels like their time to shine.\n\nAs Joe Mazzulla eloquently put it on Wednesday, the lights won't be too bright for his Celtics team.\n\n\"Unless they change the bulbs in the arena, there won't be any lights brighter than last series,\" Mazzulla joked.\n\nThis has been building for over a week, though it's felt more like months in Boston. The Celtics haven't played a game since completing an Eastern Conference Finals sweep of the Pacers on May 27. Tonight, they'll finally play Game 1 of the Finals, with tipoff set for right after 8:30 p.m.\n\nThe Celtics were the best team in basketball all season. They made the regular season look easy, and then overcame any adversity that came their way in their first three playoff series. The Celtics have that determined looked in their eyes, and are going to do whatever it takes to bring home a title.\n\nThat's not to say the Celtics aren't feeling some pressure. With 17 banners hanging in the TD Garden rafters, there is always pressure to win in Boston.\n\n\"Some of the greatest players to ever play this game wore this uniform. All of us are honored to follow in their footsteps, the way they paved for us to live out our dream,\" Tatum said Wednesday. \"Essentially, yeah, if you want to be one of the greats to put on this uniform, every great before you won a championship. That's what we try to play for every single season. The expectations are obviously different here. It takes special players to be here and to be a part of an environment like that.\"\n\nThese Celtics have been here before, so they know what is ahead of them. But just as a refresher, Brown said that he has gone back and watched the 2022 NBA Finals four or five times, and also looked back on last year's Eastern Conference Finals loss to the Miami Heat.\n\n\"I think you can always learn from anything really. But just being able to watch those moments and learn from them, how to manage your emotions, like, what you would have did differently potentially,\" explained Brown. \"I don't think that's bad to look at and acknowledge and be aware of.\"\n\nMazzulla agrees.\n\n\"You can pick numerous experiences that everybody in our locker room has been through that you need to be able to use for the situation we're in now. That will remain the same for the rest of our careers,\" said the Boston head coach. \"I think it's all about using what you've been through -- the good, bad, indifferent -- to help you in the present moment. The guys are doing it.\"\n\nMazzulla was just a bench coach the last time the Celtics were in the Finals, but he too is using that as a learning experience.\n\n\"The toughest team will win. The team that makes the most plays will win. The team that can execute the details at a high level will win. It's no different,\" he said. \"The biggest thing we took as we were going through that series against the Warriors, the things we kept coming back to were the things we kept talking about the entire year - the margins, details, fundamentals, the way you go about executing at a high level.\"\n\nThis has felt like a banner year since the Celtics acquired Porzingis last summer. That got an even bigger boost when Holiday was brought in just before the season.\n\nThe Celtics proved throughout the regular season and the playoffs that they were the best team in the league. Now they have one hurdle left to prove they're champions.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Mazzulla", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Mazzulla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Ethnic_and_Regional/European", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Ethnic and Regional/European", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Ethnic_and_Regional", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Ethnic and Regional", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/06/06/52965855-1c88-418a-9725-eaef0c48f29f/thumbnail/1200x630g2/52fad21e38b3a0c8bd2279ee43853c57/tatum-brown.jpg?v=6d480a252670b63de1e37fef02c977a5", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-27", "textStart": 2657, "textEnd": 2663}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Boston's most recent title came in 2008.\n\nThe Mavericks won their only NBA title in 2011 after reaching the 2006 final, losing to Miami.\n\nIrving will be the emotional heart of the series after his Boston stay and a playoff return with Brooklyn that went poorly.\n\n\"I'm better at consolidating the emotions now,\" Irving said. \"You call it animosity. We call it hate. We call it, 'It's going to be hell in Boston.'\"\n\n\"The last time in Boston (in the playoffs with Brooklyn), I don't think that was the best... everyone saw me flip off the birds and kind of lose my (cool) a little bit.\n\n\"I wasn't my best self at that time. I've been able to grow since then... I'm looking forward to it. I'll take the brunt of it, all the yells and all the remarks.\n\n'No stopping them'\n\n\"That wasn't a great reflection of who I am and how I like to compete on a high level.\"\n\nHe's on a high now, averaging 22.8 points in the playoffs as Slovenian guard Doncic, who averaged 33 points in the regular season, averages 28.8 points, 9.6 rebounds and 8.8 assists in the playoffs.\n\nBoston counters with two of the NBA's top defensive guards in Jrue Holiday and Derrick White.\n\n\"There's really no stopping them. You just try to make it difficult for them,\" White said. \"They're going to take tough shots and they're going to make tough shots. Just trust that over 48 minutes what we're doing is going to work.\"\n\nTatum averages 26.0 points and 10.4 rebounds in the playoffs with Brown averages 25.0 points with White and Holiday providing strong support and the team leading the NBA in 3-point shots and baskets. The Celtics are 9-0 when hitting 14 or more three-pointers.\n\n\"Boston shoots the three at a high rate,\" Mavs coach Jason Kidd said. \"They have a lot of talented players. They've been here before, they have the experience. They're well-coached. This is another great test.\"\n\nDallas center Dereck Lively isn't sweating the experience factor.\n\n\"They have a lot of tradition, but that doesn't matter. What matters is who's going to go harder on the court,\" Lively said. \"It's going to be a dogfight out there, but we're going to keep swinging and see what happens.\"\n\nBoston, which defeated the Mavericks in both meetings this season, expects to have Latvian center Kristaps Porzingis back from a right calf strain suffered on April 29 in the first round against Miami that benched him for 10 games.\n\n\"He has been working extremely hard just to get back and to help us in any way he can,\" White said.\n\n\"When KP is at his best, he has been tremendous for us,\" Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said. \"We expect that from him.\"", "source": {"uri": "philstar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Philstar.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The Mavericks defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves in the Conference Finals and is looking to earn their second NBA Championship in Franchise history. Meanwhile, the Celtics swept the Pacers and are hoping to win their first NBA Championship since 2008. Both teams played dominantly this season, but there can only be one team hoisting the Larry O'Brien Championship trophy. Who does NBA 2K24 have winning the first game of this series?\n\nMavericks vs. Celtics NBA Finals Game 1 Results According To NBA 2K24\n\nAccording to our NBA 2K24 Simulation, the Dallas Mavericks will defeat the Boston Celtics in Game 1 of the NBA Finals by a score of 101-93. The Celtics played well in the first quarter and a half, taking advantage of Dallas' missed shots and opportunities. However, the roles reversed near the end of the third quarter, as it was the Celtics who struggled to score.\n\nJayson Tatum converted a three-point shot with 48.2 seconds remaining in the third. The score at the time was 74-73 (Mavericks leading). The next time Boston scored wasn't until 8:46 remaining in the fourth quarter, when Jrue Holiday converted another three. In that time, Dallas scored 15 unanswered points, taking an 89-76 lead. Although they still had time to come back, Boston's offense wasn't able to get more points on the board.\n\nIn terms of player performances, Kyrie Irving earns the game ball tonight. He dropped 32 points while earning six rebounds, six assists, and a steal. Although he turned over the ball three times, his offensive performance catapulted Dallas to a Game 1 victory. We'd be remiss not to mention Luka Doncic, who dropped 22 points, 8 rebounds, and 9 assists, nearly earning a triple double. Nevertheless, he was integral to the team's victory.\n\nAs for the Celtics, Jayson Tatum was their only effective player on offense. He scored 29 points, earned 6 rebounds, 9 assists, and a steal during the game. However, only one other player on the team managed to score 10+ points, and that was Al Horford. Even with Kristaps Porzingis back on the court (and against his former team, the Celtics didn't do enough as a group to win this one.\n\nAdditionally, check out some game stats:\n\nWith the win, the Mavericks secure the first game of the NBA Finals. Winning is great, and winning on the road is even better. If they can beat Boston in Game 2, they can potentially end the series back home in Games 3 & 4. However, we don't think it'll be that easy for the Mavericks. But with players like Irving and Doncic, the team is primed to win their second Championship.\n\nWith the loss, the Celtics now trail, but at least only by one game. They have a chance to tie the series up at home in Game 2 before heading over to Dallas. The the team had a lead in the second quarter, so there's no reason to think they can't do it again. However, they'll just need to find a way to fend off the Mavericks' comeback attempts. We'll see if the Celtics can tie the series back up in Game 2.\n\nIn terms of accuracy, we believe the scoreboard reflects a realistic NBA game score. And if you've been keeping up with our sims, we're glad to see the Mavericks finally not dropping 130 points or more. We made some serious changes to the CPU Sliders to create more authentic scores. We didn't want the NBA Finals simulations to have both teams dropping unrealistic point totals.\n\nHowever, we still want to improve a few more aspects. Shot conversions seemed a tad too low, so we might need to make a slight adjustment.

But if he struggles, the Celtics will have to rely on depth in their frontcourt.\n\nExpect to see Porzingis give it a go as the series begins before the medical staff eventually decides if should continue with the rest of the NBA Finals or not. But given his road to get to where he is today, it's not surprising that he'll at least try.\n\nDan Hurley as coach of the Lakers makes more sense for Bronny James than it does for LeBron NBA Finals Game 1 odds and predictions: Luka Doncic on a rested knee could be trouble for Boston Here's how the Celtics and Mavericks stacked up against each other in the 2024 regular season Why Kyrie Irving left the Boston Celtics, explained Here's how Grant Williams could get a championship ring from the Celtics-Mavericks NBA Finals", "source": {"uri": "ftw.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "For The Win"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bryan_kalbrosky@ftw.usatoday.com", "name": "Bryan Kalbrosky", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronny_James", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronny James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Williams_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grant Williams (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://ftw.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/90/2024/02/USATSI_22303383-e1716317771356.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-29", "textStart": 746, "textEnd": 754}], "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

The top-seeded Celtics, who notched an NBA-best 64 wins in the regular season, coasted to the Eastern Conference title with relative ease, sweeping the Indiana Pacers in the conference finals. The resurgent Mavericks built on a late-season surge to earn the No. 6 seed in the Western Conference and have continued to improve during a 12-5 postseason run in which they never lost more than two games in a series. Their 4-1 series win over the Minnesota Timberwolves in the conference finals provided their first NBA Finals appearance since 2011.\n\nTipoff is set for 8:30 p.m. ET from TD Garden. Boston is a 6.5-point favorite and the over/under for total points scored is 214.5 in the latest Celtics vs. Mavericks odds from the SportsLine consensus. Before making any Mavericks vs. Celtics picks for Game 1 of the 2024 NBA Finals, be sure to check out what legendary handicapper Bruce Marshall has to say.\n\nMarshall, who for years was synonymous with the Gold Sheet, a famed sports betting newsletter, is an in-demand guest on numerous sports talk radio and TV shows across the country. Marshall's vast array of editorial work has been featured in the Las Vegas Review-Journal, the New York Post and many other outlets.\n\nHe has won various handicapping titles and also has emerged as a top analyst for SportsLine. Marshall has crushed his NBA picks this season for SportsLine members, entering this matchup on a 196-144 run that has returned more than $3,800 for $100 players. Anyone following him already has seen massive returns.\n\nNow, he has set his sights on Mavericks vs. Celtics and locked in his picks and NBA Finals predictions. You can visit SportsLine now to see his picks. Here are several NBA odds and betting lines for Celtics vs. Mavericks:\n\nMavericks vs. Celtics point spread: Celtics -6.5Mavericks vs. Celtics over/under: 214.5 pointsMavericks vs. Celtics money line: Celtics -250, Mavs +205DAL: The Mavericks are 11-6 against the spread in the 2024 NBA playoffs.BOS: The Celtics are 31-23-3 ATS as a favorite of 6.5 or more points this season. Mavericks vs. Celtics picks: See picks at SportsLineWhy the Celtics can cover\n\nThe Celtics appeared to be a step ahead of the rest of the NBA during the regular season, and their performance in the 2024 NBA playoffs has essentially served as an extension of this dynamic. Behind the most efficient offense in NBA history, they have bludgeoned the opposition with superior talent and a relentless pace that few opponents have matched. Moreover, they also have made clutch plays when they mattered most. In the Eastern Conference finals, the Pacers appeared to have a Game 1 upset wrapped up before the Celtics forced a turnover inside of 10 seconds and tied the game on a memorable corner 3-pointer from Jaylen Brown before dominating the overtime.\n\nWhat's more, the short-handed Pacers, who were without star Tyrese Haliburton for the last two games of the series, built double-figure leads in each of their home games only to see the resilient Celtics push through and win both contests by three points. Jayson Tatum has done much to change his reputation as a regular-season star who can't handle the bright lights of the playoffs. He is averaging 26 points, 10.4 rebounds and 5.9 assists in the 2024 NBA playoffs. See which team to pick here.\n\nWhy the Mavericks can cover\n\nDallas' trade-deadline acquisitions of both versatile forward P.J. Washington and defensive stalwart Daniel Gafford have been an enormous boost, as both have repeatedly come up big in the postseason. In addition, the insertion of journeyman Derrick Jones Jr. into the starting lineup was a catalyst behind Dallas leading the NBA in defensive efficiency for the last month-plus of the season.\n\nThe late evolution of perhaps the best supporting cast in the NBA served as a buffer for the emergence of Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving as one of the most dominant backcourts in playoff history. The playmakers have alternated taking over games in clutch time during the playoffs, and such an effort wasn't necessary as they led wire to wire in their 124-103 Game 5 closeout win over the Timberwolves in Minnesota. Doncic is averaging nearly a triple-double in the postseason, with averages of 28.8 points, 9.6 rebounds and 8.8 assists. Irving is putting up 22.8 points, 3.9 rebounds and 5.2 assists per game.

He has also identified a critical X-factor that makes one side of the spread a must-back. He's only sharing what it is, and which side to back, at SportsLine.\n\nSo who wins Mavericks vs. Celtics in Game 1 of the 2024 NBA Finals, and which side of the spread is a must-back?

Celtics Odds And Predictions", "body": "After 82 regular season games and three playoff rounds, the 30 NBA teams competing for a championship have been narrowed down to two, who will compete in the 2024 NBA Finals. The Eastern Conference champions, Boston Celtics (64-18), are set to play the Western Conference champs, Dallas Mavericks (50-32).\n\nRoad to the Finals:\n\nThe first-seeded Celtics finished the regular season with the best record in the NBA, and their playoff run was viewed as relatively easy. Considering that, in their first-round matchup, Boston beat the Miami Heat (4-1), who were playing without their best player Jimmy Butler (MCL sprain). Then in the Conference Semifinals the Celtics beat the Cleveland Cavaliers (4-1), who also were riddled with injuries, as Jarrett Allen (bruised ribs) and Donovan Mitchell (calf strain) both missed multiple games throughout the series. Then in the Conference Finals, the Celtics swept the Indiana Pacers (4-0) in a series that Tyrese Haliburton (hamstring strain) missed Games 3+4.\n\nOn the other hand, the fifth-seeded Mavericks had a much harder road to the Finals, as they beat the Los Angeles Clippers (4-2), getting passed Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, and James Harden in the first round. Then the Mavs overcame Shai-Gilgeous Alexander and the No. 1 seed Oklahoma City Thunder in the semi-final round (4-2). Lastly, they beat Anthony Edwards, Karl Anthony-Towns, and Rudy Gobert to win the Western Conference Finals over the Minnesota Timberwolves (4-1).\n\nAs to be expected, the Mavericks are the underdogs heading into the NBA championship. And with +180 odds to win the championship, if they come out on top, this will be a bigger upset than when the 2011 Mavericks (+155) defeated the Heat (-180).\n\nThe Celtics scored the second-most points per game in the NBA regular season (120.6), and also gave up the fifth-least amount of points to opponents (109.2).\n\nComparatively, the Mavericks scored the seventh-most points per game in the NBA this season (117.9), while being ranked 20th in opponents' points per game (115.6).\n\nIn two regular season matchups this season, the Celtics are 2-0 vs. the Mavericks (119-110; 1/22/24) (138-110; 3/1/24).\n\nIn the past 76 NBA Finals series, the home team won the first game of the series 58 out of 76 times (.763 win percentage).\n\nIn view of this, the Celtics are the favorites for Game 1 (-6.5 points), and the over/under for total points is set at 214.5.\n\nThe NBA Finals are set to begin on Thursday, June 6 at 8:30 pm ET. Games 1+2 will be played at TD Garden in Boston, and Games 3+4 will be at American Airlines Center in Dallas.\n\nPostseason stat leaders:\n\nLuka Doncic leads the Mavericks in points (28.8), rebounds (9.6), assists (8.8), and steals (1.6). Daniel Gafford is the team leader in blocks (1.8).\n\nJayson Tatum leads the Celtics in points (26.0), rebounds (10.4), assists (5.9). Jrue Holiday is the team leader in steals (1.3) and Kristaps Porzingis has the most blocks (1.5).", "source": {"uri": "fanbuzz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FanBuzz - Sports News - NFL | NCAA |

Boston's most recent title came in 2008.\n\nThe Mavericks won their only NBA title in 2011 after reaching the 2006 final, losing to Miami.\n\nIrving will be the emotional heart of the series after his Boston stay and a playoff return with Brooklyn that went poorly.\n\n\"I'm better at consolidating the emotions now,\" Irving said. \"You call it animosity. We call it hate. We call it, 'It's going to be hell in Boston.'\"\n\n\"The last time in Boston (in the playoffs with Brooklyn), I don't think that was the best... everyone saw me flip off the birds and kind of lose my (cool) a little bit.\n\n\"I wasn't my best self at that time. I've been able to grow since then... I'm looking forward to it. I'll take the brunt of it, all the yells and all the remarks.\n\n\"That wasn't a great reflection of who I am and how I like to compete on a high level.\"\n\nHe's on a high now, averaging 22.8 points in the playoffs as Slovenian guard Doncic, who averaged 33 points in the regular season, averages 28.8 points, 9.6 rebounds and 8.8 assists in the playoffs.\n\nBoston counters with two of the NBA's top defensive guards in Jrue Holiday and Derrick White.\n\n\"There's really no stopping them. You just try to make it difficult for them,\" White said. \"They're going to take tough shots and they're going to make tough shots. Just trust that over 48 minutes what we're doing is going to work.\"\n\nTatum averages 26.0 points and 10.4 rebounds in the playoffs with Brown averages 25.0 points with White and Holiday providing strong support and the team leading the NBA in 3-point shots and baskets. The Celtics are 9-0 when hitting 14 or more three-pointers.\n\n\"Boston shoots the three at a high rate,\" Mavs coach Jason Kidd said. \"They have a lot of talented players. They've been here before, they have the experience. They're well-coached. This is another great test.\"\n\nDallas center Dereck Lively isn't sweating the experience factor.\n\n\"They have a lot of tradition, but that doesn't matter. What matters is who's going to go harder on the court,\" Lively said. \"It's going to be a dogfight out there, but we're going to keep swinging and see what happens.\"\n\nBoston, which defeated the Mavericks in both meetings this season, expects to have Latvian center Kristaps Porzingis back from a right calf strain suffered on April 29 in the first round against Miami that benched him for 10 games.\n\n\"He has been working extremely hard just to get back and to help us in any way he can,\" White said.\n\n\"When KP is at his best, he has been tremendous for us,\" Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said. \"We expect that from him.\"", "source": {"uri": "cebudailynews.inquirer.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "CDN Digital"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@cebudailynews.inquirer.net",

Raphielle Johnson, Noah Rubin, Zak Hanshew, and Ameer Tyree offered their thoughts on what's sure to be a thrilling conclusion to the NBA season.\n\nQ: Who are you picking to win and why?\n\nRaphielle Johnson: I'm taking the Celtics in six games. They've been the best team in the NBA all season long, and during the conference finals, they displayed solid growth regarding how they close games offensively. The addition of Jrue Holiday and his defensive impact will help the Celtics attack the Doncic/Irving tandem, and they have options that the teams Dallas eliminated to reach this point lacked. Also, the time off should help Kristaps Porzingis; he's reportedly on track to be available for Game 1, which will give Boston a welcome boost in the frontcourt.\n\nNoah Rubin: Celtics in five. Full disclosure, I'll be rooting for Dallas to win and for the series to go seven games. However, this Boston team just feels inevitable. While they haven't faced much healthy competition yet this postseason, they were able to make quick work of every team they have played. The moves they made this summer gave them the best top six in the league, and it has shown all year. The extra rest has given time for Kristaps Porzingis to heal up, and with both teams pretty healthy, it will come down to talent. Simply put, the Celtics are the better team on paper, and I think their defense is set up perfectly to try and slow down Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving. Boston has won their last ten games against Kyrie, including their sweep of the Nets in 2022. I don't expect the Celtics to dominate every game, but this team has been the title favorite all year for a reason.\n\nZak Hanshew: I'm going Dallas in six. Boston comfortably led the NBA in games won this season, and the team has arguably the most talented starting five from top to bottom. This isn't a Tuesday in March... this is the NBA Finals. Imagine it's a two-point game with three minutes to play. Which Celtic is taking over? Will it be Jayson Tatum, who's having one of his worst playoff runs in recent memory? Will it be Jaylen Brown, who won the Eastern Conference Finals MVP award? Will it be Derrick White or Jrue Holiday, who can get hot at times? Maybe Kristaps Porzingis gets hot in his first game back. There are no questions when we look at the Mavericks. Dallas has a killer who wants the ball in his hands at the end of the game and is not afraid of the brightest lights. I'm picking the team with the best player on the court in Luka Doncic. Don't forget about Kyrie Irving, another one of the best closers in the Association who has already proven himself when he hit the go-ahead triple in Game 7 of the 2016 Finals in Golden State.\n\nAmeer Tyree: The Celtics should get the job done this time around. I'm picking the Celtics to win in six games. They were far and away the best team at home in 2023-24, are set to get Kristaps Porzingis back, and have had plenty of time to rest and prepare for the Mavericks. Boston has more offensive options and a more capable defense, so I'm backing them to take care of business. They've long been considered the most well-rounded team in basketball and should benefit from having an abundance of youth and big-time playoff game experience. Boston added a player with championship pedigree in Jrue Holiday and its perimeter defense is built to slow down the Mavericks' guard-centered offense.\n\nQ: Who is your Finals MVP and why?\n\nRaphielle Johnson: Jayson Tatum. There was some controversy regarding the Eastern Conference Finals MVP; I personally did not have a problem with Jaylen Brown winning it. Tatum wasn't his most efficient self against the Pacers, but he still produced solid numbers. I expect him to be better against the Mavericks, and a Boston championship would likely net him the Bill Russell Most Valuable Player award.\n\nNoah Rubin: Jayson Tatum. Even if Luka Doncic averages 40/10/10, the best player on the winning team is going to get this award. Jaylen Brown won the Eastern Conference Finals MVP despite Tatum having more points, rebounds and assists in the series. Not to say that the voters got it wrong, but I don't expect that result to repeat if Tatum has better numbers once again. Tatum wasn't great the last time they made the Finals, so I expect him to be much better this time around.\n\nZak Hanshew: I'm picking Dallas because they have the best player in the series and a man who should have received more love as the league's MVP. Of course, I'm picking Luka Doncic to win Finals MVP.\n\nAmeer Tyree: Jayson Tatum. Jayson Tatum has been overshadowed by Jaylen Brown at times. He's the best player on the best team at the end of the day, though. Luka Doncic might end up taking and making more shots, but Boston is built to win the series and winning team always has a player named MVP.\n\nQ: Who will be the X factor of the series?\n\nRaphielle Johnson: I'm going with Al Horford. Even though Kristaps Porzingis is expected back for Game 1, Horford's presence within the rotation will remain important. The veteran center is better equipped to punish Dallas' bigs offensively than Rudy Gobert, as evidenced by the seven 3-pointers Horford made in Game 3 of the conference Finals. Against Indiana, he averaged 12.8 points, 7.3 rebounds, 1.5 assists, 1.0 steals, 1.8 blocks, and 2.8 3-pointers in 35 minutes, shooting 46.2% from the field and 80.0% from the foul line. Horford's play/production has improved by the round, out of necessity due to the Porzingis injury, but it's a clear sign that he still has plenty to give. If he can continue on that path, Boston will be well-positioned to win the title.\n\nNoah Rubin: Kristaps Porzingis. One advantage that Dallas can exploit is forcing Porzingis to switch onto Luka and Kyrie. Doncic obviously had a number of big shots over Rudy Gobert in the conference finals, and Boston will need to avoid that matchup as much as possible. Porzingis needs to be able to hold his own in those situations and force Daniel Gafford to guard him on the perimeter, which will open up driving lines for their star scorers. However, things will get difficult for the Celtics if the Mavs are able to take advantage of Porzingis as a defender, since everyone else can be effective when switched onto Luka or Kyrie.\n\nZak Hanshew: Dereck Lively II immediately springs to mind here following an impressive rookie campaign and even more impressive postseason performance. The X factor here, however, is Kyrie Irving. Despite boasting a number of quality defenders, Boston will have its hands full with Luka Doncic, and the team will have to settle for slowing him down or wearing him out rather than completely neutralizing him. In two matchups with the Celtics in the regular season, Luka averaged 35.0 points, 15.0 rebounds and 12.0 assists on 47.3% shooting. Irving, on the other hand, averaged just 21.0 points, 5.0 rebounds and 2.5 assists on just 41.8% shooting. This year's playoffs did a phenomenal job in showing how important role players are, but both Luka AND Kyrie will need to be elite to slay the Eastern Conference's 65-win juggernaut. Irving is not liked in Boston, so there will be an added element of vitriol when he faces his former team in Boston.\n\nAmeer Tyree: Derrick White has been as hot as any Celtic on offense at times this postseason while also being a defensive linchpin. If his shotmaking pop early in this series he could be the player who makes Boston overwhelming. Especially because he'll likely end up getting a Kyrie Irving matchup assignment.\n\nQ: Which team/player is under the most pressure?\n\nRaphielle Johnson: Tatum, Brown, and the Celtics. We've seen these two stars come up short multiple times in their respective careers. While Tatum is still 26 and Brown 27, patience isn't exactly a strength of most fans and analysts. Add in the fact that the Celtics rolled through the regular season and the playoffs, and they're no denying who will be under the most pressure in this series.\n\nNoah Rubin: Celtics/Jayson Tatum. Boston has made the Eastern Conference Finals six times in the past eight seasons and in five of Tatum's seven years in the league. That is an impressive feat, but this is only their second appearance in the NBA Finals during that stretch. After losing to the Heat in the conference finals last year, they reloaded by adding Porzingis and Holiday, and White has been incredible this season. They've even had players like Payton Pritchard step up this year in an expanded role. This is a stacked team that was built to win the championship, and it would be a disappointment if they didn't get it done. On the other side, this is the Mavs first trip to the NBA Finals without Dirk Nowitzki. Dallas wasn't even in the Play-In Tournament last year, and now they're four wins away from a ring. Doncic will eventually have pressure on him to win a ring every year, but it's only his first appearance. Boston has to get it done this year, or the narratives will get ugly.\n\nZak Hanshew: I've got to concur with Raph, here. Boston continues to win in the regular season and in the playoffs, but the core of Tatum and Brown has yet to bring home any hardware. This is arguably the most talented roster the duo has ever played with, and if they can't get it done after going 12-2 in the Eastern Conference, this season will be seen as a massive failure. Tatum's name is often mentioned when NBA fans and analysts try to name the top-5 or top-10 players in the league, though he's gotten a reputation as someone who wilts in big games. Can he overcome that reputation and change the narrative on what's been an otherwise phenomenally successful career to date?\n\nAmeer Tyree: Jayson Tatum is the player facing the most pressure. The young star is 0-1 in the NBA Finals and has benefited from amazing team structure for years.\n\nQ: What does this mean for X player legacy?\n\nRaphielle Johnson: Luka Doncic will be the new face of the NBA if the Mavericks win the title. He's never been \"disrespected\" in the conversations regarding the league's best players, but maybe his name should be mentioned more with regard to who will lead the league in the post-LeBron/Curry/KD years. Doncic has been playing at a high level since his early teenage years at Real Madrid, and he didn't skip a beat once he arrived in Dallas. However, the difference now is that he has a team that's built to win a championship. Get it done now, and this may signal the beginning of the \"Doncic Era\" in the NBA.\n\nNoah Rubin: Al Horford is a Hall of Famer with a ring. This take feels a little bold to me, which is why I like it. Horford won two rings in college at Florida and has made the All-Star Game five times as a pro. He also has one All-NBA third team, one All-Defensive second team and made the All-Rookie first team. Add in another ring to his resume, and the case gets stronger. Entering this series, Basketball Reference has him at a 12.2% chance to make the Hall of Fame, so a ring would give him a fighting chance. He isn't a lock to make it, but I think he has a strong case with a ring, especially if he continues to play past this season.\n\nZak Hanshew: Kyrie Irving is a top-5 PG of all time. Magic Johnson and Steph Curry are cemented among the top-5 at the position, and guys like John Stockton, Allen Iverson and Oscar Robertson often make their way into the discussion. Irving is regarded as arguably the best ball handler ever, but he can etch his name into another all-time list with four more wins. With a second Finals victory for a second team and a strong Finals performance, it will be tough to exclude Irving from the top-5 PG conversation.\n\nAmeer Tyree: Tatum wants to take another step and become an undisputed top-5 player. The discussion could shift from him being a promising, young superstar to a disappointment with another championship loss.\n\nQ: Which of these guys (if any) can boost/diminish his 2024-25 fantasy stock with a big/poor performance?\n\nRaphielle Johnson: A player who could potentially boost his 2024-25 fantasy stock in this series is PJ Washington. Based on his Yahoo ADP (128.1), he wasn't a player most managers expected to see produce a top-100 season. However, he was a top 100 player after being traded to Dallas, finishing just outside of that threshold in season-long value. Playing off of Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving did result in a slight decrease in Washington's scoring, but the rebounds, steals, and blocks all increased.\n\nNoah Rubin: Daniel Gafford/Dereck Lively II. They both have helped their stock already, and now they'll have one more series for us to evaluate. Will one of them seize control of the starting center minutes? Will one of them falter, forcing the other to play more minutes? Will they both play well enough to provide value in a minutes split. This four-game series shouldn't be the only factor ahead of drafts next season, but if one of them plays noticeably better, the rotation could swing in favor of either big heading into next season.\n\nZak Hanshew: It's got to be PJ Washington. At this point, fantasy managers know what they'll get from Dereck Lively II and Daniel Gafford. Both guys will be great rebounders and blockers with the occasional scoring outburst when the lobs are plentiful. Can Washington consistently be the guy we hoped he would be for Charlotte? Can he score and rebound at a high level while hitting threes and making a concerted effort on defense?\n\nAmeer Tyree: PJ Washington's long-range shooting was huge in the Western Conference Finals and he's effectively working as his team's third option on offense. An impressive NBA Finals performance could help him lock in a significant role in 2024-25 after falling by the wayside in his last run with the Hornets.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com",

Some fans will want to watch in person, so how much are tickets?\n\nFans have seen a lot of the Boston Celtics in the NBA Finals, as the team has 22 previous appearances in the NBA's championship series. The team made it to the final stage of the postseason as recently as 2022. On the other hand, the Celtics' Finals opponent, the Dallas Mavericks, have only made the Finals twice before.\n\nThe matchup is an intriguing one, and all basketball fans will have their eyes on the action, especially considering all of the storylines that make this series interesting. While plenty of fans will watch on TV, some fans will want to get a better view of the action and watch the games in person. In this article, we will look at how much tickets will cost for the 2024 NBA Finals.\n\nWhen and where are the NBA Finals?\n\nThe Boston Celtics have been the best team throughout the season, and they finished with the best record in the league. Because of that, they will have home-court advantage in the NBA Finals. That means Games 1, 2, 5, and 7 will be at their home, the TD Garden in Boston, Massachusetts. The Mavericks will host Games 3, 4, and 6 at the American Airlines Center in Dallas, Texas.\n\nGame 1: Dallas Mavericks @ Boston Celtics on Thursday, June 6 at 8:30 p.m. ET - ABC\n\nGame 2: Dallas Mavericks @ Boston Celtics on Sunday, June 9 at 8 p.m. ET - ABC\n\nGame 3: Boston Celtics @ Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday, June 12 at 8:30 p.m. ET - ABC\n\nGame 4: Boston Celtics @ Dallas Mavericks on Friday, June 14 at 8:30 p.m. ET - ABC\n\nGame 5: Dallas Mavericks @ Boston Celtics on Monday, June 17 at TBD - ABC\n\nGame 6: Boston Celtics @ Dallas Mavericks on Thursday, June 20 at TBD - ABC\n\nGame 7: Dallas Mavericks @ Boston Celtics on Sunday, June 23 at TBD - ABC\n\nHow much are tickets to the NBA Finals?\n\nNBA Finals tickets are available on Vividseats. Ticket prices for Game 1 start at $574 and are as expensive as $5,957. The average price is about $700-800. Additionally, you can get VIP tickets that surpass $6,000. Games 2 tickets go up in price, as the least amount of money it will cost to get in is $675, while top-end expensive tickets are over $9,000. The average price is about $100 more expensive than it was in Game 1, too.\n\nAs the series makes its way to Dallas, it will only cost more to watch the Finals in person. Game 3 tickets are at least $680, and they can cost up to over $10,000, with the most expensive tickets being listed at $29,736. Game 4 is the first game where the series could be closed out, so prices skyrocket then, too. The cheapest tickets are $778, while luxurious tickets will cost over $10,000.\n\nThe series will go back to Boston for Game 5, and once again, tickets get more expensive. The lowest you can pay to watch Game 5 is $864, and it'll likely cost you over $1,000 to watch the game. Of course, the series might not go this far, but prices really become unreasonable in Game 6. The cheapest tickets for that game are listed at $1,295, and it may cost you over $2,000 just to get average seats. As of right now, Game 7 tickets aren't quite as unreasonable, and you should be able to get in for less than $2,000, although prices will surely increase if the series does extend that far.\n\nThe NBA Finals first took place in 1947, back when the league was known as the BAA. Three years later, the league rebranded to the NBA, and we have seen plenty of teams advance to the league's biggest stage since. Even so, arguably no team has had more NBA Finals success than the Celtics. Their 17 championships are tied for the most in league history, and now they have a chance to take sole possession of first place in that regard. Boston has only lost the NBA Finals five times, too.\n\nThe Mavericks, on the other hand, will become the fourth team with exactly three Finals appearances. They lost it all back in 2006 with Dirk Nowitzki leading the way before the Hall of Famer led the team back in 2011, where they won one of the most iconic series in league history.\n\nThe 2024 NBA Finals are set up to be memorable. The Celtics have made the Conference Finals in six of the last eight years, but they haven't been able to bring home the Larry O'Brien Trophy during that time.\n\nMeanwhile, Luka Doncic has taken Nowitzki's place as Dallas' European megastar, and he will be desperate to get the championship that Nowitzki wasn't able to get until later in his career.\n\nAdditionally, Kristaps Porzingis is a former Maverick who was cast out by Dallas, while Kyrie Irving is a former Celtic who didn't end on good terms with his team in Boston. There are revenge storylines left and right, and the stakes are at an all-time high. You won't want to miss any of the action, and buying NBA Finals tickets and watching the game in person can be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity if it is feasible.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bailey_bassett@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Bailey Bassett", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_advantage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home advantage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Airlines Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_O'Brien_Championship_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirk_Nowitzki", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dirk Nowitzki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Tickets", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Tickets", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "label": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/How-much-does-it-cost-to-attend-Celtics-vs.-Mavericks.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 1381, "textEnd": 1387}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-09", "textStart": 1464, "textEnd": 1470}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-12", "textStart": 1547, "textEnd": 1554}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-14", "textStart": 1631, "textEnd": 1638}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-17", "textStart": 1715, "textEnd": 1722}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 1792, "textEnd": 1799}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-23", "textStart": 1867, "textEnd": 1874}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Boston enters with the momentum of a 12-2 postseason record and two telling performances against their opponents during the regular season.\n\nThe Celtics swept the season series 2-0 against the Mavericks this year. Those performances found a few similarities that could recirculate as both teams draw up game plans with the Larry O'Brien trophy on the line.\n\nHere are three areas the Celtics benefited from during the season series with the Mavericks.\n\nDefend The Perimeter\n\nThe Celtics live and die by the three-point shot when it comes to their offense.\n\nIt also marked a weakness for the Maverick's when creating offense against a more-than-capable Celtics defense. Dallas shot just 23-of-74 from distance (31%) in the two games against Boston.\n\nJrue Holiday and Derrick White excel in their dynamic ability to contest shots as the leaders of Boston's defensive efforts. Keeping Dallas at bay with outside shooting should be an area to watch from Game 1.\n\nElevate Stars\n\nBoston gets production across the board, though the Celtics need impact efforts from their stars to set the tone for the series.\n\nKyrie Irving will make plays and Luka Doncic tallied a 30-point triple-double the last time he stepped foot on the parquet at TD Garden. The Mavericks will get scoring from their stars. The Celtics got the same from theirs during the season series.\n\nJayson Tatum poured in 39 points in Dallas while Jaylen Brown scored after a show-stopping move that put Doncic on the ground.\n\nTatum and Brown went to work again in Boston when the Celtics racked up 138 points in a victorious effort to start the month of March.\n\nShare The Basketball\n\nThe Celtics play at their best when each night dictates the hot hand of the offense. Kristaps Porzingis returns to restore the full starting lineup for Boston.\n\nThe scoring threats go beyond Tatum and Brown. White and Holiday each posted 25+ points in various spots of the postseason while Porzingis provides the counter that Boston lacked in previous playoff runs.\n\nThe Celtics had a +15 assist advantage in the two previous matchups against Dallas. Quality ball movement can set the tone for Boston once again.", "source": {"uri": "nesn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NESN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tim_crowley@nesn.com", "name": "Tim Crowley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_O'Brien", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Larry O'Brien"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Hispanic_whites", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Non-Hispanic whites"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Ethnic_and_Regional", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Ethnic and Regional", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://nesn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/06/jayson-tatum_a105ad.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Writers discuss names to watch in NBA Finals", "body": "Ahead of the NBA Finals between the Dallas Mavericks and the Boston Celtics, columnists and beat writers from The Dallas Morning News and The Boston Globe collaborated to answer several questions and predict an outcome for the series, which starts Thursday in Boston.\n\nHere are the players they said need to step up for either the Mavericks or the Celtics to win the series.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMike Curtis: P.J. Washington is going to be the X-factor for the Mavericks. He's shown throughout the postseason that he's capable of stepping up as that third scoring option behind Doncic and Irving. He'll receive plenty of looks from the 3-point line, especially from the corner. It's up to him to knock them down. His defense on Tatum and Brown could be even more valuable to Dallas and might prove the difference in the series if he can make it difficult for either Celtics star.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTim Cowlishaw: This will be an enormous series for Derrick Jones Jr. The Mavericks didn't know they were getting a full-time starter when they signed him away from Chicago. But the former dunk champion has been a top-level defender and will undoubtedly guard Tatum plenty in the coming series.\n\nMavericks\n\nBe the smartest Mavericks fan.

But if Jones does his usual job of making Tatum work, that puts added pressure on Brown and Derrick White and others to carry the load.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShawn McFarland: P.J. Washington. He averaged 12.2 points and 6.4 rebounds in the Western Conference finals and cracked double digits in each game, and he's grown into the third option behind Doncic and Irving. We've seen him change the momentum, flow and outcome of individual playoff games, and assuming the Celtics -- with a top-ranked defense led by Jrue Holiday, White, Brown and co. -- throw the kitchen sink at Dallas' superstar backcourt, Washington's impact on offense and defense is necessary. He and Jones could see a lot of time on Tatum (6-8) and Brown (6-6), and his perimeter shooting can help stretch the floor versus a defense without too many holes.\n\nKevin Sherrington: Dereck Lively II was the Mavs' unsung hero of the last two rounds because of his ability to limit teams' offense in the paint. But how much difference can he make against the Celtics, especially if Porzingis reclaims the minutes Al Horford picked up in his absence? Washington and Jones will have their hands full guarding Tatum and Brown, meaning they may not have a lot left for offense. Goes without saying that Doncic and Irving need to outdo Tatum and Brown, so how's this for a wild card: Jaden Hardy. He's got a shooter's conscience, meaning none at all. If he can provide a consistent offensive spark, the Mavs can score with Boston.\n\nBrad Townsend: Washington. At this point, the Mavericks know the baseline of what they can expect from key non-Doncic/Irving players such as Washington, Jones, Josh Green, Maxi Kleber and even Lively. And they know they'll get stellar defense from Washington. But what will he give Dallas offensively? The Celtics have so many offensive weapons that it's imperative for the Mavericks to counter with a reliable No. 3 scorer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDallas doesn't necessarily need the 17.7-point, 8.3-rebound Washington we saw against Oklahoma City in the second round, though that Washington obviously would be welcomed. But in this series the Mavericks need more scoring from Washington than his 10.8-point average in the first round and 12.2-point average against Minnesota in the WCF.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChad Finn: Honestly, it's just a matter of the Celtics' best players playing up to their ability. The Celtics have a remarkably well-rounded team, and Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown have never trusted their colleagues more. The Celtics could be in trouble if Tatum or Brown underperforms or tries to do too much, but I don't anticipate that. I will say this: I think Jrue Holiday will be the one to make the play or plays that clinch this series.\n\nAdam Himmelsbach: The beauty of this Celtics team is that they are so talented at the top that they are generally able to withstand at least one poor performance by any player. So they don't necessarily need one specific player to step up. But keep an eye on Sam Hauser, who was one of the best 3-point shooters in the NBA during the regular season but has largely disappeared during these playoffs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGary Washburn: This needs to be a Jayson Tatum series and that does not necessarily mean scoring. Tatum needs to rebound, be a playmaker, and play strong defense. The Mavericks don't have a player who can consistently guard him one-on-one and he needs to take advantage of any matchup, but don't get caught up in him matching Doncic basket for basket. He must be best all-around player in this series, prove he's Top 5-Tatum, and make his teammates better.\n\nRelated StoriesView MoreCeltics stars Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown feel better equipped for 2nd chance in NBA Finals10 things to know about ex-Mavericks forward Kristaps Porzingis for the NBA Finals Who will win NBA Finals?

I don't know if I'm a prisoner of the moment, but this is going to be a tight series full of tight games and I simply trust these two to close games out in a way I don't trust the Celtics collectively. I won't argue with anyone who disagrees with me on this pick. This is a coin flip.

Please get the best number. I'm far from the biggest C's fan, but the Green Teamers would've been -400 or higher against Dallas before the postseason started. This is just too cheap, and you get the deeper and more complete team.

The franchise could win its second NBA championship this summer with four wins over the Boston Celtics over these next couple of weeks\n\nIt'll be an uphill battle, though. The Celtics have been the best team in the NBA all season long. And, while the Mavericks have been incredible during this postseason run, overcoming the Celtics' talent won't be easy.\n\nThere's a path to victory here, though. Let's talk a bit about it.\n\nWhy the Mavericks will win\n\nFirst: Dallas arguably has the best player in the series in Luka Doncic.\n\nThis is why so many people have faith in the Dallas Mavericks. It's not that the Celtics aren't the NBA's best team or that there's widespread disbelief in Boston. It's just that Luka Doncic is that good. There's an argument to be made that he should've been MVP this season.\n\nThough the Mavericks didn't beat the Celtics in the regular season this year, he still had his way with Boston, scoring 35 points through the two games while averaging 15 rebounds and 12 assists. I don't know if we see those gaudy Luka numbers in this series, but if we do? That certainly bodes well for Dallas.\n\nSecond: Kristaps Porzingis might not be 100 percent healthy\n\nKristaps Porzingis' health hasn't mattered much this postseason. He's been out since the end of April and Boston has still managed to dispatch their opponents easily.\n\nThe Celtics' big man is back for this series. He says he's healthy, but that slight hesitation in saying he's no longer playing with pain raises antennas a bit.\n\nLuka and Kyrie Irving are going to test that calf. We'll see just how he's feeling in these Finals.\n\nThird: Luka and Kyrie Irving as a combination have been incredible in the playoffs\n\nAs far as duos go, Doncic and Irving have been at the top of the top so far in these playoffs. The 595 minutes they've played together in the postseason are the most any combination of players has played so far this season. Those two have a 9.1 net rating in those minutes together. That's extremely good.\n\nFinding ways to get those two playing in sync against Boston could tilt the series in Dallas' way.\n\nWhy the Mavericks won't win\n\nFirst: The Celtics' \"others\" are better than the Mavericks'\n\nDallas has the best player in this series. There's certainly an argument to be made that they've got the best duo in the series, too, though Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are incredible.\n\nBut there's no question that the rest of the Celtics' supporting cast is much better than what Dallas offers. Boston has two guards on the NBA's All-Defense team, a big man in Porzingis who could've been an All-Star if he had a healthier season, and a rotation filled with players who know their roles and play them well.\n\nThe Mavericks' role players have stepped up well in these playoffs. Maybe they will again, but Boston has them beat.\n\nSecond: Boston's defense has been impenetrable during these playoffs\n\nThe Celtics' 108.7 defensive rating in these playoffs is the third-best in these playoffs so far and the second-best out of any team that has played at least 10 games in these playoffs behind Oklahoma City (104.5).\n\nThe Mavericks might have the best player in this series, but he'll see many different matchups throughout this series. Boston is good enough to keep him in check.\n\nThird: The Celtics have matchups to hunt offensively against Dallas\n\nWhen you think about this series from a matchup standpoint, you've got to think about who is guarding who.\n\nWhere are you placing your weakest defenders against Boston? Who is Kyrie Irving going to guard? Where will Luka Doncic Play? Dereck Lively II and Daniel Gafford will have to play from the outside with Boston's big shooters stretching the floor. Can they handle that?\n\nThe more I think about it, the fewer answers I come up with. Dallas could try a zone or two -- that's not beyond the realm of possibility for this team. But doing that against a team that fires off 40 3-pointers a game is dangerous.\n\nDallas will have a hard time finding the answers defensively in this one.", "source": {"uri": "ftw.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "For The Win"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_d_sykes@ftw.usatoday.com", "name": "Mike D.

We're here to share our NBA Finals odds series and make a Jayson Tatum NBA Finals points per game prediction and pick.\n\nTatum is looking to win his first NBA Championship and help the Celtics break their tie with the Lakers and win championship number 18. This is Tatum's second appearance in the Finals and they lost in his first outing in six games against the Warriors. This is redemption for not just him, but also Jaylen Brown to finally win a title.\n\nTatum has been great in the postseason. He is scoring 26 points per game, which leads the Celtics overall, and is second in this series behind only Luka Doncic. Tatum has a massive skillset where he can shoot, drive to the hoop, and post up playing down low.\n\nThisshould be an interesting matchup because the Mavericks were not a good defensive team during the regular season, but became one in the postseason. The Mavericks have athletes and while Luka Doncic might see some time on Tatum, his primary defender will be PJ Washington, who has been an x-factor for Dallas in the postseason. Tatum is the key for Boston, so this is a huge matchup.\n\nHere are the NBA Finals odds, courtesy of FanDuel.\n\nNBA Finals Odds: Jayson Tatum Points Per Game Odds\n\nJayson Tatum had a lot of pressure on him coming into this postseason. In the first series against the Heat, Tatum only hit over this number once in Game 2 when he had 28 points. He scored at least 20 in each game except Game Five when he had 16, but the Celtics still closed it out and finally overcame the team that had haunted them.\n\nTatum played much better against the Cavaliers in the Eastern Conference Semifinals. He had his worst scoring output in Game 1 at 18 points and then in a five-game series he hit over this number twice. He scored 33 points in both Game 3 and Game 4. He helped the Celtics put the Cavaliers away in Game 5 when he scored 25 points.\n\nThen when the lights were brightest in the Eastern Conference Finals against the Pacers, Tatum helped the Celtics win the series in a sweep. Tatum hit over this number in two out of the four games. He scored 36 points in Game 1 and Game 3 and then scored 26 points in Game 4 to close out the Pacers and advance to the NBA Finals.\n\nTatum is the engine that makes the Celtics go despite all the depth they have in the lineup from Jaylen Brown to Derrick White and Kristaps Porzingis to Jrue Holiday. He is shooting 44.2% from the field and needs to improve his shooting from behind the arc with it only at 29%. If he does that, he will be almost unstoppable in this series against the Mavericks.\n\nThe Celtics need him to show up more than any player as the leader and the Celtic with the most pressure. They had the disappointment from two years ago, so expect that motivation to push him over the top in this matchup for Game 1. Tatum has heard everything from his critics and this is the perfect time for him to silence them and take over this game.\n\nWhy Jayson Tatum Will Hit the Under\n\nTatum is the focal point for the Celtics, but they have so much depth. He has only hit over this number in five out of the 14 total games they have played in this postseason. He only hit over it once against the Heat and then twice against both the Cavaliers and the Pacers.\n\nHe has not had any bad games this postseason in comparison. He has hit over 20 points in 12 of 14 games this postseason. The only two he did not were in Game 5 against the Heat and Game 1 against the Cavaliers where he scored 16 and 18 points respectively. Still, the Celtics won both games easily which speaks to their depth.\n\nTatum will hit under this point total mainly because of the depth of the Celtics on offense. Five different players average over double digits with each one capable of going off on their own, and that includes Tatum. The depth of the Celtics is what separates them as a team, but it could also hinder Tatum in this matchup.\n\nFinal Jayson Tatum Points Per Game Prediction\n\nJayson Tatum should hit over this number in scoring to make a statement in his second NBA Finals appearance. The game is in Boston which should also help and fuel not just him but the rest of the Celtics team. The fanbase already hates Kyrie Irving and will go after Luka Doncic over the talk between him and Tatum. That should fuel Tatum, so expect him to use it to his advantage and have a huge game and hit over this number.\n\nClick here for more betting news and predictions", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jake_faigus@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Jake Faigus", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2022 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Point (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Jayson-Tatum-NBA-Finals-points-per-game-prediction-odds.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

This year, the Celtics were powered by major offseason acquisitions in Jrue Holiday and Kristaps Porzingis. They received good news on the injury front as Porzingis is expected to be ready for Game 1. As the Celtics come into the NBA Finals against the Dallas Mavericks, they face pressure of being the favorite, a feeling known all too well by Los Angeles Lakers star and former rival LeBron James.\n\nOn a recent episode of LeBron James' and JJ Redick's podcast, 'Mind the Game,' James spoke about the pressures that come with being considered the favorite in the NBA Finals.\n\n\"I know what Boston is going through, you know being a favorite and having the weight on their shoulders, and you know like you said the expectation because they've been there so many times it's like okay how many times you're going to climb this mountain to where now you keep sliding back down it and not actually getting to the top and going back down the other way,\" James said. \"So they're definitely feeling it but you know up until this point listen, it don't matter who is put in front of you, we're all NBA players and they're taking care of business right now.\"\n\nLeBron James has reached the NBA Finals ten times in his career. He's won four championships during those appearances. When he was playing for the Miami Heat, his teams were definitely favorites heading into each Finals series.\n\nCeltics have been the NBA's elite team this season\n\nThe Celtics came into the NBA playoffs as the favorite to win the title. They finished the regular season with a record of 64-18 and homecourt advantage throughout the entire postseason. Throughout the playoffs so far, they've looked like a team on a mission.\n\nSure they may have faced teams with a few injury woes, but as LeBron James said, they're all NBA players and the Celtics are taking care of business no matter who is opposite them.\n\nThe Celtics defeated the Heat in five games in the first round, beat the Cleveland Cavaliers in five games in the second round and swept the Indiana Pacers, 4-0, in the Eastern Conference Finals. Now the Celtics prepare for the Mavericks. While they have benefitted tremendously from the additions of Jrue Holiday and Kristaps Porzingis, it's been the star duo of Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown who have powered this run.\n\nDuring this playoff run, Tatum has been averaging 26.0 points, 10.4 rebounds, 5.9 assists and 1.1 steals with splits of 44.2 percent shooting from the field, 29 percent shooting from the three-point line and 84.5 percent shooting from the free-throw line. Brown has been averaging 23.0 points, 5.5 rebounds, 3.6 assists and 1.2 steals with splits of 49.9 percent shooting from the field, 35.4 percent shooting from the three-point line and 70.3 percent shooting from the free-throw line.\n\nThe Celtics reached the NBA Finals in 2022 only to fall to the Golden State Warriors in six games.

After a slow start this season, they found cohesion after the All-Star break and emerged from a deep Western Conference field.\n\nHere's everything you need to know.\n\nAll NBA Finals games in Australia will air on ESPN starting Friday June 7.\n\nThe Boston Celtics have a chance to be the standalone leader with 18 NBA championships if they can win. The 17 titles are tied with the Los Angeles Lakers for most in NBA history.\n\nBefore this season, the Celtics' last Finals appearance was in 2022, where they lost to the Golden State Warriors. Their most recent championship was in 2008.\n\nThe Dallas Mavericks have three NBA Finals appearances. Before this season, their most recent appearance -- and only championship -- was in 2011 when they defeated the Miami Heat. The Mavs reached the 2006 NBA Finals, losing to the Heat.\n\nThere's been a lot of the pressure on Tatum and Brown the past two seasons but that has been somewhat reduced by the presence of offseason acquisitions of Holiday and Porzingis, as well as the consistency of a bench led by veteran Al Horford.\n\nAs a result, Tatum and Brown have seen their overall production increase.\n\nTatum's scoring numbers have remained steady from the regular season (26.9 per game) into the playoffs (26.0), while his rebounding has increased from 8.1 to 10.4 per game in the postseason. Brown has also seen jumps in those categories, going from 23.0 points and 5.5 rebounds per game to 25.0 points and 6.1 rebounds in the playoffs.\n\nBut it's been tweaks to their overall mental approaches to this season that have stood out.\n\nFor a chunk of his career Brown acknowledged he was at times a victim of consuming much of the negative perception people have had about him.\n\nThat's changed this season, which he played under his most unrelenting spotlight yet as the league's first $450 million player.\n\n\"You get to a point where it's, like, you get scrutinised enough for a large part of your career, it becomes normal. Then it just rolls off you,\" Brown said. \"I don't know if Jayson feels the same way. It's kind of been that my whole career in a sense. Just being booed when you were drafted to saying you were overpaid, saying you were overpaid again. It's been that the whole journey for me.\"\n\nTatum, too, has let go of the mental blocks he believes weighed him down. That includes reluctantly accepting the disappointments he's endured along the way.\n\n\"I hate that I had to go through it. I wish we would have won,\" he said. \"But I'm a firm believer in everything happens for a reason. There's a lesson to be learned in every situation. I do. I do feel a lot different this time, this go-around, two years later. I'm excited for the opportunity for us to get the job done.\"\n\nDoncic could become the first player to win a scoring title and a championship in the same season since Shaquille O'Neal in 2000, and a title surely would only add to the argument that Doncic -- who leads all players in this postseason in points, rebounds and assists -- may be the best player in the game right now.\n\nDoncic is averaging 28.7 points per game in his six regular seasons; only Michael Jordan and Wilt Chamberlain -- both at 30.1 -- have a higher career average. He's the only player in NBA history to have averages of at least eight assists and eight rebounds per game. He's one of two players with at least 10,000 points, 3,000 rebounds and 3,000 assists through his first 400 career games; Oscar Robertson is the other.\n\nDoncic wants no part of talk that winning is easy. He may make it look easy -- he had a league-best 73-point game this season, 13 different games of scoring at least 40 points in the regular season, and that number could have been even higher considering he scored exactly 39 points on eight other occasions.\n\nFor Irving, it has been a reminder that success can be fleeting. He won his lone championship with Cleveland in 2016 and has played with three teams over the past eight years. His time in Dallas has reinvigorated him.\n\n\"These young guys are very hungry. They want a championship. I want a championship,\" he said. \"So our feelings are very mutual. But I've always reminded them that this is a process. Failure is going to be part of this, too. Get it out your mind that this is about to be a clean sweep or everything is about to feel good throughout this journey and all that.\n\n\"I'm just very real, very honest. That's what's helped me grow as a leader.\"\n\nDoncic credits the partnership with Irving for uncorking the potential of a team that entered the postseason as a fifth seed.\n\n\"His leadership is amazing,\" Doncic said. \"The way he connects us. I think me and Kyrie are the leaders of this team, but he's the one that's been in the Finals. He's the one that won in the Finals. He's the one that is really leading it.\"\n\nAustralia's Josh Green and Dante Exum are expected to play roles off the bench in the Mavericks rotation as they look to become the next stars Down Under to become NBA champions.\n\nBoomers Green and Exum saw plenty of court time during the playoffs and have become key role players for the Mavericks.\n\nIt's been a wonderful resurgence for Exum, a former No.4 pick, who found himself out of the NBA due to a bad run with injuries. He returned with Barcelona in Euro basket, which paved the way for his return to the NBA.\n\nEvery season since being drafted by the Mavericks in 2020, Green's game has evolved to complement Doncic.\n\nIt's led to the Sydneysider playing a meaningful role on the Mavericks when it matters most, playing 17.8 minutes a game over these playoffs, averaging 4.8 points, 2.5 rebounds, and 1.2 assists a contest, while shooting 35.4 per cent from beyond the arc.\n\n\"Honestly, it's a tough adjustment for anyone,\" Green told ESPN. \"But, I think for me personally, I want to win first.\n\n\"It took time to get used to it, and it took time for me to realise what I need to do to be out on the court. You can tell it's appreciated from guys like Kyrie and Luka. They know the work that the role players put in.\n\n\"They know that it's not like the role players can't do more; but we have Luka and Kyrie and there's certain things that we need to do in order for our team to win, and we're willing to sacrifice for the team.\n\n\"That's why we're in the Finals. Our goal is to keep being a winning team, and that means buying into your role.\"\n\nThis stage is nothing new to Mavericks coach Jason Kidd, who is in the Finals for the fifth time as a player or coach.\n\nHe has experienced lows, such as losing back-to-back trips to the Finals in 2002 and 2003 as a player with the New Jersey Nets. He has also seen success, earning his lone title as a player with Dallas in 2011 at age 38 and one as an assistant on the Lakers 2020 championship team.\n\nThe biggest lesson he has taken away is to approach it like business and be ready to live with the results. That has been his message to his team throughout these playoffs.\n\n\"This is the best of the best at the highest level,\" Kidd said. \"It's fun. That's what the Finals are all about, is seeing what team is going to step forward and take advantage of mistakes.\"\n\nJoe Mazzulla was an assistant on Ime Udoka's staff in 2022. What he learned from that experience is that the details of winning never change, even on this stage.\n\n\"The toughest team will win,\" Mazzulla said. \"The team that makes the most plays will win. The team that can execute the details at a high level will win. It's no different.\"\n\nThe Boston Celtics are the overwhelming favourites.\n\nSportsbet has the Celtics paying $1.40 to win the series, with Dallas at $2.75.", "source": {"uri": "nine.com.au",

They are 12-2 in 14 postseason games, defeating the No. 8 Miami Heat, without Jimmy Butler, in five games, the fifth-seeded Cleveland Cavaliers in five games and the sixth-seeded Indiana Pacers in four.\n\nDallas has had a much tougher road, beating the No. 4 L.A. Clippers and No. 1 Oklahoma City Thunder in six games each. In the Western Conference Finals, they beat the No. 3 Minnesota Timberwolves in five games, who had just beaten the reigning champs in the second round.\n\nThe Celtics will host Games 1 and 2 on Thursday at 8:30 p.m. ET and Sunday at 8 p.m. The series then moves to Dallas for Games 3 and 4 on Wednesday and Friday at 8:30 p.m. before games 5, 6, and 7, if necessary, alternate between the two sites.\n\nGame 5 would be June 17 at 8:30 p.m., Game 6 would be three days later at the same time, and Game 7 is currently slated for June 23 at 8 p.m.\n\nThe Celtics have been in the finals more recently than Dallas, making it two years ago but losing to the Golden State Warriors. However, Boston last won it all the way back in 2008. Dallas, famously, beat the Miami Heat in their first year of their Big Three in 2011, and have not made the finals since.\n\nThis is Boston's 23rd Finals appearance in franchise history. With a win, Boston would break its tie with the Los Angeles Lakers for the most NBA titles, with 18.

Jayson Tatum and Luka Doncic enter NBA Finals as favourites", "body": "The NBA Finals are here as the Boston Celtics take on the Dallas Mavericks, in pursuit of the Larry O'Brien trophy.\n\nThe Celtics finished with the best record in the regular season (64-18), and breezed through the Eastern Conference with a 12-2 record, led by Jayson Tatum and ECF MVP Jaylen Brown.\n\nMeanwhile, the Mavericks find themselves in their first NBA Finals since 2011, led by Western Conference Finals MVP Luka Doncic and his backcourt mate Kyrie Irving.\n\nMORE: Why Celtics need a healthy Kristaps Porzingis to beat Mavericks\n\nWith the superstars at the forefront of the series, the Finals will ultimately come down to which duo steps up on the biggest stage, with Doncic the only one from the four-man group making his Finals debut.\n\nThe bookmakers have earmarked the Celtics as favourites to win the Finals, with Jayson Tatum the front-runner for Finals MVP.\n\nHere's a look at the complete odds for the Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player award.\n\nOdds courtesy of TAB\n\nTatum enters the Finals with the shortest odds at $1.75 for Finals MVP as the best player on the top-rated team, but throughout this postseason, Jaylen Brown has been the Celtics' best performer.\n\nComing off an Eastern Conference Finals MVP, Brown has averaged 25.0 points, 6.1 rebounds, 2.6 assists and 1.1 steals on .488/.363/.722 shooting splits, and with the 3-time All-Star likely to take on a larger share of the defensive assignment on Luka Doncic, his impact on the series could prove to be the difference-maker for Boston. At $6.00, Brown presents great value.\n\nMORE: Jayson Tatum gets candid about Kyrie Irving's disappointing Celtics run\n\nTatum's case for Finals MVP rests in him being the clear No. 1 option on offence, and while he routinely attracts the opposition team's best defender, he has still been productive this postseason with averages of 26.0 points, 10.4 rebounds, 5.9 assists and 1.1 steals on .443/.290/.845 shooting splits.\n\nIf Dallas is to pull off the upset and win the title, it will most likely mean Luka Doncic has gone absolutely berserk in the Finals -- a scenario that could well play out given he leads the Mavs in total points, rebounds and assists this postseason.\n\nSure, the superstars will have their say, but in Boston's case, there's one player looming as a wildcard for Finals MVP: Derrick White.\n\nThrough 14 postseason games, White is averaging 17.8 points, 4.6 assists, 4.1 rebounds and 1.3 blocks on .471/.407/.893 shooting splits, while playing elite defence on the other end of the court.\n\nHe leads the Celtics in 3-point percentage and has proven he can blow games open when he's knocking down triples, with Boston 8-0 when he hits at least three.\n\n\"When you talk about his ability to shoot the three, again he's one that a lot of times goes under the radar, but when he's able to knock down threes and he gets a lot of looks at them, it takes their offence to another level,\" Mavs head coach Jason Kidd said of White.\n\n\"They got a lot of lasers out there, we gotta be able to guard the three but White is the one that we are concerned about.\"\n\nMORE: Revisiting the trade that sent Kyrie Irving from Brooklyn to Dallas\n\nMeanwhile, Kyrie Irving presents an interesting pick for bettors at $17, with the 32-year-old one of just three players alongside Boston's Jrue Holiday and Dallas' Markieff Morris with championship experience.\n\nIrving's ability to create shots for himself in tight spaces and bail the Mavs out in the fourth quarter when Doncic attracts double teams could provide the perfect recipe for the ultimate revenge against his former team.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

His role was limited, but his athleticism and defensive capabilities were key components of the Heat's rotation.\n\nIn the 2024 playoffs, Jones Jr. has been a significant contributor for the Dallas Mavericks, averaging 9.8 points, 3.6 rebounds, and 1.4 assists in 17 games. His ability to defend multiple positions and provide energy off the bench has been vital for the Mavericks, adding depth to their playoff rotation.\n\n11. Luke Kornet - 0-1 In Series (0-3 Game-Record)\n\nLuke Kornet played in the 2022 NBA Finals with the Boston Celtics, appearing in three games. In that series, he averaged 1.7 points, 0.7 rebounds, and 0.3 assists per game. Although his role was limited, his presence provided valuable bench depth.\n\nIn the 2024 playoffs, Kornet has been more active, averaging 3.9 rebounds, 3.7 points, and 0.5 assists in 10 games. His contributions off the bench have helped bolster the Celtics' frontcourt as they prepare for another championship run.\n\nRelated: 2024 NBA Finals: Celtics vs. Mavericks (Analysis, Comparison,

The duo accepts the weight of representing the historic Celtics organization in the NBA Finals. High expectations and pressure on Tatum and Brown will test their resolve in the Finals.\n\nIt takes a lot of composure for NBA players with the responsibility of carrying their team, and the adversity that these players face can be overwhelming. It's a gift and a curse to be a superstar in the NBA. When all is well and the team is winning, the fans are ecstatic, the organization is satisfied, and the player receives praise from the media. When things take a turn for the worse, the situation can be ugly. Players have been scrutinized, mocked, and torn apart by the media if they fail to meet expectations.\n\nSuperstar players have to be mentally strong and must have the ability to bounce back after tough outings. Teams become dependent on these superstars to be able to be a voice of reason in the locker room, to be a leader on the floor all while producing at an elite level. There is an abundance of pressure that comes along with trying to navigate through a vaunted regular season schedule, not to mention how much more challenging it can be to perform well on the game's biggest stage.\n\nThe dynamic duo of Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown knows all too well about playing under pressure. These two players have been criticized daily and are always the topic of conversation whenever the Boston Celtics lose. As they prepare to make their second NBA Finals appearance, will the Celtic duo feel less pressure this time around?\n\nThe Celtics Understand What's At Stake In the 2024 NBA Finals Tatum and Brown may feel pressure trying to live up to the Celtics All-Time greats\n\nTatum and Brown have always handled being under pressure like seasoned veterans. You hardly ever see them get frustrated, and that credit should be given to the veterans that they have played with, particularly Al Horford and Kyrie Irving during his tenure when he was with the Celtics. Having that veteran presence brings a sense of calm, peace, and serenity in stressful situations, and gives the superstar duo someone to lean on if they ever need guidance or advice.\n\nThere has always been pressure for just putting on the Celtics jersey. Those players are not only representing themselves but the many legends who came before them. A reporter asked Tatum whether the team faced a different level of pressure due to the Celtics' historic past.\n\n\"We only hang championship banners. Seventeen of them. Some of the greatest players ever to play this game have worn this uniform, and all of us are honored to even follow in their footsteps. The way they paved for us in order to live out our dreams.\" -Jayson Tatum\n\nTatum, Brown, and the rest of the Celtics understand the significance of putting on that Celtics green as they understand the fact that this is bigger than any individual success. One day, Tatum's and Brown's jerseys should hang in the TD Garden rafters along with the rest of the Celtics legends, but the pressure to even live up to that is enormous. What they don't want is to be remembered as that group of Celtics who made it to the end and couldn't finish the job.\n\nWe are living in an era where a dynamic duo that has played in five Eastern Conference Finals and what will be two NBA Finals once the series begins before they both turned 30 is being viewed as a failure. Critics view this iteration of the Celtics as failure because of how stacked the roster has been over the past few seasons.\n\nEven Though the Pressure Mounts, Tatum and Brown Don't Appear to be Affected The past experiences and letdowns have prepared the duo for this moment\n\nEvery time the Celtics advance deep into the postseason, the goalpost gets moved and expectations become higher. Tatum and Brown will either falter from the pressure or they will overcome and embrace this challenge. If they have learned anything from their Finals appearance in 2022, it's to never allow the moment to overtake you and to remember that its still basketball at the end of the day.\n\nTake away the crucial mistakes and the costly turnovers from that series, and we may be having another conversation. No other duo has faced more pressure to succeed over the past couple of seasons as the Celtics were poised and ready to make a run at NBA history. During the team's media availability, a reporter asked Celtics guard Jrue Holiday about how Tatum and Brown handle the pressure of carrying the team so well and what he does to try and help alleviate some of that pressure.\n\n\"The pressure that JB and JT have to take on is something different. I've told them this before, that it's really impressive how they handle themselves, how they stay professional, how they still come out every game and do what they do.\" -Jrue Holiday\n\nThe Celtics rewarded Brown with the richest deal in NBA history by giving him a 5-year supermax extension worth up to $303.7 million. If the Celtics lose against the Dallas Mavericks in the Finals, the media will more than likely bring up the fact that the player with the largest contract in league history couldn't get the job done, and will question if he was even worth the money if he can't deliver on the biggest stage. A lot of players disappear when they get that big contract, but Brown has been the total opposite. He got his money and has been spectacular this postseason as his performance has improved.\n\nJaylen Brown's Playoff Stats 2023\n\nYear\n\nPPG\n\nRPG\n\nAPG\n\n3PT%\n\n2023\n\n22.7\n\n5.6\n\n3.4\n\n35.4\n\n2024\n\n25.0\n\n6.1\n\n2.6\n\n36.8%\n\nTatum also reflected on his experiences from the loss they suffered in the 2022 Finals during the team's media availability. The fact of the matter isn't that they lost on the biggest stage, but the lessons and knowledge that was gained in the process.\n\n\"I hate that I had to go through it. I wish we would have won. I'm a firm believer that everything happens for a reason. There is a lesson to be learned in every situation and I do feel a lot different this time around.\" -Tatum\n\nRelated Jrue Holiday 'Can't Wait' for Kristaps Porzingis' Return for NBA Finals The defensively skilled point guard made it clear that Boston needs their center to win an NBA title.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Pressure_Cooker", "label": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Pressure Cooker", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/jayson-tatum-jrue-holiday.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Boston is a 6.5-point favorite over the Dallas Mavericks at BetMGM, with -250 odds on the moneyline.\n\nThe team's record at TD Garden certainly supports the line. Boston is 43-6 at home in the regular season and postseason combined.\n\nHowever, two of those losses came in the playoffs, where the Celtics haven't been quite as dominant against competition much less than what the Mavericks should present.\n\nEven as the West's No. 5 seed, Dallas had a better record than any team Boston has played this postseason. Not to mention, the Mavericks were a much better team to finish the season than they were at the start. And they've kicked things to another level in the playoffs.\n\nThis line should be a lot closer.\n\nDallas is 11-6 against the spread this postseason, including 4-1 last round against the Timberwolves. Boston is just 7-7 and trending in the opposite direction. Since going 4-1 ATS against Miami in the first round, the Celtics are 3-6 ATS, including 1-3 in the conference finals against Indiana.\n\nThat's before they've had to play a talent like Luka Doncic, who will present a challenge no matter how good Boston's defense can be. Learning how best to defend him and all the problems he presents will happen over the course of a series. Not a single game. Particularly a game where Kristaps Porzingis is returning from injury and presumably not as mobile as he'll be later in the series.\n\nFor that reason, I like Doncic to go over 31.5 points. He eclipsed that total in four of five games against Minnesota, and two of three Game 1s this postseason. It also helps that he had extra time to rest his knee.\n\nEspecially considering all the pressure is on Boston to set the tone at home in their second trip to the finals in the last three years, I expect the Mavericks to play looser and cover the spread in what should be an extremely competitive Game 1.\n\nWith the closers they have, Dallas can win outright.\n\nBest bet: Dallas +6.5\n\nWho are the referees calling the 2024 NBA Finals between the Mavericks and Celtics? 3 shrewd decisions that helped the Mavericks make the 2024 NBA Finals Jayson Tatum will enter the NBA Finals as a shaky (and fascinating) favorite to win MVP", "source": {"uri": "ftw.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "For The Win"}, "authors": [{"uri": "prince_j_grimes@ftw.usatoday.com", "name": "Prince J.

That includes their most recent trip to the NBA Finals in 2022 when Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown learned some hard lessons in their first trip to the league's biggest stage, falling at the hands of the more experienced Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors.\n\nBoston last won a title in 2008, when Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce and Ray Allen -- along with young upstart point guard Rajon Rondo -- knocked off the Kobe Bryant Lakers in six games.\n\nBoston was in the NBA Finals just two years ago, 2022, but lost to the Golden State Warriors. That was a very different Boston team. While Tatum and Brown were still the leaders, that roster leaned on players no longer with the team, including Marcus Smart, Robert Williams (who was battling knee issues even then), and Grant Williams.\n\nZero. That's the next step in Tatum's legacy, as great a player as he has been -- five-time All-Star, four-times All-NBA, 2022 Eastern Conference Finals MVP -- in Boston legacies are measured in rings. If Tatum wants to ascend to become one of the Celtics' all-time greats, he needs a title (or titles). That can start this year.\n\nFive Celtics have been named NBA Finals MVP. Larry Bird did it twice in the 1980s (1984 and 1986) and has the most of any Boston player. Other Celtics who have been voted NBA Finals MVP are John Havlicek (1974), Jo Jo White (1976), Cedric Maxwell (1981), and Paul Pierce (2008).\n\nBill Russell's name is not on that list because the NBA Finals award did not exist until 1969, the final season of Russell's 13-year Hall of Fame playing career. The Celtics did make the Finals in 1969, and the Celtics won the title that season, but the Finals MVP went to the Lakers' Jerry West, the only time in NBA history the award winner was on the losing team in the series. If the Finals MVP award existed prior to 1969, Russell would have a trophy case full of them.\n\nYes, and that doesn't even tell the story of the Celtics' dominance from the late 1950s through the 1960s.\n\nBoston won 11 titles in 13 seasons during the Bill Russell era, starting in the 1957 Finals and running through Russell's final season in 1969. Those teams were stacked with talent, including Russell, Cousy at the point,Tommy Heinsohn, Sam Jones, K.C. Jones, Frank Ramsey, and Bill Sharman, and they were coached by the legend Red Auerbach.", "source": {"uri": "nbcsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

We kind of took it for granted at certain moments.\"\n\nAnd now?\n\n\"I'm not thinking about what it would mean for my legacy or anything like that,\" he said. \"Just excited to play some basketball ... and go out there and try to get the job done.\"\n\nDallas' Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving see it as their first opportunity to make good on a partnership that began late last season after Irving was traded from Brooklyn following a tumultuous run of two-plus seasons with the Nets.\n\nBut the duo was still learning to play with each other during their truncated time together last season and didn't make it to the postseason. After a slow start this season, they found cohesion after the All-Star break and emerged from a deep Western Conference field.\n\nFor Irving, it has been a reminder that success can be fleeting. He won his lone championship with Cleveland in 2016 and has played with three teams over the past eight years. His time in Dallas has reinvigorated him.\n\n\"These young guys are very hungry. They want a championship. I want a championship,\" he said. \"So our feelings are very mutual. But I've always reminded them that this is a process. Failure is going to be part of this, too. Get it out your mind that this is about to be a clean sweep or everything is about to feel good throughout this journey and all that.\n\n\"I'm just very real, very honest. That's what's helped me grow as a leader.\"\n\nDoncic credits the partnership with Irving for uncorking the potential of a team that entered the postseason as a fifth seed.\n\n\"His leadership is amazing,\" Doncic said. \"The way he connects us. I think me and Kyrie are the leaders of this team, but he's the one that's been in the Finals. He's the one that won in the Finals. He's the one that is really leading it.\"\n\nThey'll matchup with a Boston team playing like a group that has learned from its recent shortcomings. That was exhibited during a 64-win regular season that established it as a favorite to raise the franchise's 18th championship banner entering the postseason.\n\nThrough the first three rounds, the Celtics have met the challenge, losing just two games along the way under the guidance of second-year coach Joe Mazzulla.\n\nThey've also benefited from an offseason shakeup of its roster that saw longtime emotional leader Marcus Smart and former NBA Sixth Man of the Year Malcolm Brogdon traded in favor of 7-footer Kristaps Porzingis and Jrue Holiday, who won a championship with Milwaukee in 2021.\n\nBrown said a core that features seven players from the 2022 team that lost in the Finals to Golden State, is up to the challenge.\n\n\"I think this is a special group. I really do,\" Brown said. \"We've been able to go through the experiences of having success but not having success at the same time. I think to solidify the ultimate goal is to get over the hump and win. I think that will add a lot to our legacy. But as of right now, that story is kind of still untold.\"\n\nCOACHING PERSPECTIVES\n\nThis stage is nothing new to Mavericks Coach Jason Kidd, who is in the Finals for the fifth time as a player or coach.\n\nHe has experienced lows, such as losing back-to-back trips to the Finals in 2002 and 2003 as a player with the New Jersey Nets. He has also seen success, earning his lone title as a player with Dallas in 2011 at age 38 and one as an assistant on the Lakers 2020 championship team.\n\nThe biggest lesson he has taken away is to approach it like business and be ready to live with the results. That has been his message to his team throughout these playoffs.\n\n\"This is the best of the best at the highest level,\" Kidd said. \"It's fun. That's what the Finals are all about, is seeing what team is going to step forward and take advantage of mistakes.\"\n\nMazzulla was an assistant on Ime Udoka's staff in 2022. What he learned from that experience is that the details of winning never change, even on this stage.\n\n\"The toughest team will win,\" Mazzulla said. \"The team that makes the most plays will win. The team that can execute the details at a high level will win. It's no different.\"\n\nFRIENDS AND COMPETITORS\n\nIrving is ready for what he expects to be an icy greeting from Boston's home crowd for Game 1 on Thursday.\n\nCeltics fans haven't held a high opinion of him since he ended two disappointing seasons in Boston by leaving for the Nets and joining Kevin Durant in free agency in 2019.\n\nHe then rankled the Boston faithful even more when he flipped his middle finger at fans after making a shot during Brooklyn's first round playoff series loss to the Celtics in 2022. But he said he is looking forward to matching up with \"brothers\" and former teammates Tatum and Brown.\n\n\"They've gotten tremendously better. They've led their team to this point. So I'm proud of them,\" Irving said. \"I'm looking forward to the competition because this is what we've all strived for since we were kids, basketball at this level playing against the best of the best.\"\n\nBoston Celtics guard Jaylen Brown (7) reacts in front of Indiana Pacers forward Pascal Siakam (43) after making a basket during the second half of Game 4 of the NBA Eastern Conference basketball finals, Monday, May 27, 2024, in Indianapolis.

Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is -- who's been out since the first round of the playoffs but expected back for Game 1 -- is making his return to Dallas after spending three seasons alongside Luka Don\u010di\u0107.\n\nRead more: Mavericks' Luka Don\u010di\u0107 Claps Back at Chandler Parsons for Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is Comments\n\nJayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are looking to finally take the next step as a duo and win a championship. On the flip side, Don\u010di\u0107 is looking to cement himself as a serious contender for an all-time great with a championship at 25 years old.\n\nBoston and Dallas took very different paths to get to the 2024 NBA Finals.\n\nThe Celtics were the NBA's best team all year long, coasting to the East's No. 1 seed with a 64-18 record, 14 games ahead of the No. 2-seeded New York Knicks. They then continued their dominance in the postseason, losing just two games across the first three rounds.\n\nThe Celtics took down the shorthanded Miami Heat in five games, losing only Game 2 of the five-game series. They then took down the injury-riddled Cleveland Cavaliers in five games, too, again losing just Game 2 at home. In the Eastern Conference Finals, the Celtics completed a sweep of the Indiana Pacers, who were without Tyrese Haliburton for Games 3 and 4.\n\nNow, they're just four games away from their first championship since 2008, and their record 18th championship in franchise history.\n\nThe Mavericks have other plans, though.\n\nDallas took a very different path than Boston in this year's playoffs. First, they took down the No. 4-seeded Los Angeles Clippers in six games in a back-and-forth series. Then, they ousted the No. 1-seeded Oklahoma City Thunder in another six-game series. And finally, they took out the Minnesota Timberwolves -- who had just beat the reigning-champion Denver Nuggets -- in six games, en route to their third Finals appearance in the franchise's history.\n\nThe Mavericks have won just one NBA Finals, a 2011 win over James and the Heat, and will look to add to that a little more than a decade later.\n\nThis series has all the makings of a classic. Game 1 tips off on Thursday in Boston. Time for some predictions.\n\nRead more: NBA Finals Schedule: How to Watch, Betting Odds and More for Mavericks vs Celtics\n\nGames 1 and 2 are in Boston, and Dallas won't make things easy. The Celtics have already lost multiple Game 2s at home this series, and they'll continue to struggle in the opening games of the series. The teams will split the two games in Boston, and head back to Dallas with a 1-1 series.\n\nThe Celtics haven't yet lost a road game this postseason, but that changes in Dallas. The Dallas will not only win one, they'll win back-to-back games in Games 3 and 4, giving them a 3-1 lead over the NBA's best team.\n\nGame 5 goes back to Boston, and the raucous crowd at TD Garden won't let their team go down without a fight. The Celtics will dominate in Game 5, winning by the series' largest margin to stay alive and force a Game 6 back in Dallas. Will they be able to win in Dallas and force a Game 7 back in Boston?\n\nGame 6 will be a classic, with all the best players coming to play. It will be a back and forth between Tatum and Brown and Don\u010di\u0107 and Irving, but in the end, it will be the clutch shotmaking of the latter duo that puts the Mavericks on top to win their second NBA title in franchise history.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "noah_camras@newsweek.com", "name": "Noah Camras", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandler_Parsons", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chandler Parsons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "label": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2404654/kyrie-irving-jaylen-brown.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=16dd636c492de9c7bdc4c9f5b72eda41", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

Boston is the favorite at -225, while Dallas is a +180 underdog.\n\nOdds for who will win Finals MVP are much more interesting. It's an important distinction that will live on forever for the winning franchise and will certainly shape the legacy of the player who wins it.\n\nLet's take a look at the odds for the 2024 NBA Finals MVP and make a prediction on who will win it.\n\nWith the Celtics favored to win the series, it makes perfect sense that their best player is the odds-on favorite to win Finals MVP.\n\nTatum has so much playoff experience under his belt and should be motivated to prove himself in the Finals after a subpar showing against the Warriors two years ago.\n\nHe's played well this postseason, averaging 26 points, 10.4 rebounds and 5.9 assists on 44.2% shooting, and he's coming off a series in which he scored 30.3 points per game against the Pacers.\n\nHowever, his 3-point shooting has been off in the playoffs; he's converting on just 29% of his attempts. If he can find a way to return to his regular-season form from deep (37.6%), then he could end up running away with the Finals MVP.\n\n\" READ MORE: Bet on high scoring Game 1 between the Mavericks and Celtics in NBA Finals matchup\n\nIt's hard not to consider Doncic as the Finals MVP after what he's shown this postseason. He is a perfect offensive player and is on track to grab the \"Best Player in the League\" belt with a championship, and there's a strong case to be made that he already has that title.\n\nThe Slovenian superstar can get any shot he wants, pass with wicked accuracy and present mismatches everywhere on the court due to his combination of size and quickness.\n\nIf the Mavericks somehow pull off the series upset, Doncic will certainly be the driving force behind their success.\n\nNow we're getting to the interesting, value-based part of the odds.\n\nEven though Brown isn't considered quite as good as Tatum, he is not far behind. His 2024 playoff scoring average of 25.0 points per game is almost identical to Tatum's, but he's been way more efficient because he's shot 54.1% during the playoffs and 36.8% from long range.\n\nShooting 54% through three rounds of the NBA playoffs as a non-center is ridiculous, and it's not like these shots are all near the rim as he's attempting 5.4 3-pointers per game. Remember, he was the one who drained that tough shot against the Pacers in Game 1 of the ECF.\n\nBrown didn't seem to be scared of the bright lights in his first trip to the Finals, either. He averaged 23.5 points per game against the Warriors two years ago, including a 34-point outing in Boston's Game 6 loss, and he's only improved since then.\n\nWouldn't it be something if Irving won Finals MVP at the expense of his former team. It's not very likely with Doncic as his sidekick, but Irving has played well enough this postseason to have it be within the realm of possibility.\n\nHis 22.8 points per game in the playoffs has come in a very streaky fashion, since he had three games of 30-plus points against the Timberwolves but failed to score double digits in two games vs. the Thunder, averaging just 15.7 points per game in that series.\n\nIt feels like Irving will be great in some games in the Finals but won't be consistent enough to take home the hardware.\n\n\" READ MORE: Luka Doncic has value to lead NBA Finals in points and rebounds as Mavericks take on Celtics\n\nSince I think the Celtics will win this series in seven games, Brown is my Finals MVP pick.\n\nI just don't think there has been that big of a difference between his level of play and Tatum's production this postseason, and the sizable gap in their odds value makes Brown a worthy value pick.\n\nIt's important to remember that he played better than Tatum in the Finals two years ago, and I think Porzingis' presence on the floor will open more space and lead to more driving lanes for Brown.", "source": {"uri": "inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Philadelphia Inquirer"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Murder-Mystery_and_Deduction", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Murder-Mystery and Deduction", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.inquirer.com/resizer/r30_3PMbEwFZyIBsM0tACn1Vhds=/760x507/smart/filters:format(webp)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/pmn/JDEH2L5T2ZCBNKFD7AXK75ILZM.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.584313725490196, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

Both teams bring uniquely strong attributes to the series, which tips off Thursday in Boston. With an eye on their first championship since 2008, the Celtics are under immense pressure to perform.\n\nA Celtics team desperate for championship glory face Luka Doncic and a Dallas Mavericks squad eager to play spoiler in an intriguing NBA Finals matchup that tips off Thursday in Boston.\n\nLed by superstars Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, the sharpshooting Celtics have had a relatively easy road to the finals. Coming out of the weaker Eastern Conference as the top seed, they breezed past the Jimmy Butler-less Miami Heat, dispatched the Cleveland Cavaliers and swept the Indiana Pacers, who were without point guard Tyrese Haliburton for the final two games.\n\nThe Celtics have won 12 of their 14 playoff games and gone undefeated on the road but they know that none of that will matter if they fail to end a title drought that stretches back to 2008. The mission is clear - hang that elusive 18th championship banner from the TD Garden rafters and put recent postseason disappointment, including falling to the Warriors in the 2022 finals and coming up short in the conference finals last year, firmly behind them.\n\nAnything less will be seen as a bitter disappointment. \"They were the best team in the regular season and they have been the best team in the playoffs,\" former player and current ESPN analyst JJ Redick said on a call with reporters.\n\n\"I feel strongly that they are the favorites going into this series. At the same time, I wouldn't be surprised if Luka and Dallas and Kyrie (Irving) and (head coach Jason Kidd) made this a series and won... This is going to be a phenomenal series.\" Standing in Boston's way is a confident Mavs team under far less pressure and uniquely equipped to ruin the Celtics' title aspirations.\n\nThat starts with Doncic, the 25-year-old Slovenian who is quickly becoming the face of the league. He has been the best player in the playoffs and is the first to lead in points (489), rebounds (164) and assists (150) coming into a finals.\n\nBy his side is veteran point guard Irving who, after turbulent stints in Brooklyn and Boston, has looked more comfortable and confident on the court than he has in years. \"I think it's fair to say that offensively they are as talented as any backcourt in NBA history,\" Redick said of Doncic and Irving.\n\nOne big, 7-foot 2-inch question mark hanging over the series is the health of Boston's Kristaps Porzingis, the former Maverick who suffered a calf strain in the Heat series and has been sidelined since. The Celtics are hopeful that their prized offseason acquisition, who averaged 20.1 points and 7.2 rebounds and 1.9 blocks during the regular season, will be healthy enough to match up against the Mavs' breakout big men Daniel Gafford and Dereck Lively II.\n\nGame One of the NBA Finals is Thursday in Boston.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kidd", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jason Kidd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/05_06_2024_13_04_02_7851261.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

This is the team's chance to pull ahead.\n\nGame 1 will be on June 6, 2023, and will be held at Boston's TD Garden.\n\nIn the regular season, the Mavericks were 50-32, and the Celtics were 64-18.\n\nEven with the Celtics having more regular season wins, the Mavericks are expected to be tough competition.\n\nDallas' duo of Luka Donc\u030cic\u0301 and Kyrie Irving shut down Minneapolis in Game 5 of their playoffs series, making them the Western Conference champions to Boston's Eastern Conference champions.\n\nThe Celtics' best players will have to contend with Donc\u030cic\u0301 and Irving, made even more complicated by the fact that Irving is a former Celtic, now going up against the Celtics as a Mavericks player.\n\nJaylen Brown has been the game-winner up for the Celtics during the playoffs. He won the Eastern Conference Finals MVP after he averaged a team-high 30.3 points a game in the Indiana series.\n\nDuring the regular season, Brown averaged 23 points per game with 5.5 rebounds and 3.6 assists. He also shot 35% from behind the arc.\n\nIn the postseason, he's only gotten better, with 25 points per game with 6.1 rebounds, although a lower assist stat. However, he is now shooting 36.8% with three-pointers.\n\nIn the last game the Celtics played, Brown put 29 points on the board against the Pacers.\n\nCeltics star Jayson Tatum has averaged 26 points and is shooting 29% from 3-point territory this postseason.\n\nHe also has an average of 10.4 rebounds per game, which is better than his teammate Brown's rebound stat.\n\nTatum scored 26 points in the last game the Celtics played.\n\nBrown and Tatum will likely square off against the Mavericks' combo of Donc\u030cic\u0301 and Irving.\n\nBoston Celtics Stats: See the stats for the whole team\n\nDonc\u030cic\u0301, despite this being his first time to the NBA championships, is looking to be the most dominant player in this series.\n\nHe is averaging 28.8 points per game in this playoff run and shooting 34.3% from three-point land.\n\nIrving, who suited up for Boston in the 2017-18 and 2018-19 seasons, is averaging 22.8 points this postseason, and shooting 42.1% from behind the arc.\n\nIn the last game the Mavericks played, Irving also put up 36 points.\n\nRin Velasco is a trending reporter.

Boston's most recent title came in 2008.\n\nThe Mavericks won their only NBA title in 2011 after reaching the 2006 final, losing to Miami.\n\nIrving will be the emotional heart of the series after his Boston stay and a playoff return with Brooklyn that went poorly.\n\n\"I'm better at consolidating the emotions now,\" Irving said. \"You call it animosity. We call it hate. We call it, 'It's going to be hell in Boston.'\"\n\n\"The last time in Boston (in the playoffs with Brooklyn), I don't think that was the best... everyone saw me flip off the birds and kind of lose my (cool) a little bit.\n\n\"I wasn't my best self at that time. I've been able to grow since then... I'm looking forward to it. I'll take the brunt of it, all the yells and all the remarks.\n\n'No stopping them'\n\n\"That wasn't a great reflection of who I am and how I like to compete on a high level.\"\n\nHe's on a high now, averaging 22.8 points in the playoffs as Slovenian guard Doncic, who averaged 33 points in the regular season, averages 28.8 points, 9.6 rebounds and 8.8 assists in the playoffs.\n\nBoston counters with two of the NBA's top defensive guards in Jrue Holiday and Derrick White.\n\n\"There's really no stopping them. You just try to make it difficult for them,\" White said. \"They're going to take tough shots and they're going to make tough shots. Just trust that over 48 minutes what we're doing is going to work.\"\n\nTatum averages 26.0 points and 10.4 rebounds in the playoffs with Brown averages 25.0 points with White and Holiday providing strong support and the team leading the NBA in 3-point shots and baskets. The Celtics are 9-0 when hitting 14 or more three-pointers.\n\n\"Boston shoots the three at a high rate,\" Mavs coach Jason Kidd said. \"They have a lot of talented players. They've been here before, they have the experience. They're well-coached. This is another great test.\"\n\nDallas center Dereck Lively isn't sweating the experience factor.\n\n\"They have a lot of tradition, but that doesn't matter. What matters is who's going to go harder on the court,\" Lively said. \"It's going to be a dogfight out there, but we're going to keep swinging and see what happens.\"\n\nBoston, which defeated the Mavericks in both meetings this season, expects to have Latvian center Kristaps Porzingis back from a right calf strain suffered on April 29 in the first round against Miami that benched him for 10 games.\n\n\"He has been working extremely hard just to get back and to help us in any way he can,\" White said.\n\n\"When KP is at his best, he has been tremendous for us,\" Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said. \"We expect that from him.\"", "source": {"uri": "rfi.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "RFI"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki",

This is the sixth time in eight years the franchise has reached at least the Conference Finals and the second time in three years Boston has reached the Finals. The coveted Larry O'Brien Trophy, however, has so far eluded them.\n\nVictory in this year's Finals would give the Celtics a record-breaking 18th NBA title, taking them past the Los Angeles Lakers as the most successful franchise in the league.\n\nCritics and opponents have at times maligned the Celtics as having a soft underbelly, with key players or the team as a whole struggling in the biggest moments; both last year's shock loss to the No. 8 seed Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference Finals and Jayson Tatum's performances in the 2022 NBA Finals being examples of these concerns.\n\n\"There's a lot that myself and we can learn from that experience, being in the Finals,\" Tatum told reporters. \"This go-around is a lot different. Obviously, we've been there before and we came up short. It's a great opportunity to make it to Finals again, you don't always get a second chance.\n\n\"I'm really just looking at it as a second chance, trying to simplify things as much as we can. It's another series that we gotta win.\n\n\"Having nine days off [before the Finals] is good for your body and for everybody to get healthy, but we're in the NBA Finals and we're all so anxious and excited to play. I wish it did start a little bit earlier, so we could get after it, but we have a lot of guys of who been here before and we understand the magnitude of this moment and saying sharp, fresh and staying ready.\"\n\nBut the team has shown impressive mettle this postseason, in particular in the Conference Finals against the Indiana Pacers. Three times in that series, the Celtics found themselves down late but turned each of the games around to earn a sweep, thanks largely to series MVP Jaylen Brown.\n\nAccording to ESPN Stats and Info, the Pacers had at least a 90% win probability during the fourth quarters of Games 1, 3 and 4.\n\nCan Luka emulate Dirk?\n\nWhile the Celtics have been on a roll since day one, the Dallas Mavericks didn't really turn their season around until February's trade deadline.\n\nThe addition of more size and length in Daniel Gafford and PJ Washington has perfectly complimented the superstar backcourt of Luka Don\u010di\u0107 and Kyrie Irving, who have taken turns carrying the team throughout this playoff run.\n\nMeanwhile, Dereck Lively II is capping off a mightily impressive rookie season by becoming a valuable rotation piece for the Mavericks this playoff run, while Derrick Jones Jr. has grown as a player and made some huge buckets in the postseason.\n\nThough Don\u010di\u0107, who finished third in MVP voting, is still performing at a high level, a knee injury means he has struggled at times to reach the heights of the regular season; so much of Dallas' success will rest on the Slovenian's fitness and form.\n\nHead coach Jason Kidd could further cement his place in Mavericks history by leading the team to the title. It has been 13 years since Kidd helped bring the franchise its first and only Larry O'Brien trophy as a player, assisting Dirk Nowitzki in a stunning Finals win over the Miami Heat.\n\n\"It was a tough road to get back here [the Finals],\" Irving told reporters. \"So I'm just appreciating all of the little steps that it took, appreciating all the people who helped me grow. It was a great reflection period the last couple of days just thinking about not only the past few years, but what we were able to accomplish this year in such a short period of time.\n\n\"How we galvanized the city of Dallas and our fans, and it just feels like we've got the whole world supporting us throughout this endeavor, so I'm appreciative and grateful for everything that I had to go through and everything my teammates had to go through in order to get here with me.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Founded in 1980, the team has two key players who provide offensive firepower and scoring ability.\n\nLuka Doncic, undoubtedly the most prolific offensive player in recent years, is averaging 29.9 points, 8.8 rebounds and 7.5 assists, even including his rookie year (when all big stars tend to have lower numbers due to rotations and strategies that start rookies on the sidelines). However, his record against the Celtics is a mixed 5-6.\n\nLuka is often indefensible and will be the focus of the offence (first and second offensive setups, minimum, in addition to double-teams and a defensive system centred around him), but he won't be alone. Former Celtics player Kyrie Irving is a potent offensive weapon, especially from three-point range.\n\n\"They're the best team in the NBA,\" said Doncic. \"They have by far the best record, some incredible weapons on the offensive and defensive end, so we're going to have to play some really hard and amazing basketball to beat them,\" the former Real Madrid man admitted, putting the pressure on his rivals.\n\nFor the Celtics, Jayson Tatum will be looking to avenge the 2-4 loss to Golden State in 2022. \"There's a lot that I can learn and we can learn from the experience of being in the Finals, and this go-round is a lot different,\" Tatum said. \"I'm really just looking at it as a second chance and trying to simplify things as much as we can.\"\n\nThe team from the capital of Massachusetts will be looking to reign supreme in the NBA, sharing 17 titles with the Lakers, who joined them in 2020 during the pandemic bubble. Boston last won the title in 2008.\n\nThe Mavericks will be playing in their third final, having won in 2011 and lost to Miami's Shaquille O'Neal and Dwyane Wade in 2006. This will be the first final for the Texans without German Dirk Nowitzki, although they will have another unconventional white European player in Luka Doncic, who averaged 33 points in the regular season and 28.8 points, 9.6 rebounds and 8.8 assists in the playoffs.\n\nIrving (22.8 points in the playoffs) will be the emotional heart of the series after his stint in Boston and an unsuccessful return to the playoffs with Brooklyn. He knows what it takes to win a championship ring (he did it in one of the most memorable Finals in 2016, when the Cleveland Cavaliers overcame a 3-1 deficit against the Golden State Warriors to win 4-3).\n\n\"I'm better at consolidating emotions now,\" Irving said. \"You call it animosity. We call it hate. We call it, 'It's going to be hell in Boston.\n\n\"The last time in Boston (in the playoffs with Brooklyn), I don't think it was the best... everybody saw me flip off the birds and kind of lose my cool a little bit.\n\n\"I wasn't at my best then. I've grown since then... I'm looking forward to it. I'm going to take the brunt of it, all the shouting and all the comments. It wasn't a good reflection of who I am and how I like to compete at a high level,\" the 6'2\" (1.8m) guard concluded.\n\nBoston will counter with two of the NBA's best defensive guards in Jrue Holiday and Derric Williams.\n\n\"You can't really stop them. You just try to make it tough for them,\" White admitted. \"They're going to take tough shots and they're going to make tough shots. You just have to trust that what we're doing is going to work for 48 minutes.\"\n\nTatum is averaging 26.0 points and 10.4 rebounds in the playoffs, while Brown is averaging 25.0 points, with White and Holiday providing strong defensive support. The team leads the NBA in three-pointers made and baskets made. The Celtics are 9-0 when making 14 or more three-pointers, a key defensive challenge for the Mavericks.\n\n\"Boston shoots the three at a high rate,\" said Mavs coach Jason Kidd. \"They've got a lot of talented players. They've been here before, they've got the experience. They're well coached. This is another great test.\"\n\nDallas centre Dereck Lively isn't worried about the experience factor. \"They have a lot of tradition, but that doesn't matter. What matters is who's going to come out harder on the court,\" Lively said. \"It's going to be a dogfight out there, but we'll just keep swinging and see what happens.\"\n\nBoston will be favoured because of their history and current form, as well as having beaten the Mavericks in both regular season meetings this year.\n\nThey will be hoping to get Latvian centre Kristaps Porzingis back from a right calf strain that sidelined him for 10 games in the first round against Miami on 29 April.\n\n\"He's been working extremely hard to get back and help us in any way he can,\" White said.\n\n\"When KP is at his best, he has been tremendous for us,\" Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said. \"We expect that from him.\"\n\nThe NBA Finals are approaching and promise to be as exciting as ever, with an extra twist this year. If the Celtics win, they will once again dominate the NBA, as they have for many years in the history of the 76 championships contested (including this year).\n\nOn the other hand, Luka Doncic, often questioned for his unconventional style and physique (as well as being white and European), could finally establish himself as an NBA star, not just any star, but one who can compete with the greats of history. This would be a significant shift for an American public often reluctant to embrace international figures despite their impressive statistics. A championship ring could change everything for him, and for an NBA where homegrown players have been losing ground for years.", "source": {"uri": "insidethegames.biz", "dataType": "news", "title":

Now, we take a look at who they're playing. For the first time ever, the Mavs will compete against a team not named the Miami Heat in the NBA Finals.\n\nThis time, the Mavericks face the legacy franchise of Boston, who are looking to break the league record and claim an 18th title. The Celtics have been the league's best team all year long, boasting the best record in the NBA. The Mavs, however, are arguably the league's hottest team at the moment.\n\nHere is a deep dive into the Boston Celtics and how they got here:\n\nThe Celtics entered the NBA Playoffs with the best record in the NBA (64-18).\n\nThe No. 2 seed in the East, New York Knicks, finished 14 games back from the Celtics. The Western Conference was a much tighter race, with the No. 1 through No. 3 seeds finishing one game apart from each other: OKC (57-25), Denver (57-25), and Minnesota (56-26). Similarly, the No. 4 through No. 10 seeds in the West were only separated from each other by five games.\n\nBoston steamrolled through the Eastern Conference in the playoffs, winning their series twice in only five games and sweeping the Indian Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nDallas' road to the Finals was much rockier - upsetting the Western Conference No. 4 seed Clippers in six games, No. 1 seed Thunder in six games and No. 3 seed Timberwolves in five games.\n\nEight of Boston's 12 playoff wins this postseason run have been by a 10-point margin or more, too. Dallas has won eight of their 12 playoff wins by five points or less.\n\nThe Celtics, like the Mavs, are spearheaded by a dynamic duo: Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown.\n\nTatum and Brown averaged 26 and 25 points per game this postseason, respectively. Tatum also averages 10.6 rebounds per game in the playoffs this year.\n\nBoston's main weapon is the quantity and efficiency of its 3-point shooting. According to NBA stats, they've taken 47.4% of their shots from 3-point range, the highest rate in the playoffs by a healthy margin, and tick higher than their league-high rate in the regular season (47.1%). As a team, they've made 36.8% of those threes.\n\nTatum also leads the playoffs in cumulative plus-minus, with the Celtics having outscored their opponents by 141 points with him on the floor.\n\nThere is a little bit of controversy with this story.\n\nThe Celtics former coach, Ime Udoka, who now coaches the Houston Rockets, was suspended and \"dismissed\" in September 2022 for an improper workplace relationship within the Celtics organization. Udoka had just led the Celtics to the NBA Finals in the previous season, and Mazzulla, an assistant coach at the time for Boston, took over the reins as the head man.\n\nMazzulla was named the interim head coach and the interim title was dropped in February 2023.\n\nMazzulla's first year as head coach ended in the Eastern Conference Finals, where the Celtics lost to the Jimmy Butler-led Miami Heat.\n\nBrad Stevens parlayed his successful coaching career at Butler University, where he led the Bulldogs to back-to-back National Championship game appearances as a 5 seed and 8 seed, into a head coaching gig with the Celtics in 2013. Stevens served as the Celtics coach for eight seasons and moved from his head coaching role into the front office.\n\nStevens was named Boston's president of basketball operations after longtime GM Danny Ainge retired.\n\nStevens was awarded with the NBA Executive of the Year Award for this season.\n\nThese are the regular season stats for the Celtics and Mavs compared to the rest of the league.", "source": {"uri": "wfaa.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WFAA-TV Channel 8"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5,

Boston's most recent title came in 2008.\n\nThe Mavericks won their only NBA title in 2011 after reaching the 2006 final, losing to Miami.\n\nIrving will be the emotional heart of the series after his Boston stay and a playoff return with Brooklyn that went poorly.\n\n\"I'm better at consolidating the emotions now,\" Irving said. \"You call it animosity.

The Boston Celtics and the Dallas Mavericks square off in Game 1 of the 2024 NBA Finals on Thursday evening. The Mavericks are seeking to win their second NBA Finals in franchise history. Meanwhile, Boston has won 17 total championships, tied with the Los Angeles Lakers for most in the NBA. However, the Celtics haven't hoisted the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy since 2008.\n\nTipoff is at 8:30 p.m. ET from TD Garden in Boston. The latest Mavericks vs. Celtics odds from SportsLine consensus list Boston as 6.5-point favorites, while the over/under for total points scored is 214.5. Before locking in any Celtics vs. Mavericks picks for the 2024 NBA Finals, you'll want to see the NBA predictions and betting advice from the proven computer model at SportsLine.\n\nThe SportsLine Projection Model simulates every NBA game 10,000 times and has returned well over $10,000 in profit for $100 players on its top-rated NBA picks over the past five-plus seasons. The model entered the 2024 NBA Finals on a sizzling 94-61 roll on all top-rated NBA picks this season, returning more than $2,800. Anyone following has seen huge returns.\n\nNow, the model has set its sights on Celtics vs. Mavs and just locked in its picks and NBA Finals predictions. You can head to SportsLine now to see the model's picks. Here are several NBA betting lines and trends for Mavs vs. Celtics:\n\nCeltics vs. Mavericks spread: Boston -6.5Celtics vs. Mavericks over/under: 214.5 pointsCeltics vs. Mavericks money line: Boston -250, Dallas +204BOS: The Boston Celtics have hit the 1H money line in 37 of their last 44 gamesDAL: The Dallas Mavericks have covered in in 35 of their last 50 gamesCeltics vs. Mavericks picks: See picks at SportsLineWhy the Mavericks can cover\n\nThe Mavericks have been able to be very active and effective in the lane. During the 2024 NBA playoffs, the Mavs average 6.2 blocks and 43.1 rebounds per game. Both of those numbers ranked within the top four of all teams in the postseason. A big reason for that is two active members in the frontcourt. Center Daniel Gafford is a strong finisher around the rim with the ability to soar high for alley-oops. Meanwhile, defensively he's a great shot blocker.\n\nIn the Western Conference finals versus the Timberwolves, he averaged 10.8 points, 6.8 rebounds, 2.6 blocks, and shot 75% from the field. In his last outing, Gafford finished with 11 points and nine rebounds. Center Dereck Lively II is a supplementary presence in the frontcourt. Lively has been a great finisher in the lane with soft hands. In the 2024 NBA playoffs, he's averaging 8.6 points and 7.2 rebounds per game off the bench. See which team to pick here.\n\nWhy the Celtics can cover\n\nForward Jayson Tatum is one of the top playmakers and shot-creators in the NBA. Tatum's footwork is elite to create space on the perimeter to either get into the lane or get a clean look as a jump shooter. The five-time All-Star also has good court vision as a passer. He ranks first on the team in points (26), rebounds (10.4), and assists (5.9) in the 2024 NBA playoffs. In the Game 4 win over the Pacers, Tatum notched 26 points, 13 rebounds, and eight assists.\n\nGuard Jrue Holiday has consistently been a two-way threat in the backcourt. Holiday is a pesky and active defender due to his instincts. The UCLA product will get his teammates involved and likes to get downhill. In the Eastern Conference finals, he averaged 18.5 points, 7.3 rebounds, and 5.8 assists per game. See which team to pick here.\n\nHow to make Mavericks vs. Celtics picks\n\nSportsLine's model is leaning Over on the total, projecting 220 combined points. The model also says one side of the spread hits well over 50% of the time.

Mavericks vs. Celtics picks, predictions and odds", "body": "The 2024 NBA Finals are set. Will Jayson Tatum and the Celtics surpass the Lakers for most titles won, or will Luka and the Mavs bring home Dallas' first championship since 2011?\n\nThe Mavericks beat the 51-win Los Angeles Clippers, 57-win Oklahoma City Thunder and 56-win Minnesota Timberwolves with Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving starring and a capable cast of know-their-role guys providing support, including trade-deadline acquisitions P.J. Washington from Charlotte and Daniel Gafford from Washington.\n\nSince the deadline the Mavs have been one of the best teams in the league, showing marked improvement offensively and defensively. They rely on Doncic's playmaking but they have other capable scorers, make enough 3s and love alley-oop lobs.\n\nBoston is a force. The Celtics possessed the NBA's best offense and No. 2 defense and had a league-best 64 victories. When Kristaps Porzingis is in the lineup, the Celtics have the best starting five in the league and are the best two-way team in the league. They have multiple scorers, led by Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum, and it's not unusual for a third player (Jrue Holiday, Derrick White, Porzingis) to score 20 in a game. Defensively, they have size, strength and length and two All-Defense selections in Holiday and White. They come at an opponent several different ways, and the pressure is constant.\n\nThe Celtics like their 3s, and they're proficient at making them. When 3s are going in and Brown and Tatum are both in the 20s, the Celtics are tough to beat.\n\nHere are USA TODAY Sports' NBA experts' picks and predictions for the 2024 Finals:\n\nThis potentially will come down to which duo plays better: Kyrie and Luka or Tatum and Brown? But the X-factor is Kristaps Porzingis. If he can give them anything after coming back from a 10-game absence because of a calf injury, the Celtics should hoist banner No. 18, because they are just too deep and too good.\n\nThe Celtics had a fairly uncontested route to the NBA Finals, facing the Miami Heat, Cleveland Cavaliers and Indiana Pacers, all of whom were missing major star power, including Jimmy Butler (Heat), Donovan Mitchell (Cavaliers), Jarrett Allen (Cavaliers) and Tyrese Haliburton (Pacers). But the Celtics will face a superstar pair in Doncic and Irving. The series will be a close one, but the Mavericks have the closers to get this done.\n\nI believe in underdogs - and particularly in Luka's ability to break hearts.\n\nThe Celtics have too many offensive weapons and too many defensive options so unless their offense takes a dip for an extended time, the Celtics will win the title.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Gafford", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Gafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Butler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Butler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donovan_Mitchell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donovan Mitchell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrett_Allen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jarrett Allen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Ethnic_and_Regional", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Ethnic and Regional", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/05/USAT/73979640007-usatsi-22661772.jpg?auto=webp&crop=4502,2531,x0,y52&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

They've got two of the best ever. Obviously, Jayson Tatum and those guys are really good. Jaylen Brown is really good. But Luka and Kyrie are something we haven't seen.\"\n\nThomas is basically saying that the Mavericks not only have the best player in the series in Luka Doncic but, with Kyrie Irving, have the two best players - even over Jayson Tatum and Jalen Brown.\n\nOf course, not everyone agrees with Thomas.\n\nThere is a general consensus among sports fans heading into this series that the Mavericks have the best player of the two teams in Doncic, but that Boston probably has more talent overall. The best player on the Celtics of course is Tatum, and recently, sports media personality Stephen A. Smith took to First Take to make a controversial statement, as he has been known to do, that will have Mavericks fans riled up.\n\n\"I'm going to go with Jayson Tatum, believe it or not,\" said Smith, when asked who has had the better career thus far between Doncic and Tatum. \"Here's a couple of things. Luka's been in the league for six years. He's missed the playoffs twice, and he's been bounced out of the first round twice. So, four of the six years, he either hasn't made it past the first round or hasn't made it to the first round at all... In Jayson Tatum's seven years in the NBA, he's only been bounced out of the first round one time. He's been to five conference finals, and now his second NBA Finals appearance, and when you look at that kind of resume, that's where I think he gets the edge.\"\n\nMavericks vs. Celtics NBA Finals nearly underway\n\nGame 1 between the Mavericks and Celtics will be on Thursday from Boston.\n\nIf there is one thing that is apparent before this series even gets underway, it is that this year's title means a lot to both organizations. The Celtics are looking to claim the 18th title in franchise history and their first since 2008. The Mavericks are looking to capture the second championship in franchise history. In doing so, Dallas would become the 12th team in the league with multiple titles.\n\nInterestingly enough, the last time the Mavericks won an NBA Finals, Jason Kidd was helping lead the way next to Dirk Nowitzki, who many tend to call the greatest international player ever. Now, Kidd has a chance to guide the Mavs to their second championship, only this time he is their head coach and may be witnessing the start of Doncic's reign as the greatest European basketball player.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "peter_sampson@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Peter Sampson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Thomas_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Isaiah Thomas (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_A._Smith", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen A.

Let's continue our NBA odds series with a Mavericks-Celtics prediction and pick.\n\nThe Celtics host the Mavericks in the NBA Finals on Thursday in Game 1! This series has all of the makings of a great Finals. It is a matchup of dynamic duos with Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum going up against Kyrie Irving and Luka Doncic. Let's continue our NBA odds series with a Mavericks-Celtics prediction and pick.\n\nThe Mavericks have done wonders with their dynamic duo of Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving. The key will again be where the scoring comes from after those two. PJ Washington has been that third scorer, but they have also gotten great play from Dereck Lively II, Derrick Jones Jr., and Daniel Gafford. The Mavericks have rolled through the postseason thanks to their duo just one season after flaming out and not even making the playoffs. They have playmaking, athleticism, and the coaching with Jason Kidd to win the title, but they are playing a juggernaut of a team in the Celtics. They have the elements to win, and make it a close series.\n\nThe Celtics were the best team in the NBA all season. They have been dominant in the postseason too, winning every series by five games and then swept their final one. They have the depth and talent to compete with anyone. They can come at teams in waves with Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, and Derrick White, but then Kristaps Porzingis and Jrue Holiday are also stars in their own right. The Celtics are the better team not just in this game, but the entire series. The difference for the Celtics is that they are just as great on offense as on defense. It is an NBA championship or bust for the Celtics, and it might make it even sweeter to go up against Kyrie Irving for that potential championship.\n\nHow to Watch Mavericks vs. Celtics NBA Finals Game 1\n\nThe Mavericks have been one of the best offensive teams in the NBA this season thanks to their dynamic duo. They were 7th in scoring offense at 117.9 points per game. They were also 11th in total field goal percentage and 13th in three-point percentage at 48.1% and 36.9% respectively. In the postseason, the Mavericks are averaging 107.9 points per game, 47.1% from the field, and 37.2% from behind the arc. Three Mavericks are averaging over double digits in scoring with Luka Doncic leading the way at 28.8 points per game. Doncic does everything for the Mavericks because he also leads the way in rebounding at 9.6 per game and in assists at 8.8 per game. Doncic does everything for the Mavericks, but the key is will be how much help he has from Kyrie Irving against his old team and how much help they get from the rest of the lineup.\n\nThe defense for the Mavericks has been a tale of two units in the regular season and the postseason. During the season, they were 20th in the league in scoring defense, allowing 115.6 points per game. They were also 20th in field goal percentage at 47.5% and 18th in three-point percentage at 36.8%. In the postseason, their defense has been a massive x-factor. They are allowing 103.9 points per game, 44.5% from the field, and then they are allowing 35.6% from behind the arc. Four Mavericks average at least 0.9 steals per game with Doncic leading the way at 1.6. Daniel Gafford then leads the way in blocks at 1.8 per game. Their defense needs to step up against the Celtics and how much depth they have on offense.\n\nWhy The Celtics Could Cover The Spread/Win\n\nThe Celtics have been the most well-rounded and best team in the NBA this season. They were second in scoring at 120.6 points per game, eighth in field goal percentage at 48.7%, and then second in three-point percentage at 38.8%. In the postseason, the Celtics are averaging 111.4 points per game, 48% from the field, and 36.8% from behind the arc. Five different Celtics are averaging over double digits with Jayson Tatum leading the way at 26 points per game. Tatum has been the difference maker for the Celtics in the postseason because he also leads the way in rebounding at 10.4 per game and in assists at 5.9 per game.\n\nThe Celtics' defense has been great all year and it has not changed at all from the regular season to the postseason. They were fifth in scoring defense at 109.2 points per game, second in field goal percentage defense at 45.3%, and fourth in three-point percentage defense at 35.2%. In the postseason, they are allowing 101.3 points per game, 46.7% from the field, and 33.8% from behind the arc. Four Celtics are averaging over one steal with Kristaps Porzingis and Jrue Holiday tied for the lead at 1.3 per game. Porzingis then leads the way in blocks at 1.5 per game. Their defense does not get as much attention, but it is elite and needs to be elite against this Mavericks offense.\n\nFinal Mavericks-Celtics Prediction & Pick\n\nThe Mavericks have been red-hot, but the rest and time off might hurt them as much as it might hurt the Celtics after sweeping the Pacers. There is the rust factor for the Celtics and that is why this spread is too big. The Celtics should still win at home, but the Mavericks should keep it close thanks to Luka and Kyrie, and cover this spread.\n\nClick here for more betting news and predictions", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jake_faigus@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Jake Faigus", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_goal_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Field goal percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kidd", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jason Kidd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_Jones_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Derrick Jones Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Mavericks-vs-Celtics-Game-1-prediction-odds-pick.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

The Hall of Famer noticed this year's team didn't celebrate too heavily after winning the Eastern Conference Championship. Instead, Boston kept their eye on the prize and Kevin Garnett took notice.\n\n\"Listen man when you're in the fraternity man you understand the bylaws, you understand the mentality. You know I didn't see any of those guys grab the ball when they won the Eastern Conference Finals, they wasn't really hoo-rahing. That ain't really Celtic culture. The Eastern Conference is the path, you got to go through the path but you don't celebrate until you hoist the Larry O'Brien and that's that's law.\"\n\nThe Celtics have been the top team in the NBA all season long. They earned the No. 1 seed of the Eastern Conference and essentially ran through the playoffs. It's championship or bust for Boston as the franchise aims to win its first championship since 2008.\n\nIt's also one of the most winningest sports franchises in American sports history. So, the fact Kevin Garnett is mentioning the history ahead of the NBA Finals makes sense. Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, and the entire roster have a ton pressure to live up to that Celtics history.\n\nHow the Celtics take Game 1 over the Mavericks\n\nThe Mavericks have made a brilliant run to the NBA Finals with Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving leading the way. Both players have been playing out of their mind and they've been a fantastic duo. So, the Celtics will have their hands full in this series.\n\nConsidering how good Doncic and Irving are offensively, it's hard to imagine Boston actually lock them down. Instead, the Celtics would be wise to shut down the role players who have stepped up big throughout the postseason.\n\nKeeping Dereck Lively II off the glass will be a necessity if Boston hopes to beat the Mavericks. Additionally, preventing PJ Washington from getting how will be essential as well. If the Celtics can limit the supporting cast around Doncic and Irving then their chances to win Game 1 drastically improves.\n\nOffensively, the Celtics have to continue relying on Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. They've been fantastic throughout the playoffs and that should continue on Thursday night.

They ended it with another blockbuster deal to solidify what was overwhelmingly the best starting group in the NBA.\n\nBoston wasn't just the best team in the NBA all season -- it was statistically one of the most dominant teams in league history. Anything less than a championship was always going to feel like a disappointment for the Celtics, and now they're four wins away from banner No. 18. The Celtics enter the 2024 NBA Finals as a sizable favorite against the Dallas Mavericks. The Mavs might have the biggest star on the floor, but Boston has six of the eight-or-nine best players in the series.\n\nThe Celtics were in the NBA Finals in 2022 and seem like they make at least the conference finals every season. After trading for Kristaps Porzingis and Jrue Holiday in the offseason, Boston finally has the pieces around stars Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown to win it all. Here are three reasons why the Celtics are destined to win the 2024 NBA Finals.\n\nThe Celtics punished teams on both ends of the floor all year. Boston was No. 1 in offensive rating, No. 2 in defense rating, and No. 1 in net-rating. Trading Marcus Smart for Porzginis at the start of the offseason cemented the Celtics as a five-out team that threatened the opposing defense from every spot on the floor. Adding Jrue Holiday late in the offseason in the aftermath of Milwaukee's move for Damian Lillard gave Boston the lockdown defense and offensive connector it needed to stamp itself as the best team in the league.\n\nBoston's starting group played 1,293 possessions this season and out-scored their opponents by 12 points per 100 possessions, according to Cleaning the Glass. Milwaukee and Denver each had slightly stronger point-differentials, but no one could match the way Boston's group drove winning. The Celtics' 64 wins were the most in the NBA, and 14 more than anyone else in the East. Even if their playoff road ended up being a little soft, no one can say the Celtics are unproven entering the NBA Finals. They dominated the entire season.\n\nThe Celtics are dedicated to shooting threes with high volume, and it makes sense because they have so many great shooters in the lineup. Boston took 47.1 percent of their shots from three-point range this season, which ranked No. 1 in the league. It made 38.8 percent of their threes, which ranked No. 2 in the league. On the season, Boston made 1,351 three-pointers, which was 140 more than the next best team, the Golden State Warriors.\n\nWhen the Celtics go on a three-point barrage, it feels like a knockout punch no team can come back from. Every player in Boston's starting five made at least 35 percent of their threes, which is so impressive given their massive volume. Even the Celtics' bench -- the obvious weakness of the team -- is filled with players who can space the floor and hit an open three. Al Horford hit 42 percent of his threes this year, Sam Hauser hit 42.4 percent from deep, and Payton Pritchard made 38.5 percent of his long balls.\n\nThe Celtics can generate open looks from three easily with so many great drivers and passers. When they get hot and knock them down, the game is usually over in the blink of an eye.\n\nThe NBA Playoffs often turn into a game of picking out the worst defender, having their man set a screen for your star, and letting that star go to work. Good luck playing that game against the Celtics: Boston starts four awesome on-ball defenders, and then has a very good rim protector in Porzingis manning the backline.\n\nLuka Doncic will be Boston's toughest test yet, but no team in the league is better prepared to handle him. Doncic has called Jrue Holiday the toughest defender he's faced. The Celtics can put Tatum on Dallas' centers and switch every screen. Derrick White is excellent at shooting at the gaps and providing help, while Jaylen Brown does a good job of keeping his man in front of him. There's no defensive liability in Boston's lineup.", "source": {"uri": "sbnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SB Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ricky_o_donnell@sbnation.com", "name": "Ricky O'Donnell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Smart", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Smart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damian_Lillard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Damian Lillard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payton_Pritchard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Payton Pritchard"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GEOkIohBh0eBTpT57zf4XC7X3_Q=/0x358:4337x2527/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25477372/2154446730.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Doncic is a three-level scorer with a limitless range. The 25-year-old also has pinpoint accuracy as a facilitator to create good opportunities for his teammates. In the Western Conference finals, Doncic averaged 32.4 points, 9.6 rebounds, and 8.4 assists per game. On May 28, Doncic racked up 28 points, 15 rebounds, and 10 assists against the Timberwolves.\n\nDallas' offense has been effective in multiple aspects, with Doncic being the engine. The Mavericks average 107.9 points and 22.4 assists in the postseason, while shooting 37.2% from beyond the arc. Meanwhile, defensively, the Mavericks are holding opponents to 103.9 points in the playoffs and forcing them to shoot 32% from 3-point land. See which team to pick here.\n\nWhy the Celtics can cover\n\nCenter Al Horford gives Boston a veteran clog in the frontcourt. Horford is able to stretch the floor due to his jumper and does a good job fighting for rebounds. He stepped up in the absence of Kristaps Porzingis (calf), who went down in the first round. In the Eastern Conference finals versus the Pacers, Horford averaged 12.8 points, 7.3 rebounds, and made 39% of his 3-pointers. On May 25 versus Indiana, he had 25 points, five boards, and went 7-of-12 from downtown.\n\nGuard Payton Pritchard provides a nice boost off the bench. Pritchard has the offensive skillset to score in bunches from time to time and owns a smooth jumper. He's scored in double figures in five playoff games thus far. In the Game 2 win over the Pacers, Pritchard tallied 12 points, two assists, and knocked down both 3-pointers. In the 2024 NBA playoffs, he's averaging 7.5 points, 2.3 assists, and shooting 45% from beyond the arc.

Drama drives fan interest and fan interest drives ratings. Given how anticlimactic the conference finals were, it shouldn't be that shocking that the NBA's ratings are down from last year's postseason. The good news for the league is that the NBA Finals between the Boston Celtics and the Dallas Mavericks should make for must-see TV.\n\nThe Indiana Pacers and Minnesota Timberwolves both kept things competitive during individual games, but their opponents still managed to take 3-0 leads against them in their respective conference finals. Boston ended up sweeping Indiana, who consistently fell apart in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, the Timberwolves, who knocked out the defending champion Denver Nuggets in the previous series, only managed to salvage only a single game in their series.\n\nIt's hard to imagine this NBA Finals being one-sided, however. The Celtics had the best record in the NBA, taking a 14-game lead over the second-place New York Knicks in the East. Meanwhile, the fifth-seeded Mavericks have saved their best basketball for the postseason and have had to defeat stronger competition than the Celtics to reach this far. While Boston may have beaten the Mavericks in both of their regular season games -- and has home-court advantage -- Dallas has been outplaying them and has the best individual player in Luka Don\u010di\u0107.\n\nThese two teams are also reliable draws. Dallas is the league's fifth-largest market while Boston is their eight-largest market. These are two big-ticket teams, so it's unsurprising that the ticket prices for the NBA Finals have been hitting record highs.\n\nAnd star power? These two teams have it. Don\u010di\u0107 has been one of the best players in the league for years despite not having the same postseason success as Giannis Antetokounmpo and Nikola Joki\u0107. Don\u010di\u0107's sidekick Kyrie Irving never stopped being one of the most talked about players in the NBA, but for the first time in years it's primarily about what he's doing on the court. Over in Boston, Jayson Tatum is an established star and -- even if Stephen A. Smith has doubts -- Jaylen Brown has made a case that he should be one as well.\n\nIt's also been a while since either of these two teams has won a championship. The Mavericks last won in 2011, while the Celtics' last victory hasn't been since 2008. Since then, they've sat and watched the Los Angeles Lakers tie their NBA record of 17 championships. Make no mistake, all these Celtics are desperate for Banner 18, particularly 38-year-old Al Horford who is still searching for his first ring.\n\nOf course, the Celtics have regularly gotten deep into the playoffs in the Tatum-Brown Era but have acquired a reputation as underachievers for their inability to close things out. It's a bit of an unfair tag as it feels like they're punished for consistently being one of the best teams in the NBA, but expectations come higher for a team with such a proud tradition of winning.\n\nThen there are the more gossipy storylines. All eyes will be on Irving's return to Boston after making himself public enemy number one since his departure from the team. Meanwhile, the Celtics' Kristaps Porzingis is planning to return to action in Game 1 after a lengthy injury absence, which means he'll also be facing a team that he left under less-than-ideal circumstances.\n\nWill these storylines translate into high viewership and big ratings? In the end, it will all depend on whether or not the Finals is competitive. If either the Mavericks or Celtics come out dominating early, audiences might tune out. However, if both teams play up to their capabilities, it seems likely that we're headed to six or seven games' worth of high-stakes drama.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giannis_Antetokounmpo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Giannis Antetokounmpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_A._Smith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen A.

The names are known. The excitement is all but guaranteed. Now, we just wait for the NBA Finals to tip-off between the Boston Celtics and the Dallas Mavericks. Can the Celtics duo of Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown get over the hump to bring home the 18th NBA title for Boston or will Luke Doncic and Kyrie Irving prove the Western Conference is supreme like everyone thought?\n\nOutside of the big four names, Boston and Dallas are both loaded with talent. Despite being the fifth seed in the rugged West, the Mavericks won as many games as the second seed in the East, the New York Knicks. The Celtics have flown through the Eastern Conference playoffs with just two losses after winning the East by a whopping 14 games in the regular season.\n\nIn every way, including analytics, Boston was expected to be here chasing the Larry O'Brien Trophy. Dallas, on the other hand, was a surprise to many including the data. The Mavericks overcame the Minnesota Timberwolves in the Western Conference Finals despite being significantly worse on the defensive side of the ball.\n\nAt least in the West in 2024, offense brought home the trophy. Given the opening betting line, it is easy to think that the series will be one-sided but that was also the expectation in the series against the Timberwolves and we all know how that turned out.\n\nInjuries are likely to be the great unknown at this point especially with Krisaps Porzingis returning for the Celtics. No amount of data can predict what player might go down or how quickly they will recover in between games.\n\nDespite that, we hope to predict which team will be raising the trophy at the end of the NBA Finals by using analytics. In the NFL playoffs, we have used DVOA to predict each round over the last two seasons. Unlike the NFL, the NBA is full of different advanced data that helps put the game into perspective. Data points like Player Efficiency Rating, LEBRON, Win Shares per 48 minutes, Win Probability Added, Real Plus-Minus, RAPTOR and others try to help put the game into context.\n\nFor our predictions, we will be using advanced net rating (aNet) which takes into account a wide variety of data points, including adjusting for schedule, to boil down a team to simple numbers to help us predict the outcome of the conference finals.\n\nLike any analytical model, aNet is not considered predictive of what will happen. Instead, it provides a data point of what has happened to help rate teams.\n\nBut even while aNet may not be considered predictive, it does provide us with quality data points as a guide for the upcoming conference finals.\n\nNBA Finals Prediction\n\nOverall aNet: Boston 1st vs Dallas 14th\n\nOffensive aNet: Boston 1st vs Dallas 7th\n\nDefensive aNet: Boston 2nd vs Dallas 18th\n\nEdge: Celtics - As it was in the conference finals, Boston is the clear favorite via analytics over the Mavericks. This matches the current odds as well. With a week to get healthy, Doncic and Irving will look to overcome the odds with their ability to control things on the offensive end of the court. Dallas was able to rank seventh on that side of the ball in the regular season despite Irving missing 24 games and Doncic being out 12.\n\nHow Porzingis is able to return after not playing for over a month will be closely monitored after the Celtics were able to run roughshod without him. Boston seems to lack a weakness but they have the ability to beat themselves despite being one of the best teams in NBA history statistically, according to the numbers.\n\nThose numbers lead to the huge advantage in aNet for the Celtics as well.\n\nProfessional sports are complicated. That is what makes them so fun. The nuance of the NBA, along with its high-flying nature, provides a level of excitement and feats of athleticism rarely seen in the common person. But boiling that game down to a simple number, as we have done above, is an attempt to help understand the game better and, perhaps, win a little money as well.", "source": {"uri": "sbnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SB Nation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_O'Brien_Championship_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_professional_sports_leagues_in_the_United_States_and_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Gaming", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Gaming", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-AsMSh9vX71WM4aCksBXc3apjfM=/0x655:5012x3161/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25479629/2155465353.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

He now has a chance to win a Finals MVP -- which he'd probably appreciate more.\n\nTim Cowlishaw, Dallas Morning News: I don't know how Luka Doncic isn't the biggest story line in everything he does. He already has set regular-season statistical standards, and he has been dominant in the playoffs. In the conference finals, he badly outplayed Minnesota's Anthony Edwards, and few players have enjoyed hitting big shots or winning on the road stage quite like Luka.\n\nWell, a Finals in the Garden against the team with 17 championship banners is about as large as it's going to get. The accolades keep pouring in from national TV analysts, coaches, players. This series isn't quite Luka vs. the Celtics, but it's close to that, and he loves it. The extra days off in the Finals will allow Jason Kidd to play Luka close to 48 minutes a night.\n\nShawn McFarland, Dallas Morning News: The impact a title could have on each team's star(s). Just consider the company of 1A players who have led teams to recent titles that either Doncic or Jayson Tatum could join: Nikola Jokic, Steph Curry, Giannis Antetokounmpo, LeBron James, and Kawhi Leonard.\n\nA Dallas win would cement Doncic and Dirk Nowitzki as the only two superstars to lead the Mavericks to a championship. An 18th banner for Boston would officially ensure that the Tatum-Jaylen Brown era is successful beyond deep-yet-ringless playoff runs, and it'd squash any leftover narrative that the two can't coexist. The NBA is a star-driven league, and this series has massive ramifications for those on both sides.\n\nKevin Sherrington, Dallas Morning News: Kristaps Porzingis's return to Dallas will undoubtedly become a subtext, especially after Chandler Parsons's contention that Doncic didn't like playing next to him and that there's a \"beef\" there. Luka says there's nothing there.\n\nUnless KP goes off against the Mavs, the dominant story line will be whether Luka carries the Mavs to a title. Boston has a better team, or at least more star-caliber players, but, all apologies to Tatum, none so bright as Luka. If he doesn't play at a superstar level in the Finals, it won't be because he shrank from the spotlight. He might be the most unflappable player in the league, if not all sports.\n\nBrad Townsend, Dallas Morning News: It's Porzingis because there are so many layers to his expected return to the court. How rusty will he be? How quickly will he and his teammates reacclimate to one another? There's no worse time than the NBA Finals for Porzingis and the Celtics to confront these unknowns and have, in effect, a breaking-in period.\n\nLet's say the transition goes smoothly and the Celtics win the first two games in Boston, then Porzingis faces the hurdle of playing his first game in Dallas since the Mavericks traded him to Washington in February 2022.\n\nChad Finn, Boston Globe: I think the most overlooked story line in all of the analysis about this series is how the Mavericks intend to defend the Celtics. Dallas's defense has been terrific pretty much since the trade deadline, but it has also been lucky (catching an Oklahoma City team that went frigid from 3). Doncic and Irving are average defenders at best, and the Celtics are going to expose weaknesses that have been hidden so far.\n\nAdam Himmelsbach, Boston Globe: This is an obvious one, but it's the health of Celtics center Kristaps Porzingis, who is expected to return for Game 1 after being sidelined since suffering a calf sprain against the Heat on April 28.\n\nWhen Porzingis was asked Tuesday whether he is running without pain, he had a long, long pause before finally answering yes. Maybe this was just a smokescreen, or maybe there is something there. The Celtics will welcome 3-point shooting to space the floor, along with his rim protection against the Mavericks' array of high-flying finishers.\n\nGary Washburn, Boston Globe: How the Celtics defend Luka Doncic and approach one of the league's most talented and ball-dominant players. Do they allow Doncic to score but try to shut down his options for distributing the ball? Doncic has arguably been the best player in the playoffs and the Celtics have to devise a plan to slow him down so he doesn't turn into a scorer and distributor. If Doncic takes full control of this series, hits shots, gets to the free throw line and is allowed to toss easy lobs to the Dallas big men, it could be a long series for the Celtics.\n\nCurtis: P.J. Washington is going to be the X-factor for the Mavericks. He's shown throughout the postseason that he's capable of stepping up as that third scoring option behind Doncic and Irving. He'll receive plenty of looks from the 3-point line, especially from the corner. It's up to him to knock them down. His defense on Tatum and Brown could be even more valuable to Dallas and might prove the difference in the series if he can make it difficult for either Celtics star.\n\nCowlishaw: This will be an enormous series for Derrick Jones Jr. The Mavericks didn't know they were getting a full-time starter when they signed him away from Chicago. But the former dunk champion has been a top-level defender and will undoubtedly guard Tatum plenty.\n\nTatum is a streaky shooter, and when he's at his best, Boston probably has too many weapons for the Mavs to contend with. But if Jones does his usual job of making Tatum work, that puts added pressure on Brown and Derrick White and others to carry the load.\n\nMcFarland: P.J. Washington. He averaged 12.2 points and 6.4 rebounds in the Western Conference finals and cracked double digits in each game, and he's grown into the third option behind Doncic and Irving. We've seen him change the momentum, flow, and outcome of individual playoff games, and assuming the Celtics -- with a top-ranked defense led by Jrue Holiday, White, Brown & Co. -- throw the kitchen sink at Dallas's superstar backcourt, Washington's impact on offense and defense is necessary. He and Jones could see a lot of time on Tatum (6-8) and Brown (6-6), and his perimeter shooting can help stretch the floor versus a defense without many holes.\n\nSherrington: Dereck Lively II was the Mavs' unsung hero of the last two rounds because of his ability to limit teams' offense in the paint. But how much difference can he make against the Celtics, especially if Porzingis reclaims the minutes Al Horford picked up in his absence?\n\nWashington and Jones will have their hands full guarding Tatum and Brown, meaning they may not have a lot left for offense. Goes without saying that Doncic and Irving need to outdo Tatum and Brown, so how's this for a wild card: Jaden Hardy. He's got a shooter's conscience, meaning none at all. If he can provide a consistent offensive spark, the Mavs can score with Boston.\n\nTownsend: Washington. At this point, the Mavericks know the baseline of what they can expect from key non-Doncic/Irving players such as Washington, Jones, Josh Green, Maxi Kleber, and even Lively. And they know they'll get stellar defense from Washington. But what will he give Dallas offensively? The Celtics have so many offensive weapons that it's imperative for the Mavericks to counter with a reliable No. 3 scorer.\n\nDallas doesn't necessarily need the 17.7-point, 8.3-rebound Washington we saw against Oklahoma City in the second round, though that Washington obviously would be welcomed. But in this series the Mavericks need more scoring from Washington than his 10.8-point average in the first round and 12.2-point average against Minnesota in the WCF.\n\nFinn: Honestly, it's just a matter of the Celtics' best players playing up to their ability. The Celtics have a remarkably well-rounded team, and Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown have never trusted their colleagues more. The Celtics could be in trouble if Tatum or Brown underperforms or tries to do too much, but I don't anticipate that. I will say this: I think Jrue Holiday will be the one to make the play or plays that clinch this series.\n\nHimmelsbach: The beauty of this Celtics team is that they are so talented at the top that they are generally able to withstand at least one poor performance by any player. So they don't necessarily need one specific player to step up. But keep an eye on Sam Hauser, who was one of the best 3-point shooters in the NBA during the regular season but has largely disappeared during these playoffs.\n\nWashburn: This needs to be a Jayson Tatum series, and that does not necessarily mean scoring. Tatum needs to rebound, be a playmaker, and play strong defense. The Mavericks don't have a player who can consistently guard him one-on-one, and he needs to take advantage of any matchup, but don't get caught up in him matching Doncic basket for basket. He must be the best all-around player in this series, prove he's top-five Tatum, and make his teammates better.\n\nCurtis: Coaching is one of the most underappreciated aspects of the playoffs. Adjustments could be the difference between a sweep, a competitive series, or ultimately a championship. Kidd has shown the ability to make several quick adjustments throughout the playoffs, whether it's a personnel change, such as giving Hardy more opportunities off the bench, or challenging a crucial late-game whistle that works in Dallas's favor.\n\nMazzulla, 35, is the youngest coach to reach the Finals since Bill Russell in 1969, but his Celtics didn't go through as much adversity in the previous three rounds as Dallas has. I'll give Kidd the edge here.\n\nCowlishaw: I don't know that there's a particular coaching edge in the series. Both have spent time being criticized in their own markets the last two years -- Mazzulla for being quiet or soft and emphasizing threes at all costs (who doesn't?), and Kidd for his team's uneven play and terrible defense a year ago when Dallas missed the play-in games.\n\nBut Kidd has been a recent assistant in the Finals (LA) and took the Mavs to the conference finals two years ago while Mazzulla has done the same the last two seasons in Boston. Kidd has been known to be reluctant to use timeouts to quiet home crowds when the opponent is making a run. That will be something to watch in Boston.\n\nMcFarland: Mazzulla. Kidd might have an experience edge in the postseason given his track record (titles as a player and assistant coach), and he's pushed the correct buttons more often than not this spring, but Mazzulla's winning percentage (.738) since becoming head coach last season is hard to overlook. His .676 postseason winning percentage trumps Kidd's .508, albeit in a smaller sample size.\n\nMazzulla has grown into his role considerably since last year's Eastern Conference finals loss to the Miami Heat, and he had to knock out Erik Spoelstra and Rick Carlisle to reach this year's Finals.\n\nSherrington: Neither Kidd nor Mazzulla has gotten the credit each deserves for getting their teams to the Finals. Just because both have stars doesn't mean it's easy. Mazzulla will feel more pressure because of the weight of Celtics history and their standing this season as the league's best team, at least by record.\n\nKidd knows what it takes to win a title because he's done it as a player and as an assistant. He conceded this week that it's \"a lot harder\" as a coach than as a player, but he's rounding into the job.\n\nBoston is great, but the Mavs have come a long way since the trade deadline. Kidd deserves a lot of the credit for that, and the nod here.\n\nTownsend: Kidd. He's been a head coach, off and on, since 2014. He's been on the NBA Finals stage three times as a player and once as a Lakers assistant in 2020, albeit in the Disney World bubble.\n\nSure, Mazzulla was an assistant when the Celtics lost to Golden State in the '22 Finals. But he's 35 and in his second season as head coach. Losing to No. 8 seed Miami in last season's Eastern Conference finals was deemed a failure and had media and fans wondering whether Mazzulla was suited for the job.\n\nBoston's 64-win regular season and 12-2 run through the playoffs has more than proved Mazzulla's head coaching ability, but the pressure to win this championship, which would be Boston's first since 2008, is immense.\n\nThis coaching matchup reminds me a lot of the 2011 Finals, when veteran Carlisle and his staff clearly made better chess moves than 40-year-old Spoelstra and his staff. That was Spoelstra's third season as head coach and first Finals.\n\nCertainly Spoelstra, with titles the next two seasons, has proved he's one of the best coaches of this generation, but back in '11? Carlisle was the better Finals coach.\n\nFinn: Kidd has never been considered a great tactician, with the Mavs or in previous stops, but he has gotten the most out of this team. Mazzulla made huge progress in his second season -- thank goodness he finally uses his timeouts -- and strategically, he might actually be a little better than Kidd, especially with Sam Cassell and Charles Lee at his side.\n\nHimmelsbach: Jason Kidd has played in the NBA Finals, and Mazzulla never even played in the NBA. But that doesn't really matter now. I'm not sure that either has an edge, really. Both have pushed all the right buttons during these playoffs. Over the course of the season, the Celtics became increasingly comfortable with Mazzulla's philosophy and general approach, and it showed.\n\nWashburn: This is dead even. While Kidd has the experience, the Mavericks struggled at times this season and he has been heavily criticized. Mazzulla won the coaching matchup in the Indiana series against Rick Carlisle and the Celtics were able to win close games.\n\nMazzulla has to devise a way to limit Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving. Kidd has galvanized what was a flawed roster after trades to get Daniel Gafford and P.J. Washington to turn the Mavericks into a better defensive club, but Mazzulla outcoached Kidd in both matchups during the regular season. He has a chance to win the rematch.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Can Boston, who had the No. 1 net rating in the regular season - and so far in the playoffs - show why it's the favorite on Thursday?\n\nHere's our full betting preview with the latest odds, key players to watch and a best bet for Game 1:\n\nLuka Doncic: The 2023-24 regular season MVP finalist leads the playoffs in total points, rebounds, assists, steals and 3-pointers made, recording six triple-doubles in 17 games. Luka really came on in the Western Conference Finals, scoring 32 or more points in all four of Dallas' wins, and he is going to be the main focus for Boston's defense in Game 1.\n\nJayson Tatum: Jayson Tatum has not shot the ball well in the postseason - 44.2 percent from the field, 29.0 percent from 3 - but he's made an impact elsewhere averaging over 10 rebounds and five assists per game. Tatum didn't play his best in his first NBA Finals appearance in 2022, but the Celtics star has a better team around him - and that experience to lean on - in this series.\n\nBoston deserves a little more respect for its run to the Finals, even if it faced a few banged-up teams along the way.\n\nThe C's needed just 14 games to get through the East, winning in blowouts against Miami and Cleveland as well as taking three games against the Indiana Pacers where the Pacers had a 90 percent win probability or higher in the fourth quarter of three of the four games.\n\nAn interesting trend for Game 1 of the NBA Finals surfaced this week, showing that since 2005, the favorite is 16-3 ATS in Game 1.\n\nI think that bodes well for a Boston team that covered in two of its three Game 1s so far this postseason and was 37-4 straight up at home in the regular season. The C's also posted a 26-21-2 against the spread record as home favorites this season, winning those games by an average margin of victory of 14.4 points.\n\nI have a lot of respect for the run Dallas made, but Jason Kidd's team has struggled in Game 1s since he took over, going 1-5 straight up and losing four of those five games by seven or more points.\n\nI'm worried about Dallas' role players and whether or not they'll make enough shots for key defenders like Derrick Jones Jr. and PJ Washington to stay on the floor for the majority of the game. Boston, on the other hand, is going to be even deeper with Kristaps Porzingis likely back in action.\n\nOdds refresh periodically and are subject to change.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kidd", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jason Kidd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_Jones_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derrick Jones Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Gaming", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Gaming", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_6000,h_3375,x_0,y_246/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si/01hzmgsk0kjcqd4008kq.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

Boston's most recent title came in 2008.\n\nThe Mavericks won their only NBA title in 2011 after reaching the 2006 final, losing to Miami.\n\nIrving will be the emotional heart of the series after his Boston stay and a playoff return with Brooklyn that went poorly.\n\n\"I'm better at consolidating the emotions now,\" Irving said. \"You call it animosity. We call it hate. We call it, 'It's going to be hell in Boston.'\"\n\n\"The last time in Boston (in the playoffs with Brooklyn), I don't think that was the best... everyone saw me flip off the birds and kind of lose my (cool) a little bit.\n\n\"I wasn't my best self at that time. I've been able to grow since then... I'm looking forward to it. I'll take the brunt of it, all the yells and all the remarks.\n\n- 'No stopping them' - More from this section Microsoft to invest $3.2 bn in AI in Sweden Cucumbers Are Recalled in 14 States Middle Class Americans Struggle Financially Amid High Costs\n\n\"That wasn't a great reflection of who I am and how I like to compete on a high level.\"\n\nHe's on a high now, averaging 22.8 points in the playoffs as Slovenian guard Doncic, who averaged 33 points in the regular season, averages 28.8 points, 9.6 rebounds and 8.8 assists in the playoffs.\n\nBoston counters with two of the NBA's top defensive guards in Jrue Holiday and Derrick White.\n\n\"There's really no stopping them. You just try to make it difficult for them,\" White said. \"They're going to take tough shots and they're going to make tough shots. Just trust that over 48 minutes what we're doing is going to work.\"\n\nTatum averages 26.0 points and 10.4 rebounds in the playoffs with Brown averages 25.0 points with White and Holiday providing strong support and the team leading the NBA in 3-point shots and baskets. The Celtics are 9-0 when hitting 14 or more three-pointers.\n\n\"Boston shoots the three at a high rate,\" Mavs coach Jason Kidd said. \"They have a lot of talented players. They've been here before, they have the experience. They're well-coached. This is another great test.\"\n\nDallas center Dereck Lively isn't sweating the experience factor.\n\n\"They have a lot of tradition, but that doesn't matter. What matters is who's going to go harder on the court,\" Lively said. \"It's going to be a dogfight out there, but we're going to keep swinging and see what happens.\"\n\nBoston, which defeated the Mavericks in both meetings this season, expects to have Latvian center Kristaps Porzingis back from a right calf strain suffered on April 29 in the first round against Miami that benched him for 10 games.\n\n\"He has been working extremely hard just to get back and to help us in any way he can,\" White said.\n\n\"When KP is at his best, he has been tremendous for us,\" Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla

He's a threat offensively. As we know, he shoots it, he can post, he protects the rim for us. It's just a really good thing for us to be able to have him back.\"\n\nEven though Porzingis seems to have the green light for Game 1, it remains to be seen just how healthy he is -- given the wide variance of recovery times with calf injuries.\n\n\"It's tough to say. I haven't played. I haven't played for a while,\" Porzingis said. \"Tomorrow will be my real, like, first real minutes in a while, you know? I did as much as I could to prepare for this moment, but there's nothing like game minutes and game experience that I'm going to get tomorrow.\n\n\"It will be tough to jump into the Finals like this. I did everything I could to prepare for it and we'll see tomorrow night.\"\n\nThis is not the first NBA Finals rodeo for several key cogs on the Celtics' roster. While Jrue Holiday won a ring with the Bucks in 2021, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Horford, Derrick White, and more Celtics players were on Boston's roster in 2022 when the team came up short against the Warriors in the NBA Finals.\n\nDespite the lessons learned from that 2022 run, Tatum still doesn't harp on the experience.\n\n\"I hate that I had to go through it. I wish we would have won,\" Tatum said. \"But I'm a firm believer that everything happens for a reason. There's a lesson to be learned in every situation. I do feel a lot different this time, this go-around, two years later. I'm excited for the opportunity for us to get the job done.\"\n\nIt's only been two years since the Celtics came up just short of a championship, but Brown stressed that plenty has happened since then.\n\n\"We got a different team. We got a different coach, too, as well. We had Ime Udoka; now we have Joe Mazzulla,\" Brown said. \"We had Marcus Smart, Rob Williams; we have Jrue Holiday, Kristaps Porzingis. Different team, different coach two years later makes a pretty big difference.\"\n\nWhile some players might want to burn the tape after falling in the NBA Finals, Brown stressed that he has rewatched film from that six-game series several times -- as well as other shortcomings for Boston in recent memory.\n\n\"I've watched it a few times now, maybe four or five times. As well as last year's conference finals (against the Heat),\" Brown said. \"I think you can always learn from anything really. But just being able to watch those moments and learn from them, how to manage your emotions, like, what you would have did differently potentially.\n\n\"I don't think that's bad to look at and acknowledge and be aware of. So I would say a few times at least I've watched the Finals, the whole thing, all the way through.\"\n\nJoe Mazzulla's blunt and candid comments during press conferences have often drawn attention, with the second-year head coach's emphasis on staying in the moment often leading to him not taking the bait on questions from the media.\n\nThat trend continued on Wednesday, especially when asked about the \"bright lights\" that come with playing in the NBA Finals.\n\n\"Yeah, I mean, unless they change the light bulbs in the arenas, they won't be any brighter than they were the last series,\" Mazzulla said. \"It's just sticking to the details, the things that matter, the truth.\n\n\"The truth of the matter is if you don't box out, if you don't sprint back in transition, if you don't pass the ball in a two-on-one, if you don't take away the other team's tendencies, if you don't know who you're guarding, don't recognize the spacing, if you don't talk, if you don't play hard, you're not going to win.\"\n\nAs for any talk of this Finals showdown with the Mavericks being the end to this \"journey\" that has been the 2023-24 season?\n\n\"I would say this is not the end of the journey,\" Mazzulla said. \"The journey is for however long you're alive. This is just one piece to that. Regardless of what happens you got to wake up the next day and do your job. The journey will forever be there.\n\n\"You're just ready for it. You do everything within your control to prepare for it, mentally, physically, emotionally, spiritually. Tomorrow you just get after it. The game, the environment will tell us what we need to focus on, what we need to get better on and what we need to do. The most important thing is staying even keel and staying with poise. I think that's something our team has done a good job of doing all year.\"\n\nKyrie Irving is far from the only Mavericks player expecting boos and jeers on Thursday night at TD Garden.\n\n\"It's hard to play in this place,\" Luka Doncic said Wednesday. \"The crowd is amazing for their team. All I got to say is we got to stay together. It's us against them. We got to stay together. But it's going to be really hard to play in this crowd.\"\n\nGranted, Doncic is no stranger to hostile crowds -- and dishing it back with his play on the court.\n\nThe 25-year-old guard led the league in scoring this season with 33.9 points per game, while also averaging 9.2 rebounds and 9.8 assists. He has thrived at TD Garden in his career, averaging 32.2 points in his six games on the parquet floor.\n\nBut the most hostile crowd he's ever faced was not in an NBA setting.\n\n\"It was (the) quarterfinals of EuroLeague against Panathinaikos in Panathinaikos,\" Doncic said. \"The crowd went crazy. They started winning 20-0. Imagine that.\"\n\nEven though Irving still holds court as one of the most hated figures in Boston sports history, the sentiment hasn't been shared by some of his former Celtics teammates.\n\nDespite Irving making several critical comments about Boston's young core during his final season with the team, Brown noted on Wednesday that he's happy to see Irving thriving with a new team in Dallas.\n\n\"I think it was great,\" Brown said. \"Definitely learned a lot from Kyrie while he was here. It's been great to see his journey, see where he's at, all the stuff he's going through, stuff like that, to be where he's at it's amazing, it's dope to see.\"\n\nOf course, those positive words will ring hollow once Game 1 actually begins.\n\n\"How to stop him? That's a great player over there, so it's going to be a full-team effort,\" Brown said. \"Him and Luka. Making sure we're alert, making sure we're back in transition, and do the best we can.\"\n\nIrving's history with the Celtics is a popular storyline leading into the NBA Finals. But Porzingis is also set to face off against his former team in the Mavericks.\n\nPorzingis was one of the featured players on the Mavericks from 2019-22, with his size and scoring ability making him an intriguing option to pair alongside Doncic. But their time together did not work out, with former NBA player Chandler Parsons declaring earlier this week that Doncic \"did not like playing with\" Porzingis.\n\nBoth Porzingis and Doncic didn't feed into the narrative when asked about it on Wednesday.\n\n\"It's always been good,\" Porzingis said of his relationship with Doncic. \"He's one of the best players in the league, in the world. It'll be a tough challenge for us to try to stop him. But just following his career. When he came in the league, he already made a huge impact.\n\n\"I had the opportunity to play with him for a couple years and get to know him. Just knowing what type of person he is, the type of player he is, just his mindset. He's a special, special player. We have a big challenge ahead of us competing against somebody like that.\"\n\n\"I don't know why it didn't work out,\" Doncic added. \"We were still both young. We tried to make it work, but it just didn't work. So, moved on.\"\n\nBoth Mazzulla and Brown had plenty of good things to say about Brad Stevens, who has made the successful transition from Boston's head coach to the team's president of basketball operations.\n\n\"Everybody in the organization is a leader in their own way,\" Mazzulla acknowledged. \"Everybody sets the temperature when they come in. Brad giving me my start, hiring me, empowering me from day one as an assistant, giving me some of the opportunities that he has. But also the way he carries himself.\n\n\"I've always had a lot of respect for how he went about coaching, how he kept family balance number one. How he treated people, number one. That was always more important than whether there was a success or a failure. I think he spearheads the leadership, the temperature of the building, just as everybody else does.\"\n\nAfter making the switch to the front office, Stevens has orchestrated several key trades and roster moves that have put Boston just four wins away from a title -- including three deals that brought back White, Holiday, and Porzingis.\n\n\"I think Brad has been great in his role as GM. He was a great coach,' Brown said. \"I think he just continued that by just being a great GM, being able to put the right pieces together and things like that.\n\n\"Just happy for him. His schedule has been able to settle down, probably putting a little bit less stress on him than we did when he was coaching us. But, no, Brad has been great since he's been a part of the Boston organization. He's helped bring this organization back in terms of winning. He's now been able to move into that GM position and put the right pieces together to get us back to the Finals.\"\n\nTatum was candid when asked about whether or not the 17 championship banners hanging above TD Garden present any added pressure to this current Celtics squad.\n\n\"I mean, you know the answer to that. Of course, right? We only hang NBA championship banners, right? 17 of them,\" Tatum said. \"Some of the greatest players to ever play this game wore this uniform. All of us are honored to follow in their footsteps, the way they paved for us to live out our dream.\n\n\"Essentially, yeah, if you want to be one of the greats to put on this uniform, every great before you won a championship. That's what we try to play for every single season. The expectations are obviously different here. It takes special players to be here and to be a part of an environment like that.\"\n\nThe Celtics will get their chance to earn an 18th banner starting on Thursday night.\n\n\"I would just like to add to it,\" Holiday said. \"I think to be a part of history would be cool, especially a history that the Celtics have and everything that comes with it. Again, I would say that I probably don't take a bulk of the pressure because we have Jayson and Jaylen on our team.\n\n\"But to add to that is I feel like a part of the reason why I was brought here, the part of reason why I wanted to come.\"", "source": {"uri": "boston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conor_ryan@boston.com", "name": "Conor Ryan", "type":

It helped Brown earn the NBA's first $300 million contract last summer. Tatum is expected to get one this offseason.\n\nThe team has branded the All-Stars as \"The Jays\" in a marketing campaign shown during games that pitted them against one another in mini competitions.\n\nIt has created natural comparisons between them along the way, fostering an atmosphere in which fans and sports pundits alike have tried to parse out which one of them is better, whose spot is most untouchable on the roster and which of them is more pivotal to the Celtics' success as they prepare to lead the team's attempt at an 18th NBA title.\n\nIt reached a new level last week during a segment on ESPN's \"Get Up\" in which panelists debated whether the 26-year-old Tatum expressed excitement or disappointment while watching the 27-year-old Brown garner Eastern Conference finals MVP honors.\n\n\"I think it's unfair to both of them,\" Celtics Coach Joe Mazzulla said of what he viewed as an attempt to manufacture friction between the two stars.\n\nBut even as Tatum and Brown have distinguished themselves as the most important players on Boston's roster and the keys to the Celtics' fate in their NBA Finals matchup with the Dallas Mavericks, Mazzulla has hope that people will start viewing them differently.\n\nTatum and Brown, along with Al Horford, are the only returning starters from the 2021-22 team that lost to the Golden State Warriors in six games in the Finals after holding a 2-1 series lead.\n\nWhile Horford has taken on mostly a reserve role this season, backing up Kristaps Porzingis, Tatum and Brown have taken their play up a notch.\n\nTatum's scoring numbers have remained steady from the regular season (26.9 per game) into the playoffs (26.0), while his rebounding has increased from 8.1 to 10.4 per game in the postseason. Brown, too, has seen jumps in those categories, going from 23.0 points and 5.5 rebounds per game to 25.0 points and 6.1 rebounds in the playoffs.\n\nTatum believes they've both used lessons from the 2022 NBA Finals' loss, as well as last year's conference finals loss to Miami, to grow into players more equipped to accomplish their championship goal this time around.\n\n\"Obviously, we've been there before, we came up short,\" Tatum said. \"You don't always get a second chance, so really just looking at it as a second chance and trying to simplify things as much as we can.\"\n\nMazzulla believes the reason the relationship between Brown and Tatum is so often talked about is rooted in outside disbelief that their dynamic doesn't breed any rivalry between them.\n\n\"At the end of the day, like, those two guys, their relationship is their relationship,\" Mazzulla said. \"They love each other. They push each other every single day in practice. They communicate with each other, but they go about it differently.\"\n\nBoston Celtics guard Jaylen Brown (7) is congratulated by forward Jayson Tatum (0) after a after a 3-point basket during the second half of Game 4 of an NBA basketball second-round playoff series against the Cleveland Cavaliers, Monday, May 13, 2024, in Cleveland.

Will Kristaps Porzingis's calf hold up? Is the city of Boston still that mad at Kyrie Irving? Will Al Horford spontaneously crumble in a cloud of dust now that he's 38 years old like he's been snapped away by Thanos?\n\nIt's an absolutely fascinating championship series, and it all gets rolling tonight.\n\nChad Finn: Celtics in 6. Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving will not steal the series, because the Celtics are the better team.\n\nAdam Himmelsbach: Celtics in 5. I think this is the first time I've ever picked the Celtics to win a title.\n\nChristopher L. Gasper: Celtics in 6. The Celtics' margin for error and victory is simply greater than that of the peaking Mavericks.\n\nDan Shaughnessy: Mavericks in 7. Please don't be offended. It's Jayson Tatum's time. It's Jaylen Brown's time. The Celtics have the best roster, won the most games, and are 12-2 in the playoffs. But I still don't trust them and have nightmares about Kyrie Irving winning it here.\n\nKhari Thompson: Celtics in 6. The Celtics have too much depth on both ends of the floor for Dallas to match.\n\nGary Washburn: Celtics in 6. The Celtics have a deeper team, have had more than a week to prepare, and appear ready for this moment. There are no excuses.\n\nMike Curtis: Mavericks in 6. I don't foresee many blowouts, and I think almost every game will go the distance.\n\nTim Cowlishaw: Mavericks in 5. Boston has been just as good as Dallas (maybe better) at closing out games, but I'll still take Doncic with the ball in his hands for the final shot over Tatum, Brown, and the rest. Sometimes teams just get on a roll, and Dallas is on one.\n\nShawn McFarland: Celtics in 7. Don't be surprised if Dallas takes one of the first two road games, though, to create a pivotal stretch at American Airlines Center.\n\nKevin Sherrington: Mavericks in 7. I don't think the Mavericks will beat the Celtics, but I'm tired of being wrong.\n\nBrad Townsend: Mavericks in 6. Boston was the best team over the course of the season, but Dallas has been the best team of the past 2\u00bd months.\n\nYou want Boston? You got Boston.That's the message the Celtics are sending tonight with their in-arena giveaway shirts. And better yet: The order of the shirts will spell out some cool messages in the stands \ud83d\udc40\n\nOther highlights from tonight's festivities at the Garden:\n\n\ud83c\udfc0 Canal Street will be open to pedestrians starting around noonish. The Celtics will have their entertainment teams and a DJ spinning outside the Garden before the game.\n\n\ud83c\udfc0 The Celtics are wearing their white association jerseys. They're 3-1 in those duds.\n\n\ud83c\udfc0 For halftime ... folks, we're in for a treat. Red Panda is in the house. A living legend.\n\n\ud83c\udfc0 Don't have tickets?

Email us at gardenparty@globe.com \ud83c\udf89\n\nOne reason I hope the Lakers don't hire JJ Redick -- we'd probably lose his \"Mind the Game\" podcast with LeBron James, which has been full of fascinating conversations on the inner workings of basketball.\n\nIn this week's episode, James and Redick discussed how to defend Luka Doncic in the pick-and-roll, the biggest challenge the Celtics face in the NBA Finals -- few teams use the action more than Dallas, and even fewer players are more deadly in the pick-and-roll than Doncic.\n\nRedick asked James which of the main defensive options against the pick-and-roll -- blitzing, switching, and playing drop coverage -- was most effective. James correctly identified blitzing as the best option, and switching as the worst (as the Timberwolves found out the hard way in the Western Conference finals).\n\nWhen opponents blitz Doncic on the pick-and-roll, sending a hard double-team at him, the Mavericks posted 0.97 points per possession this season (as a frame of reference, the most effective Celtic as a pick-and-roll ballhandler this season was Jayson Tatum, at 0.95 points per possession). That number has dipped to 0.67 when teams blitz Doncic in the playoffs.\n\nWhen opponents play drop coverage, having whoever isn't guarding the ballhander (often a big man) drop into the paint to stop the roll, that number is around 1.10. And when teams switch the pick-and-roll, Doncic and the Mavericks put up 1.15 points per possession.\n\nThis leads to quite the conundrum for Joe Mazzulla. The most effective defense against a Doncic pick-and-roll is a blitz, which the Celtics rarely do. The least effective is a switch, which is Boston's preferred defense, as we saw with Al Horford having to defend Darius Garland and Andrew Nembhard out on the perimeter early in the playoffs.\n\nWill the Celtics stray away from their identity? That can be a dangerous thing to do; but leaving Horford or Kristaps Porzingis on an island with Doncic in this series could be lethal.\n\nGasper: Brad Stevens doesn't seek credit, but he's a big reason the Celtics are here\n\nLast offseason, there were no promises or proclamations of improvement from the Celtics, no mantras like \"full throttle,\" \"ready to burn some cash,\" or the latest Boston sports Pledge of Improvement via Bruins general manager Don Sweeney: \"We're going to be aggressive to be able to complement what we currently have.\" No, the Celtics are in the NBA Finals, four wins away from Banner No. 18, largely because last offseason Brad Stevens and his front office acted with a boldness our other local teams only offer as PR palaver.\n\n'Bro, where does that accent come from?': Talking all things Boston in Dallas ahead of the NBA Finals.\n\nAsking Texans what they think of Boston can be a humbling experience for native New Englander Danny McDonald.\n\nThe self-proclaimed hub of the universe, the Athens of America, is reduced to a ubiquitous coffee chain, cans of baked beans, an FBI snitch, assorted Afflecks, and a retired quarterback who grew up in Northern California. Worse yet are the shrugs, the blank space that Boston evokes for some.\n\n\"Bro, where does that accent come from?\" asked Will Cody, a 38-year-old bartender at the Press Box Grill in downtown Dallas. \"I've never been there, I really don't know anything about Boston.\"\n\nOn the cusp of the NBA Finals, which will pit the Dallas Mavericks against the Boston Celtics starting Thursday, the indignities don't end there.\n\nDoris Burke has come a long way from her days at Providence. Now, she's on the cusp of history.\n\nA standout basketball player at Providence College who still calls Rhode Island home, the Hall-of-Fame broadcaster never lost her point guard's eye for details, writes Aidan Ryan. People close to Burke say that shows up in the trust she builds with coaches and players, and her ability to communicate even the smallest details to millions of viewers.", "source": {"uri":

Porzingis' return to form is crucial for Boston; adds value with defense and spacing. Bench production is key for the Celtics, esp. Hauser, Kornet, Brissett, and Tillman. GIVEMESPORT VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\nThe 2024 NBA Finals is about to get underway when the Boston Celtics host the Dallas Mavericks to begin Game 1 of the highly anticipated matchup.\n\nThis is especially a big challenge for the Celtics, seeking their 18th championship in franchise history and their first since 2008.\n\nBoston went 64-18 in the regular season, showcasing themselves as one of the best offensive and defensive teams in the league. They kept that up in the playoffs, going 12-2 against Miami, Cleveland, and Indiana en route to their second NBA Finals appearance in the last three seasons.\n\nWith Dallas posing a huge threat, particularly with the dynamic scoring duo of Luka Don\u010di\u0107 and Kyrie Irving, the Celtics must do everything they can to achieve their goal of bringing the Larry O'Brien trophy back to Beantown.\n\nHere are five things they must do to take down the Mavericks in this series:\n\n1 Tatum Must Perform Big In His Second NBA Finals Tatum struggled in his Finals debut in 2022\n\nWhen the Celtics lost the 2022 Finals against Golden State, a lot of criticism went Jayson Tatum's way due to his shooting and scoring struggles inside the arc.\n\nIn that series, he averaged 21.5 points, seven assists, and 6.8 rebounds. He was all-around with his impact as he shot an amazing 45.5 percent from beyond the arc, but he was 36.7 percent from the field overall. When three-pointers are removed, he was 31.6 percent.\n\nIt was concerning because his scoring went down after each series that year. He went from averaging 29.5 points against Brooklyn to 21.5 against the Warriors, an eight-point decrease for a player known for being able to score the ball at will.\n\nThis postseason has seen a different version of Tatum. While maintaining his willingness to keep his teammates involved, his production has gone up following each series. He went from putting up 21.8 points against Miami in the first round to a whopping 30.3 points against Indiana in the Eastern Conference Finals, a big increase of 8.5 points.\n\nBoston will need all the scoring they can get from their franchise star to win this series, and with the way he has been playing as the playoffs go on, they might do just that.\n\n2 Have Porzingis Return To Form KP missed much of the postseason with injury\n\nBoston breezed through the East despite being without one of their key players in Kristaps Porzingis, who left during Game 4 of the first round against Miami due to a calf injury.\n\nThe good news for the Celtics is that Porzingis will be back on the court to begin the NBA Finals against Dallas.\n\nHaving him return provides Boston with a lot of advantages. He allows them to space out the floor with his efficient ability to make three-pointers, not to mention that he can be a lob threat when needed.\n\nHis defense is also valuable, with his shot-blocking and rim protection being a potential factor in preventing Dallas' offense from flourishing. It will also help keep his teammate Al Horford fresh, who had to play more minutes due to his absence.\n\nBefore he went to the sidelines, Porzingis was averaging 12.3 points, five rebounds, 1.8 assists, 1.5 blocks, and 1.3 steals on 38.9 percent shooting from the field and 40 percent from downtown.\n\nA small sample size to take into account since it only involves the first round, but Boston will need Porzingis to come through with big plays when they are in need of a mismatch to keep Dallas' defense on their heels.\n\n3 Bench Must Produce Assistance from Horford, Pritchard, and Hauser will be needed\n\nThe starting rotation of Jrue Holiday, Derrick White, Jaylen Brown, Tatum, and Porzingis will certainly have a heavy workload of minutes to start out the series against Dallas. Once it progresses, however, the Celtics will look to their bench for potential sparks.\n\nThe significant performers have been mainly Horford and Payton Pritchard, the former who stepped up in Porzingis' absence and the latter for being active with his production via three-point shooting and aggressiveness in getting to the basket.\n\nBoston needs Sam Hauser to bounce back from his shooting woes. Making 38.6 percent of his shots from the field and 33.3 percent of his attempts from three this postseason, he is coming off a brutal offensive showing in the East Finals, where he went 2-of-16 overall and 1-of-14 from downtown. Having him return to sharpshooting form will do wonders for the team's bench.\n\nIt would also be beneficial to keep an eye on Luke Kornet, Oshae Brissett, and Xavier Tillman throughout the series. They have shown, at the very least, that they can provide energy on both sides of the court, resulting in huge runs that prove difficult for opponents to come back from. Production from them would be the cherry on top of what is already a potent offense from the Celtics.\n\n4 Knock Down Three-Pointers Consistently The team averages 14.6 triples per game in the playoffs\n\nThree-point shooting has been the Celtics' signature for the past two seasons under head coach Joe Mazzulla. This playoff run has seen it be taken to a new level.\n\nBoston is making 14.6 of their 39.8 attempts from beyond the arc. While it may not be the 16.5 three-pointers they knocked down per game during the regular season, they still remain a deadly threat from deep as Dallas might have a hard time cooling them off.\n\nWhite and Tatum have the most attempts on the team, making their triples at a 35.3 percent clip. Brown, Holiday, Porzingis, Horford, and Pritchard follow suit as their ability to convert triples down the stretch will be crucial to them securing wins throughout the series.\n\n5 Slow Down Luka and Kyrie The duo scores 51.6 points per game this postseason\n\nThe biggest defensive challenge for Boston will be figuring out how to keep Luka Don\u010di\u0107 and Kyrie Irving in check.\n\nThe star duo has done a tremendous job in getting Dallas back to the NBA Finals for the first time since their title run in 2011.\n\nDon\u010di\u0107 has been on a scorching tear throughout this playoff run, averaging 28.8 points, 9.6 rebounds, 8.8 assists, and a 1.6 steals as a triple-double threat. Leading the team in shot attempts with 22.3 per game, getting the ball out of his hands should be one of Boston's top priorities on defense.\n\nAs for Irving, he is putting up 22.8 points, 5.2 assists, 3.9 rebounds, and 1.2 steals as an excellent second option behind Don\u010di\u0107. Facing his former team in the NBA Finals, it will be interesting to see how Boston limits his impact while making sure Don\u010di\u0107 is not getting to his spots with ease. Holiday, White, Brown, and Tatum will have their hands full whenever they switch onto these two stars.\n\nForcing PJ Washington, Derrick Jones Jr., Josh Green, Maxi Kleber, Daniel Gafford, and Dereck Lively to shoot the ball instead of Don\u010di\u0107 and Irving could be key to the Celtics' defensive game plan. How it will play out once the ball is tipped off to begin the series remains to be seen, but it will be interesting nonetheless.\n\nRelated Top 5 NBA Finals Debut Performances All-Time Many NBA

Mandatory Credit: David Butler II-USA TODAY Sports\n\nAfter an improbable run to the Western Conference title as the #5 seed, the Dallas Mavericks (62-37, 32-18 away, 58-41 ATS) face the Eastern Conference #1 seed Boston Celtics (76-20, 43-6 home, 49-43- 4 ATS) in the 2024 NBA Finals starting with Game 1 on Thursday, June 6, at 8:40 pm ET.\n\nThe Mavericks vs Celtics odds heavily favor Boston holding serve at home in Game 1.\n\nDallas Mavericks vs Boston Celtics Odds\n\nThe Celtics are currently 6.5-point favorites for Game 1 and -230 on the moneyline. The Mavs come back at +190 to win while the game total is sitting at 214.5.\n\nDallas is 9-8 over/under in the postseason and has hit the over in five of its past six games. Boston is 8-6 O/U in the postseason and has also gone over in five of its last six.\n\nOdds as of June 5 at DraftKings. Claim a bonus through the best NBA betting apps for the 2024 finals.\n\nThe Mavericks won three straight series without home-court advantage en route to the Western Conference championship, downing the #4 LA Clippers in six games, the #1 OKC Thunder in six as well, and the #3 Minnesota Timberwolves in five. Dallas is 11-6 against the spread in the playoffs to date.\n\nBoston hardly broke a sweat on its path to the NBA finals. After dusting aside the #8 Miami Heat and #4 Cleveland Cavaliers in five games each, the Celtics swept the #6 Indiana Pacers in the East finals, benefitting from an injury to Indiana's All-Star point guard Tyrese Haliburton.\n\nDallas vs Boston Game 1 Injury Reports\n\nAfter a ten-day hiatus, the Boston Celtics enter the 2024 NBA Finals fully healthy. Center Kristaps Porzingis missed the last ten games with a calf injury but the 7'1 center is no longer on the injury report ahead of Game 1 against the Mavericks.\n\nOn the Dallas side, Luka Doncic (knee/ankle) remains on the injury report, listed as probable. But take that with a grain of salt. Doncic has been listed as\"probable\" for the majority of the Mavs playoff games. He hasn't missed any time and has averaged 28.8 PPG, 9.6 RPG, and 8.8 APG in 41.5 minutes per night (all team-highs).\n\nMaxi Kleber (4.4 PPG, 3.3 APG, 34.8 3P%) missed the entirety of Dallas' six-game victory over OKC in the second round and the first three games against Minnesota in the West finals, but he returned in Games 4 and 5, scoring five points in 21 minutes over the pair of games. He's no longer on the Dallas injury report heading into the Boston series.\n\nAfter averaging 32.4 PPG in the five-game series win over the T-wolves, Luka Doncic is listed with a game-high point total of 31.5 on Thursday. Tatum has the highest total for the Celtics, per usual, at 26.5.\n\nMavericks vs Celtics Predictions for Game 1\n\nBoston wasn't seriously pushed in any of its first three series but it's sweep of the Pacers was arguably the least convincing sweep in NBA history. Three of the four games were decided by five points or fewer, and the Pacers led in the fourth quarter in three of the four (including nine-point fourth-quarter leads in both Games 3 and 4). If Haliburton had been healthy, the Eastern Conference Finals might have played out very differently.\n\nThere's no denying that the analytics - regular season and postseason - say Boston is the better team. They had an NBA-best in Net Rating of +11.7 in the regular season and once again lead in that category in the playoffs at +10.8. But the Mavericks have made huge strides in the postseason and, with Doncic rested and ready, I expect Dallas to push the Celtics every bit as hard - make that harder - than the Pacers did. And Dallas is considerably better at closing out games than Indiana.", "source": {"uri": "sportsbettingdime.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Betting Dime"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The 'over' is the smart choice for the 214.5 points total. Luka Don\u010di\u0107 is predicted to score over 31.5 points.\n\nThe 2023-24 NBA playoff action continues as we move on to the NBA Finals, where the Boston Celtics will face the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nHere is a look at which squad has the edge in this matchup and why.\n\nCeltics vs. Mavericks Game 1 Info\n\nWhen\n\nThurs. June 6\n\nWhere\n\nTD Garden\n\nTime\n\n8:30 PM EST\n\nLocation\n\nBoston, MA\n\nTV\n\nABC\n\nCeltics vs. Mavericks - How We Got Here & Betting Trends Boston is the favorite heading into Game 1\n\nThe Boston Celtics are just two years removed from their last Finals appearance. In 2022, they fell to the Golden State Warriors in six games. Last season, they were just one win away from consecutive appearances despite falling behind 0-3 to the Miami Heat in the conference finals.\n\nThis season, Boston was one of the prohibitive favorites to come out of the Eastern Conference, and they certainly lived up to those lofty expectations. They finished the season with the league's best record at 64-18. Despite dropping a pair of Game 2s in the first two rounds of the postseason, the Celtics have produced 12 wins in their 14 postseason games, including a 4-0 sweep over the Indiana Pacers in the previous round.\n\nLooking back at the team's previous Finals appearance, Boston forward Jayson Tatum offered this perspective:\n\n\"It was a lesson to be learned. I told myself that if I ever got the opportunity again to make it to the Finals, that (I'd) never take it for granted. Obviously, we're here now and thankful to be here. I'm excited to get ready to play and have fun.\" - Jayson Tatum\n\nOn the other side of the equation, the Dallas Mavericks have also had an impressive postseason run. In the first round of the playoffs, they defeated the L.A. Clippers in six games -- the first time they had managed to get by the Clippers in three tries. Next, their opponent was the top-seeded Oklahoma City Thunder. The teams split the first four contests before Dallas closed out the series in six games.\n\nThe conference finals matchup would pit the Mavericks against the third-seeded Minnesota Timberwolves - a team that had not been this far in the playoffs since 2004, and their inexperience was evident. The Mavericks took the first three games of the series before Minnesota finally broke through with a win in Game 4. However, the Mavericks left little doubt that they were the better team, as they closed out the series with an emphatic 124-103 victory in Game 5.\n\nThe Mavericks' last trip to the Finals occurred in 2011. Ironically, head coach Jason Kidd was the starting point guard for that squad, which defeated the Miami Heat in six games to claim the franchise's only NBA championship.\n\nKidd helped guide the Mavericks to an upset as a player. Can he pull off the feat once again from the sidelines?\n\nNow that we have set the stage for this matchup, let's examine the betting trends for both sides.\n\nCeltics vs. Mavericks Picks GIVEMESPORT presents our picks with analysis Spread\n\nOn the heels of going 12-2 through their first 14 playoff games, the Celtics come into this matchup as a 6.5-point favorite (per Lineups.com). Here is a look at how both ball clubs have fared against the spread this season.\n\nThe Mavericks have covered the spread four times in their last five outings. Dallas is 1-5 ATS in its last six matchups against Boston. The Mavericks are 5-0 ATS in their last five road games. In their last seven matchups against Eastern Conference opponents, Dallas is 6-1 against the spread. The Celtics have failed to cover the spread five times in their last six games. Boston is 4-1 ATS in its last five games against teams in the Southwest Division. In their last six Thursday night games, the Celtics are 2-4 against the spread. Prediction: Boston Celtics (-6.5) Over/Under\n\nThe projected over/under total for this matchup opened at 214.5 points (per BleacherNation.com). Here is why going with the \"over\" is the smart choice.\n\nThe OVER total holds a 5-1 record in the Mavericks' last six contests. In Dallas's last five games as the underdog, the OVER total is 4-1. The OVER total has emerged victorious five times in the Celtics' last six games. In Boston's last seven home games, the OVER total cashed in six times. Boston and Dallas have averaged a combined 238.5 points per game, which is 24 points more than the 214.5 over/under. Prediction: OVER 214.5 points Player Prop Bets\n\nLuka Don\u010di\u0107 leads the team in multiple categories, including scoring, rebounding, assists, and steals. It is also worth noting that he is putting up solid numbers despite playing with an assortment of injuries. With that in mind, he is the key player to watch for the road team. Doncic currently has -110 odds of scoring more than 31.5 points and -110 odds of finishing with less than 31.5 points (via DraftKings).\n\nDo Doncic's numbers favorably compare to the estimated points total for this matchup? Let's look at the tale of the tape to find out.\n\nDoncic is averaging 32.9 points per contest across 87 regular season and playoff games. In two games against the Mavericks this season, he has averaged 35.0 points per contest. During the postseason, Doncic is averaging 28.8 points per outing. Doncic has suited up against Eastern Conference teams 28 times this season. In those contests, he is averaging 34.9 points per outing. In nine matchups against teams in the Atlantic Division, the Mavericks guard is averaging 34.6 points per game. Over his last 10 outings, Doncic has averaged 29.1 points, 10.5 rebounds, and 8.4 assists per contest, exceeding the points total for this matchup four times during that stretch.\n\nPrediction: Luka Don\u010di\u0107 OVER 31.5 points\n\nOn the other hand, Jayson Tatum is one of the key players to watch for the home team. He currently has -131 odds of scoring more than 26.5 points and -104 odds of finishing with less than 26.5 points (via Caesars Sportsbook).\n\nHere is a look at how his numbers stack up against the projected points total for this matchup.\n\nTatum is averaging 26.7 points per contest during the regular season and playoffs. In two matchups against Dallas this season, he has averaged 35.5 points per contest. During the postseason, Tatum is averaging 26.0 points per outing. Tatum has played against Western Conference opponents 28 times this season (including the playoffs). In those contests, he is averaging 26.6 points per outing. In 23 matchups against teams in the Southwest Division, the Celtics forward is averaging 27.0 points per game. Over his last 10 outings, Tatum has averaged 27.1 points, 10.5 rebounds, and 5.9 assists per contest, exceeding the points total for this matchup four times during that stretch.\n\nPrediction: Jayson

The roster is new and improved, has experience from top to bottom, and hasn't tripped amid a favorable postseason path no matter what's been thrown at the Celtics up to this point.\n\nHere are four predictions before the Celtics and Mavericks meet for Game 1:\n\n1. Jayson Tatum's breakout series arrives at perfect time for Boston\n\nThe naysayers have had a field day watching Tatum's postseason struggles, but under the brightest lights, more than due, the 26-year-old will deliver.\n\nEntering Tatum's second-career trip to the Finals, and after coming up short of an MVP honor in the conference finals, the five-time All-Star is averaging 26 points while shooting 29% from 3-point range. Taking advantage of the double-team coverages thrown his way, Tatum played facilitator, but it didn't help Boston when it encountered its few dicey moments this postseason.\n\nBy this point, Tatum understands the only way to silence the outside doubters will be to unleash a night similar to his Game 7 versus the 76ers in last season's semifinal round. He might not outperform everyone else throughout the series from start to finish, however, being the most effective player will push him toward a Finals MVP candidacy.\n\n2. Boston won't restrain Luke Donic and it won't matter\n\nOne of the (many) leading questions following the Celtics in the Finals is how they'll guard Doncic, who's averaged 28.8 points this postseason.\n\nDoncic's emergence has been a sight to behold. With limited athleticism, the prodigal son of Dallas has the IQ, skill, and shooting ability that's thrown Doncic into (very) premature Hall of Fame discussion without having won a title -- and it's completely warranted too.\n\nSo... where does that leave Boston?\n\nWell, the Celtics don't need to shut down Donic to win the Finals and outplay the Mavericks. It's already hard, and sometimes impossible enough, but the talent gap between Boston and Dallas -- especially if Kristaps Porzingis returns -- should put the Celtics well above Doncic. The danger zone comes in tight late-game situations where, as we know, Doncic relishes in taking the final shot -- likely a step-back three -- in the dire moments.\n\nGive the Mavericks an offensive output like the Celtics did on March 1 (138 points) and Boston should be just fine.\n\n3. Joe Mazzulla's learning lessons won't be preached, they'll be applied\n\nOne of the several constants of a Mazzulla-coached team is the bright side approach to the inexcusable.\n\nLearning lessons is what the second-year head coach routinely chalks up the team's uncharacteristic off-nights to, but with a need for four wins in at least seven games, there's no room for any of that. By this point, lessons should be learned, notes should be studied, and with the exam on Boston's desk, the Celtics need to Ace their final test.\n\nWith a proven winner in Jrue Holiday and a hungry star duo in Tatum and Brown, plus the versatility in Porzingis, Derrick White, and Al Horford, Boston has the mix to get the job done. Having not lost more than twice consecutively -- a trend that carried its way into the playoffs -- the Celtics have shown their urgency to respond to defeats so there's no reason to suggest they'll be incapable of continuing to do so if necessary.\n\n4. The Kyrie Irving hatred (while played out) will reach new heights\n\nIt's old, it's unnecessary, but it's an inevitable storyline, therefore, after booing Caleb Martin, Max Strus, and Aaron Nesmith, Irving is up next.\n\nThe final villain standing in Boston's way of Banner 18, the ex-Celtics guard of two seasons, Irving, shouldn't expect a welcome back from the TD Garden crowd come Thursday night. Instead, the 32-year-old veteran should prepare for an outpour of boos whenever the ball ends up in his hands, even though it's now been five years and the Celtics have proven to be better off following the Boston-Irving breakup.\n\nWhat's a Finals series without some sort of theatrics, right?", "source": {"uri": "nesn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NESN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gio_rivera@nesn.com", "name": "Gio Rivera", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Nesmith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Nesmith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Strus", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Max Strus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Ethnic_and_Regional", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Ethnic and Regional", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Spectrangle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Spectrangle", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://nesn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/06/Jayson-Tatum-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-03-01", "textStart": 2669, "textEnd": 2676}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

USATSI\n\nThe Boston Celtics and Dallas Mavericks will face off in the NBA Finals starting Thursday. It's a matchup filled with endless storylines and star power. We'll get Kyrie Irving facing his former team in Boston, as well as Kristaps Porzingis going against his former Dallas team. There's also Luka Doncic's first NBA Finals appearance, and Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown getting a second chance at a title after falling in the Finals two years ago.\n\nOn paper, this should be an epic series (and one that has people picking both teams), as it will pit some of the top talent in the league against each other. Both of these teams have shown dominance in the postseason, so it feels right to see how these rosters stack up next to each other in preparation for Thursday. With that in mind, we're ranking the top 15 players in the NBA Finals, from important role players to franchise stars.\n\n15. Sam Hauser, Celtics\n\nThe NBA Finals would be a perfect time for Hauser to break out of his shooting slump. The 6-foot-8 forward is shooting just 33% from deep in the playoffs, but he was knocking them down at a 42.4% clip on six attempts in the regular season. If he starts to find the bottom of the net, the Celtics become even more dangerous.\n\n14. Maxi Kleber, Mavericks\n\nDallas' do-it-all-forward returned in the Western Conference finals, after missing nine games with a dislocated shoulder. He hasn't done much in the two games since his return, but when he's healthy, he's a 3-point threat and is a versatile defender on the other end of the floor. We'll have to see if he's healthy enough to make an impact in this series, but having him back is still a plus for Dallas.\n\n13. Payton Pritchard, Celtics\n\nIt's crazy to think that a year ago Pritchard averaged just six minutes in the playoffs, because he's been such an important piece off the bench for the Celtics. He's as surefire as it gets from 3-point range, shooting 45.5% from deep in the postseason, and he's great at knowing when to get teammates involved and when the get his own bucket. He's not going to lock anyone down on defense, but he's going to put a ton of effort in on that end of the floor, which is valuable.\n\n12. Derrick Jones Jr., Mavericks\n\nThe Mavericks really found a diamond in the rough when they signed Jones to a veteran minimum contract this past summer. He's having a career year across the board, highlighted by shooting nearly 40% on 3s in the playoffs on the most attempts he's averaged in his career. And that's just on offense. Jones has been Dallas' best perimeter defender, already being tasked with guarding Paul George, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Anthony Edwards, and he'll surely draw either Jayson Tatum or Jaylen Brown in the Finals.\n\n11. Daniel Gafford, Mavericks\n\nOne of two trade deadline acquisitions, Gafford has been a major upgrade to Dallas' center rotation. He's a great rim running big to have alongside Doncic and Irving in the starting lineup, and his rim protection on the other end is why opposing teams have had a difficult time scoring in the paint on the Mavericks. He struggled in the first around against Ivica Zubac, but held his own against the Thunder and did a great job of containing the length the Timberwolves possess to make enough of a positive impact for Dallas.\n\n10. Dereck Lively II, Mavericks\n\nNo one could've expected that Lively would wind up being this impactful in his rookie season on an NBA Finals team (that includes Lively). He even said as much this week about being surprised at how much he's been used in his first year in the league. But if you've watched him play it's not surprising at all. He may be coming off the bench for Dallas, but Lively and Gafford play identical minutes, and you can see the boost of energy Lively injects into this team when he checks into the game. He's already a pest on the offensive glass, coming up clutch on a number of occasions to get the Mavericks second-chance opportunities. He's a lob threat any time Doncic or Irving are attacking the rim, and he's shown flashes of his development of being able to put the ball on the ground and get a basket himself. His length makes him a natural deterrent to anyone who tries to attack the rim, and he's already shown he can hold his own against tough matchups.\n\n9. Al Horford, Celtics\n\nHorford could honestly be higher on this list and I would understand that. He's been so important to the Celtics for several years, and again he seamlessly stepped back into the starting lineup for Boston when Kristaps Porzingis got injured. He's supremely efficient on offense, and while he's not knocking down 3s like he was the last time Boston went to the Finals, he's still a consistent threat. And he's more than just a spot-up shooter, too. Part of what made Boston's last Finals run so special was because of how Horford was playing on both ends of the floor. He put in a tremendous amount of effort on the defensive side of the ball, and while he's two years older now, we know that Horford is willing to do what is needed to get his team closer to winning a title.\n\n8. PJ Washington, Mavericks\n\nThe other trade deadline acquisition for the Mavericks, Washington has been a revelation in Dallas' playoff run. In the last two rounds, he's averaging over 15 points while shooting 38.3% from deep. He's also tasked with guarding one of the opposing team's best players, and in the last round did a great job of containing Karl-Anthony Towns. But part of why the Mavericks traded for him back in February was his ability to create for himself, and that's been on display too, especially on broken plays. He's capable of putting the ball on the deck an working in floaters or getting all the way to the rim for a finish. His production is going to be incredibly important for Dallas' championship chances, and they'll need the version of Washington that was shooting closer to 47% from deep against the Thunder to topple Boston.\n\n7. Jrue Holiday, Celtics\n\nYou could honestly interchange Holiday and Derrick White on this list because they're mirrors of each other in terms of doing whatever it takes on either side of the ball to help their team win. Holiday is a terror defensively, and he's going to be the toughest challenge for Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving yet. His huge wingspan, mixed with his high basketball IQ make him a nightmare for even the best offensive players in the league. His scoring has waxed and waned during the postseason, but his efficiency is still high, and he's still doing a great job of organizing things on offense for the likes of Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. Boston doesn't even need Holiday to do too much scoring, which lends itself to him being able to focus more of his energy on Dallas' potent backcourt. And who knows, this could be a particularly high-scoring series for Holiday, who may have Doncic guarding him. If that's the case, the Celtics will surely want to take advantage of that mismatch, and Holiday is perfectly capable of making the Mavericks star work on defense.\n\n6. Derrick White, Celtics\n\nWith Porzingis out, White has been the third star on this Celtics team in the playoffs. Like Holiday he's a pest on the defensive side of the ball, but he's a bit more dangerous offensively. He can have a scoring outburst like the 38-point performance he had in the first round against the Heat, and he can fill the box score like his 15-point, nine-assist, six-rebound outing in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals against the Pacers. Depending on Porzingis' health, he may need to continue racking up points for the Celtics, and if K.P. is back healthy, that only helps White and Boston because as the Mavericks try to contain everyone else, White could be left open from time to time. He's one of Boston's several do-it-all guys, and between him and Holiday they're sure to make life incredibly difficult for Doncic and Irving.\n\n5. Kristaps Porzingis, Celtics\n\nBarring any setbacks, Porzingis is expected to return in Game 1 of the NBA Finals. He's been the biggest question mark heading into the Finals after a first-round calf injury, and now it appears as though Boston will have one of its weapon back. When healthy, he's the ultimate floor spacing center, capable of launching 3s with ridiculous efficiency, backing down a smaller defender in the post and acting as a lob threat to guards attacking the rim. We'll have to see if he's 100% healthy, but if K.P. is back to his old self, it will be just another headache for the Mavericks to gameplan for, not just because of his offense, but his rim protection on the other side as well. Porzingis averaged two blocks a game during the regular season, the highest since his first year in Dallas back in 2019. With him patrolling the paint, it will certainly force the Mavericks to work a bit harder at getting shots around the rim, and even if he is pulled away from the basket he's solid at recovering to still impact a shot.\n\n4. Jaylen Brown, Celtics\n\nThis is perhaps the best version of Brown the Celtics have had, and he's been their go-to guy while Tatum has struggled with efficiency. Brown performed so well in the playoffs that he earned Eastern Conference finals MVP, not Tatum. Brown's averaging 25 points on a ridiculous 54.1% from the field and 36.8% from deep, and while there's been jokes about Boston's \"easy\" path to the NBA Finals, Brown has been making incredibly difficult shots along the way to get them there. Shots that he wasn't making prior to this season. His offensive game has reached new heights, and it literally just feels like he's been in attack mode throughout the playoffs.\n\nWe'll have to see if Brown can sustain that production against a Mavericks team that has surprised many people with its defensive pressure, so you could argue that this will be the first time Brown and the Celtics will truly be tested. But Brown was putting up absurd numbers even in the regular season, so regardless of the strength of competition in the Eastern Conference in the playoffs, he's been doing this for awhile.\n\n3. Kyrie Irving, Mavericks\n\nIf Irving wasn't on the roster, Dallas wouldn't have made it this far. He's been the perfect backcourt mate for Doncic, capable of completely taking over on offense like he did in Game 1 of the Western Conference finals. He's also the guy Dallas goes to when the other team has gone on a run and the Mavericks need a basket. Irving plays so calmly and confidently that it feels like every time the ball leaves his hands it's going in. He's shooting the ball absurdly well with .485/421/.828 splits, and he turns things up a level in the fourth quarter, where he's averaging 7.5 points, which ranks fifth in the playoffs.\n\nThere's truly an artistry to the way Irving plays basketball, contorting his body to get off the most impossible shots under the rim with multiple defenders draped around him, or using every inch of the backboard to bank in a difficult mid-range jumper. Irving's defense has also been a pleasant surprise for the Mavericks. He's committed on that end of the floor and is making smart plays to deflect passes or come away with steals.\n\n2. Jayson Tatum, Celtics\n\nTatum's somewhat struggled with efficiency throughout the postseason, specifically from 3-point range where he's making them at just a 29% clip. Boston is going to need him to improve on that if they want to finish off the Mavericks. But that aside, Tatum is Boston's best player. Brown might've had the better overall showing in this run to the Finals, but everything starts with Tatum's ability to score at will, at all three levels. He can pick apart a defense to get to the rim, work a defender and elevate for a mid-range jumper, or walk into a 3-pointer with ease. He's also grown as a passer over the years, and he's leading the Celtics this postseason in scoring, rebounds and assists.\n\nSimilar to Brown, the Mavericks will be the first real test of this postseason for Tatum. He's done great at knowing when to attack and when to pass it off to someone else, especially when his shot isn't falling. So if that happens in the Finals, Boston will need him to lean on that facilitation role a bit more.\n\n1. Luka Doncic, Mavericks\n\nDoncic enters the Finals as the best player in the series. He's been called a generational talent, and for good reason. There are very few players who can control the game quite like Doncic can, and we saw that in the Mavericks close-out win against the Timberwolves where he dropped 20 points in the first quarter. He can manipulate the defense like no one else, and even when you think you've got him beat, he'll flip a pass to an open shooter in the corner for a triple. And when his 3-pointer is falling, he's even more of a terror to guard. He's even shown a willingness to actually put in effort on the defensive side of the ball, which has always been a gripe about his game in the past.\n\nDoncic has already picked apart the No. 1 and No. 4 defense en route to this Finals appearance, and the Celtics boast the No. 2 defense. Boston has perhaps the best arsenal of versatile defenders equipped to make life difficult for Doncic, but we've already seen twice now how easy he can still find his spots, or at the very least get his teammates good looks.\n\nIt's going to be a battle between the Mavericks and Celtics, and if all of these guys are performing at peak levels we should be in for a great series.", "source": {"uri":

I could, I may never get it, and I'm okay with that. I am who I am. I do what I do. And I believe in what I believe in. So, the ones who wit' me, let's rock and roll, and the ones who aren't can kiss my a-.\"\n\nBrown has helped Boston reach the 2024 NBA Finals, where the Celtics will face the Dallas Mavericks in the best-of-seven series that begins on Thursday. Another strong run through the playoffs is following a spectacular regular season where the Celtics posted a 64-18 record and finished atop the Eastern Conference 14 games ahead of the New York Knicks and 16 games ahead of the fourth-place Cavaliers.\n\nIn his eighth season in the NBA -- all with the Celtics -- Brown contributed mightily by averaging 23.0 points, 5.5 rebounds and 3.6 assists per game in 70 regular season appearances. In the 2024 NBA Playoffs, the 27-year-old is averaging 25.0 points, 6.1 rebounds and 2.6 assists per contest as Boston has lost only twice and therefore needed just 14 games to reach the NBA Finals.\n\nStevens played his first three NBA seasons for the Cavaliers before winding up with the Celtics this season and making 19 appearances for them before being traded to the Memphis Grizzlies in February.\n\nThough Brown was named to the NBA All-Star Game for a second straight season, he was not named to any of the 2023-24 All-NBA teams despite being a Second Team selection for the 2022-23 campaign.\n\nThe snub -- in addition to his absence from the league's All-Defensive teams as well -- drew some attention and comments from teammates, raising the idea that Brown and the Celtics may become even more motivated to win an elusive NBA championship.\n\nThis is Brown's second trip to the league's championship round after the Celtics lost to the Golden State Warriors in the 2022 NBA Finals. Boston has advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals six times since Brown's debut in the 2016-17 season.\n\nFinally capturing a ring would go a long way toward perhaps giving Brown recognition he might deserve as a superstar.", "source": {"uri": "cavaliersnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cavaliers Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_battaglino@cavaliersnation.com", "name": "Mike Battaglino", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis_Grizzlies", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Memphis Grizzlies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cavaliersnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/USATSI_23388303_168403909_lowres-scaled-e1717598959772.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

The news and editorial departments had no role in the creation or display of this content.\n\nWe're just a day away from tipoff between the Dallas Mavericks and Boston Celtics in the NBA Finals, and oddsmakers have released a variety of props for the final series of the 2023-24 NBA season.\n\nWill this generation of Celtics finally get over the hump and capture banner No. 18, or will Luka Doncic capture his first ring and the Mavericks' first since 2011?\n\nHere are our favorite NBA Finals series bets for Mavericks vs. Celtics:\n\nREAD: 2024 NBA Finals Picks and PreviewREAD: Best NBA Finals Game 1 Sportsbooks Promos\n\n2024 NBA Finals: Dallas Mavericks vs. Boston Celtics odds & preview\n\nThe Celtics have been overwhelming favorites to win the title for months. All of the advanced analytics favor them, they went 2-0 against the Mavs during the regular season and they'll play four games at home should the series go to seven games.\n\nWhile Dallas is not viewed in the same regard as Boston, the Mavericks have been nothing short of sensational since the trade deadline. They were on a 67-win pace in games in which Luka Doncic, Kyrie Irving, Derrick Jones Jr., P.J. Washington and Daniel Gafford all started, including a tough playoff schedule against the Los Angeles Clippers, Oklahoma City Thunder and Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nKristaps Porzingis is expected to return from a calf injury for Game 1 of the Finals, which will be a major boost for Boston.\n\nThe key for the Celtics is to win with their depth, and to have Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown score effectively in clutch situations.\n\nOn the flip side, Dallas needs to get elite offensive production from its backcourt and continue to slow down the pace on defense with what has been one of the league's best defensive units since the trade deadline.\n\n2024 NBA Finals props: Mavericks +1.5 games (-130 or better)\n\nDallas has been on quite the run since it reshaped its roster in the middle of the season. Their defense is no longer a liability, and they posted a defensive rating of 111.1 in the playoffs.\n\nThe Mavs also had the best record in clutch games during the regular season and produced a 121.1 offensive rating in the fourth quarter of playoff games. For context, that would equal the second-highest offensive rating in NBA history, and it came during moments when teams give their best possible effort on defense.\n\nOn top of that, Dallas won all three of its series while starting on the road. Boston hasn't faced stiff competition in more than a month and could find it difficult to adjust to a hardened Dallas squad.\n\nCeltics vs. Mavericks series props: Luka Doncic most 3-pointers made (+110 or better)\n\nLuka was hot to start the playoffs before a slew of injuries slowed him down, and he couldn't launch a beach ball into the ocean. Those days appear to be gone, however, as he averaged five 3-pointers per game on 46.5% shooting over the final four games of the Timberwolves series.\n\nBoston blitzed Doncic at the third-lowest rate of any team in the league during the regular season, meaning they are unlikely to send multiple bodies at him knowing how lethal he is as a playmaker. If anything, he could receive even more shot opportunities if Boston tries to key in on Irving and force Doncic to beat them on his own.\n\nThe Celtics have done a nice job defending the 3-point line, holding opponents to 33.6% shooting in the postseason, but Doncic can get his shot off any time he wants. The other top contenders for this market, such as Derrick White and Tatum, have also been very up and down throughout the playoffs and are riskier bets over the course of an entire series.\n\nUnderdog DFS promo code BETFPB for NBA Finals odds: $250 bonus for new customers\n\nSince its launch in 2020, Underdog DFS has offered regular tournaments on a daily, weekly and season-long basis with a draft-based format.

So who knows how much waffling preceded the national NBA media's predictions for who will be the 2024 NBA Champion.\n\nWho do the experts like? Read on:\n\nThe Mavs can win this. They have the best player, and if Irving sizzles, they could have the best two. In that scenario, they're champs. With Porzingis out or limited, I'd pick the Mavs.\n\nBut assuming Porzingis can give this a real go, Boston should have barely enough answers at both ends. It knows what it is up against -- that it will have to summon a new energy and focus, and reach a higher level than was required in the East. Everything for so many years has been leading to this moment -- this chance.\n\nBoston in six.\n\nCeltics in six. This is the sixth time in eight years the Celtics have reached at least the conference finals and their second Finals in three years. Star wings Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown have achieved almost everything short of a ring. Coach Joe Mazzulla's job status was shaky in 2023 and Horford can't wait to get off that \"most playoff games without a title\" list. Urgency alone doesn't win championships, but urgency + talent + roster depth + experience + continuity + home court should be enough.\n\nMavericks in seven. Boston hasn't been truly tested this postseason. No Jimmy Butler in the first round. Donovan Mitchell and Tyrese Haliburton missed games in the subsequent rounds. Not only is this Dallas team mostly whole, but it's also peaking behind a pair of the league's best closers. -\n\n\"I still haven't seen anything to make me think the Celtics are not going to win the championship. ... I think it's gonna be a hell of a series but I like the Celtics.\"\n\nBy now, no one should underestimate the Mavericks. They have the star power, the firepower, and the defense to compete with anyone. But the Celtics just have more of everything -- shooting, playmaking, versatile defenders, the ability to play big or small -- as well as previous Finals experience. I'll go Boston in six.\n\nI have been waffling back and forth on this, and no answer feels good. You could probably talk me into any outcome and I'd buy it as plausible. Hard to know what's what with Porzingis's calf dinged up. If he's healthy enough and plays just average, Celtics in seven. If Zinger can't be effective and Dallas stays healthy, Ricks in six. And because both of those are cop-out answers and the league has insisted on staying as confusing as ever, let's just get weird and say Ricks in seven.\n\nThe Mavericks are playing the same kind of defense if not better than they displayed in the postseason two years ago. And, sorry to Celtics fans, but Luka is better than anyone they've got on a nightly basis. I don't think Leprechauns or mystique are going to determine outcomes for the next two or three weeks. I think the extra day of rest between every game (except 3 and 4 here in Dallas) keeps Luka as fresh as he's ever going to be in June.\n\nSometimes you learn from history. Other times you have to recognize the call of the future and the game's next truly great player. -- Mavericks in five.\n\nDallas' offense doesn't have the ability to spread the floor like Boston's does, and while I believe Doncic is the best player in this series, Boston has shown all season long that it is the best team.\n\nI don't think Dallas gets run out of the building like Boston did to the East, but given the Celtics' ability to win on the road in this postseason - and past postseasons - with this core, I think they clean this up in six games. Pick: Celtics in 6\n\nDallas is battle-tested and -hardened. Wrapping up the Wolves series in five games earned them a little extra rest, too. And right now, the Mavericks seem to have a solve for everything the league's best and most physical defense is throwing at them.\n\nAs TNT's Reggie Miller noted during Game 3 when he compared them to Mariano Rivera and Dennis Eckersley, Dallas has the two best closers left standing in Don\u010di\u0107 and Kyrie Irving. Those two are surrounded with size (thanks in large part to the acquisitions of Gafford and Washington), defensive versatility and talent that knows it's there to lift the stars.\n\nWhen these games get tight (and they will) Luka and Kyrie will make just enough more plays than Tatum, Brown and White to win this series in seven.\n\nIf Boston clamps down on Doncic and Irving's struggles against his former team continue, this could be a short series. If they continue to operate at a high level, however, Dallas should stay competitive with an improved defense that was one of the NBA's best during the second half.\n\nAfter taking down three teams with better records during the NBA Playoffs, the Mavericks will put up a fight and shouldn't be dismissed. However, the Celtics simply have too much firepower, especially if Porzingis is healthy. In terms of net rating, they're one of the best teams in NBA history and haven't lost four of seven at any point this season.\n\nBack Boston to prevail and add another banner to the rafters at TD Garden.", "source": {"uri": "masslive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MassLive"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Butler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Butler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donovan_Mitchell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donovan Mitchell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brown Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Eckersley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dennis Eckersley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariano_Rivera", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mariano Rivera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reggie Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Hispanic_whites", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Non-Hispanic whites"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.masslive.com/resizer/v2/WVKINTEJDNBRXIFXBXKRQCOTTQ.jpg?auth=a49eb16c50996ca93b899cfa888bd96271bab261e2fe43be66fcba119535c31d&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

We've also seen the total bet up a half-point after opening at 214.5.\n\nAlthough the Celtics won the season series 2-0, they could face more questions than answers regarding the status of center Kristaps Porzingis, who was set to return from a right calf injury but a recent session with the media proved less convincing.\n\nWhen asked whether he's at 100%, Porzingis said, \"I don't know. We'll see.\" He then stated that the \"current plan\" was for him to be available for Game 1.\n\nWhile the uncertainty around the Latvian's injury could undoubtedly influence the point spread, his status should have minimal impact on the total.\n\nOdds via DraftKings\n\nThe Mavericks and Celtics play very similar styles in terms of shot selection. Dallas ranks second behind Boston (47.1%) with a 3-point rate of 43.6%. Thus, we have a matchup in which both teams will look to make a lot of shots from beyond the arc.\n\nThe Celtics put a lot of pressure on their opponents with their perimeter shooting. They almost force the opposing team to match them shot for shot.\n\nAnd even if you're trying to slow the game down, things can speed up pretty quickly if Boston starts to heat up from the perimeter.\n\nDallas likes to play with a bit of tempo, ranking seventh in pace with 100.6 possessions per 48 minutes. But while the Celtics ranked only 19th in pace (97.98), their 3-point shooting can make the game feel a bit faster than it already is.\n\nWith the Mavericks' fast pace and the Celtics' aggressive perimeter shooting, we could be in for a thrilling, high-scoring game.\n\n\" READ MORE: Luka Doncic has value to lead NBA Finals in points and rebounds as Mavericks take on Celtics\n\nBoston is not only the most aggressive team from beyond the arc but also has the best shooting percentage in the league, at 38.5%. As a result, there aren't really any bad 3-point shots in the Celtics' offense.\n\nThe Celtics reached the Eastern Conference finals in three straight seasons while deploying this aggressive perimeter strategy. This is who they are as a team, and they've built a roster that reflects their vision.\n\nThey aren't going to suddenly change their playing style at this late stage in the season.\n\nThey might also want to loiter on the perimeter to avoid having to challenge the Mavericks' frontcourt inside the paint. Dallas is averaging 6.2 blocks per game during the postseason, the second-highest mark among the 16 playoff teams.\n\nEn route to the NBA Finals, the Mavs faced three teams (Clippers, Thunder and Timberwolves) that finished the season ranked in the bottom half of 3-point attempts.\n\nThe Celtics are a completely different animal, and you can be sure they'll dial up the pressure from the perimeter.\n\nDuring the playoffs, games are played at a much slower pace. However, given these teams' firepower, this matchup could quickly turn into a sprint.\n\nIn the last two years, the total is 19-15 to the over in Celtics' playoff games.

Washington and Daniel Gafford all started, including a tough playoff schedule against the Los Angeles Clippers, Oklahoma City Thunder and Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nKristaps Porzingis is expected to return from a calf injury for Game 1 of the Finals, which will be a major boost for Boston.\n\nThe key for the Celtics is to win with their depth, and to have Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown score effectively in clutch situations.\n\nOn the flip side, Dallas needs to get elite offensive production from its backcourt and continue to slow down the pace on defense with what has been one of the league's best defensive units since the trade deadline.\n\n2024 NBA Finals props: Mavericks +1.5 games (-130 or better)\n\nDallas has been on quite the run since it reshaped its roster in the middle of the season. Their defense is no longer a liability, and they posted a defensive rating of 111.1 in the playoffs.\n\nThe Mavs also had the best record in clutch games during the regular season and produced a 121.1 offensive rating in the fourth quarter of playoff games. For context, that would equal the second-highest offensive rating in NBA history, and it came during moments when teams give their best possible effort on defense.\n\nOn top of that, Dallas won all three of its series while starting on the road. Boston hasn't faced stiff competition in more than a month and could find it difficult to adjust to a hardened Dallas squad.\n\nCeltics vs. Mavericks series props: Luka Doncic most 3-pointers made (+110 or better)\n\nLuka was hot to start the playoffs before a slew of injuries slowed him down, and he couldn't launch a beach ball into the ocean. Those days appear to be gone, however, as he averaged five 3-pointers per game on 46.5% shooting over the final four games of the Timberwolves series.\n\nBoston blitzed Doncic at the third-lowest rate of any team in the league during the regular season, meaning they are unlikely to send multiple bodies at him knowing how lethal he is as a playmaker. If anything, he could receive even more shot opportunities if Boston tries to key in on Irving and force Doncic to beat them on his own.\n\nThe Celtics have done a nice job defending the 3-point line, holding opponents to 33.6% shooting in the postseason, but Doncic can get his shot off any time he wants. The other top contenders for this market, such as Derrick White and Tatum, have also been very up and down throughout the playoffs and are riskier bets over the course of an entire series.\n\nUnderdog DFS promo code BETFPB for NBA Finals odds: $250 bonus for new customers\n\nSince its launch in 2020, Underdog DFS has offered regular tournaments on a daily, weekly and season-long basis with a draft-based format.

Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward were coming back healthy the following season. Head coach Brad Stevens seemed to get every last drop of potential out of whatever roster he was bestowed. So even amid the obvious sting of that playoff defeat, there was an undeniable optimism about what lied ahead.\n\n\"When it ends, it's painful. That is part of the path,\" Stevens said that night. \"And so we have to let it motivate us.\"\n\nBut in that moment, no one could have known just how much pain was ahead, or just how long it would take for the Celtics to truly shuffle closer to completing its title quest.\n\nNothing is promised in the NBA. Optimism turns to uncertainty in the bounce of a ball. Pain has been part of Boston's path for 2,202 days. But, over the next 18 days, Boston has a chance to erase a lot of bad memories.\n\nAs the Celtics tip off Game 1 of the NBA Finals by hosting the Dallas Mavericks on Thursday night at TD Garden, Banner 18 is within their grasp.\n\nSeven-hundred and twenty-one days ago, the pain crescendoed for the core of this Celtics team.\n\nAnother magical playoff run delivered this team to the 2022 Finals stage. Boston had been minutes away from taking a 3-1 series lead over the vaunted Golden State Warriors. Instead, they were watching that same opponent celebrate a six-game triumph on the Garden floor.\n\nEven with Tatum and Brown blossoming into All-Star talents, the Celtics ran out of a gas after navigating a grueling playoff run. Four years after optimism tempered that Game 7 loss to the Cavaliers, the uncertainty of how long it would take to get back to the title stage hovered as Boston digested not being able to get over the last hump.\n\n\"We know what it feels like to get to this point,\" Tatum said after the Game 6 loss to Golden State. \"Getting here and not accomplishing it, it's tough. You don't want to feel like this again but you want to get back here.\"\n\nThe Celtics should have known that nothing is promised in the NBA.\n\nIn the aftermath of that 2018 playoff run, the wheels came flying off the Celtics' car during an utterly miserable 2019 season. Kyrie Irving, entering a contract year, declared his intentions to re-sign in Boston before the start of the 2018-19 campaign then sulked his way through a season in which it became clear he was gone. No one on a talent-gushing Celtics roster was willing to sacrifice individual stats for the betterment of the team.\n\nAfter an unceremonious second-round exit, Irving rushed to join Kevin Durant in Brooklyn. Al Horford chased a payday to join rival Philly. The Celtics were left to pick up the pieces with a very uncertain path forward.\n\nThe ascension of Tatum and Brown ensured the team stayed afloat. Heck, the Celtics nearly surged to the Finals amid the Bubble weirdness of the 2020 playoffs. But a first-round playoff exit at the hands of Irving and the Nets in 2021 made it feel like Banner 18 had never been further away.\n\nOne thousand, one hundred days ago, the Celtics enacted Phase 1 of an organizational shakeup aimed at putting the team back on a title track.\n\nOn a sleepy Wednesday morning, the day after the team's season ended in Brooklyn, the Celtics announced that Danny Ainge would be retiring and, more shockingly, Stevens would elevate from coach to general manager.\n\nIt's easy to forget now given all the bold moves that Stevens has made to reconstruct a title contender, but there was uncertainty about whether he could thrive as team architect. Would Stevens be able to make bold moves, particularly given the relationship he had forged with his players as head coach?\n\nThat question got a quick answer when he dealt beloved guard Kemba Walker to Oklahoma City to bring back Al Horford in his first days on the job. Stevens hired Ime Udoka as his replacement as Celtics coach and Udoka's tough love seemed to fuel this team in a way that Stevens' voice no longer could.\n\nDespite some bumps in the road, the Celtics' leaned into a defensive identity late in the 2021-22 season and embarked on a furious second-half run that would deliver them all the way to the Finals stage.\n\nEven in defeat, it didn't feel like it would be long before Boston might be back in the title round. But nothing is promised.\n\nUdoka was dismissed from the team of the eve of the 2022-23 season, unheralded back-row assistant Joe Mazzulla was promoted in his place, and a cloud hovered over the Celtics as they embarked on a quest to get back to the Finals.\n\nIt took a little longer than they might have liked, but Boston is here now. And the next 18 days could change just how we look back at all the crazy twists and turns of the previous 2,202 days.\n\nFive days ago, Tatum sat at the podium in the Auerbach Center pondering Boston's return to the Finals.\n\n\"You don't always get a second chance,\" said Tatum.\n\nUnlike all those playoff series that Boston entered as the feisty underdog, the Celtics will tip off the 2024 Finals as heavy favorites to secure Banner 18. There's a pressure present that wasn't there in 2022. But there's also an experience that might better position the team to get to the finish line of its long title quest.\n\nOver these past 2,202 days, the Celtics have experienced all of the emotions. Individually, there have been extreme highs. Tatum and Brown have further evolved into All-NBA players and are reaping the rewards. Brown signed the richest contract in NBA history last summer and Tatum should sign a big-money pact this offseason.\n\nBoth players have learned that none of their individual accolades matter unless you raise a banner. When you play in Boston, it's not about the stat lines you produce and the awards you secure, but the Larry O'Brien Trophies you add to the collection.\n\nIt doesn't feel like a stretch to suggest that, if Tatum and Brown get to the finish line of this title hunt, their legacies will forever change in Boston. If they put an 18th title banner in the rafters, they might as well start sewing another banner that houses retired numbers, because both 0 and 7 will be trending toward going skyward.\n\nThat they have to go through Irving, whose absence was conspicuous on the Boston bench in Game 7 of that 2018 loss, only brings this story that much more full circle.\n\nOf course, Tatum and Brown will not go this alone. Stevens, in Phase 2 of this team's recent overhaul, made two bold decisions to acquire Kristaps Porzingis and NBA champion Jrue Holiday. It meant dealing away core pieces in Marcus Smart and Robert Williams III. But the moves undeniably made Boston a more dynamic team with a higher ceiling. That much has been proven as the Celtics have compiled a 76-20 record since the start of the regular season.\n\nA convincing Finals triumph would position Boston as one of the most dominant teams in NBA history. Quibble about the strength of opposition on this postseason journey, but Boston has flexed on all comers this season.\n\nNo one could have possibly seen all the twists and turns that have occurred since that 2018 loss in the East Finals. There has been a lot more strife than anyone could reasonably expect on the quest to add to Boston's banner collection.\n\nBut the opportunity is there again. Banner 18 has never felt closer. And yet the Celtics know all too well that nothing is promised. There is work to do.\n\nEverything over the past 2,202 days has built to this moment. The path has been bumpy and there have been a lot of painful detours along the way.\n\nAll of which might just make it that much more satisfying if the Celtics are able to complete this journey. Pain was part of the path but an indescribable joy might wait at the finish line.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

But unless he helps them hoist their 18th NBA championship banner to the TD Garden rafters, he won't be able to call himself a true Boston great.\n\nNo one knows that better than Tatum himself. Speaking to a packed crowd of reporters Wednesday at NBA Finals media day, the Celtics' centerpiece superstar acknowledged that his team's standard for excellence is simply higher than it is in nearly every other NBA city.\n\nIn Boston, only champions become icons.\n\n\"We only hang NBA championship banners, right?\" Tatum said on the eve of Game 1 against the Dallas Mavericks. \"Seventeen of them. Some of the greatest players to ever play this game wore this uniform. All of us are honored to follow in their footsteps, the way they paved for us to live out our dream.\n\n\"Essentially, yeah, if you want to be one of the greats to put on this uniform, every great before you won a championship. That's what we try to play for every single season. The expectations are obviously different here. It takes special players to be here and to be a part of an environment like that.\"\n\nTatum nearly reached that rarefied status two years ago, when he and Jaylen Brown led the Celtics to their first Finals since 2010. Boston took a 2-1 lead in that series but dropped the next three games to Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors.\n\nThose teams looked like what they were at the time: a multi-time title-winning dynasty against a young upstart with no real championship experience. The Celtics' execution was lacking on both ends of the floor, and the Warriors won in six.\n\n\"I hate that I had to go through it,\" Tatum said. \"I wish we would have won. But I'm a firm believer in everything happens for a reason. There's a lesson to be learned in every situation. I do feel a lot different this time, this go-around, two years later. I'm excited for the opportunity for us to get the job done.\"\n\nThe biggest lesson? Despite head coach Joe Mazzulla's insistence this year that the regular season and postseason are no different, sometimes it takes a loss on the game's grandest stage to learn how to win.\n\n\"I think we understood what it took to get there,\" said Tatum, who's reached at least the Eastern Conference finals in five of his seven NBA seasons. \"They understood what it took to get over the hump. ... They've just been there before.\n\n\"In some of those tough moments, when I go back and look, you can tell that they had been there before. It was a lesson to be learned. I told myself that if I ever got the opportunity again to make it to the Finals, never take it for granted.\"\n\nNow, the Celtics are back, looking to right their wrongs from 2022 and break the storied franchise's 16-year title drought. Tatum, a first-team All-NBAer in each of the last three seasons, leads Boston in points, rebounds and assists this postseason. His team won a league-best 64 games during the regular season and is 12-2 in the playoffs, albeit against a trio of weakened East foes.\n\n\"He's there for every single practice, every single game,\" Mazzulla said. \"Loves being coached. Just carries himself the best way. There's no one like him. He's great.\"\n\nThe national narrative surrounding Tatum, however, has been largely negative. His status as a top-five player has been questioned, his reaction to Brown's East finals MVP award critiqued. He's not viewed nearly as positively as his NBA Finals foil, Mavericks star Luka Doncic, who also does not have a Larry O'Brien Trophy on his resume. A reporter mentioned during Tatum's media day news conference that the 26-year-old might be the most scrutinized player in these NBA playoffs.\n\n\"You think so?\" Tatum replied, rhetorically, while smiling and pantomiming a basketball shot.\n\nThat criticism, Tatum said, bothers his mother and grandmother. As for his own feelings? He took the high road, chalking the chatter up to the interminable 10-day break between the end of the conference finals and Game 1 of the Finals on Thursday night at TD Garden.\n\n\"My mom took it a little tougher than maybe I did,\" Tatum said. \"But for me, I don't take it personal, right? Just a long break without NBA basketball, also they had to overanalyze every little thing to have something to talk about.\n\n\"Did it get old? Yeah. But, you know, it's the Finals. They wouldn't talk about me if I wasn't good, so try to take some positives out of it and change the channel.\"\n\nChanging the channel is easy. The only way to change the narrative and solidify Tatum as a Celtics legend and unquestioned NBA elite: beat the Mavs and claim Banner 18.", "source": {"uri": "bostonherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zack_cox@bostonherald.com", "name": "Zack Cox", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_O'Brien_Championship_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AP24023115410318.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

It helped Brown earn the NBA\u00b4s first $300 million contract last summer. And, Tatum is expected to get one this offseason.\n\nThe team has branded the All-Stars as \"The Jays\" in a marketing campaign shown during games that pitted them against one another in mini competitions.\n\nIt has created natural comparisons between them along the way, fostering an atmosphere in which fans and sports pundits alike have tried to parse out which one of them is better, whose spot is most untouchable on the roster and which of them is more pivotal to the Celtics' success as they prepare to lead the team to the franchise\u00b4s 18th NBA title.\n\nIndiana Pacers forward Pascal Siakam (43) goes up for a shot against Boston Celtics guard Jaylen Brown (7), forward Jayson Tatum (0) and center Al Horford (42) during the first quarter of Game 1 of the NBA Eastern Conference basketball finals, Tuesday, May 21, 2024, in Boston. (AP Photo/Michael Dwyer)\n\nIt reached a new level last week during a segment on ESPN\u00b4s \"Get Up\" in which panelists debated whether the 26-year-old Tatum expressed excitement or disappointment while watching the 27-year-old Brown garner Eastern Conference finals MVP honors.\n\n\"I think it\u00b4s unfair to both of them,\" Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said of what he viewed as an attempt to manufacture friction between the two stars.\n\nBut even as Tatum and Brown have distinguished themselves as the most important players on Boston\u00b4s roster and the keys to the Celtics\u00b4 fate in their NBA Finals matchup with the Dallas Mavericks, Mazzulla has hope that people will start viewing them differently.\n\n\"They\u00b4re, like, two completely different people. They\u00b4re two completely different players,\" Mazzulla said. \"They\u00b4re great teammates, they love each other and they go about winning and they go about their process in a different way. Why they have to always be lumped together I think is unfair.\"\n\nTatum and Brown, along with Al Horford, are the only returning starters from the 2021-22 team that lost to the Golden State Warriors in six games in the Finals after holding a 2-1 series lead.\n\nWhile Horford has taken on mostly a reserve role this season, backing up 7-footer Kristaps Porzingis, Tatum and Brown have taken their play up a notch.\n\nTatum\u00b4s scoring numbers have remained steady from the regular season (26.9 per game) into the playoffs (26.0), while his rebounding has increased from 8.1 to 10.4 per game in the postseason. Brown, too, has seen jumps in those categories, going from 23.0 points and 5.5 rebounds per game to 25.0 points and 6.1 rebounds in the playoffs.\n\nTatum believes they\u00b4ve both used lessons from the 2022 NBA Finals\u00b4 loss, as well as last year\u00b4s conference finals loss to Miami, to grow into players more equipped to accomplish their championship goal this time around.\n\n\"Obviously, we\u00b4ve been there before, we came up short,\" Tatum said. \"You don\u00b4t always get a second chance, so really just looking at it as a second chance and trying to simplify things as much as we can.\"\n\nAnd being each other's biggest cheerleaders, too.\n\nAfter Brown made a game-tying 3-pointer late in Game 1 of the conference finals matchup with Indiana to send the game to overtime in an eventual Celtics' victory, the highest praise came from Tatum.\n\n\"Big time players make big time plays,\" Tatum said of Brown.\n\nFor Brown, this season has been about focusing on the expectations he has for himself and not worrying about others' perception of him.\n\nInitially, when he was asked about not being included on either the All-NBA or All-Defensive teams, he shrugged it off, saying his attention was focused on getting back to the NBA Finals.\n\nAfter he was named conference finals MVP, he acknowledged it did offer at least some motivation, particularly on the defensive side of the ball which he said he put most of his work into this past offseason.\n\n\"As time has gone by and I got to this point, I stopped caring,\" Brown said. \"I don\u00b4t care who sees what, as long as my city knows my value, my team knows my value, my family - that\u00b4s all I really care about.\"\n\nMazzulla believes the reason the relationship between Brown and Tatum is so often talked about is rooted in outside disbelief that their dynamic doesn\u00b4t breed any rivalry between them.\n\n\"At the end of the day, like, those two guys, their relationship is their relationship,\" Mazzulla said. \"They love each other. They push each other every single day in practice. They communicate with each other, but they go about it differently. And, I think they both get it unfair being compared to each other.

We kind of took it for granted at certain moments.\"\n\nAnd now?\n\n\"I'm not thinking about what it would mean for my legacy or anything like that,\" he said. \"Just excited to play some basketball ... and go out there and try to get the job done.\"\n\nDallas' Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving see it as their first opportunity to make good on a partnership that began late last season after Irving was traded from Brooklyn following a tumultuous run of two-plus seasons with the Nets.\n\nBut the duo was still learning to play with each other during their truncated time together last season and didn't make it to the postseason. After a slow start this season, they found cohesion after the All-Star break and emerged from a deep Western Conference field.\n\nFor Irving, it has been a reminder that success can be fleeting. He won his lone championship with Cleveland in 2016 and has played with three teams over the past eight years. His time in Dallas has reinvigorated him.\n\n\"These young guys are very hungry. They want a championship. I want a championship,\" he said. \"So our feelings are very mutual. But I've always reminded them that this is a process. Failure is going to be part of this, too. Get it out your mind that this is about to be a clean sweep or everything is about to feel good throughout this journey and all that.\n\n\"I'm just very real, very honest. That's what's helped me grow as a leader.\"\n\nDoncic credits the partnership with Irving for uncorking the potential of a team that entered the postseason as a fifth seed.\n\n\"His leadership is amazing,\" Doncic said. \"The way he connects us. I think me and Kyrie are the leaders of this team, but he's the one that's been in the Finals. He's the one that won in the Finals. He's the one that is really leading it.\"\n\nThey'll matchup with a Boston team playing like a group that has learned from its recent shortcomings. That was exhibited during a 64-win regular season that established it as a favorite to raise the franchise's 18th championship banner entering the postseason.\n\nThrough the first three rounds, the Celtics have met the challenge, losing just two games along the way under the guidance of second-year coach Joe Mazzulla.\n\nThey've also benefited from an offseason shakeup of its roster that saw longtime emotional leader Marcus Smart and former NBA Sixth Man of the Year Malcolm Brogdon traded in favor of 7-footer Kristaps Porzingis and Jrue Holiday, who won a championship with Milwaukee in 2021.\n\nBrown said a core that features seven players from the 2022 team that lost in the Finals to Golden State, is up to the challenge.\n\n\"I think this is a special group. I really do,\" Brown said. \"We've been able to go through the experiences of having success but not having success at the same time. I think to solidify the ultimate goal is to get over the hump and win. I think that will add a lot to our legacy. But as of right now, that story is kind of still untold.\"\n\nCOACHING PERSPECTIVES\n\nThis stage is nothing new to Mavericks coach Jason Kidd, who is in the Finals for the fifth time as a player or coach.\n\nHe has experienced lows, such as losing back-to-back trips to the Finals in 2002 and 2003 as a player with the New Jersey Nets. He has also seen success, earning his lone title as a player with Dallas in 2011 at age 38 and one as an assistant on the Lakers 2020 championship team.\n\nThe biggest lesson he has taken away is to approach it like business and be ready to live with the results. That has been his message to his team throughout these playoffs.\n\n\"This is the best of the best at the highest level,\" Kidd said. \"It's fun. That's what the Finals are all about, is seeing what team is going to step forward and take advantage of mistakes.\"\n\nMazzulla was an assistant on Ime Udoka's staff in 2022. What he learned from that experience is that the details of winning never change, even on this stage.\n\n\"The toughest team will win,\" Mazzulla said. \"The team that makes the most plays will win. The team that can execute the details at a high level will win. It's no different.\"\n\nFRIENDS AND COMPETITORS\n\nIrving is ready for what he expects to be an icy greeting from Boston's home crowd for Game 1 on Thursday.\n\nCeltics fans haven't held a high opinion of him since he ended two disappointing seasons in Boston by leaving for the Nets and joining Kevin Durant in free agency in 2019.\n\nHe then rankled the Boston faithful even more when he flipped his middle finger at fans after making a shot during Brooklyn's first round playoff series loss to the Celtics in 2022. But he said he is looking forward to matching up with \"brothers\" and former teammates Tatum and Brown.\n\n\"They've gotten tremendously better. They've led their team to this point. So I'm proud of them,\" Irving said. \"I'm looking forward to the competition because this is what we've all strived for since we were kids, basketball at this level playing against the best of the best.\"", "source": {"uri": "lasvegassun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Las Vegas Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@lasvegassun.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author",

The Mavericks are a +190 underdog and were as high as 50-1 earlier this season to win their second championship.\n\n\"If you would've set a Dallas-Boston series price before the playoffs had even started, it probably would've been about Boston (-400),\" Sherman said. \"But the way that things have transpired in the playoffs, you're looking at half that price.\"\n\nThe Celtics are 12-2 in the postseason (7-7 against the spread), but had a relatively easy path to the Finals.\n\nThey beat the Heat without star Jimmy Butler, the Cavaliers without star Donovan Mitchell and the Pacers without star Tyrese Haliburton. Boston is on a 1-5 spread slide after winning three close games against Indiana in the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nThe Mavericks are 12-5 in the playoffs (11-6 ATS) after beating the Clippers and Thunder before eliminating the Timberwolves -- who knocked out the defending NBA champion Nuggets -- in five games in the Western Conference Finals. Dallas has covered four of its last five games and seven of its last 10.\n\n\"Just the way Boston struggled a bit with an Indiana team without Haliburton and Dallas looked pretty good against Minnesota, you could just tell that if we went too high on Dallas, in the +200 or +220 range, it would've been a little bit one-sided on Dallas support,\" Sherman said.\n\nBettors backing Mavericks\n\nBettors are still all over the Mavericks to upset the Celtics.\n\nEighty-five percent of the tickets at BetMGM and 70 percent of the tickets at the SuperBook are on Dallas. Sixty-one percent of the money at the SuperBook is on Boston, bolstered by the return of center Kristaps Porzingis.\n\n\"I still think you're going to see the body of work show for Boston,\" Sherman said. \"They've just been the best team all year. I would expect them to come through here.\"\n\nRynning (@ersports1) still likes the plus price on the Mavericks, who are led by stars Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving. Doncic won the NBA's scoring title this season after averaging 33.9 points per game.\n\n\"Rarely in the NBA playoffs (will you) find the team with the best player garnering a 2-1 underdog price,\" Rynning said. \"One can certainly make that case with Luka Doncic and the Mavericks. The betting market still hasn't found the right price with this Mavericks team that's taken the NBA by storm since the All-Star break and into the playoffs.\n\n\"Importantly, the Mavericks were able to generate a plethora of easy shots against the strong rim-defending Timberwolves, while the Celtics are vulnerable in the paint. Yes, the Celtics are the most likely series winner here, but the value is with the underdog. The Mavericks are the bet in Game 1, plus the points as well.\"\n\nBoston is a consensus 6\u00bd-point favorite in Game 1 after the line opened at 6 at the SuperBook.\n\n\"We took some sharp play at -6 to get us to 6\u00bd,\" Sherman said.\n\nIn Game 1, 57 percent of the tickets at the SuperBook are on Dallas and 88 percent of the money is on Boston. Seventy-two percent of the tickets and 66 percent of the money is on the Mavericks at Caesars Sportsbook.\n\nThe total is 214\u00bd. Eighty-six percent of the tickets and 87 percent of the money is on the over at Caesars.\n\nMVP odds\n\nCeltics star Jayson Tatum is the -130 favorite at the SuperBook to win the NBA Finals MVP award. Doncic is the 2-1 second choice.\n\nOnlyPlayers.com handicapper Doug Kezirian, formerly of ESPN, recommends a play on Doncic to win MVP instead of a series bet on the Mavericks.\n\n\"If someone wants to bet Dallas +180 to win the Finals, it makes more sense to bet Luka +210 to win MVP,\" said Kezirian (@DougKezirian). \"There is no world where the Mavs win without that occurring. Any money on Kyrie Irving or another Maverick is just lighting your money on fire.\"\n\nThat said, Kezirian believes the Celtics will beat Dallas.\n\n\"While I do believe there is a legitimate path for Dallas, based on Luka's dominance and (Celtics coach) Joe Mazzulla's potential incompetence, I think Boston is the right side,\" Kezirian said. \"The Dallas defense did improve with the midseason acquisitions but they still advanced only because Minnesota's two best players underperformed and the Thunder shot 30 percent on open 3-pointers. Boston's offense is just too good.\"", "source": {"uri": "reviewjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Las Vegas Review-Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Boston is 12-2 in the playoffs entering the NBA Finals, on the heels of going 64-18 in the regular season.

For me, I don't take it personal. It's a long break without NBA basketball. They had to overanalyze every little thing and have something to talk about. Did it get old? Yeah. But it's The Finals.

After having suffered disappointing ends late in postseason runs over the last couple of years, the Celtics are trying to win the franchise's first championship since 2008. Led by Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, Boston has lost just twice on the way to the Finals for the second time in three seasons. They defeated the Miami Heat, Cleveland Cavaliers and Indiana Pacers to claim the Eastern crown.\n\nThis is just the third time the Mavericks have ever made it to the Finals, and the first since they won it all in 2011. It has been a long and winding road for the franchise to get back to this point. After a few abysmal seasons, superstar guard Luka Doncic has led the team on a resurgence. With the help for a former champion in Kyrie Irving, Dallas has a one-two punch that has been very tough to stop. The Mavericks have made it to this point by beating the Los Angeles Clippers in Round 1, before taking down the top-seeded Oklahoma City Thunder and and Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nThe Celtics have a ridiculous 17-3 record in the Finals, while the Mavericks are 1-1.\n\nThe first game of the Finals is set for Thursday, June 6 at the TD Garden in Boston, where the Celtics are 6-2 so far in these playoffs.

Smith's Jayson Tatum-Luka Doncic take will have Mavericks fans up in arms", "body": "Luka Doncic and the Dallas Mavericks are currently gearing up for their NBA Finals matchup vs the Boston Celtics, which is set to begin on Thursday evening. Doncic has been having an unbelievable postseason so far, absolutely eviscerating a Minnesota Timberwolves defense that was the best in the NBA this year in the last round and getting some great help from his Mavericks teammates en route to his first NBA Finals appearance.\n\nThere is a general consensus among sports fans heading into this series that the Mavericks have the best player of the two teams in Doncic, but that Boston probably has more talent overall. The best player on the Celtics of course is Jayson Tatum, and recently, sports media personality Stephen A. Smith took to First Take to make a controversial statement, as he has been known to do, that will have Mavericks fans riled up.\n\n\"I'm going to go with Jayson Tatum, believe it or not,\" said Smith, when asked who has had the better career thus far between Doncic and Tatum (via First Take on X, the social media platform formerly referred to as Twitter. \"Here's a couple of things. Luka's been in the league for six years. He's missed the playoffs twice, and he's been bounced out of the first round twice. So four of the six years, he either hasn't made it past the first round or hasn't made it to the first round at all... In Jayson Tatum's seven years in the NBA, he's only been bounced out of the first round one time. He's been to five conference finals, and now his second NBA Finals appearance, and when you look at that kind of resume, that's where I think he gets the edge.\"\n\nWho's had the better career?\n\nSmith's version of answering the question seemed to be solely to point to team accomplishments rather than individual accomplishments, where Doncic has Tatum beat in virtually every category. Doncic has already amassed five (!) first team All NBA appearances in his six years to Tatum's three, and also finished higher in the MVP vote than Tatum this year.\n\nWhile he has undoubtedly played an immense role in the Celtics' success over the last half decade plus, Tatum was drafted to a team that had made the conference finals the year before he got there and who had just upgraded that team by adding Kyrie Irving, along with an improved Jaylen Brown in what was the second year of his career. Doncic, meanwhile, was drafted (technically traded) to a Mavericks team that was in the midst of a total rebuild upon his arrival.\n\nOf course, both Tatum and Doncic have had great careers and are consensus top ten players in the NBA today.

Kenny says with both teams taking different paths to get to the NBA Finals - the Celtics were prohibitive favorites to win the Eastern Conference while the Mavericks were mostly underdogs against their Western Conference opponents - the series offer a contrasting scenario for viewers.\n\n\"We always like to say that fans are very smart, and opportunities like this where you have genuine heat and genuine star power on a national stage should generate genuine interest in the series,\" Kenny said.\n\nHeadlining the play-by-play announcing team for ABC is veteran analyst Mike Breen along with newcomers J.J.

The elite duo of Luka Don\u010di\u0107 and Kyrie Irving helped the Mavericks overcome adversity en route to the Finals. A potential series win for Dallas hinges on exploiting the Celtics' weaknesses while capitalizing on their own strengths.\n\nThe entire roller coaster of the NBA season leads up to one moment: the NBA Finals. That moment has come as the 2024 NBA Finals are set to kick off between the Boston Celtics and Dallas Mavericks. The other twenty-eight teams are left on the outside looking in.\n\nThis first-time matchup pins together two even-strength teams, similar in nature and construction. But as the order of natural law pertains, only one can take home the prestige of the NBA championship.\n\nAlthough the series is expected to be even for the most part, Dallas is the slight underdog to win the title. Here is why the Mavericks will defy those odds and win the 2024 NBA Finals.\n\nRoad to the 2024 NBA Finals How the Mavericks got here\n\nThe Mavericks were forced to adapt and survive quickly and early on in the 2023-24 NBA season, as they found themselves smack in the middle of one of the most highly competitive conferences in years. But thanks to their big duo of Luka Don\u010di\u0107 and Kyrie Irving, who have thrived together this year to become one of the league's top duos, the team outlasted.\n\nThe Mavericks finished in the middle of the Western Conference with a record of 50-32, which was good enough for the fifth seed. That was thanks to the play of Don\u010di\u0107 and Irving, as mentioned, but also the Trade Deadline acquisition of P.J. Washington, which has all but solidified their rotation.\n\nIn the first round of the NBA playoffs, the Mavericks squared off against a familiar opponent, the Los Angeles Clippers. This time, they got the best of the Clippers as they ousted them in six games, advancing to the Conference Semifinals.\n\nNext, the Mavericks faced the privilege of taking on the top seed in the Western Conference, the Oklahoma City Thunder. Despite the Thunder having the top seed, however, the Mavericks took it to them, using their playoff experience against the Thunder, who had none coming into this year. Dallas would take four of the last five games of the series to knock off the Thunder in six.\n\nIt was in that series where the elite pairing of Don\u010di\u0107 and Irving really cemented itself. That would continue into the Conference Finals, where the Mavericks were to take on the Minnesota Timberwolves. The Timberwolves cemented themselves as a legitimate title contender thanks to the emergence of Anthony Edwards, coupled with the longtime sensation Karl-Anthony Towns and defensive mastermind Rudy Gobert.\n\nDespite the series being much more evenly-matched on paper, the Mavericks were able to take the first three games of the series, including the first two in Minneapolis. Dallas would finish them off in a gentleman's sweep to advance to their first NBA Finals since 2011, and only third in franchise history.\n\nRoad to the Championship How the Mavericks can defeat the Celtics\n\nThe Mavericks are facing a relatively unfamiliar opponent in the Boston Celtics. They only faced each other twice in the regular season, losing both games. The first game was played in Dallas on January 22, and the Celtics won that game by a score of 119-110. The second game was played in Boston on March 1, and the Mavericks were blown out by a score of 138-110.\n\nThat, however, feels like an eternity ago, before the Mavericks hit their stride. They, of course, were always a contender, but they have elevated their game to another level in these playoffs. Dallas is now equipped with the keys necessary to slow the Celtics down enough to the point of elimination.\n\nBoth the Mavericks and Celtics have gotten lucky that they have not had to deal with the injury bug, leading to their success. But Boston got unlucky by losing Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is early in the playoffs due to a calf injury, and he has not returned since.\n\nPorzi\u0146\u0123is is expected to return for Game 1 of the NBA Finals, but it is unlikely that he will be operating at full strength. He is not the most mobile of players to begin with, and if he is compromised, the Mavericks will be able to switch-hunt him. The Celtics' defense is elite, but if Porzi\u0146\u0123is is compromised, the Mavericks' shot-creators will be able to take full advantage and essentially make him a non-factor.\n\nThe Celtics rely on a game plan of setback three-pointers, which they have been able to use to blow away opponents. The Mavericks do not rely as heavily on that metric, but they did already play a team that did -- the Oklahoma City Thunder -- and crushed them in six games. They forced them to make contested looks, and there is no doubt they can do the same against the Celtics.\n\nThe Thunder also possessed the top defense in the NBA, and the Minnesota Timberwolves possessed the fourth-best. It was debated whether that would be able to stop the Mavericks by limiting the production of both Don\u010di\u0107 and Irving, but Dallas spit in the face of those narratives by eating those teams alive.\n\nThe Celtics possess the second-best defense, and if any team has given any indications of toppling that, it is the Dallas Mavericks. There is no doubt that, as currently constituted, the pairing of Don\u010di\u0107 and Irving will be able to go toe-to-toe with the dynamic duo of Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, who will be hard to topple.\n\nIf the Mavericks keep their games close, the clutch factor of their stars, combined with the deep nature of their bench, will be more than enough to win the series and allow them to take home their second title in franchise history.\n\nRelated: Why the Boston Celtics Will Win the 2024 NBA Finals\n\nRelated Jason Kidd Told Mavericks to 'Go Get' Kyrie Irving After Hearing of Trade

Despite a combined 26 NBA Finals appearances between the two teams, this is the first time the Celtics and Mavericks will meet on the league's biggest stage.\n\nGame 1 of the 2024 NBA Finals will tip off at 7:30 p.m. CT on Thursday, June 6. TD Garden in Boston, Massachusetts will play host to the first two games of the series after Boston finished the regular season with a better record (64-18).

Boston Celtics vs. Dallas Mavericks NBA Finals preview\n\nDraftKings Sportsbook lists the Celtics as unsurprising favorites to win their first ring since 2008. Boston is -210 to win the NBA Finals, meaning interested bettors would have to wager $210 to return a profit of $100.\n\nBetting on Dallas comes with a risk, but Jason Kidd's team has continued to win as an underdog during the NBA Playoffs. The Mavericks are currently trading at 7/4 (+175) to win their first NBA Finals since 2011.\n\nThese teams have put together awe-inspiring postseason runs. They've posted a combined record of 24-7 through three rounds. Thus, it's no surprise that oddsmakers expect this series to go deep. Over 5.5 total games in the series is heavily juiced (-156). The under provides some value at +135 for those who feel strongly about either team's chances to dominate the series.\n\nThe time off for each team heading into the NBA Finals could be the difference. Dallas comes into the series on six days' rest, which has given key players like Luka Doncic and Dereck Lively II time to heal from nagging injuries. Meanwhile, Boston's nine off days were enough for Kristaps Porzingis to come back after a lengthy stint on the sidelines.\n\nThe individual everyone will be talking about, though, is Kyrie Irving. Dallas' superstar guard returns to the place he spent two seasons in from 2017 to 2019. Boston fans will be foaming at the mouth at the opportunity to berate Irving with boos, how will the eight-time All-Star respond? His over/under for Game 1 is set at 23.5 points at DraftKings Sportsbook with a slight lean (-118) to the over.\n\nThe Celtics are favored in Game 1 by 6.5 points. The hosts are -230 moneyline, the visitors are +190 to play spoiler and the total is set at 214.5 points.\n\nHere is the schedule for the NBA Finals (all games on ABC):\n\nCeltics-Mavericks 2024 NBA

Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward were coming back healthy the following season. Head coach Brad Stevens seemed to get every last drop of potential out of whatever roster he was bestowed. So even amid the obvious sting of that playoff defeat, there was an undeniable optimism about what lied ahead.\n\n\"When it ends, it's painful. That is part of the path,\" Stevens said that night. \"And so we have to let it motivate us.\"\n\nBut in that moment, no one could have known just how much pain was ahead, or just how long it would take for the Celtics to truly shuffle closer to completing its title quest.\n\nNothing is promised in the NBA. Optimism turns to uncertainty in the bounce of a ball. Pain has been part of Boston's path for 2,202 days. But, over the next 18 days, Boston has a chance to erase a lot of bad memories.\n\nAs the Celtics tip off Game 1 of the NBA Finals by hosting the Dallas Mavericks on Thursday night at TD Garden, Banner 18 is within their grasp.\n\nSeven-hundred and twenty-one days ago, the pain crescendoed for the core of this Celtics team.\n\nAnother magical playoff run delivered this team to the 2022 Finals stage. Boston had been minutes away from taking a 3-1 series lead over the vaunted Golden State Warriors. Instead, they were watching that same opponent celebrate a six-game triumph on the Garden floor.\n\nEven with Tatum and Brown blossoming into All-Star talents, the Celtics ran out of a gas after navigating a grueling playoff run. Four years after optimism tempered that Game 7 loss to the Cavaliers, the uncertainty of how long it would take to get back to the title stage hovered as Boston digested not being able to get over the last hump.\n\n\"We know what it feels like to get to this point,\" Tatum said after the Game 6 loss to Golden State. \"Getting here and not accomplishing it, it's tough. You don't want to feel like this again but you want to get back here.\"\n\nThe Celtics should have known that nothing is promised in the NBA.\n\nIn the aftermath of that 2018 playoff run, the wheels came flying off the Celtics' car during an utterly miserable 2019 season. Kyrie Irving, entering a contract year, declared his intentions to re-sign in Boston before the start of the 2018-19 campaign then sulked his way through a season in which it became clear he was gone. No one on a talent-gushing Celtics roster was willing to sacrifice individual stats for the betterment of the team.\n\nAfter an unceremonious second-round exit, Irving rushed to join Kevin Durant in Brooklyn. Al Horford chased a payday to join rival Philly. The Celtics were left to pick up the pieces with a very uncertain path forward.\n\nThe ascension of Tatum and Brown ensured the team stayed afloat. Heck, the Celtics nearly surged to the Finals amid the Bubble weirdness of the 2020 playoffs. But a first-round playoff exit at the hands of Irving and the Nets in 2021 made it feel like Banner 18 had never been further away.\n\nOne thousand, one hundred days ago, the Celtics enacted Phase 1 of an organizational shakeup aimed at putting the team back on a title track.\n\nOn a sleepy Wednesday morning, the day after the team's season ended in Brooklyn, the Celtics announced that Danny Ainge would be retiring and, more shockingly, Stevens would elevate from coach to general manager.\n\nIt's easy to forget now given all the bold moves that Stevens has made to reconstruct a title contender, but there was uncertainty about whether he could thrive as team architect. Would Stevens be able to make bold moves, particularly given the relationship he had forged with his players as head coach?\n\nThat question got a quick answer when he dealt beloved guard Kemba Walker to Oklahoma City to bring back Al Horford in his first days on the job. Stevens hired Ime Udoka as his replacement as Celtics coach and Udoka's tough love seemed to fuel this team in a way that Stevens' voice no longer could.\n\nDespite some bumps in the road, the Celtics' leaned into a defensive identity late in the 2021-22 season and embarked on a furious second-half run that would deliver them all the way to the Finals stage.\n\nEven in defeat, it didn't feel like it would be long before Boston might be back in the title round. But nothing is promised.\n\nUdoka was dismissed from the team of the eve of the 2022-23 season, unheralded back-row assistant Joe Mazzulla was promoted in his place, and a cloud hovered over the Celtics as they embarked on a quest to get back to the Finals.\n\nIt took a little longer than they might have liked, but Boston is here now. And the next 18 days could change just how we look back at all the crazy twists and turns of the previous 2,202 days.\n\nFive days ago, Tatum sat at the podium in the Auerbach Center pondering Boston's return to the Finals.\n\n\"You don't always get a second chance,\" said Tatum.\n\nUnlike all those playoff series that Boston entered as the feisty underdog, the Celtics will tip off the 2024 Finals as heavy favorites to secure Banner 18. There's a pressure present that wasn't there in 2022. But there's also an experience that might better position the team to get to the finish line of its long title quest.\n\nOver these past 2,202 days, the Celtics have experienced all of the emotions. Individually, there have been extreme highs. Tatum and Brown have further evolved into All-NBA players and are reaping the rewards. Brown signed the richest contract in NBA history last summer and Tatum should sign a big-money pact this offseason.\n\nBoth players have learned that none of their individual accolades matter unless you raise a banner. When you play in Boston, it's not about the stat lines you produce and the awards you secure, but the Larry O'Brien Trophies you add to the collection.\n\nIt doesn't feel like a stretch to suggest that, if Tatum and Brown get to the finish line of this title hunt, their legacies will forever change in Boston. If they put an 18th title banner in the rafters, they might as well start sewing another banner that houses retired numbers, because both 0 and 7 will be trending toward going skyward.\n\nThat they have to go through Irving, whose absence was conspicuous on the Boston bench in Game 7 of that 2018 loss, only brings this story that much more full circle.\n\nOf course, Tatum and Brown will not go this alone. Stevens, in Phase 2 of this team's recent overhaul, made two bold decisions to acquire Kristaps Porzingis and NBA champion Jrue Holiday. It meant dealing away core pieces in Marcus Smart and Robert Williams III. But the moves undeniably made Boston a more dynamic team with a higher ceiling. That much has been proven as the Celtics have compiled a 76-20 record since the start of the regular season.\n\nA convincing Finals triumph would position Boston as one of the most dominant teams in NBA history. Quibble about the strength of opposition on this postseason journey, but Boston has flexed on all comers this season.\n\nNo one could have possibly seen all the twists and turns that have occurred since that 2018 loss in the East Finals. There has been a lot more strife than anyone could reasonably expect on the quest to add to Boston's banner collection.\n\nBut the opportunity is there again. Banner 18 has never felt closer. And yet the Celtics know all too well that nothing is promised. There is work to do.\n\nEverything over the past 2,202 days has built to this moment. The path has been bumpy and there have been a lot of painful detours along the way.\n\nAll of which might just make it that much more satisfying if the Celtics are able to complete this journey. Pain was part of the path but an indescribable joy might wait at the finish line.", "source": {"uri": "nbcsportsboston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports Boston"}, "authors": [],

After eight grueling months of regular season and postseason action, the NBA Finals are upon us, and it will either be the Boston Celtics (as expected) or the Dallas Mavericks (whoa!) who will be hoisting the Larry O'Brien Trophy within the next two and a half weeks. Since the offseason, Boston has been penciled in as the Eastern Conference favorite, and from the opening night of the season through the conclusion of the Eastern Conference Finals, they've looked the part.\n\nMeanwhile, the run made by their Western Conference counterpart was significantly more unexpected. The Dallas Mavericks were in 8th place in the Western Conference at the NBA Trade Deadline when they made two moves on the fringes that have since reinvented their team. The additions of PJ Washington and Daniel Gafford, coupled with the increased comfort that Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving have gained playing with one another for a full season now, propelled Dallas to a 24-9 record in their final 33 regular season games, and a 12-5 record in the postseason. A .720 winning percentage stretched out over an 82 game season is a 59-win pace, which would've amounted to the conference's best record.\n\nBut make no mistake, the Dallas Mavericks are the underdog heading into the series for good reason. Boston has been historically great all year long, and their championship window will never be more open than it is right now. Yet analysts around the NBA are giving Dallas more than just a puncher's chance to win the series. At ESPN, nine of the seventeen reporters polled picked Dallas to win the series.\n\nSo what can we expect from the 2024 NBA Finals? Well, here are five bold predictions for the Dallas Mavericks as they look to capture their second NBA Title in franchise history.\n\nMavericks guard Kyrie Irving will have one big game in Boston\n\nIt is well-documented how Boston fans feel about Kyrie Irving, and Kyrie Irving has made it clear how he feels about Boston. But this time around, with the stakes as high as they are, I don't expect Kyrie to lose his cool, as he has in the past. Instead, I'm expecting a zenned-out Kyrie Irving to maintain his composure throughout the NBA Finals, and continue to give Dallas everything they need from him, whether it be facilitation, spot-up shooting, or defense, which once upon a time was not a Kyrie Irving calling-card.\n\nBut at some point in this series, and I think it'll be in Boston, Kyrie is going to go supernova against the Celtics. Yes, Boston has capable defenders in Derrick White and Jrue Holiday to throw at him, but the NBA Playoffs have shown us that great offense will almost always beat great defense, and when Kyrie Irving gets it going, there are very few players on the planet who make it look as easy -- or as beautiful -- as Kyrie Irving does.\n\nMavericks center Maxi Kleber will have a moment too\n\nAfter missing a considerable chunk of the Mavericks postseason run due to a third-degree dislocation of the AC Joint in his right shoulder, Maxi Kleber was able to return to the court and give Dallas 22 minutes of action combined in Game's 4 and 5 against the Minnesota Timberwolves in the Western Conference Finals. Where Kleber fits in with Dereck Lively II and Daniel Gafford within the Mavericks rotation of bigs remains to be seen, but my gut tells me that Maxi's minutes may be on the rise heading into the NBA Finals.\n\nDefensively, Kleber has been trusted in the past to serve as Jayson Tatum's primary defender in Mavericks matchups versus the Celtics. Additionally, with Dallas likely to switch just about everything on the perimeter against Boston, Kleber is their most switchable big by far. Lively will be fine on an island against wings and guards, but this might be a series that Gafford finds himself in trouble. If Gafford sees his minutes cut, Kleber could be the beneficiary.\n\nOn the other end of the floor, Kleber represents the only floor-spacing big that the Mavericks have on their roster, and Dallas head coach Jason Kidd has seen Kleber shine in the postseason in the past. During the Mavericks' run to the Western Conference Finals, Kleber averaged nearly 9 points and 5 rebounds per game, and he shot 44 percent from three-point range. For his career, he's a 36 percent shooter, and with all of the attention that Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving will draw, that could leave Kleber open to feast on open threes.\n\nThe Mavericks will play all non-Al Horford Celtics bench players out of the series\n\nThis just ain't the series for Payton Pritchard, Luke Kornet or Sam Houser... a triad of Celtics reserves who will be hunted relentlessly if they step on the floor at any point in the NBA Finals.\n\nLuka Doncic will crack the top three in NBA Finals scoring\n\nFor clarification, we're talking total points and not points per game, though it wouldn't be the most surprising outcome in the world if Doncic pushed for both. But because I'm expecting a long NBA Finals series, that means the total points record could be in jeopardy.\n\nElgin Baylor and Jerry West, a pair of Lakers legends, will continue to occupy the top spots, with 284 and 268 points respectively, but I think Luka finishes with somewhere around 250 points, which would put him 3rd place all-time in total points in a Finals series. 250 points -- four points ahead of Michael Jordan's total in the 1993 NBA Finals -- comes out to 35.7 points per game, for those of you who don't have a calculator handy. So it's not as if this is unheard for Doncic, who in his postseason career averages 31.7 points per game.\n\nNow, this is potentially contingent on how Boston chooses to defend Luka Doncic. Surely, Celtics head coach Joe Mazzulla will throw a number of looks Luka's way, but predominantly, Boston chooses to play drop coverage and tends not to double ball handlers in pick and rolls. If Boston doesn't regularly take the ball out of Doncic's hands, he'll feast. There's just no way around it. And if they force it out, then Dallas will have plenty of 4-on-3's to potentially punish Boston on the back end. There's no good answer really, which makes me think Boston will do mostly what they're comfortable with, and that could allow Luka to put up massive scoring numbers.\n\nThe Dallas Mavericks will win the NBA Finals\n\nI came into the week feeling like I was picking Boston, and as recently as last night, I had shared with others that my pick was Boston in 7. But then I got to thinking about the Luka Doncic/Kyrie Irving partnership. I got to thinking about how dangerous it felt to pick against Luka Doncic when the lights are shining bright. I thought about Kyrie Irving's performance in the 2016 NBA Finals. I thought about the Boston Celtics' recent postseason home struggles. And then I thought about Luka Doncic again.\n\nI had to pivot. I'm going Dallas in 7 games, because it feels icky to pick against Luka and Kyrie in a 7th game, no matter where it's played. Maybe I'll regret this. Maybe Boston, who has been historically great all season long, is due to finally win the title after making the Conference Finals six times in the last eight seasons. Or maybe these two teams are more even than we realize, and if that's the case, then picking the team with the best player in the series is actually not so bold at all.", "source": {"uri":

If you've been once, you'll continue to keep going,\" Tatum said. \"We realized that last year. We kind of took it for granted at certain moments.\"\n\nAnd now?\n\n\"I'm not thinking about what it would mean for my legacy or anything like that,\" he said. \"Just excited to play some basketball ... and go out there and try to get the job done.\"\n\nDallas' Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving see it as their first opportunity to make good on a partnership that began late last season, after Irving was traded from Brooklyn following a tumultuous run of two-plus seasons with the Nets.\n\nBut the duo was still learning to play with each other during their truncated time together last season and didn't make it to the postseason. After a slow start this season, they found cohesion following the all-star break and emerged from a deep Western Conference field.\n\nFor Irving, it has been a reminder that success can be fleeting. He won his lone championship with Cleveland in 2016 and has played with three teams over the past eight years. His time in Dallas has reinvigorated him.\n\n\"These young guys are very hungry. They want a championship. I want a championship,\" he said. \"So, our feelings are very mutual. But I've always reminded them that this is a process. Failure is going to be part of this, too. Get it out your mind that this is about to be a clean sweep, or everything is about to feel good throughout this journey and all that.\n\n\"I'm just very real, very honest. That's what's helped me grow as a leader.\"\n\nDoncic credits the partnership with Irving for uncorking the potential of a team that entered the postseason as a fifth seed.\n\n\"His leadership is amazing,\" Doncic said. \"The way he connects us. I think me and Kyrie are the leaders of this team, but he's the one that's been in the Finals. He's the one that won in the Finals. He's the one that is really leading it.\"\n\nThey'll match up with a Boston team playing like a group that has learned from its recent shortcomings. That was exhibited during a 64-win regular season that established the Celtics as favorites to raise the franchise's 18th championship banner.\n\nThrough the first three rounds, the Celtics have met the challenge, losing just two games along the way under the guidance of second-year Coach Joe Mazzulla.\n\nThey've also benefited from an offseason shakeup of the roster that saw longtime emotional leader Marcus Smart and former NBA Sixth Man of the Year Malcolm Brogdon traded in favor of 7-footer Kristaps Porzingis and Jrue Holiday, who won a championship with Milwaukee in 2021.\n\nBrown said a core that features seven players from the 2022 team that lost in the Finals to Golden State is up to the challenge.\n\nHe has experienced lows, such as losing back-to-back trips to the Finals as a player with the New Jersey Nets in 2002 and 2003. He has also seen success, earning his lone title as a player with Dallas in 2011 at age 38, and one as an assistant on the Los Angeles Lakers' 2020 championship team.\n\nThe biggest lesson he has taken away is to approach it like business and be ready to live with the results. That has been his message to his team throughout these playoffs.\n\n\"This is the best of the best at the highest level,\" Mr. Kidd said. \"It's fun. That's what the Finals are all about, is seeing what team is going to step forward and take advantage of mistakes.\"\n\nMr. Mazzulla was an assistant on Ime Udoka's staff in 2022. What he learned from that experience is that the details of winning never change, even on this stage.\n\nCeltics fans haven't held a high opinion of him since he ended two disappointing seasons in Boston by leaving for the Nets and joining Kevin Durant in free agency in 2019.\n\nHe then rankled the Boston faithful even more when he flipped his middle finger at fans after making a shot during Brooklyn's first-round playoff series loss to the Celtics in 2022. But he said he is looking forward to matching up with \"brothers\" and former teammates Tatum and Brown.\n\n\"They've gotten tremendously better. They've led their team to this point. So, I'm proud of them,\" Irving said. \"I'm looking forward to the competition because this is what we've all strived for since we were kids, basketball at this level, playing against the best of the best.\"", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type":

TV schedule, channel to watch Celtics vs. Mavericks Game 1", "body": "At long last, the wait is over. The championship matchup between the Celtics and Mavericks is here.\n\nBoston is back in the NBA Finals for the second time in three seasons, having ripped through the Eastern Conference with relative ease. The Celtics have lost just twice in this year's playoffs, and they swept the Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nTheir success has come without Kristaps Porzingis, as the 7-2 center has missed the last five weeks with a right calf strain. But Porzingis is expected to rejoin the rotation for Game 1, sliding into a formidable lineup already boasting Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown.\n\nDallas tore through the Western Conference en route to the franchise's first appearance in the NBA Finals since 2011. Its tantalizing one-two punch of Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving has caused fits for opposing defenses, particularly late in games. And storylines abound with Irving, who spent two successful yet tumultuous years with Boston earlier in his career.\n\nHere is everything you need to know about the 2024 NBA Finals, including the tipoff time for Game 1 between the Celtics and Mavericks.\n\nGame 1 of the NBA Finals will tip off around 8:30 p.m. ET on Thursday, June 6. The game will be played at TD Garden in Boston.\n\nGame 1 of the 2024 NBA Finals will air nationally on ABC. Mike Breen (play-by-play), Doris Burke (color analyst) and JJ Redick (color analyst) will have the call, with Lisa Salters serving as the sideline reporter.

That's what happens when you win 12 playoff games and have enough success to secure a trip to the NBA Finals.\n\nOdds are whichever team wins a championship will have to master the art of the comeback at least once.\n\nThe Celtics know all about that, as they rallied to overcome a double-digit deficit in Game 1 of the Finals in 2022, outscoring the Warriors 40-16 in the fourth quarter. They also put together a masterful comeback in Game 4 of the 2008 NBA Finals, which set the stage for a championship.\n\nThe Mavericks, meanwhile, are arguably the more battle-tested team in the series, having played numerous close games between their playoff meetings with the Thunder and Timberwolves. Dallas has risen to the occasion in high-pressure moments, and that experience could be meaningful if the Mavericks find themselves trailing against a Celtics team that has been here before.\n\nHere's a look at the biggest comebacks in NBA Finals history, from the 1971 Bucks to the 2008 Celtics.\n\nMORE: Why the Celtics need a healthy Kristaps Porzingis to win NBA Finals\n\nThe Celtics' 24-point comeback over the Lakers in Game 4 of the 2008 NBA Finals is the largest Finals comeback in the past five decades. Elias Sports Bureau reported at the time that the comeback was the largest in the NBA Finals since 1971, when the Bucks swept the Baltimore Bullets, but the exact details of the comeback aren't known due to less complete record-keeping at the time.\n\nGame 4 of the 2008 Finals is one that might still linger in the minds of Lakers fans, though winning back-to-back championships in 2009 and 2010 undoubtedly erased some of the pain.\n\nThe Lakers led 45-21 in the second quarter of Game 4 and still held an 18-point advantage at halftime. The second half was an offensive nightmare for Los Angeles, who scored just 33 points and was badly outplayed by Boston. The Celtics outscored the Lakers by 24 in the second half, winning 97-91 on the road to take a 3-1 series lead.\n\nIt was a balanced effort by the Celtics, who had five players score in double figures and were led by Paul Pierce's 20 points. Kobe Bryant shot just 6-of-19 in the Lakers' loss, and it didn't help matters that their bench was just 5-of-21 from the field.\n\nThe Lakers would win Game 5 to force another game back at TD Garden, but Game 6 was a 39-point destruction that put the Celtics back on top of the basketball world.\n\nMORE: Ranking the best players in the 2024 NBA Finals\n\nHistory tells you to expect a double-digit comeback in the 2024 NBA Finals.\n\nThe Heat overcame a 13-point deficit in their lone win over the Nuggets in last year's NBA Finals, while the Celtics trailed by as much as 15 in their Game 1 win over the Warriors in 2022. The Bucks entered the second quarter of Game 5 in 2021 down by 16 before coming back to win. Both the Warriors and Raptors completed double-digit comebacks during the 2019 Finals.\n\nOf course, some late-game comebacks that don't match the Celtics' 24-point resurgence or even the Bucks' 16-point recovery are just as impressive.

Boston's most recent title came in 2008.\n\nThe Mavericks won their only NBA title in 2011 after reaching the 2006 final, losing to Miami.\n\nIrving will be the emotional heart of the series after his Boston stay and a playoff return with Brooklyn that went poorly.\n\n\"I'm better at consolidating the emotions now,\" Irving said. \"You call it animosity. We call it hate. We call it, 'It's going to be hell in Boston.'\"\n\n\"The last time in Boston (in the playoffs with Brooklyn), I don't think that was the best... everyone saw me flip off the birds and kind of lose my (cool) a little bit.\n\n\"I wasn't my best self at that time. I've been able to grow since then... I'm looking forward to it. I'll take the brunt of it, all the yells and all the remarks.\n\n- 'No stopping them' -\n\n\"That wasn't a great reflection of who I am and how I like to compete on a high level.\"\n\nHe's on a high now, averaging 22.8 points in the playoffs as Slovenian guard Doncic, who averaged 33 points in the regular season, averages 28.8 points, 9.6 rebounds and 8.8 assists in the playoffs.\n\nBoston counters with two of the NBA's top defensive guards in Jrue Holiday and Derrick White.\n\n\"There's really no stopping them. You just try to make it difficult for them,\" White said. \"They're going to take tough shots and they're going to make tough shots. Just trust that over 48 minutes what we're doing is going to work.\"\n\nTatum averages 26.0 points and 10.4 rebounds in the playoffs with Brown averages 25.0 points with White and Holiday providing strong support and the team leading the NBA in 3-point shots and baskets. The Celtics are 9-0 when hitting 14 or more three-pointers.\n\n\"Boston shoots the three at a high rate,\" Mavs coach Jason Kidd said. \"They have a lot of talented players. They've been here before, they have the experience. They're well-coached. This is another great test.\"\n\nDallas center Dereck Lively isn't sweating the experience factor.\n\n\"They have a lot of tradition, but that doesn't matter. What matters is who's going to go harder on the court,\" Lively said. \"It's going to be a dogfight out there, but we're going to keep swinging and see what happens.\"\n\nBoston, which defeated the Mavericks in both meetings this season, expects to have Latvian center Kristaps Porzingis back from a right calf strain suffered on April 29 in the first round against Miami that benched him for 10 games.\n\n\"He has been working extremely hard just to get back and to help us in any way he can,\" White said.\n\n\"When KP is at his best, he has been tremendous for us,\" Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said. \"We expect that from him.\"\n\njs/rcw\n\nMore from this section\n\nFive Dynamic Divas Building Digital Dynasties Bring the Drama in New Reality Series 'First Ladies of the Crypto

Even without big man Kristaps Porzingis for much of the postseason, the Celtics have gone 12-2 against the Eastern Conference's top teams. The Dallas Mavericks are a different animal though. Luka Doncic has been absolutely dominant in these playoffs, to the tune of 28.8 points per game, 9.6 rebounds, and 8.8 assists.\n\nThe Celtics have not had to face a player that dominant yet, and in basketball, the best player on the court can sometimes make all the difference.

But the X-factor is Kristaps Porzingis. If he can give them anything after coming back from a 10-game absence because of a calf injury, the Celtics should hoist banner No. 18, because they are just too deep and too good.\"\n\nBrad Botkin, CBS Sports: Mavericks in 7\n\nBotkin writes, \"I'm riding the Luka and Kyrie train. I can't help it. I don't know if I'm a prisoner of the moment, but this is going to be a tight series full of tight games and I simply trust these two to close games out in a way I don't trust the Celtics collectively. I won't argue with anyone who disagrees with me on this pick. This is a coin flip. But I just can't get past the greatness of Luka and Kyrie and the legitimacy of this Mavs defense with Daniel Gafford and Dereck Lively II at the rim.\"\n\nSam Panayotovich, FOX Sports: Celtics to win NBA Finals\n\nPanayotovich writes, \"This price is as high as -230 in Las Vegas and DraftKings is currently dealing the floor at -210. Please get the best number. I'm far from the biggest C's fan, but the Green Teamers would've been -400 or higher against Dallas before the postseason started. This is just too cheap, and you get the deeper and more complete team.

Since Gafford's first start in Dallas on March 7, only the Celtics have a better record than the Mavs (28-9).\n\nThat said, the Celtics will enter this series as heavy favorites after an NBA-best 64-18 regular-season record and a 12-2 record this postseason. Big man Kristaps Porzingis is expected to play in Game 1 after missing the team's previous 10 playoff games and should give Boston an immediate boost on both ends of the floor.\n\nSo, how will this series play out? We asked our partners at Strat-O-Matic -- who accurately predicted the Celtics' regular-season record down to the exact game -- to simulate the 2024 NBA Finals, with detailed box scores and recaps for every game.\n\nHere are the full game-by-game results of the simulation, followed by detailed player stats for the series:\n\nGame 1: Celtics 135, Mavs 127\n\nKristaps Porzingis comes out firing in his first game action since April 29, hitting a pair of 3-pointers early in the first quarter to help Boston open up a double-digit lead.\n\nThe Celtics expand their lead to as many as 17 points, but the Mavs surge back behind a barrage of buckets from Doncic and Irving and take the lead early in the fourth quarter on a Derrick Jones Jr. 3-pointer.\n\nBoston delivers with the game on the line, however, scoring the final 14 points of the contest -- including a dagger Porzingis 3-pointer with 40 seconds remaining -- to clinch a Game 1 win.\n\nPorzingis finishes with 21 points while Tatum and Brown combine for 61 points (36 and 25, respectively) to survive brilliant performances from both Doncic (38 points, 15 rebounds and five assists) and Irving (31 points and eight assists).\n\nGame 2: Celtics 128, Mavs 124\n\nCeltics fans get some early-playoff Game 2 flashbacks in this one, as the Mavs race out to a 10-point lead midway through the second quarter. But Jrue Holiday helps settle the C's down with eight straight points near the end of the first half, and Derrick White's 3-pointer helps Boston enter the break with a two-point lead.\n\nThe Celtics hold a two-point lead with under five minutes remaining when Tatum converts layups on consecutive possessions to put his team up by six. Dallas gets no closer than five until the closing seconds, as Boston earns another crunch-time victory to take a 2-0 series lead.\n\nTatum (34 points) and Holiday (24 points) pace the Celtics, while Doncic (35) and Irving (31) again are a two-man show for Dallas.\n\nGame 3: Mavs 115, Celtics 108\n\nThe Celtics hold their own early in Game 3 as the series swings to Dallas, taking a six-point lead into halftime. But the Mavs respond with a 38-point third quarter and add 30 more in the fourth, ripping off a 19-7 run down the stretch that balloons their lead to as many as 13 points with four minutes remaining.\n\nBoston has no answer for Doncic -- who goes off for a series-high 43 points, nine rebounds and 10 assists -- while Irving chips in 24. Brown is the Celtics' high scorer at 27 points and Porzingis adds 22, but Tatum is limited to 21 points on just 14 shots.\n\nGame 4: Celtics 118, Mavs 103\n\nThe Mavs surge to a 12-point first-quarter lead and appear poised to tie the series at 2-2 heading back to Boston. But the Celtics deliver a strong response, limiting Dallas to just 13 points in the second quarter and taking a double-digit lead of their own in the third quarter.\n\nThe Jays do their thing -- 26 points from Brown and 24 from Tatum -- and Derrick White steps up with 20 points on four made 3-pointers, but it's Boston's defense that wins this game. Doncic makes just 10 of 25 shots for a series-low 26 points and commits three turnovers as the Celtics take a decisive 3-1 series lead with the chance to secure Banner 18 in Boston.\n\nThe Mavs keep it close for two quarters before the Celtics send TD Garden into a frenzy with a 14-0 run late in the third that gives them a 94-77 lead. Boston's defense once again leads the charge, limiting Dallas to just 38 second-half points while forcing a total of 20 Mavs turnovers.\n\nOn offense, Brown delivers 31 points on 60 percent shooting (12 of 20), while Tatum (27), White (23) and Porzingis (21) all top 20 points in a fitting end to a dominant season for the Celtics.\n\nTwo years after watching the Golden State Warriors celebrate the 2022 championship on their own floor, the C's get sweet redemption and kick off a Garden Party by securing their NBA-record 18th title in franchise history.", "source": {"uri": "nbcsportsboston.com",

Odds, prediction, betting advice for championship series most valuable player", "body": "The 2024 NBA Finals between the Celtics and Mavericks tip off Thursday, June 6, with Boston favored to win its 18th title and hoist a new banner into the TD Garden rafters.\n\nNot surprisingly, the most popular futures wager right now is \"NBA Finals champion.\" However, the NBA Finals MVP always serves as a fun alternative for bettors, a market that often yields better value than betting on the winning team.\n\nLet's dive into BetMGM and analyze the NBA Finals MVP odds, then make our prediction and determine which Celtics and Mavs players yield the most value relative to their odds.\n\nMany sharp bettors view a bet on Tatum to win Finals MVP as a far wiser pre-series choice than betting the Celtics -225 to win the championship.\n\nJT has been long considered Boston's team MVP, he earned All-NBA First Team honors this season, and he's coming off an Eastern Conference Finals performance against Indiana that many believe should have landed him a second Larry Bird Trophy for ECF MVP.\n\nJaylen Brown ultimately won that award, and even JB looked a little shocked when his name was announced. Anyone who bet Tatum to win the award was probably shocked, too -- just look at the two stars' ECF stat averages side by side:\n\nA big part of Brown winning over Tatum was probably due to the huge Game 1 buzzer-beater three he hit to force overtime -- Indy had control of that game, and Brown turned the tables and allowed Boston to win that game in OT and then mount the sweep. Brown also shot better all series, from the floor and 3-point range. But beyond that, JT had far better stats across the four-game series,\n\nAs noted, Tatum has an Eastern Conference Finals MVP already -- he won that in 2022 when the Celts beat the Heat and went on to play the Warriors in the Finals. But the superstar forward has never won a Finals or a Finals MVP, and he could be in line for a market correction or \"make-up\" award if Boston prevails as champs (much like a make-up call after a ref messes up on a foul).\n\nTatum has emerged as a true leader for the Celtics and seems more focused than ever on winning it all. He also seems to care much less about individual awards than ever before, ironically improving the stars' chances of winning. And he's doing all the little things, like crashing the boards, playmaking for others, and playing defense.\n\nTatum's friend and idol Kobe Bryant, one of the winningest superstars in NBA history, had five rings and two Finals MVP trophies. It's hard not to think about that storyline as we head into the Finals, where it seems like it could very well finally be Tatum and the Celtics' time for glory.\n\nMORE: Finals results for All-NBA First, Second &amp; Third Teams\n\nOf course, Doncic at +200 odds to win Finals MVP after looking like the best player in the world all postseason seems like strong value. And if you like the Mavs to win the Finals, you're far better off wagering on Doncic +200 to win MVP than Dallas +180 to win it all.\n\nLuka was one of three MVP finalists at the end of the regular season, and he's easily the highest-scoring player in the playoffs. He was a unanimous selection to win the Magic Johnson trophy -- aka the Western Conference Finals MVP -- after he dominated the Timberwolves. And if the Mavs beat the Celtics despite Boston having home-court advantage, Doncic will almost certainly be the primary catalyst.\n\nDoncic is effortlessly dominant. He's the best scorer and passer in this series, and he has been so damn good that one even wonders if he could receive consideration to win this award even if Dallas loses. That is a long shot, but he's one of the only players in the NBA who could at least initiate such a conversation against a complete team like the Celtics.\n\nOther strong value picks: Kyrie Irving (+1800), Jaylen Brown (+625)\n\nWhen the ESPN broadcast of the series-clinching Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Finals concluded, Derrick White was left standing in the middle of the court as the only core rotation member of the Celtics who had not been interviewed. The dude hit the game winner of the closeout game and played arguably the best perimeter defense in the first three rounds of the postseason!\n\nIt's okay, though, because DWhite has been overlooked his entire career and he seems to find extra motivation every time it happens. Don't be surprised if White serves as a massive x-factor in this Finals and comes up with key blocks, steals, or three-pointers, then comes away with Finals MVP after the Jays cancel each other out.\n\nRemember, Andre Iguodala won Finals MVP over Steph Curry and Klay Thompson in 2015 after the Warriors won 67 regular-season games and went 16-5 in the playoffs.

They've now broken through to the championship round twice in the last three years.\n\nJaylen Brown's been there for all of it. Jayson Tatum has starred alongside him in five of those playoff runs. So has Al Horford, who left after the tumultuous 2018-19 campaign that ended his and Kyrie Irving's tenure in Boston before the former returned to help the C's reach the NBA Finals in 2022.\n\nThere's a championship standard that the franchise with 17 NBA titles in its trophy case and the city they star in hold. However, their success deserves its just due.\n\nWhen asked to reflect on the legacy of the Celtics' core, whose success Marcus Smart and Robert Williams played integral roles in before Boston's bold decisions to reconfigure its roster, striking deals for Kristaps Porzingis and Jrue Holiday, Jaylen Brown expressed, \"I think this is a special group. I really do.\"\n\nThe three-time All-Star continued, \"The core group of it has been here for a few years now. We've been able to go through the experiences of having success but not having success at the same time. I think to solidify the ultimate goal is to get over the hump and win.

It will be the 23rd Finals appearance for the Celtics and the 18th in which they've had homecourt advantage.\n\nThe C's are 15-2 in NBA Finals series when they've had homecourt advantage. Boston is 15-7 all time in Game 1 of the Finals, including a 13-4 record at home.\n\nThe Celtics have won five of their last six Game 1s of the Finals at home, and four of those five victories were by 10-plus points.\n\nThese series-opening games have produced many memorable moments and performances.\n\nLet's take a look at the best ones.\n\nThe Celtics defeated the St. Louis Hawks 140-122 with a total team effort. Four Celtics players -- Tom Heinsohn (24), Bill Sharman (23), Frank Ramsey (21) and Bob Cousy (20) -- scored 20 or more points. Boston's 140 points is the fifth-most in a Finals game.\n\nBoston won the series in seven games to claim back-to-back titles for the first time.\n\nThe Celtics earned a 117-114 win to begin the series thanks to Bill Russell, who scored 25 points and grabbed 29 rebounds in 47 minutes. Sam Jones led the Celtics with 29 points, while also tallying 15 rebounds and seven assists. Boston won the first two matchups against the Lakers at home and ultimately won the series in six games.\n\nCeltics star John Havlicek scored 37 points with 12 rebounds in Game 1 of the 1969 Finals in Los Angeles, but the rival Lakers emerged with a 120-118 win thanks to Jerry West. The Hall of Fame guard scored 53 points -- the most ever in Game 1 of the Finals and the fourth-highest in any Finals game.\n\nThe Celtics beat the Suns 98-87 on the strength of Hall of Fame center Dave Cowens, who posted a triple-double with 25 points, 21 rebounds and 10 assists. He also played all 48 minutes. Jo Jo White, who ended up winning Finals MVP, scored 22 points in the Game 1 victory. Boston won the series in six games, including a triple-overtime win in Game 5 at the old Garden.\n\nLarry Bird's first Finals game was a memorable one. It produced one of the most iconic plays in playoff history in the fourth quarter when Bird followed his own shot, jumped for the rebound and scored from a crazy angle along the baseline. It has been a staple of Finals highlight reels ever since.\n\nThe Celtics won the series in six games.\n\nThe Celtics opened the Finals with a near-perfect performance, beating the rival Lakers 148-114. Boston's 148 points are the most ever by a team in a Finals game.\n\nFive players scored at least 19 points for the Celtics, including Scott Wedman off the bench. He scored 26 points on a perfect 11-for-11 shooting (4-for-4 from 3-point range).\n\nUnfortunately for the Celtics, this was their only home win of the series. The Lakers took Game 2 and eventually won the title with a Game 6 victory in Boston, becoming the first visiting team ever to clinch a championship at the old Garden.\n\nThe Celtics beat the Rockets 112-100 led by a remarkable outing from their starting five. All five Boston starters scored at least 18 points, led by Robert Parish's 23. Larry Bird scored 21 points with 13 assists, eight rebounds and four steals. Dennis Johnson chipped in 19 points with 11 rebounds, eight assists and four steals.\n\nThe Celtics won all three home games in the series, including a championship-clinching rout in Game 6.\n\nThis matchup was the Celtics' first Finals home game since Game 5 in 1987.\n\nCeltics forward Paul Pierce appeared to injure his knee with 6:55 left in the third quarter and the Lakers up 62-58. He was taken to the locker room in a wheelchair, but he returned after a short absence and hit a couple 3-pointers late in the third quarter to give the Celtics a lead they would protect the rest of the game. Pierce finished with 22 points, 19 of which came in the second half.\n\nKevin Garnett scored a team-high 24 points, including a massive put-back dunk over Pau Gasol with 1:34 left in the fourth quarter that brought the Garden crowd to its feet and sealed the win.\n\nThe Celtics won the series in six games for their first championship in 22 years.\n\nThe Celtics needed an epic comeback to win their first Finals game in 12 years, and that's exactly what unfolded. The C's trailed 92-80 after three quarters, but they won 120-108 after outscoring the Warriors 40-16 in the fourth quarter. Boston became the first team in Finals history to trail by 10 after three quarters and win the game by 10 or more points.\n\nUnfortunately for the Celtics, they lost four of the next five games and lost the series.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki",

But why wait? There are plenty of ways to find value earlier than that when looking at the first quarter alone.\n\nIf you have an early Friday morning to worry about or are simply stumped by this game's broader lines, there is value to be found in the first 12 game minutes after this tips on Thursday, June 6.\n\nDid you see Luka Doncic in Game 5's opening frame against the Minnesota Timberwolves? In the first 4:32, he hit his first five buckets on the way to scoring 22 points. He went 9-of-12 shooting in the quarter, including 4-of-6 from deep, adding two assists, two rebounds, and a steal.\n\nThat is not the only reason to back the Dallas Mavericks early tonight, but it is the loudest reason.\n\nDallas has covered the first-quarter spread in 10 of 17 games this postseason, most notably going 5-2 against the spread in the first quarter when an underdog that night. Both losses came at Minnesota, games which the Mavericks eventually won outright. That can serve as an ounce of worry, but the 5-2 ATS mark should outweigh it.\n\nThe Boston Celtics have had a full 10 days off, not to mention a relatively easy path to the Finals. This is not another round of lampooning Boston for beating injured foes -- it could play only the opponents on the court -- but it is acknowledging this uptick in competition could take a minute to readjust to, particularly after that long layoff.\n\nAnd the Celtics have not played particularly well in first quarters, no matter who they have gone against this postseason. Boston is -- and this record may be charitable, giving the Celtics the benefit of the doubt on some varied numbers -- 2-6 ATS in the first quarter in its last eight games. The depleted Cavaliers and Pacers repeatedly kept things close through the first frame.\n\nThe casual take would be that the first quarter of the NBA Finals could be a slog. Nerves may win the moment.\n\nBut if they do, that is more likely to show up defensively than offensively. First of all, that is the modern NBA. Second of all, the two Mavericks who are most accustomed to this moment are Kyrie Irving (fourth career NBA Finals) and Doncic (been playing high-level international basketball for a decade now). Irving and Doncic are offensive-minded powers, obviously.\n\nIf they are dialed in while other Mavs fray, then Dallas will need to commit to its offense early.\n\nTwo of the last three NBA Finals Game 1s went Over their first quarter totals, including Boston's 2022 appearance, a 32-28 quarter loss to the Warriors in a game with an overall total of 214.5.\n\nFurthermore, eight of Boston's last 11 first quarters would have cleared this total. Admittedly, three out of four of those were against the Pacers and those games had inflated scores thanks to the Pacers' general preferred style. But five out of seven were in games with lower totals, ones against the Cavs and the Heat.\n\nThe Celtics' defense does not dial in early, certainly not consistently. Combine that with Dallas's most-veteran stars and this early total should be cleared quickly.\n\nNBA Finals first quarter prop: Over 55.5 1Q (-105 at DraftKings)\n\nJaylen Brown won Eastern Conference Finals MVP for a reason. He has shined this entire postseason, averaging 25 points with 6.1 rebounds and hitting 54.1% of his field goals.\n\nThe Celtics forward has not wasted any time in putting up those numbers. In 14 postseason games, he has taken the first shot in four of them. That rate alone presents value on betting Brown to score tonight's first basket at +500.\n\nHe has made the first basket in six of them. That rate strengthens this value to a point of making it a must-bet.\n\nThe greatest risk to this value may be the opening tip. But Kristaps Porzingis' return to action lessens that risk. In his 61 games this season, Boston won the opening tip 68.8% of the time (42 games).\n\nBy comparison, in Daniel Gafford's 38 games starting for the Mavericks, he won the tip on just 17 of them, 45.5%.\n\nThis will be the quickest bet of your Finals, but it could also be your quickest profit of the NBA Finals.", "source": {"uri": "covers.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Covers.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Gafford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Gafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_goal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Field goal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://img.covers.com/cms/covers/98f320f0-49a2-472a-b9c9-42c9c17f3c4d.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 605, "textEnd": 611}], "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

It grew to comical levels at times, and Tatum simply shrugged it all off as he prepared for the NBA Finals for the second time in his career.\n\n\"He's not a superstar,\" some said. \"His shot is terrible,\" other said. Some even questioned his relationship with Jaylen Brown because Tatum wasn't smiling enough when his teammate was named MVP of the Eastern Conference Finals. It got that silly.\n\nNo player is as heavily scrutinized as Jayson Tatum.\n\n\"You think so?\" Tatum joked when The Boston Globe's Gary Washburn asked him about holding the title of \"Most Scrutinized Player\" during Wednesday's NBA Finals media day at TD Garden.\n\nAs ridiculous as many of the claims are, Tatum doesn't let them bother him.\n\n\"I think more so than me, it's my mom, my grandma, family and friends. They're more bothered by it than me,\" he said. \"I understand if Deuce was to make it to the NBA and people were talking about him every day, I wouldn't be able to separate the superstar from the child. My mom took it tougher than I did. I don't take it personally. It was a long break without NBA basketball so they had to overanalyze every little thing.\"\n\nThe act has certainly gotten a bit old for Tatum's family and friends though. But he says it's fine. Again, his focus is elsewhere.\n\n\"It's the Finals. They wouldn't talk about me if I wasn't good,\" he said. \"So I try to take some positives out of it and change the channel.\"\n\nWhile his three-point shot has been off, with Tatum hitting just 29 percent from downtown, he's been better than \"good\" this postseason. He's leading the charge for Boston at 26 points per game to go with 10.4 rebounds and 5.9 assists. He's also playing excellent defense, which will need to continue against Dallas' formidable offense in the Finals.\n\nTatum has made the last three All-NBA First Teams, but many of his doubters are fixated on the fact that he doesn't own any MVP hardware or a championship ring. He can check off one of those with four more victories this postseason.\n\nAnd that is all that Tatum is focused on. A championship would help his legacy in Boston and the NBA, but Tatum isn't thinking about how he'll be remembered some day. He just wants to win a title.\n\n\"I don't think about the future or what this may mean for me down the road. As simple as it sounds, I'm trying to stay present and in the moment, enjoy it,\" he said. \"We keep talking about pressure, pressure, pressure. This is the NBA Finals, it's supposed to be fun, and that's where I'm at. I have a second chance to win an NBA championship and I want to enjoy it with my teammates and my family. That's where my narrow focus is at and about.\n\n\"I'm not thinking about what it would mean for my legacy. I'm just excited to play some basketball after this long break, and go out there and try to get the job done,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boston_Globe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Boston Globe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/06/05/50cd702a-431f-4767-88c2-718595d0c455/thumbnail/1200x630g2/fe514d3439dac30e22e9d4181e7c80d3/jayson-tatum.jpg?v=6d480a252670b63de1e37fef02c977a5", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Dallas will host the following two, and Games 5-7 will alternate between the two cities.\n\nHere are the odds and schedule for the 2024 NBA Finals, as well as which players are betting favorites to win Finals MVP. All odds are courtesy of BetMGM as of Wednesday.\n\n2024 NBA FINALS: Who will win the title? Mavericks vs. Celtics picks, predictions and odds\n\nThe Celtics dominated just about every opponent they played in the regular season and postseason. They were the only team to finish the regular season with more than 60 wins. Then they went on to win every playoff series in five games or fewer to further establish their dominance over the Eastern Conference. There's a reason they're heavy favorites.\n\nBoston has defeated the Mavericks twice already this season, once by nine points (before the trade deadline) and the other by 28 (in March). The Celtics have easily taken care of business in each of their postseason series so far, even without center Kristaps Porzingis - who averaged more than 20 points per game this season - in two of them.\n\nNow he's ready to go, playing for revenge against his old team, and can help take Boston over the top alongside fellow top scorers Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown.\n\nThis year, Dallas showed the league just how much a team can improve from trade deadline acquisitions. Over the November to January, middle-of-the-season stretch, the Mavericks were hovering right around the .500 mark and firmly in the play-in tournament - but not playoff - picture. Then they brought in P.J. Washington and Daniel Gafford at the beginning of February.\n\nThe Mavericks went 21-9 after the trade deadline, good for the third-best record in the NBA down the home stretch. They won the Southwest Division and moved to fifth in the conference, avoiding the play-in. Washington and Gafford were immediately significant contributors. The former finished fourth on the team in scoring average, and the latter trailed only Luka Don\u010di\u0107 in rebounds per game.\n\nBoth have continued to help push Dallas forward in the postseason as well. Washington is the team's third-best scorer by points per game and Gafford has averaged a team-high 1.8 blocks per game.\n\nThe Mavericks have their work cut out for them against a tough opponent, but those two will surely play a significant role to complement the stars: Don\u010di\u0107 and Kyrie Irving.\n\nTatum is the face of the team favored to win. He's led Boston in scoring (26 points per game), rebounding (10.4 per game) and assists (5.9 per game) this postseason while averaging 40.5 minutes played per game. It is no surprise to see Tatum so high on the Finals MVP odds board even though Brown edged him out for Eastern Conference Finals MVP.\n\nIf Tatum is the face of the favorite, Don\u010di\u0107 is the face of the underdog. He's similarly led his team in box score averages while playing 41.5 minutes per game on average. In doing so, he is nearly averaging a 30-point triple-double this postseason: 28.8 points, 9.6 rebounds and 8.8 assists per game. He also leads the team with 1.6 steals per game.\n\nThe Eastern Conference Finals MVP and the Celtics' No. 2 scorer this season is also among Finals MVP favorites. Brown has had an excellent postseason run thus far, including a clutch 3-pointer to send Game 1 of the ECF to overtime and matching a playoff career-high 40 points in Game 2 against the Pacers. If he continues coming through in big moments to help lead his team to a title, Brown can take home another postseason MVP trophy.\n\nIrving was everything the Mavericks could have hoped for in his first full season with the team. He had the second-best field goal percentage and third-best 3-point percentage of his career while averaging 35 minutes and 25.6 points per game. In the postseason, he's been a valuable No. 2 next to Don\u010di\u0107 capable of creating space and hitting shots from wherever he is on the floor. If the Mavericks win the title and it isn't because of Don\u010di\u0107, it will more likely than not be because of Irving.\n\nWhite has stepped up as the Celtics' No. 3 scorer this postseason in Porzingis' absence. He's also led the team with a 6.4 assist to turnover ratio, more than double the rate of the next-best player (Al Horford, 3.0). White went off for 38 points in the Celtics' Game 4 win over the Heat in the first round, but he's largely been more of a quiet yet capable contributor. He has a chance to earn Finals MVP with more big scoring performances like in round one while also complementing the skills of his teammates, dishing them the ball while continuing to limit turnovers.\n\nKYRIE IRVING: Mavericks star took long, complicated route back to NBA Finals\n\nLooking for local streaming options to catch the NBA Finals?

The final series of the 2023-24 NBA season should be a tactical masterclass from both sides with two teams with plenty of star power and elite defenses.\n\nThe Mavericks roll into the NBA Finals with two of the NBA's best offensive players in Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving, two incredibly tough players to guard for entirely different reasons.

Irving and Doncic are among the league's top shot creators and makers. They're going to get to their spots in creative ways, and they're going to knock down impossible-to-guard shots.\n\nHoliday, an NBA Champion, is an elite perimeter defender, though. So is White. They're going to pester the Mavericks' star duo, but there's truthfully only so much they can do.\n\nWatching Celtics head coach Joe Mazzulla decide on who and how to guard the duo of Irving and Doncic as a team will be interesting. Throwing two bodies at Doncic doesn't typically work as he's an elite playmaker and will expose a defense for hedging off screens or throwing double teams.\n\nIt's hard to imagine the series isn't hard-fought and a tight battle.

Brown has played a ton of minutes, clearing 40 in three of his last five games, and he's taken at least 17 shots in 11 of 14 games this postseason.\n\nJB has some serious value at this number ahead of Game 1.\n\nJrue Holiday may not win an ECF MVP or Finals MVP, but he has been a massive difference maker in his first season in Boston.\n\nHoliday's defensive prowess makes him a staple in Joe Mazzulla's rotation, and dating back to the second round he's really stuffed the stat sheet overall.\n\nHoliday is averaging 17.3 points, 6.7 rebounds and 5.3 assists per game over his last seven games, clearing 22.5 PRA in six of those contests.\n\nI imagine Holiday will draw the assignment on either Luka Doncic or Kyrie Irving, and he should play heavy minutes in Game 1. Betting on Boston props is a little volatile since we don't know Porzingis' usage, but this number has dropped significantly for Holiday compared to the 25.5 and 26.5's that we saw in the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nThe only NBA champion on the Boston roster should continue his strong play in Game 1.\n\nThis week, it has felt like the trendy pick is to take the points with Dallas, who had a tougher road to the NBA Finals.\n\nI'm going the other way.\n\nAn interesting trend for Game 1 of the NBA Finals surfaced this week, showing that since 2005, the favorite is 16-3 ATS in Game 1.\n\nI think that bodes well for a Boston team that covered in two of its three Game 1s so far this postseason and was 37-4 straight up at home in the regular season.

The Mavericks' duo of Luka Don\u010di\u0107 and Kyrie Irving have averaged 51.6 points, showing strong chemistry and offensive dominance. Both duos will face off in the 2024 NBA Finals, with the Celtics having a size advantage and the Mavs relying on shooting prowess.\n\nThe NBA has never featured any shortage of star power, and in this year's NBA Finals, that trend certainly continues. The 2024 NBA Finals are set to kick off between the top-seeded Boston Celtics and the Western juggernaut Dallas Mavericks, and each team features not just one superstar, but pairings of them.\n\nThe Celtics will take to the court donning an elite duo of Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. Meanwhile, the Mavericks will showcase a duo that has taken the league by storm and has proven itself to be one of the most threatening two-headed monsters in the NBA: that of Luka Don\u010di\u0107 and Kyrie Irving.\n\nThese Finals are certainly set to introduce waves of storylines as the drama between the two clubs builds. But it is undeniable that all eyes will be on the dynamic duos of Tatum and Brown, and Don\u010di\u0107 and Irving. They will rule the 2024 NBA Finals as the series becomes a clash of the league's top duos.\n\nTatum and Brown The Celtics will attempt to overthrow the Mavericks with their duo\n\nDespite questions surrounding their chemistry coming into this season, Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown have solidified themselves as one of the league's most elite duos. They meshed beautifully together throughout the regular season, allowing the Celtics to take over as the league's best team.\n\nTheir transcendence above all else has continued throughout the playoffs, where Jayson and Jaylen have shone repeatedly. They are averaging a combined 51.0 points, 16.5 rebounds, and 8.5 assists throughout these playoffs, causing opponents to throw all of their resources at them.\n\nThat opens up room for the rest of the Celtics' lineup, giving ample opportunities for Derrick White, Jrue Holiday, and even Al Horford to bury opponents. It is a lethal combination that has resulted in the Celtics overtaking the rest of the league, and it is why they are the slight favorites in this series.\n\n\"We kind of glorify guys that can play one side of the ball. But we really don't pay respect to people who guard and play defense.\" -- Brown on the duo of him and Tatum\n\nThe Celtics' duo also possesses an advantage over the Mavericks' duo in terms of size. Tatum is 6-foot-8, while Brown is 6-foot-6, meaning that the duo is not only extremely skilled but large in size. They possess similar skills and athletic abilities on the court and have grown to perfectly complement each others' games.\n\nTatum is averaging a double-double these playoffs and has cemented himself as more of the setup man. He will take over games with more frequency, leaving Brown to close. Brown has cemented himself as more of the closer in these playoffs, single-handedly taking Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals by nailing a corner three to tie the game late, allowing the Celtics to win it in OT.\n\nDon\u010di\u0107 and Irving The Mavericks will attempt to upset the Celtics with their duo\n\nIf any team in the NBA is as equipped to handle the duo that the Celtics will throw at them, it is the Dallas Mavericks. They possess a duo in Luka Don\u010di\u0107 and Kyrie Irving that has quickly become one of the league's best, and certainly the most famous, of these playoffs.\n\nThis duo is so skilled and has meshed together so well, in fact, that they are beginning to spring up in conversations about the game's greatest backcourt duos -- that will certainly remain to be seen. But what is confirmed is the sheer nature in which the Mavericks' duo changes the game.\n\nWhen Kyrie Irving was traded to the Mavericks last season from the Brooklyn Nets, it was unknown how well he would gel with Don\u010di\u0107 and company. But the decision to retain Irving certainly proved to be the correct one as they took the league by storm as one of the NBA's top duos, and that narrative has only strengthened in the playoffs, where its dominance has been on full display.\n\nThroughout the first three rounds of the 2024 NBA playoffs, the dynamic duo of Don\u010di\u0107 and Irving has averaged 51.6 points, 13.5 rebounds, and 14.0 assists per game. Just like in Boston, the duo is creating offensive chaos which results in opponents using every resource they have to attempt and counter them (which itself has failed), opening the door for other roleplayers to step up.\n\nElite duos in the NBA can only form via a specific combination of skill and chemistry. Just like in Boston, the Mavericks' duo has all of that and more. While they are at a disadvantage in terms of size (6-foot-7 for Don\u010di\u0107 but just 6-foot-2 for Irving), they possess the shooting to overpower opponents.\n\nEver since Irving arrived in Dallas with the assurance that he can be himself, he has gelled perfectly with Don\u010di\u0107, generating one of the game's most lethal backcourt duos. In an NBA world where Big Threes generate the most headlines, it is undeniable that this year's Finals will be all about the duos.\n\nRelated 5 Things the Boston Celtics Must Do to Win the 2024 NBA Finals A lot is at stake for the Celtics to win the 2024 NBA Finals, having a lot to prove with Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown as their star duo.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Nets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn Nets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/nba_battle-of-the-duos.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

The former Boston Celtics guard sees Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving as the more skilled tandem over Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. Despite Boston's star forwards being elite on both sides of the ball.\n\nThomas made the comments during a recent appearance on the \"Bully Ball\" podcast. He discussed the NBA Finals matchup and anointed Doncic and Irving as two of the best players to ever grace the league, regardless of generation or era. As such, Thomas likely sees the Mavericks as having a significant advantage heading into their series.\n\n\"Two of the best ever,\" Thomas said. \"Obviously, Jayson Tatum and those guys are really good. Jaylen Brown is really good. But Luka and Kyrie are something we haven't seen. And I'm putting them two, like they got the best duo...They got the best duo, they just don't got the best team.\"\n\nTatum and Brown play both sides of the ball. They are not only elite scorers and playmakers but also defend at an elite level and can rebound with the best of them. That is why the Celtics are such a formidable opponent; you can't exploit them on either side of the floor.\n\nThe Celtics will enter the Finals as heavy favorites to win a championship, regardless of what Thomas thinks. They have the better roster. They are better defensively and arguably have the best duo in the series.

The Dallas Mavericks have two stars that are very well-known -- Luka Don\u010di\u0107, a 25-year-old standout from Slovenia, who is one of the best players in the league and also Kyrie Irving, the former Celtic who has resurrected his career in Dallas -- in addition to the [Celtics] superstars, Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum.\"\n\nOn whether Tatum and Brown will be able to deliver:\n\n\"I'm expecting for them to give their absolute best effort. This is their best chance to win a championship in the seven years they've been together. They're favored in this series and they'll have to play their best basketball, so they'll have to play better than they played throughout the playoffs. And they played well throughout the playoffs. So they're going to need everything that's in them to win this series. And I think they have enough talent to do it. It's going to be a very competitive series because Dallas is also a very good team.\"\n\nOn Joe Mazzulla's first finals as coach:\n\n\"He is going to implement whatever game plan he can to slow down Luka Don\u010di\u0107. He's the head of the snake. He's their best player. He is the reason that they're here. And so he has to implement defenses to slow him down. And he also has to make Luca play on both sides of the ball, which means play defense and exert effort and energy there too.\n\n\"So his plan should be to try to slow down the combination of Don\u010di\u0107 and Kyrie Irving. You're not going to stop them, they're too talented, but you want to slow them down and make them less efficient.\"\n\nOn what makes this series different than the Celtics' 2022 finals loss against Golden State:\n\n\"They have the additions of Jrue Holiday, who was an NBA champion three years ago, then with the Milwaukee Bucks. And Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is is a center who kind of unlocks their offense because he's so versatile. And I just think experience also helps.\n\n\"This team had a chance to win that championship two years ago and kind of fell apart at a key stretch, and Golden State was much more experienced. They had won three previous championships and they did not panic when the Celtics seemingly panicked. So I think experience will make a difference here.\n\n\"The Celtics have been here before. They know the routine, so they should be more familiar with the process than the Mavericks, most of whom have not played NBA Finals.\"\n\nOn former Celtics player Kyrie Irving's tension with Boston fans:\n\n\"I don't think it'll be a factor in the game. I think the crowd will get into it. I think they'll try to get into his head, the Boston fans, in terms of the chanting and trying to distract him a little bit. He did not have a smooth tenure in Boston. He had a very tumultuous time here. He made some promises that he didn't live up to. So the Boston fans will remember that and it will remind them of that.\"\n\nOn whether the team has shown they can bring home a victory:\n\n\"Yeah, they've lived up to everything so far. They've checked all the boxes. They had the best record in the NBA, they are 12-2 in the playoffs so far, No. 1 seed. So they're here and now it's time to really, really step your game up and make sure that you take home the banner because they are their favorite and the pressure is on them.\"", "source": {"uri": "wbur.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "WBUR 90.9 mHz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boston_Globe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Boston Globe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AP24149108784355-1-1000x667.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5372549019607844, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

That's fantastic news for a Celtics team that has already sat atop the NBA in first-quarter scoring (31.4) since the start of the 2023-24 season.\n\nDallas smashed Minnesota in the mouth in the first quarter of the series-clinching Game 5 of the Western Conference Finals. But before that game, the Mavs had been outscored by the Wolves in the first frame by a collective score of 120-106. That's a +14 first-quarter scoring margin and an average plus-minus of +3.5.\n\nBoston turns up at this time of year. But the Green-teamers have been pretty solid all season, helping their squad go 37-4 in the regular season and 7-2 in the playoffs. With public enemy No. 1 Kyrie Irving coming back to face the fans he once pledged his allegiance to -- only to leave and return with sage and logo foot-stomps -- the tension will be palpable in this one and the passion should transmit to the players. Bet the Celtics to cover the 2.5-point first-quarter spread.\n\nFIRST QUARTER PREDICTION: Celtics 29, Mavs 25 -- Boston wins the first quarter (-185) and covers the -2.5 spread (-105), and the frame finishes UNDER the projected total of 55.5 (-110).\n\nPeople love betting the OVER, especially in the playoffs and Finals. It's more fun to root for points than it is to root for defensive stops, so sportsbooks tend to bump the projected totals up for Game 1 because they can always get away with it. As of Wednesday, a whopping 90 percent of BetMGM Game 1 over/under bettors had put their money on the OVER of 214.5.\n\nDon't follow the sheep, people. The Celtics have been one of the best defenses in the Association the entire season, and the Mavs turned into an elite defensive unit once they acquired Daniel Gafford and P.J. Washington at the deadline -- and Derrick Jones Jr. turned into Superman. Sure, these squads also have premier scorers -- but they also probably have some rust to kick off after many days of rest leading up to this game (never mind the nerves associated with the Finals).\n\nIf you're a little nervous about betting the UNDER, utilize the value opportunity and bet the UNDER on the alternate total of 216.5. That way, you buy an extra two points and still get in at just -130, which is very little juice considering the number you're getting.\n\nThe Celtics have held opponents to 102 points or fewer in nine of their 14 games this postseason. The Mavs held opponents to 103 or fewer in eight of their 17. Act on the UNDER now, because this might be the highest the over/under projection will be the entire championship series.\n\nFINAL SCORE PREDICTION: Celtics 108, Mavs 103 -- Boston wins (-250) but Dallas covers the +6.5 spread (-105), and the game finishes UNDER the alternate projected total of 216.5 points (-130).\n\nOne of the most underrated scorers and impact players on the Celtics, Derrick White has consistently come through in big moments for Boston. He hit what ultimately ended up being the game-winner of the fourth and final game of the Celtics-Pacers Eastern Conference Finals, and he should be a huge part of Game 1 if Dallas tries to blitz Tatum and Brown.\n\nJoe Mazzulla's squad also benefits from having Porzingis back, meaning the floor will be spaced that much better for Boston's perimeter shooters. White has already hit three-plus three-pointers in eight of the Celts' 14 postseason games so far, and he's averaging 3.4 per game in the 2024 NBA Playoffs. He should easily knock down three triples, and maybe he'll even get interviewed on the sideline to make up for being snubbed after the ECF closeout.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Sloan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Sloan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsbook", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sportsbook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MGM_Resorts_International", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MGM Resorts International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus\u2013minus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plus\u2013minus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celts", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Celts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Gafford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Gafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_Jones_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derrick Jones Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Gaming", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Gaming", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://ng-sportingnews.com/s3/files/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-06/nba-plain--ff2f645c-6531-440a-87be-894e22c6047f.png?itok=XpihN3lJ", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

Ranking Top 10 Players In NBA Finals", "body": "The Boston Celtics and Dallas Mavericks didn't get to the NBA Finals by accident.\n\nThe Celtics enter the series with a 76-20 combined record from the regular season and playoffs while the Mavericks toppled three higher seeds in the Los Angeles Clippers, Oklahoma City Thunder and Minnesota Timberwolves to get to this point.\n\nBoth teams are two of the more talented squads in the league with plenty of fire power and depth. But which team has more talent? It seems like it should be the Celtics, which doesn't guarantee them a title.\n\nThere will be plenty of highly skilled players on the floor when the Finals commence Thursday night at TD Garden, so we ranked the top 10 players who could play a big role in the series:\n\n10. Daniel Gafford\n\nDerrick Lively II could be in this spot, but Gafford took it due to his elite rim protection. He came over to the Mavericks in a midseason trade from the Washington Wizards and became Dallas' main shot-blocking presence. The 6-foot-10 center totaled 2.6 blocks per game in the Western Conference finals and in Game 2, he turned in a 16-point, five-block performance on the road.\n\n9. Al Horford\n\nHorford, 38, is the wily old veteran at this stage of his career as he looks for his first ring. Horford can still provide enough versatility on the defensive end and is a reliable enough 3-point shooter. He knocked down a career-high seven triples in a Game 3 win over the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference finals.\n\n8. P.J. Washington\n\nAnother trade deadline pick up by the Mavericks who has made his mark. Washington is Dallas' third-leading scorer in the playoffs at 13.6 points per game and can make an impact on both ends of the floor.\n\n7. Kristaps Porzingis\n\nPorzingis would be higher on this list if he hadn't sat out the last five weeks due to a calf injury. He's not even sure what he can provide in the Finals, but when he's at his best, he's a pick-and-pop assassin and top-tier rim protector.\n\n6. Derrick White\n\nWhite can do everything for the Celtics as he went from an undrafted guard to the precipice of stardom. He's scoring 17.8 points per game in the playoffs and hitting 3-pointers at a 40.7% clip. And don't forget he's one of the best defensive guards in the NBA and is a real threat to block anyone's shot.\n\n5. Jrue Holiday\n\nHoliday and White do very similar things on the court, but it just feels like Holiday has a couple of more intangibles than White to take this spot. Holiday took his game to another level in the postseason by making several clutch plays and could be the X-factor for the Celtics in this series.\n\n4. Kyrie Irving\n\nThere might not be another player in the NBA who has the array of offensive moves that Irving does. He's a deadly shooter, too, as he's sunk 42.1% of his 3-point attempts during the playoffs.\n\n3. Jaylen Brown\n\nBrown is a better all-around player than Irving, which is why the Celtics star gets this spot. Brown is averaging 25 points and is shooting an eye-popping 61.5% from inside the arc in the playoffs. Brown has also delivered in the biggest moments, too, which shouldn't go unrecognized.\n\n2. Jayson Tatum\n\nThere's a reason why Tatum has finished in the top six in MVP voting each of the last three seasons. The 6-foot-8 forward is a high-volume scorer, a strong rebounder and has developed into an adept playmaker. Tatum's long-range shooting has been off in the postseason, but if he finds it, he has the chance to take over the series and claim Finals MVP honors.\n\n1. Luka Doncic\n\nThis might be tough for Celtics fans to swallow, but Doncic is the best player in the series. He's averaging close to a triple-double in the postseason with 28.8 points, 9.6 rebounds and 8.8 assists. Doncic has an unorthodox style, but he gets the job done repeatedly and can make an impact on any play when he touches the ball.", "source": {"uri": "nesn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NESN"},

Given the stakes, the finals have always been a setting where elite performances become iconic, and this year's stars have their work cut out for them if they are to match the achievements of legends past.\n\nRead on to learn more about the players who have left the greatest mark on the NBA's biggest stage - the greatest winners, performers and record-holders in the league's history.\n\nBoston Celtics legend Bill Russell boasts the most NBA championships of any player in the league's history with a staggering 11 titles. He racked up so many rings that two had to go on the same finger.\n\nRussell was the leader of the Celtics' dynasty in the 1950s and 1960s, which saw Boston win 11 of 13 titles between 1957 and 1969. Naturally, his teammates make up much of the top of the list for most NBA titles; Sam Jones ranks second all-time with 10, and then four more Celtics - John Havlicek, Tom Heinsohn, K.C. Jones and Tom Sanders - are tied at eight.\n\nThe first non-Celtic on the list is Robert Horry, who won seven titles during his years with the Houston Rockets, Los Angeles Lakers and San Antonio Spurs in the 1990s and 2000s. Naturally, he is tied with another member of Boston's golden era in Frank Ramsey.\n\nThe story for NBA Finals appearances is similar, at least at the very top. Russell leads the way with 12, with Sam Jones right behind at 11.\n\nThis is where the influx of Los Angeles Lakers comes in. LeBron James and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar - not so coincidentally, the league's two all-time leading scorers - have both made 10 finals appearances. Magic Johnson and Jerry West, along with Heinsohn, are up next with nine.\n\nLakers great Elgin Baylor holds the record for highest-scoring finals game after he scored 61 in Game 5 of the 1962 NBA Finals against the Celtics. Los Angeles needed just about every point, too, as it defeated Boston 126-121 at the Boston Garden to take a 3-2 series lead. The Celtics would win the final two games of the series, though, to earn their fifth championship.\n\nMichael Jordan and Rick Barry each scored 55 to slot in for second. Jordan's came in the Chicago Bulls' 111-105 win over the Phoenix Suns in the 1993 NBA Finals, giving Chicago a 3-1 lead it would not relinquish. Barry hit his number in the San Francisco Warriors' 130-124 victory against the Philadelphia 76ers in Game 3 of the 1967 NBA Finals, but Wilt Chamberlain and the 76ers ultimately won that series.\n\nOnly four other players have reached 50 or more points in an NBA Finals game: West (53 in Game 1 of the 1969 NBA Finals); James (51 in Game 1 of the 2018 NBA Finals); Giannis Antetokounmpo (50 in Game 6 of the 2021 NBA Finals); and Bob Pettit (50 in Game 6 of the 1958 NBA Finals).\n\nThe aforementioned Barry holds the highest career NBA Finals scoring average; he put up 36.3 points per game over that 1967 loss to the 76ers and the Warriors' 1975 sweep of the Washington Bullets.\n\nAllen Iverson and Antetokounmpo are not far behind, with averages of 35.6 and 35.2, respectively, in their lone finals appearances. Antetokounmpo was the only one of the two to take a trophy from his finals run, though.\n\nOnly four other players average 30-plus points per game in their finals career. Jordan (33.6 points per game in 35 finals games) and West (30.5 points per game in 55 finals games) are the players with the longest sustained scoring success of the group. Kevin Durant and Nikola Jokic just top the 30-point mark at 30.3 and 30.2, respectively.\n\nIn a strange twist of fate, none of the top three player scoring performances in Game 7 of an NBA Finals have resulted in victory. It does make a bit more sense when you hear all three came against Russell's Celtics.\n\nWest holds the high-water mark with 42 in Game 7 of the 1969 NBA Finals, which Boston won 108-106 for Russell's 11 and final championship. Baylor put the finishing touches on a stunning 1962 finals performance with 41 in Game 7, but the Celtics escaped with a 110-107 victory. Pettit's 39 in the final matchup of the 1957 finals were not enough, as the Celtics escaped 125-123 for Russell's first ring.\n\nThat 1957 series conclusion also saw Heinsohn go for 37 in the win, tied with James' performance in 2013 for fourth-highest Game 7 scoring output by a player and the most in a victory.\n\nThe raw totals here are dominated by two legends who wore purple and gold. James has 11 triple-doubles in 55 finals games to top the list. Johnson is not too far behind at eight in 50 finals games.\n\nDraymond Green is up next with three in 33 finals games. Also of note: Jokic had two over the five games of the 2023 NBA Finals, giving him easily the best ratio of triple-doubles to finals games.", "source": {"uri": "nbcsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Russell", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bill Russell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Jones_(basketball,_born_1933)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sam Jones (basketball, born 1933)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Horry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert Horry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giannis_Antetokounmpo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Giannis Antetokounmpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satch_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Satch Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Heinsohn", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tom Heinsohn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Havlicek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Havlicek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._C._Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "K.

Answers, real answers, will only reveal themselves on the court in the weeks ahead.\n\nHere are 10, however, to serve as placeholders for what we'll learn about the Celtics, the Mavericks and their dueling pursuit of legacies and hardware, which begins Thursday with Game 1 (8:30 ET, ABC).\n\n1. Do playground-style rankings mean anything?\n\nFor some reason, this is an increasingly popular exercise for studio shows and media outlets looking to fill time while everyone waits for the league's championship series to start. It's like the briefly-used All-Star player draft, that mechanism that traumatized so many kids who were picked last - and might have ticked off Denver's three-time Kia NBA MVP Nikola Jokic went it happened to him.\n\nMaybe it's a clumsy and thoroughly unscientific way of gauging the teams' relative strengths, based on how many of their players are taken in the first X number of picks. A run through the Celtics and Mavericks rosters this year might go like this:\n\nAnd so on. Which doesn't tell us much about how they'll compete off each other, share responsibilities, fight through cold stretches, etc. It certainly wasn't helpful the last time Dallas got to this round, when the 2011 Miami Heat had three of the top four talents in the Finals, including prime LeBron James, and still lost. So the answer is no.\n\n2. Do Tatum and Brown get along and, if not, will that derail Boston?\n\nThis is a gossipy question straight out of a high school cafeteria, sillier than the far more meaty \"Does Kyrie Irving regret stomping on the Boston logo with mascot Lucky at TD Garden court three years ago?\"\n\nThe Celtics' set of wings have achieved so much together, combining for five conference finals, two trips to the Finals and eight All-Star selections in their seven years as teammates. Brown became the highest-paid player in the NBA last summer and Tatum is poised to top him with his next deal. Together they drain the options and energy right out of opposing defenses, and they have led Boston to a 76-20 record since the season began in October.\n\nIt's not ideal to answer a question with a question, but it is effective: Are you best friends with everyone you work with? Does it stop any of you from doing your best job?\n\n3. What does this series mean to the coaches?\n\nThere's a trivia aspect to Boston's Joe Mazzulla and Dallas' Jason Kidd working the sidelines in the first Finals to feature two black head coaches since 1975, when Golden State's Al Attles matched wits with Washington's K.C. Jones.\n\nThat doesn't mean as much as what getting here, and for one of them winning here, says. Mazzulla had a bumpy first season when abruptly thrust into Ime Udoka's vacated role in 2022-23. Kidd is on his third team in eight seasons as a head coach.\n\nBoth have learned while sticking to their beliefs and systems. Mazzulla's use of a deep roster and his connection with newcomer Holiday this season have stood out. Kidd adapted to midseason acquisitions, leaned on defense and managed the sizeable egos of Doncic and Irving.\n\nOne of the coaches will win. Both have been validated.\n\n4. Who guards Luka?\n\nTV graphics will line up five players per side, by position, and imply that's how they'll battle all series. Real NBA competition is far from that, of course.\n\nHoliday and White will get isolated on Doncic at times, with Holiday's strength a better fit for the matchup. But pick-and-rolls and switching means plenty of Boston players will get turns in the tank. The guy best equipped at this point might be Brown, who seemed to roll up his sleeves for the challenge when the teams played March 1 (a 138-110 Celtics victory).\n\nTeam defense matters, too, which in this case means taking away Doncic's lob targets Lively and Daniel Gafford as much as possible. Not that turning the Slovenian multi-threat into a shooter/scorer is any sort of goal.\n\n5. So what about Kyrie going back to Boston?\n\nIrving's two unsatisfying seasons with the Celtics (2017-2019) will provide a backdrop to this series, with fans in Boston still cranky about the point guard's lack of commitment and leadership. He left for Brooklyn after pledging to re-sign with the Celtics and has taken his lumps at TD Garden ever since.\n\nWe'll focus on the sideshow it provides, but this won't have much to do with any outcomes. The fans won't be poking any bear, not with Irving as the most Finals-experienced player in this series, and presumably he already will be maxed out on motivation and focus.\n\n6. Will Kristaps Porzingis play for Boston?\n\nA good answer is \"yes,\" and a better answer as far as the Celtics are concerned is \"right away.\" There were reports that the 7-foot center will open the series with everyone else in Game 1, which would be his first game action since April 29.\n\nThat was Game 4 against Miami, in which Porzingis suffered a strained right calf. That suggests a lot of rust, but it also has provided him with nearly seven weeks of rest and rehab on an injury that spooks NBA medical staffs these days. It was, after all, the immediate precursor for Kevin Durant that led to his torn Achilles tendon in the 2019 Finals.\n\nIt seems unlikely Porzingis will play without a minutes restriction, and the Celtics' 9-1 flow since he went down could get disrupted. But they welcome him back, particularly his pick-and-pop spacing and his presence defensively in the paint.\n\n7. Who are the X-factors for each team?\n\nWhite for the Celtics, P.J. Williams for the Mavericks. White can earn redemption for a disappointing experience in the 2022 Finals. That's when he scored 21 points in the opening victory, then managed just 38 points and a minus-87 in the final five games against Golden State. That was his first postseason with Boston; now he's established and often their most quietly valuable playoff performer.\n\nWashington will have to blink through the bright lights, because all 17 of his playoff appearances have come this spring. But he has scored in double figures in 15 of them, with the size (6-foot-7, 230 pounds) to get physical with the Boston wings.\n\n8. How did Dallas nail this Doncic-Irving pairing?\n\nFor a sport played with just one ball, teaming two of the NBA's most ball-dominant guards struck many as sheer folly. Irving showed up in February 2023 dragging his unreliable reputation and obstinate off-court history with him. That made the trade look like a big-name grab to prove the franchise wasn't hanging Doncic out there by himself.\n\nBut Irving began to thrive away from Brooklyn and COVID-19. He seemed more willing to show his love for the game and, most important, he and Doncic talked, built mutual respect and made room for each other.\n\nNow he appears to be in better shape physically and emotionally. He shows more energy defensively than in the past. And he and Doncic are the same handful for opponents that Irving and past star teammates have been for their own organizations.\n\n9. Would Boston's 'easy' road toward a title taint it?\n\nIt's true that each of the Celtics' foes in the East's three previous rounds played without stars for all or some of the games. Miami was without Jimmy Buter, Cleveland lost Donovan Mitchell for the final two contests and Indiana's Tyrese Haliburton missed two in the conference finals.\n\nBig deal. If the Celtics snag the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy this year, time will erase any asterisks. Do we really know off the top of our heads which NBA championships have been won thanks to missing stars?\n\nAnd if the Celtics don't win, that outcome will mar and largely define their season, but who was or wasn't around to face them in the playoffs won't much matter. Which leads to the next question:\n\n10. Is this championship or bust for Boston?\n\nIn a word, yes. Six trips to the East finals in eight years, with a Final appearance in 2022 against Golden State to whet appetites for this one is some serious door-knocking. Tatum (26) and Brown (27) still are young as the two pillars of this team, and there would be nothing wrong tactically with running it back.\n\nBut the belief might not be there, for the fans and perhaps even for the players. Al Horford at 38 could be crushed, and losing to this insta-contender from Dallas wouldn't be as palatable as, say, losing to defending champion Denver might have been.\n\nThe views on this page do not necessarily reflect the views of the NBA, its clubs or Warner Bros.

We kind of took it for granted at certain moments.\"\n\nAnd now?\n\n\"I\u00b4m not thinking about what it would mean for my legacy or anything like that,\" he said. \"Just excited to play some basketball ... and go out there and try to get the job done.\"\n\nDallas\u00b4 Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving see it as their first opportunity to make good on a partnership that began late last season after Irving was traded from Brooklyn following a tumultuous run of two-plus seasons with the Nets.\n\nDallas Mavericks head coach Jason Kidd watches play during Game 1 of the NBA basketball Western Conference finals against the Minnesota Timberwolves, Wednesday, May 22, 2024, in Minneapolis. (AP Photo/Abbie Parr)\n\nBut the duo was still learning to play with each other during their truncated time together last season and didn\u00b4t make it to the postseason. After a slow start this season, they found cohesion after the All-Star break and emerged from a deep Western Conference field.\n\nFor Irving, it has been a reminder that success can be fleeting. He won his lone championship with Cleveland in 2016 and has played with three teams over the past eight years. His time in Dallas has reinvigorated him.\n\n\"These young guys are very hungry. They want a championship. I want a championship,\" he said. \"So our feelings are very mutual. But I\u00b4ve always reminded them that this is a process. Failure is going to be part of this, too. Get it out your mind that this is about to be a clean sweep or everything is about to feel good throughout this journey and all that.\n\n\"I\u00b4m just very real, very honest. That\u00b4s what\u00b4s helped me grow as a leader.\"\n\nDoncic credits the partnership with Irving for uncorking the potential of a team that entered the postseason as a fifth seed.\n\n\"His leadership is amazing,\" Doncic said. \"The way he connects us. I think me and Kyrie are the leaders of this team, but he\u00b4s the one that\u00b4s been in the Finals. He\u00b4s the one that won in the Finals. He\u00b4s the one that is really leading it.\"\n\nThey\u00b4ll matchup with a Boston team playing like a group that has learned from its recent shortcomings. That was exhibited during a 64-win regular season that established it as a favorite to raise the franchise\u00b4s 18th championship banner entering the postseason.\n\nThrough the first three rounds, the Celtics have met the challenge, losing just two games along the way under the guidance of second-year coach Joe Mazzulla.\n\nThey\u00b4ve also benefited from an offseason shakeup of its roster that saw longtime emotional leader Marcus Smart and former NBA Sixth Man of the Year Malcolm Brogdon traded in favor of 7-footer Kristaps Porzingis and Jrue Holiday, who won a championship with Milwaukee in 2021.\n\nBrown said a core that features seven players from the 2022 team that lost in the Finals to Golden State, is up to the challenge.\n\n\"I think this is a special group. I really do,\" Brown said. \"We\u00b4ve been able to go through the experiences of having success but not having success at the same time. I think to solidify the ultimate goal is to get over the hump and win. I think that will add a lot to our legacy. But as of right now, that story is kind of still untold.\"\n\nCOACHING PERSPECTIVES\n\nThis stage is nothing new to Mavericks coach Jason Kidd, who is in the Finals for the fifth time as a player or coach.\n\nHe has experienced lows, such as losing back-to-back trips to the Finals in 2002 and 2003 as a player with the New Jersey Nets. He has also seen success, earning his lone title as a player with Dallas in 2011 at age 38 and one as an assistant on the Lakers 2020 championship team.\n\nThe biggest lesson he has taken away is to approach it like business and be ready to live with the results. That has been his message to his team throughout these playoffs.\n\n\"This is the best of the best at the highest level,\" Kidd said. \"It\u00b4s fun. That\u00b4s what the Finals are all about, is seeing what team is going to step forward and take advantage of mistakes.\"\n\nMazzulla was an assistant on Ime Udoka\u00b4s staff in 2022. What he learned from that experience is that the details of winning never change, even on this stage.\n\n\"The toughest team will win,\" Mazzulla said. \"The team that makes the most plays will win. The team that can execute the details at a high level will win. It\u00b4s no different.\"\n\nFRIENDS AND COMPETITORS\n\nIrving is ready for what he expects to be an icy greeting from Boston\u00b4s home crowd for Game 1 on Thursday.\n\nCeltics fans haven\u00b4t held a high opinion of him since he ended two disappointing seasons in Boston by leaving for the Nets and joining Kevin Durant in free agency in 2019.\n\nHe then rankled the Boston faithful even more when he flipped his middle finger at fans after making a shot during Brooklyn\u00b4s first round playoff series loss to the Celtics in 2022. But he said he is looking forward to matching up with \"brothers\" and former teammates Tatum and Brown.\n\n\"They\u00b4ve gotten tremendously better. They\u00b4ve led their team to this point. So I\u00b4m proud of them,\" Irving said. \"I\u00b4m looking forward to the competition because this is what we\u00b4ve all strived for since we were kids, basketball at this level playing against the best of the best.\"\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

There have been plenty of Celtics vs Mavericks predictions over the last few days, so now it's time to deliver our tips for Game 1. Current odds make the Celtics the heavy favourite in the game-winner market -- where does the value lie?\n\nWe predict the Dallas Mavericks to cover the spread against the Boston Celtics in Game 1 of the 2024 NBA Finals.\n\nThe head-to-head stats suggest the Celtics will win this game at a canter. After all, Boston won by nine and 28 points in the two regular-season meetings. This Dallas team has changed a lot since the January contest, though, and they have improved markedly since the matchup in March.\n\nBoston has the best net rating this postseason. Playoff stats only reveal part of the picture, though, with a stark difference in the strength of the opposition. Dallas has overcome the Los Angeles Clippers, an uber-talented Oklahoma City Thunder, and a Minnesota Timberwolves team which just eliminated the defending champions.\n\nBoston, in contrast, has had a very favourable run to the Finals. Both of their losses have come on their home floor, while Dallas has gone 7-2 on the road this postseason. The Mavs have won five in a row on the road, and can at least keep this game close.\n\nBet 1: Dallas Mavericks +6.5 @ 1.88 Bet9ja\n\nBoth of the regular-season contests went over this total. Dallas' last four games against the Minnesota Timberwolves in the Western Conference Finals also cleared this line. While these are two elite defences, this line is still on the low side.\n\nDallas has upped its pace this season. More willing to get out and run with effective transition players like Derrick Jones Jr., look for the Mavs to attack Boston before they can get their defence set. The Celtics will push the ball up the floor at times, too, particularly in the hands of Jaylen Brown off of Mavericks misses.\n\nDallas' games have averaged over 232 total points this season. Boston's are at almost 230. While the playoffs sees games slow down and defences lock in, this line still looks a few points low with the attacking talent on show. They could fly past this line with both teams capable of getting into the 120s.\n\nBet 2: Over 215.5 total points @ 2.10 Bet9ja\n\nThe Mavericks have consistently delivered in the clutch throughout the postseason. Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving are two ice-cold fourth-quarter performers and have repeatedly demonstrated how to dissect a defence. At the other end of the floor, Dallas has taken their defence to another level in crunch time.\n\nWhile Boston repeatedly came through in the fourth against a depleted Indiana Pacers team, there is still cause for some caution about them in clutch games. The decision-making of Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown is inconsistent, and their ball movement can desert them at times. Their go-to scorers are a level below Doncic and Irving.", "source": {"uri": "punchng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Punch Newspapers"}, "authors": [{"uri": "elysa_daumas_turle@punchng.com", "name": "Elysa Daumas-Turle", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_Jones_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derrick Jones Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/05120402/boston-vs-mavericks-predictions.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

I wish we would have won,\" Celtics star Jayson Tatum said Wednesday, on the eve of the 2024 finals.\n\nBoston is back in business, getting set to host the Dallas Mavericks at 5:30 p.m. Thursday in Game 1, two years after the Tatum-Jaylen Brown nucleus fell on its face in the duo's first finals together.\n\nThe Celtics are not exactly the same team they were in the 2022 finals, but most of the important pieces are still intact, with Tatum and Brown leading the way. As Boston and the Mavericks addressed reporters during finals media day Wednesday at TD Garden, the Celtics' recent finals experience - and the benefit it could provide them over the next three weeks - was a main topic of discussion.\n\nMost of the Celtics who will take the floor Thursday have been in the finals before, hoping that the pain they experienced at the hands of the Warriors was needed so that they can win this time.\n\n\"I'm a firm believer in everything happens for a reason,\" said Tatum, who averaged 26.9 points this season and is scoring 26.0 points per game in the playoffs. \"There's a lesson to be learned in every situation. I do feel a lot different this time, this go-around, two years later. I'm excited for the opportunity for us to get the job done.\"\n\nThe Celtics and Lakers are tied for the most championships in NBA history (17), but Boston's last finals triumph was in 2008, when Tatum was 10 years old. Brown, who has one more year of NBA service than Tatum, has been a part of six Celtics teams to reach the conference finals in eight years. Only twice has the duo gotten to the finals.\n\nDerrick White played serious minutes for Boston's last finals team, as did Al Horford and Payton Pritchard. Joe Mazzulla was an assistant coach for Boston in 2022. Brad Stevens was in his first season as team executive, having been elevated from his post as head coach.\n\nAfter falling in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals last May, Stevens added Jrue Holiday - a champion in 2021 with the Milwaukee Bucks - and former Dallas center Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is over the offseason. Together, this group blew the rest of the NBA away to the tune of 64 regular-season wins, the most in the league.\n\nThough they might disagree with this assessment, the Celtics have largely gone untested in the playoffs, facing three opponents missing their best player for some or all of each series. For a team as good as Boston, with as much pedigree and experience as the Celtics have, the finals are a referendum on whether they \"work,\" and if Tatum and Brown can win the ultimate prize together.\n\n\"I think it's a fair question. I think it's fair to say that it does affect you being embraced versus being scrutinized,\" said Brown, who was voted MVP for the Celtics' Eastern Conference finals win over Indiana.\n\n\"You get to a point where it's like you get scrutinized enough for a large part of your career, it becomes normal,\" Brown continued. \"Then it just rolls off you. For me, at least, I can say - I don't know if Jayson feels the same way - it's kind of been that (way) my whole career in a sense.\"\n\nThe Mavericks entered the postseason as the No. 5 seed in the West, and as a group this is the farthest Dallas has been in the playoffs. Luka Don\u010di\u0107 dragged the Mavs to the Western Conference finals in 2022, where they were easily dismissed by those same Warriors who bested Boston in the finals.\n\nDallas coach Jason Kidd won a championship as a player with the Mavs in 2011 - the last time the franchise reached the championship round - and collected a ring as an assistant coach with the Lakers in 2020. Kyrie Irving, one of two Mavs stars, won in 2016 with Cleveland.\n\nBut in both Kidd and Irving's case, as players, they lost in the finals before they could win one.\n\n\"Yeah, I think you do have to experience it,\" Kidd said. \"I think that's the nicer way to accept losing, is that you have to go through it. It's a graceful way to accept losing. But you do have to, again, go through defeat to understand that bad taste, how do you feel, how does it make you feel, to work on your game, to get better.\n\n\"Jayson and Brown have gone through defeat,\" Kidd continued. \"We also lost to the Warriors, too, that year. The Warriors are really good. ... That tandem (Tatum and Brown), they're playing at an extremely high level and we got our work cut out.\n\n\"But they've been here. Some of us for the Mavs have been here, some of us haven't. We're going to embrace that and find a way to hopefully win a series.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytlicensing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spokesman.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Stevens", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brad Stevens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Mazzulla", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Mazzulla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payton_Pritchard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Payton Pritchard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kidd", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jason Kidd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://thumb.spokesman.com/xhEnBk7g-eS2qR5F1n_Bq15CRXs=/1200x630/smart/media.spokesman.com/photos/2024/06/05/6660e2b48ef4e.hires.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

The NBA Finals are on the verge of beginning! The Celtics and Mavericks will square off on June 6th in Game 1. Surprisingly, Isaiah Thomas, a former fan favorite who used to wear the coveted green and white jersey, believes that the team from Dallas has the best players heading into the series.\n\n\"Dallas,\" Thomas said when asked which team has the best player in the Finals (h/t Sports Illustrated). \"They got two of the best ever. Obviously Jayson Tatum and those guys are really good. Jaylen Brown is really good. But Luka and Kyrie are something we haven't seen. They are the best duo (in the Finals). They don't just have the best player.\"\n\nThis take is 100% subjective, and everyone is entitled to their own opinion, even if they go against their former team. However, this is why basketball and sports in general are heavily tuned in -- the controversy makes things enticing. But like always, none of it matters one bit; it's all going to be determined by the players involved.\n\nFor starters, Jayson Tatum -- five-time All-Star and someone who is looking to avenge their 2022 NBA Finals loss to the Golden State Warriors. That one is a gimme.\n\nWho else?\n\nJaylen Brown, a three-time All-Star who normally gets overshadowed by Tatum's success, is starting to prove his worth to everyone. After the Celtics swept over the Indiana Pacers, Brown was named the NBA Eastern Conference Finals MVP.\n\nIt's awesome to watch Brown's growth, and it's making the doubters think twice.\n\nThomas' take states that the Mavericks have \"two of the best ever,\" but he must remember that basketball is a five-person sport, not just two.\n\nBesides Tatum and Brown, Joe Mazzulla has Derrick White, Kristaps Porzingis, Al Horford, and NBA champion Jrue Holiday. In comparison to rookie Derrick Lively, Daniel Gafford, P.J. Washington, and Derrick Jones Jr.\n\nWhat's the difference between those two groups? Experience. That's so crucial and is a huge factor in deciding if a team will hang another banner in their respective arenas.\n\nRegardless of what the former Boston Celtics fan favorite said, it will not change the fact that the two teams will duke it out on their own terms.\n\nThat's where we'll really find out who has the best players.", "source": {"uri": "hardwoodhoudini.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hardwood Houdini"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Thomas_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Isaiah Thomas (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Mazzulla", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Mazzulla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_Jones_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derrick Jones Jr."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2667,h_1500,x_0,y_175/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/18/01hzmdxmqb4xpskxsr0w.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 193, "textEnd": 201}], "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

Historically good, actually. They won 64 games in the regular season, 14 more than any other team in the Eastern Conference. They set a franchise record for points scored in a season, won their first 20 games at home, and either set or tied NBA records for 50-point wins, 40-point wins, and 30-point wins in a season.\n\nBottom line: The Celtics crushed everybody all season, and that continued into the playoffs, as they lost just two games (one each to the Heat and Cavaliers) on their way to the Finals.\n\n\u25aa There are six guys on the team you should know about. You probably already know Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, he star 1-2 punch at the top. Tatum made another All-NBA first team -- named one of the five best players in basketball, more or less -- and Brown has been brilliant in the playoffs, averaging 29.8 points per game to win Eastern Conference finals MVP as the Celtics swept the Pacers.\n\nBehind them is the do-it-all, defense-first backcourt of Jrue Holiday and Derrick White, a pair of unselfish guards who were both named to the NBA's All-Defense second team. They both can provide scoring, too -- White in particular is liable for the occasional offensive takeover, hanging 38 points on the Heat in the first round -- but they make much of their hay on the other end.\n\nNow, if you haven't paid much attention over the last year, you might be thinking, \"Where the heck is Marcus Smart? Didn't everyone love him?\" They did, but building a juggernaut requires sacrifice. Rounding out the Celtics' starting five is 7-foot-2-inch center Kristaps Porzingis, whose size, shooting, and versatility brought a new dimension to this offense.\n\nThe Celtics swung a blockbuster trade for Porzingis last summer, parting with Smart, long the beating heart of the team and a huge fan favorite, to bring the lanky Latvian to Boston. Porzingis has missed much of this playoff run with a calf injury, but he's expected to return for Game 1 of the Finals, a big boost to the Celtics, who have been without their third-leading scorer since the first round.\n\nThe loss of Smart was softened by the acquisition of Holiday, who also came to Boston in an offseason trade. Holiday has been, more or less, a direct upgrade of Smart -- even better defensively, more efficient as a shooter and scorer, and far less likely to drive you insane with his shot selection.\n\nAnd finally, there's Al Horford, the eminently popular 38-year-old big man who has turned back the clock on multiple occasions this postseason starting in place of Porzingis. It's OK if you don't love Horford yet; you will.\n\nPayton Pritchard and Sam Hauser will provide some shooting and energy off the bench, but the championship hopes of the Celtics lie almost entirely with those six guys.\n\n\u25aa The Celtics are coached by 35-year-old Joe Mazzulla, the youngest coach in the NBA and the youngest to lead a team to the NBA Finals since Bill Russell in 1969. So, is he some sort of coaching wunderkind, a prodigious basketball mind with revolutionary ideas?\n\nWell, no, not really. Mazzulla is Mazzulla; his brand of coaching has more to do with letting his guys do what they do best and play their own game rather than complex scheming and tactics. You probably will see the Celtics give up a big run to Dallas and think Mazzulla is going to call a timeout to slow the momentum (he won't) or you may expect the Celtics to stop taking 3-pointers if they're shooting poorly (they won't). It's part of the experience.\n\nMazzulla is an intense character. He practices jiu-jitsu in his spare time. He once tried to block an opponent's shot after the buzzer (\"We want our opponents to constantly be uncomfortable,\" he said). He has claimed that he watches \"The Town,\" the Ben Affleck bank-heist flick set in Boston, four times a week.\n\n\u25aa That's most of what you need to know about the Celtics. The short version on the Mavericks: Their best player is Luka Doncic -- the best player on either team -- and he will have the ball for 80 percent of the game and spend the other 20 percent complaining to the referees. Their second-best player is Kyrie Irving (you might remember him), who almost certainly will get booed incessantly in Boston. It's all part of the fun.\n\nIt all kicks off Thursday night at TD Garden, where the Celtics lost the 2022 Finals in six games to Stephen Curry and the Warriors. But the Celtics have home-court advantage this time, plus an even better roster and more consistent stars.\n\nOne way or the other, it should be a fun series. And if the Celtics fall short again, you can always tell your coworkers you knew they shouldn't have traded Marcus Smart.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Writers discuss names to watch in NBA Finals.", "body": "Tim Cowlishaw, Kevin Sherrington, Mike Curtis, Brad Townsend and Shawn McFarland - The Dallas Morning News (TNS)\n\nAhead of the NBA Finals between the Dallas Mavericks and the Boston Celtics, columnists and beat writers from The Dallas Morning News and The Boston Globe collaborated to answer several questions and predict an outcome for the series, which starts Thursday in Boston.\n\nHere are the players they said need to step up for either the Mavericks or the Celtics to win the series.\n\n-- Mike Curtis: P.J. Washington is going to be the X-factor for the Mavericks. He's shown throughout the postseason that he's capable of stepping up as that third scoring option behind Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving. He'll receive plenty of looks from the 3-point line, especially from the corner. It's up to him to knock them down. His defense on Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown could be even more valuable to Dallas and might prove the difference in the series if he can make it difficult for either Celtics star.\n\n-- Tim Cowlishaw: This will be an enormous series for Derrick Jones Jr. The Mavericks didn't know they were getting a full-time starter when they signed him away from Chicago. But the former dunk champion has been a top-level defender and will undoubtedly guard Tatum plenty in the coming series.\n\nTatum is a streaky shooter, and when he's at his best, Boston probably has too many weapons for the Mavs to contend with. But if Jones does his usual job of making Tatum work, that puts added pressure on Brown and Derrick White and others to carry the load.\n\n-- Shawn McFarland: P.J. Washington. He averaged 12.2 points and 6.4 rebounds in the Western Conference finals and cracked double digits in each game, and he's grown into the third option behind Doncic and Irving. We've seen him change the momentum, flow and outcome of individual playoff games, and assuming the Celtics -- with a top-ranked defense led by Jrue Holiday, White, Brown and co. -- throw the kitchen sink at Dallas' superstar backcourt, Washington's impact on offense and defense is necessary. He and Jones could see a lot of time on Tatum (6-8) and Brown (6-6), and his perimeter shooting can help stretch the floor versus a defense without too many holes.\n\n-- Kevin Sherrington: Dereck Lively II was the Mavs' unsung hero of the last two rounds because of his ability to limit teams' offense in the paint. But how much difference can he make against the Celtics, especially if Kristaps Porzingis reclaims the minutes Al Horford picked up in his absence? Washington and Jones will have their hands full guarding Tatum and Brown, meaning they may not have a lot left for offense. Goes without saying that Doncic and Irving need to outdo Tatum and Brown, so how's this for a wild card: Jaden Hardy. He's got a shooter's conscience, meaning none at all. If he can provide a consistent offensive spark, the Mavs can score with Boston.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\n-- Brad Townsend: Washington. At this point, the Mavericks know the baseline of what they can expect from key non-Doncic/Irving players such as Washington, Jones, Josh Green, Maxi Kleber and even Lively. And they know they'll get stellar defense from Washington. But what will he give Dallas offensively? The Celtics have so many offensive weapons that it's imperative for the Mavericks to counter with a reliable No. 3 scorer.\n\nDallas doesn't necessarily need the 17.7-point, 8.3-rebound Washington we saw against Oklahoma City in the second round, though that Washington obviously would be welcomed. But in this series the Mavericks need more scoring from Washington than his 10.8-point average in the first round and 12.2-point average against Minnesota in the WCF.\n\n-- Chad Finn: Honestly, it's just a matter of the Celtics' best players playing up to their ability. The Celtics have a remarkably well-rounded team, and Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown have never trusted their colleagues more. The Celtics could be in trouble if Tatum or Brown underperforms or tries to do too much, but I don't anticipate that. I will say this: I think Jrue Holiday will be the one to make the play or plays that clinch this series.\n\n-- Adam Himmelsbach: The beauty of this Celtics team is that they are so talented at the top that they are generally able to withstand at least one poor performance by any player. So they don't necessarily need one specific player to step up. But keep an eye on Sam Hauser, who was one of the best 3-point shooters in the NBA during the regular season but has largely disappeared during these playoffs.\n\n-- Gary Washburn: This needs to be a Jayson Tatum series and that does not necessarily mean scoring. Tatum needs to rebound, be a playmaker, and play strong defense. The Mavericks don't have a player who can consistently guard him one-on-one and he needs to take advantage of any matchup, but don't get caught up in him matching Doncic basket for basket. He must be best all-around player in this series, prove he's Top-5 Tatum, and make his teammates better.\n\n\u00a92024 The Dallas Morning News. Visit dallasnews.com.

Here's our betting breakdown on the spread, total and moneyline for Game 1 between the Celtics and Mavericks tonight with odds via sportsbooks in New Jersey:\n\nCeltics vs. Mavericks spread: Celtics -6.5 (-106), Mavericks +6.5 (-110)\n\nLooking at both teams track records so far this postseason, Boston's clearly been better at getting out of the gate to begin a series.\n\nThe Celtics are 3-0 in Game 1s this postseason, winning by 20+ points versus the Heat and Cavaliers, then needing overtime to beat the Pacers 133-128 in the conference semifinals.\n\nOn the flip side, the Mavericks are the complete opposite. Besides beating the Timberwolves 108-105 in Game 1 of the third round, Dallas dropped each of its prior Game 1s, losing by double digits in both affairs in the process (12-point loss at Clippers and 22-point defeat at Thunder).\n\nWhile these trends seemingly point directly to Boston having a dominant Game 1, bet the opposite happens here.\n\nBoth these organizations have played in tightly contested games throughout the playoffs.\n\nThe Celtics had three of four games versus the Pacers be decided by five points or less and the Mavericks had three of their five game series against the Timberwolves come down to an outcome of five or fewer points.\n\nFurthermore, Dallas is 7-3 against the spread (ATS) in its previous 10 games and Boston has failed to cover in five of its last six contests, including three of those coming on its home court.\n\nI believe we're in for a close game to start this series off and would wager on the Mavericks to cover the spread.\n\nDraftKings Sportsbook has the best available price for Mavericks +6.5 at -110 (Bet $110 to win $100).\n\nPrediction: Mavericks +6.5 (-110)\n\nMore: Celtics vs. Mavericks 2024 NBA Finals: Odds, picks and prediction for title, Finals MVP\n\nCeltics vs. Mavericks total: Over 214.5 points (-109), Under 214.5 points (-105)\n\nThrough three rounds of the postseason, the Mavericks and Celtics have been dominant on both ends of the floor. Each organization ranks top-six in points per game (PPG) and opponents points per game (OPPG).\n\nEven with recent trends of the totals going under or below the projected line in the playoffs, the side to wager on here is the over.\n\nWhen it comes down to the Celtics, you have to look at the differences in their opponents.\n\nIn the first two rounds, they faced inferior offenses in the Heat and Cavaliers, both of whom are bottom-three this postseason in PPG.\n\nThen they had a completely different opponent in the conference finals, facing a Pacers' squad that leads the playoffs in PPG (113.9)\n\nA similar comparison can be made about who the Mavericks' have faced, with two low-scoring opponents in the Clippers and Thunder, before taking on a Timberwolves team that ranks middle of the pack (107.5 PPG).\n\nWhen these two teams faced off in the regular season, they combined to score 229 or points in both games, including a 248-point outburst on Mar. 1 at TD Garden.\n\nWhile I don't think we'll see that in Game 1, all there needs to be is at least 215 points here and I'm betting on these two franchises to have higher scoring contests earlier on in these matchups and the totals going lower as the series progresses.\n\nBetRivers has the best odds for over 214.5 points with a current price of -109 (Bet $109 to win $100).\n\nPrediction: Over 214.5 points (-109)\n\nMLB: Aaron Judge or Juan Soto: Who's the AL MVP this season? Here's what the current odds say\n\nCeltics vs. Mavericks moneyline: Celtics -230 (Bet $230 to win $100), Mavericks +205 (Bet $100 to win $205)\n\nIn most series, there's a feeling out process between two teams before the gameplay gets tighter and tighter when getting closer to crowning a champion.\n\nWhether it's the Mavericks or Celtics, don't be shocked if one team jumps out to a large lead before the other jumps back in and makes it a close contest.\n\nThere's no doubt that these two franchises will easily be playing their toughest opponent to date.\n\nNobody would be surprised if the Mavericks do pull off the upset here as a near 2/1 underdog if the sensational backcourt of Kyrie Irving and Luka Doncic can continue to play at their highest level on the biggest stage.\n\nWith that being said, I believe Dallas comes up just short, with the combo of the Celtics' Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown plus the depth of Boston's bench will be too much to overcome on the road in Game 1.\n\nTo get the best price of Celtics' moneyline, go to DraftKings Sportsbook where they're currently -230 (Bet $230 to win $100) to take a 1-0 series lead in the NBA Finals.", "source": {"uri":

It helped Brown earn the NBA's first $300 million contract last summer. And, Tatum is expected to get one this offseason.\n\nThe team has branded the All-Stars as \"The Jays\" in a marketing campaign shown during games that pitted them against one another in mini competitions.\n\nIt has created natural comparisons between them along the way, fostering an atmosphere in which fans and sports pundits alike have tried to parse out which one of them is better, whose spot is most untouchable on the roster and which of them is more pivotal to the Celtics' success as they prepare to lead the team to the franchise's 18th NBA title.\n\nIt reached a new level last week during a segment on ESPN's \"Get Up\" in which panelists debated whether the 26-year-old Tatum expressed excitement or disappointment while watching the 27-year-old Brown garner Eastern Conference finals MVP honors.\n\n\"I think it's unfair to both of them,\" Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said of what he viewed as an attempt to manufacture friction between the two stars.\n\nBut even as Tatum and Brown have distinguished themselves as the most important players on Boston's roster and the keys to the Celtics' fate in their NBA Finals matchup with the Dallas Mavericks, Mazzulla has hope that people will start viewing them differently.\n\n\"They're, like, two completely different people. They're two completely different players,\" Mazzulla said. \"They're great teammates, they love each other and they go about winning and they go about their process in a different way. Why they have to always be lumped together I think is unfair.\"\n\nTatum and Brown, along with Al Horford, are the only returning starters from the 2021-22 team that lost to the Golden State Warriors in six games in the Finals after holding a 2-1 series lead.\n\nWhile Horford has taken on mostly a reserve role this season, backing up 7-footer Kristaps Porzingis, Tatum and Brown have taken their play up a notch.\n\nTatum's scoring numbers have remained steady from the regular season (26.9 per game) into the playoffs (26.0), while his rebounding has increased from 8.1 to 10.4 per game in the postseason. Brown, too, has seen jumps in those categories, going from 23.0 points and 5.5 rebounds per game to 25.0 points and 6.1 rebounds in the playoffs.\n\nTatum believes they've both used lessons from the 2022 NBA Finals' loss, as well as last year's conference finals loss to Miami, to grow into players more equipped to accomplish their championship goal this time around.\n\n\"Obviously, we've been there before, we came up short,\" Tatum said. \"You don't always get a second chance, so really just looking at it as a second chance and trying to simplify things as much as we can.\"\n\nAnd being each other's biggest cheerleaders, too.\n\nAfter Brown made a game-tying 3-pointer late in Game 1 of the conference finals matchup with Indiana to send the game to overtime in an eventual Celtics' victory, the highest praise came from Tatum.\n\n\"Big time players make big time plays,\" Tatum said of Brown.\n\nFor Brown, this season has been about focusing on the expectations he has for himself and not worrying about others' perception of him.\n\nInitially, when he was asked about not being included on either the All-NBA or All-Defensive teams, he shrugged it off, saying his attention was focused on getting back to the NBA Finals.\n\nAfter he was named conference finals MVP, he acknowledged it did offer at least some motivation, particularly on the defensive side of the ball which he said he put most of his work into this past offseason.\n\n\"As time has gone by and I got to this point, I stopped caring,\" Brown said. \"I don't care who sees what, as long as my city knows my value, my team knows my value, my family -- that's all I really care about.\"\n\nMazzulla believes the reason the relationship between Brown and Tatum is so often talked about is rooted in outside disbelief that their dynamic doesn't breed any rivalry between them.\n\n\"At the end of the day, like, those two guys, their relationship is their relationship,\" Mazzulla said. \"They love each other. They push each other every single day in practice. They communicate with each other, but they go about it differently. And, I think they both get it unfair being compared to each other. They're different. And we see other duos around the league don't have to go through that. ... It's because they've been so successful their entire careers, they've been able to for so long stay in success at a high level.\"\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kyle_hightower@register-herald.com", "name": "Kyle Hightower", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Mazzulla", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Mazzulla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/register-herald.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/d5/9d58cd29-542e-5951-8367-c5f09cc06f82/6642d5ac8a4e1.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

But if recent Celtics history, and the star power of Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving have taught us anything, it's that these Finals are destined to be a long, tight series.\n\nAmid all the drama and scrutiny, here's how Boston can pull out Banner 18:\n\n1. Feed Porzingis\n\nThe Celtics' clearest matchup advantage lies with the murky status of Kristaps Porzingis.\n\nPorzingis is expected to play in these Finals, but it's unclear exactly when or how many minutes he will be allowed to play coming off a calf strain. Whenever the 7-footer hits the floor, the Celtics should waste no time finding him. He can post up or shoot over every Mavericks rotation regular, and threaten Dallas with pick-and-pop 3s like no opposing center has yet these playoffs.\n\nHe is the solution to the Mavericks' first-rate rim protection, and any switching defense Dallas might opt for against the Celtics' star wings.\n\nPorzingis went 4 of 8 on 3-pointers in their last matchup, a Boston rout on March 1 that started with him canning multiple 3s in the first quarter. Much has changed since then, including a Mavericks team that quickly coalesced into a legit championship contender. But the mismatch Porzingis presents remains, and the Celtics should exploit it whenever they can.\n\n2. Attack Doncic on defense\n\nA tactic as old as time: forcing the opponent's best offensive player to work overtime on defense.\n\nFatigue them, mentally and physically. Force them to chase, think and defend. One possession after another after another.\n\nDoncic, at 6-foot-7 and 230 pounds, is no stranger to this plan. He's also held his own in the playoffs defensively, despite dealing with various minor injuries. The Celtics are not armed with the type of player best-equipped to beat him -- lightning-quick ball-handlers who can shoot -- but they can force Doncic to switch onto Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown or chase Derrick White around screens.\n\nBoston should probably brace for a Doncic avalanche on offense. It's coming.\n\nDoncic might even win a game or two on his own. The 25-year-old star is that good, and the proof is in these playoffs, when he knocked off three of the West's top four seeds, all 50-win teams. Kyrie Irving, on the other hand, is a different story.\n\nOklahoma City successfully harassed the 32-year-old with athletic primary defenders, encroaching double teams and lots of defensive attention. Irving averaged fewer than 15 points per game entering the Mavs' clinching Game 6 win in that series and nearly seven assists. Irving yielded the ball to lesser teammates (P.J. Washington, Derrick Jones Jr. and Josh Green, to name a few), who punished OKC on open 3-point looks.\n\nIt was a pick-your-poison proposition the Thunder handled wisely. With extra pressure on Doncic and Irving, Dallas posted a 112 offensive rating in that series, a rating that would have ranked bottom-10 over the regular season. The pitfall OKC found -- missing its own 3-pointers -- is an area Boston should avoid, as the second-best shooting team in the league by effective field goal percentage.\n\nThough, there is a balance here. Blitzing Irving cannot lead to Doncic playing 4-on-3 behind that initial pressure. He will kill the Celtics. Boston should pressure Irving with the intent of guiding the ball to the Mavericks' wings and centers as best it can, the least dangerous place it could be with two stars on the floor.\n\nNot to mention, during the regular season, Dallas went just 6-5 in games Irving played at least 15 minutes and scored fewer than 20 points.\n\n4. Keep an eye on transition\n\nThe Celtics' transition defense has been excellent all season, with two notable Game 2 exceptions: in the first round versus Miami and second round against Cleveland.\n\nThey lost both of those nights, a function of inconsistent defensive focus and preposterously hot opponent shooting. Dallas may step into similar shooting luck one night against Boston, but the Celtics can't give up anything easy.\n\nThe Mavericks will run selectively, often with Doncic or Irving hitting hit-ahead passes before the defense knows what has happened. Dallas is adding 3.4 points per 100 possessions off fast breaks in the playoffs, fourth-highest in the postseason per Cleaning the Glass, while the Celtics are at 0.1. Those three to four points could be the difference in any game this series, especially if Boston is slow to get back on multiple possessions.\n\n5. Play with purpose\n\nThe Celtics have come too far to let go of the rope now.\n\nThey cannot suffer from their own aimlessness against Luka and Co. The Mavericks will punish them for a lack of focus, lazing into stepback 3s and allowing easy baskets. They don't boast the same firepower or depth, but they know who they are and how they want to win.\n\nKnowing their talent advantage pads their margin for error, the Celtics have known to play with their food. But now it's time to eat.\n\nBecause if the Celtics match the Mavs' purpose and deliberately attack their weaknesses -- allowing corner 3s and lack of playmaking outside of Doncic and Irving -- long enough, it should pay off in a title.\n\n\u00a92024 MediaNews Group, Inc.

The Celtics enter the matchup both the heavy series (-225) and Game 1 (-6.5, -250) favorites, with Heavy's projections putting the Celtics' Game 1 win probability at 66%, with a spread of minus-5.\n\nThe Celtics haven't played since May 27th, when they eliminated the Indiana Pacers with a 105-102 win. On the other side, the Mavs have had less rest, securing their spot in the NBA Finals with a series-clinching 124-103 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nLet's take a look at the best bets for player props on both sides.\n\nWhile there is a logical reason to think the Mavericks will want to get Kyrie Irving going early in Game 1, the Celtics will not want Irving to gain the emotional upper hand with a quick start.\n\nTraditionally, Doncic has been the one to control the offense early, as he's scored in the first three minutes in each of his last five contests. Doncic is second in the NBA Playoffs in first-quarter points, with an average of 9.6 over 17 games.\n\nKyrie Irving Made Threes - Over 2.5 (-111)\n\nThe Celtics have allowed 33.8% shooting from the 3-point line over the span of the 2023-24 NBA Playoffs, but that number deserves context. Over their 14 playoff games, the Celtics have allowed 12.4 3-point attempts that were \"open\" (nearest defender 4-to-6 feet), with their opponents making a paltry 28.2% of those attempts. It's not great defense as much as bad shotmaking.\n\nAfter starting the playoffs averaging 8.2 3-point attempts per game against the Los Angeles Clippers, Irving backed off in the first five games of the Oklahoma City Thunder series, shooting it from deep just 3.2 times per contest. Since then (six games), he's back to attempting 7.0 3-pointers per game, making an average of 2.7.\n\nPlayer to Record 1+ Points, Rebounds, Assists, Blocks and Steals - Kristaps Porzingis (-160)\n\nBefore leaving Game 4 of the Eastern Conference First Round against the Miami Heat, Porzingis was riding quite a streak, recording the following:\n\nThe two issues to watch for are whether Porzingis is healthy and ready to play quality minutes and whether he's able to secure a steal. Familiarity playing alongside Doncic in the past paired with having relatively fresh legs will play a role in getting that steal.\n\nPlayer to Record a Double Double - Jayson Tatum (-135)\n\nTo say that this is the biggest game in Tatum's career would be an understatement. He's going to come out aggressively and should pass the 10-point threshold quickly. The rebounds will take longer, though, over his last 14 games, he's averaging 10.4 rebounds. Tatum has a double-double in six of his last seven and 10 of his last 12 games, the only misses in a game against the Pacers where both teams shot over 52% and a stinker against the Cleveland Cavaliers where they were outrebounded 44-31.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_dunlap@heavy.com", "name": "Michael Dunlap", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2023 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Block (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Point (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1953924444-e1717616447838.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-27", "textStart": 441, "textEnd": 449}], "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

And then too, you're down on the road 18, they think that you can just hit a button and all of a sudden you're tired.\"\n\n\"No, man, you gotta win on the road. And it's hard as sh** to win on the road. And it's even more hard to close out on the road. But for all this other s**t that they can't control and that's out of control, get the f**k out of here with that. This is where we are with it.\" (13:15)\n\nGarnett points out that the Celtics can't control the health of their opponents. Injuries are an unfortunate part of the game, but the Celtics still had to face professional athletes who were determined to compete and win.\n\nThe Hall of Famer dismisses the idea that Boston's success should be discounted because their opponents were missing star players. He believes the Celtics' dominance throughout the season and playoffs speaks for itself.\n\nTo Garnett's point, the Celtics finished the regular season with a 64-18 record, the best in the league by a significant margin. They were 41-11 against Eastern Conference teams, underscoring their superiority. During the playoffs, Boston maintained this high level of performance, showcasing their depth and resilience.\n\nThey swept the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals, a series where the Pacers fought hard despite missing Tyrese Haliburton for two games.\n\nCritics have suggested that the Celtics' path was too easy, but Garnett argues that winning on the road and closing out games are incredibly challenging tasks, regardless of the opposition. He emphasizes that the Celtics not only had to overcome deficits but also had to deal with the pressure of performing away from home, which is no small feat in the playoffs.\n\nFurthermore, Garnett highlights the Celtics' comprehensive team effort. Boston was built to withstand adversity, with a deep roster capable of stepping up when needed. This resilience was evident throughout their playoff run, as different players took turns making significant contributions. The notion that their path was easy undermines the hard work and determination displayed by the entire team.\n\nIn the Eastern Conference Finals, the Celtics faced criticism for winning close games, but Garnett argues that these victories should be seen as a testament to their toughness and ability to execute under pressure. He believes that even with the injuries to their opponents, Boston's performance was impressive and deserving of respect.\n\nAs the Celtics prepare to face the Dallas Mavericks in the NBA Finals, Garnett's defense of his former team serves as a reminder of the unpredictability and challenges of the playoffs.\n\nThe path to a championship is never easy, and the Celtics have proven themselves to be a formidable team, ready to compete at the highest level. Garnett's passionate defense underscores the pride and belief he has in the Celtics, and he remains confident in their ability to win the title.\n\nThe Celtics Run Should Not Have Any Asterisk Next To It\n\nThe Celtics' run to the 2024 NBA Finals should not have any asterisk next to it. It's unfair to diminish their achievements because their opponents faced injuries. The Celtics maintained their intensity and focus, taking advantage of the opportunities presented to them without any intentional actions causing those injuries.\n\nIn the first round, the Celtics faced the Miami Heat, who were without Jimmy Butler and Terry Rozier. Despite these absences, the Celtics did not show any complacency, handling their business efficiently and defeating the Heat in five games. Their professional approach ensured they moved past the Heat with minimal fuss.\n\nThe second round saw the Celtics up against the Cleveland Cavaliers, who were missing key players Jarrett Allen and Donovan Mitchell due to injuries. Again, the Celtics showcased their dominance, taking care of the Cavaliers in five games. Injuries impacted the Cavaliers, but the Celtics' superior play ensured they capitalized on the situation effectively.\n\nIn the Eastern Conference Finals, the Celtics faced the Indiana Pacers. The Pacers were without Tyrese Haliburton for the final two games, but the Celtics still had to execute their game plan and perform at a high level to secure the sweep. Boston's ability to stay focused and maintain their performance levels was a testament to their championship-caliber mindset.\n\nIt's important to recognize that injuries are an unfortunate part of sports. The Celtics cannot be blamed for their opponents' misfortunes. They played who was in front of them and did so with a high degree of professionalism and skill. The narrative that their path was easier due to these injuries overlooks the fact that Boston was the best regular-season team in the league and played like it throughout the playoffs.\n\nHowever, there is one caveat: if the Celtics were to lose in the Finals and blame their lack of competition in earlier rounds for their defeat, that excuse would not hold weight. A true championship team prepares and adapts to any situation, regardless of the opposition. The Celtics' journey to the Finals has been impressive, and their focus should remain on finishing the job, not on the circumstances that led them there.\n\nThe Celtics' run to the Finals deserves full recognition and respect. They have proven themselves as a dominant force in the league, and any attempt to undermine their achievements with an asterisk is misguided and unjustified.\n\nRelated: 2024 NBA Finals: Celtics vs. Mavericks (Analysis, Comparison, Prediction)\n\nThank you for being a valued reader of Fadeaway World.

During the media press conference on Wednesday, the 26-year-old star broke down what it means to be on the cusp of history with such a historic franchise.\n\n\"If you want to be one of the greats to put on this uniform, every great before you won a championship. The expectations are obviously different here,\" Tatum said, via ESPN's Tim Bontemps. \"It takes special players to be here and to be a part of an environment like that.\"\n\nThe Celtics and Lakers are currently tied at 17 championships apiece, but the Celtics have a chance to re-take their spot as the winningest team with a victory in this series. for Tatum, he's humbled to think about those who came before him.\n\n\"We only hang NBA championship banners, right? 17 of them,\" Tatum said. \"Some of the greatest players to ever play this game wore this uniform. All of us are honored to follow in their footsteps, the way they paved for us to live out our dream.\"\n\nSo far, Tatum (26 years old) and Brown (27 years old) have withstood all of the trade rumors over the years and they've put together one of the most impressive runs by any duo in modern NBA history -- even if it hasn't come with a title. If they lose now to the Mavericks, many believe changes will be warranted, but Jayson wants to put all of that aside to live fully in the moment.\n\n\"I don't think about the future or what this may mean for me down the road,\" Tatum said. \"As simple as it sounds, just try to stay present, stay in the moment, enjoy it, right? Keep talking about pressure, pressure, pressure... It's the NBA Finals. This s--- is supposed to be fun.\"\n\nWith season averages of 26.9 points, 8.1 rebounds, and 4.9 assists per game on 47.1% shooting, Tatum was an MVP frontrunner all season long and now it's time to back it up. After cruising through the regular season and then through the East playoffs, the Celtics are out of excuses and expectations couldn't be higher.\n\nJaylen Brown Says The Celtics Are Ready To Cement Their Legacy\n\nDespite their youth, the Celtics have been in this position before. Besides the 21 other times they've advanced to the final round, this particular group made a similar run back in 2022. In that series, against the Warriors, Tatum and Brown were ultimately defeated in six games against a more experienced and well-rounded roster.\n\nWith a chance to come out on the winning end this time, Jaylen Brown knows the importance of the moment ahead and he's ready to seize the moment and establish a lasting legacy with the franchise.\n\n\"We've been able to go through the experiences of having success but not having success at the same time. I think to solidify the ultimate goal is to get over the hump and win,\" said Brown. \"I think that will add a lot to our legacy. But as of right now, that story is kind of still untold.\"\n\nWith Game 1 set to kick off tomorrow, it won't be long now before we find out if the Celtics duo, who were both drafted 3rd overall, are for real or if they're just blowing smoke. Judging from how they've looked in the playoffs so far, they aren't messing around and they are determined to give the Mavericks everything they've got.\n\nRelated: Jayson Tatum Gets Real On His Run With Kyrie Irving: \"It's Not Just Talent That Takes You Over The Top...\"\n\nThank you for being a valued reader of Fadeaway World.

It helped Brown earn the NBA's first $300 million contract last summer. And, Tatum is expected to get one this offseason.\n\nThe team has branded the All-Stars as \"The Jays\" in a marketing campaign shown during games that pitted them against one another in mini competitions.\n\nIt has created natural comparisons between them along the way, fostering an atmosphere in which fans and sports pundits alike have tried to parse out which one of them is better, whose spot is most untouchable on the roster and which of them is more pivotal to the Celtics' success as they prepare to lead the team to the franchise's 18th NBA title.\n\nIt reached a new level last week during a segment on ESPN's \"Get Up\" in which panelists debated whether the 26-year-old Tatum expressed excitement or disappointment while watching the 27-year-old Brown garner Eastern Conference Finals MVP honors.\n\n\"I think it's unfair to both of them,\" Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said of what he viewed as an attempt to manufacture friction between the two stars.\n\nBut even as Tatum and Brown have distinguished themselves as the most important players on Boston's roster and the keys to the Celtics' fate in their NBA Finals matchup with the Dallas Mavericks, Mazzulla has hope that people will start viewing them differently.\n\n\"They're, like, two completely different people. They're two completely different players,\" Mazzulla said. \"They're great teammates, they love each other and they go about winning and they go about their process in a different way. Why they have to always be lumped together I think is unfair.\"\n\nTatum and Brown, along with Al Horford, are the only returning starters from the 2021-22 team that lost to the Golden State Warriors in six games in the Finals after holding a 2-1 series lead.\n\nWhile Horford has taken on mostly a reserve role this season, backing up 7-footer Kristaps Porzingis, Tatum and Brown have taken their play up a notch.\n\nTatum's scoring numbers have remained steady from the regular season (26.9 per game) into the playoffs (26.0), while his rebounding has increased from 8.1 to 10.4 per game in the postseason. Brown, too, has seen jumps in those categories, going from 23.0 points and 5.5 rebounds per game to 25.0 points and 6.1 rebounds in the playoffs.\n\nTatum believes they've both used lessons from the 2022 NBA Finals' loss, as well as last year's conference finals loss to Miami, to grow into players more equipped to accomplish their championship goal this time around.\n\n\"Obviously, we've been there before, we came up short,\" Tatum said. \"You don't always get a second chance, so really just looking at it as a second chance and trying to simplify things as much as we can.\"\n\nAnd being each other's biggest cheerleaders, too.\n\nAfter Brown made a game-tying 3-pointer late in Game 1 of the conference finals matchup with Indiana to send the game to overtime in an eventual Celtics' victory, the highest praise came from Tatum.\n\n\"Big time players make big time plays,\" Tatum said of Brown.\n\nFor Brown, this season has been about focusing on the expectations he has for himself and not worrying about others' perception of him.\n\nInitially, when he was asked about not being included on either the All-NBA or All-Defensive teams, he shrugged it off, saying his attention was focused on getting back to the NBA Finals.\n\nAfter he was named conference finals MVP, he acknowledged it did offer at least some motivation, particularly on the defensive side of the ball which he said he put most of his work into this past offseason.\n\n\"As time has gone by and I got to this point, I stopped caring,\" Brown said. \"I don't care who sees what, as long as my city knows my value, my team knows my value, my family -- that's all I really care about.\"\n\nMazzulla believes the reason the relationship between Brown and Tatum is so often talked about is rooted in outside disbelief that their dynamic doesn't breed any rivalry between them.\n\n\"At the end of the day, like, those two guys, their relationship is their relationship,\" Mazzulla said. \"They love each other. They push each other every single day in practice. They communicate with each other, but they go about it differently. And, I think they both get it unfair being compared to each other. They're different. And we see other duos around the league don't have to go through that. ...

The Sporting News has all the information you need to attend Game 1 of this best-of-seven series, including ticket prices, seat information, and more.\n\nOne of the two most winningest franchises in NBA history, Boston will be looking for just its second NBA Finals win since the end of the Larry Bird dynasty in the 1980s. Dallas, meanwhile, will be looking for just its second championship ever, having last won in 2011 with Dirk Nowitzki.\n\nThis championship series will certainly be star-studded. Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown will be joined by a dynamic supporting cast that features former Mav Kristaps Porzingis as well as Jrue Holiday, Derrick White, and Al Horford. Joe Mazzulla's Celts have been one of the best teams on both sides of the floor all season long.\n\nBut Jason Kidd's Mavericks are no slouches. Luka Doncic has looked like the best player in the world this postseason, and running mate Kyrie Irving finally seems to be at peace and ready to take back over the league.

The winningest team in NBA history has played in six of the last eight Eastern Conference Finals. Boston's best player, Jayson Tatum, has already played in 19 playoff series and is still only 26 years old.\n\nAll of that makes it no surprise to see the Celtics in their second NBA Finals in three seasons. And this time, their appearance in the NBA's championship round is a little more tense on paper.\n\nREAD MORE: Ranking the 14 greatest NBA Finals of all time.\n\nThat's because these Celtics were built to win a title. They have two All-Stars (Tatum and Jaylen Brown) surrounded by a roster stacked with other All-Star-caliber players and difference-makers. They also hail from the East, which is inarguably the easier path to the Finals between the NBA's two conferences. If the Celtics don't win this title, it's hard to see this iteration of the team ever getting over the hump. Full stop.\n\nWith all of that said, we'll have plenty of time to dive deeper into these narratives in a few weeks. For now, it's worth revisiting the steps the Celtics took to build a juggernaut that qualified for this year's NBA Finals.\n\n1. Taking advantage of the Milwaukee Bucks' desperation for Damian Lillard\n\nThis time last year, it wasn't an abject certainty that Giannis Antetokounmpo would be a Buck for the duration of his entire NBA career. Well, actually, at this point in time, it still isn't. But it helps that Milwaukee traded for perennial All-Star Damian Lillard with the aim of giving Antetokounmpo a top-flight running mate.\n\nHowever, to acquire Lillard in a blockbuster trade with the Portland Trail Blazers, the Bucks had to give up some sizable assets. One of them was point guard Jrue Holiday, arguably the NBA's best point-of-attack defender. With rebuilding Portland having no need for an older veteran guard like Holiday, it quickly shipped him off to the win-now Celtics.\n\nNow, Holiday anchors a tenacious and elite Boston defense while usually making timely and smart plays on offense. This only happened because the Bucks were so eager for Lillard in the first place.\n\n2. Selling high on Marcus Smart when they still could\n\nFrom a glance, Smart might be one of the greatest Celtics of all time. The guard made three All-Defensive First Teams and was the 2022 Defensive Player of the Year during his career in green. He was once rightfully considered an important long-term core piece for Boston alongside Tatum and Brown.\n\nUntil he wasn't.\n\nAfter the Celtics' disappointing collapse in last year's Eastern Conference Finals, they decided to sell high on Smart. They offloaded the defense-first point guard in a three-team deal that helped completely remodel their starting lineup. In return, Boston received a much-needed floor-spacer in center Kristaps Porzingis, who gives the Celtics another top-flight three-point shooter and offensive player.\n\nWhile the Celtics are a deep and great team without Porzingis's services, he undoubtedly gives them another extremely dangerous element. This never happens without a tough and shrewd trade of Smart.\n\n3. Believing in Derrick White\n\nOnce upon a time, White was just another bog standard cog-in-the-machine for the San Antonio Spurs. By no means was he a bad player, but there was little chance the guard would ever really flourish once the Spurs entered an earnest rebuild. The Celtics thought as much because they wanted to capitalize on his potential.\n\nOnce San Antonio began trying to bottom out, Boston swooped in with a modest 2022 trade centered around White eventually shining in a winning environment. He's done that and then some ever since.\n\nIn two seasons with the Celtics, White has morphed into an elite high-volume three-point shooter. Mix that up with his All-NBA-caliber defense, and the Celtics have constructed one of the more useful \"winning\" backcourts in the NBA. White fits like a perfect puzzle piece with the Celtics' starters.\n\nEven despite their recent success, these Celtics are proof that NBA contenders should never be afraid to make bold or shrewd trades.\n\nSometimes, a few shake-ups are exactly what's necessary to compete for a title.\n\nMeet NBA Draft prospect Kyle Filipowski, the Duke star ready to reintroduce himself in the pros The latest

We kind of took it for granted at certain moments.\"\n\nAnd now?\n\n\"I'm not thinking about what it would mean for my legacy or anything like that,\" he said. \"Just excited to play some basketball ... and go out there and try to get the job done.\"\n\nDallas' Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving see it as their first opportunity to make good on a partnership that began late last season after Irving was traded from Brooklyn following a tumultuous run of two-plus seasons with the Nets.\n\nBut the duo was still learning to play with each other during their truncated time together last season and didn't make it to the postseason. After a slow start this season, they found cohesion after the All-Star break and emerged from a deep Western Conference field.\n\nFor Irving, it has been a reminder that success can be fleeting. He won his lone championship with Cleveland in 2016 and has played with three teams over the past eight years. His time in Dallas has reinvigorated him.\n\n\"These young guys are very hungry. They want a championship. I want a championship,\" he said. \"So our feelings are very mutual. But I've always reminded them that this is a process. Failure is going to be part of this, too. Get it out your mind that this is about to be a clean sweep or everything is about to feel good throughout this journey and all that.\n\n\"I'm just very real, very honest. That's what's helped me grow as a leader.\"\n\nDoncic credits the partnership with Irving for uncorking the potential of a team that entered the postseason as a fifth seed.\n\n\"His leadership is amazing,\" Doncic said. \"The way he connects us. I think me and Kyrie are the leaders of this team, but he's the one that's been in the Finals. He's the one that won in the Finals. He's the one that is really leading it.\"\n\nThey'll matchup with a Boston team playing like a group that has learned from its recent shortcomings. That was exhibited during a 64-win regular season that established it as a favorite to raise the franchise's 18th championship banner entering the postseason.\n\nThrough the first three rounds, the Celtics have met the challenge, losing just two games along the way under the guidance of second-year coach Joe Mazzulla.\n\nThey've also benefited from an offseason shakeup of its roster that saw longtime emotional leader Marcus Smart and former NBA Sixth Man of the Year Malcolm Brogdon traded in favor of 7-footer Kristaps Porzingis and Jrue Holiday, who won a championship with Milwaukee in 2021.\n\nBrown said a core that features seven players from the 2022 team that lost in the Finals to Golden State, is up to the challenge.\n\n\"I think this is a special group. I really do,\" Brown said. \"We've been able to go through the experiences of having success but not having success at the same time. I think to solidify the ultimate goal is to get over the hump and win. I think that will add a lot to our legacy. But as of right now, that story is kind of still untold.\"\n\nCOACHING PERSPECTIVES\n\nThis stage is nothing new to Mavericks coach Jason Kidd, who is in the Finals for the fifth time as a player or coach.\n\nHe has experienced lows, such as losing back-to-back trips to the Finals in 2002 and 2003 as a player with the New Jersey Nets. He has also seen success, earning his lone title as a player with Dallas in 2011 at age 38 and one as an assistant on the Lakers 2020 championship team.\n\nThe biggest lesson he has taken away is to approach it like business and be ready to live with the results. That has been his message to his team throughout these playoffs.\n\n\"This is the best of the best at the highest level,\" Kidd said. \"It's fun. That's what the Finals are all about, is seeing what team is going to step forward and take advantage of mistakes.\"\n\nMazzulla was an assistant on Ime Udoka's staff in 2022. What he learned from that experience is that the details of winning never change, even on this stage.\n\n\"The toughest team will win,\" Mazzulla said. \"The team that makes the most plays will win. The team that can execute the details at a high level will win. It's no different.\"\n\nFRIENDS AND COMPETITORS\n\nIrving is ready for what he expects to be an icy greeting from Boston's home crowd for Game 1 on Thursday.\n\nCeltics fans haven't held a high opinion of him since he ended two disappointing seasons in Boston by leaving for the Nets and joining Kevin Durant in free agency in 2019.\n\nHe then rankled the Boston faithful even more when he flipped his middle finger at fans after making a shot during Brooklyn's first round playoff series loss to the Celtics in 2022. But he said he is looking forward to matching up with \"brothers\" and former teammates Tatum and Brown.\n\n\"They've gotten tremendously better. They've led their team to this point. So I'm proud of them,\" Irving said. \"I'm looking forward to the competition because this is what we've all strived for since we were kids, basketball at this level playing against the best of the best.\"", "source": {"uri": "recordherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Record Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki",

It's kind of been that my whole career in a sense. Just being booed when you were drafted to saying you were overpaid, saying you were overpaid again. It's been that the whole journey for me. It just becomes another headline.\"\n\nThe 27-year-old is preparing for his second NBA Finals appearance on Thursday, as the Celtics are set to play the Dallas Mavericks in the championship round. He's been a vocal leader for Boston this playoffs and has maintained an impressive intensity on both ends of the floor throughout the playoffs.\n\nTatum, his partner in crime, has also learned to ignore the constant chatter from the media and other outlets.\n\n\"It's my mom, my grandma, my family and friends. They're more bothered by it than me,\" he admitted when asked about the scrutiny he faces. \"Just a long break without NBA basketball, so [the media] had to overanalyze every little thing, have something to talk about. Did it get old? Yeah. But, you know, it's the Finals. They wouldn't talk about me if I wasn't good, so ... Try to take some positives out of it and change the channel.\"\n\nThe best way for the Celtics to silence the noise is simple: hang Banner No. 18 in the rafters. Tatum and Brown have been to four Eastern Conference Finals in the last five years and have become accustomed to lengthy playoff runs. However, neither star has been able to earn themselves a ring thus far, but doing so this June would likely hush a lot of doubters.\n\nIt won't be easy, though. Mavericks star Luka Doncic is eager for his first title as well, and ex-Celtic Kyrie Irving knows what it takes to win on the biggest stage.\n\n\"That's a great player over there, so it's going to be a full-team effort,\" Brown remarked when asked how the Celtics can slow down Irving. \"Him and Luka. Making sure we're alert, making sure we're back in transition, and do the best we can.\"\n\nWhy Jrue Holiday is so impressed by Tatum and Brown\n\nCeltics guard Jrue Holiday definitely qualifies as an NBA veteran. He's in his thirties and has been in the league since 2009.\n\nAs a result, he's seen plenty, yet even he's been shocked by the disrespect Tatum and Brown face.\n\n\"The pressure that J.B. and J.T. have to take on is something different,\" he told the media on Wednesday. \"I've told them this before, but it's really impressive how they handle themselves, how they stay professional, how they still come out every game and do what they do. Yeah, I think it's extremely impressive how they do that.\"\n\nHoliday acknowledged that he's witnessed other players, such as Milwaukee Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo, get dissected unfairly by the media. But, in his opinion, that still doesn't compare to what Tatum and Brown deal with.\n\n\"I would say that I probably don't take a bulk of the pressure because we have Jayson and Jaylen on our team,\" Holiday said.\n\nMedia condemnation aside, the Celtics are more concerned with taking down the Mavs. Despite this year being his first time playing for Boston, Holiday shares the hunger for a championship that Tatum, Brown, and the rest of the C's have displayed this season.\n\n\"I think this team really wants to win,\" the 2021 NBA champion said. \"I know they've been to the Eastern Conference Finals a million times. They've been to the Finals. They've been to the top, just didn't execute the way they wanted to. Now that we're here, we want to get the job done.\"", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniel_donabedian@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Daniel Donabedian", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giannis_Antetokounmpo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Giannis Antetokounmpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Celtics-Jayson-Tatum-Jaylen-Brown-respond-to-harsh-criticism-before-NBA-Finals.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

His first appearance was a disappointing one, but Brown's improvement has been immense over the past couple of seasons. As a three-time All Star and one-time second-team All-NBA selection, Brown is on the perfect track to capture his first NBA Championship.\n\nThe Boston Celtics will be led by Brown and Jayson Tatum as they are in pursuit of beating the Dallas Mavericks in the 2024 Finals. Brown earned the 2024 Eastern Conference Finals MVP, which was a brilliant feat for the budding star. With all the momentum and confidence on Brown's hands, playing on the court against the Mavericks to wrap up an impeccable campaign will be a fantastic sight for the Celtics fanbase.\n\nIt will be an arduous and grueling series for Brown, but here are a couple of predictions for his 2024 NBA Finals.\n\n*Watch NBA games LIVE with fuboTV (click for a free trial)*\n\nJaylen Brown limits Luka Doncic to less than 40% FG in at least two games\n\nIn the two regular season victories for Boston, Brown was the main man tasked in containing Luka Doncic. He still had an impressive showing against the Celtics, but Brown made him work for a plethora of possessions. The strength and basketball IQ of Doncic is spectacular, thus it makes Brown the best option to try and stay in front of him.\n\nThe Mavericks will have a bevy of schemes to force either Kristaps Porzingis or Al Horford defend Doncic in the perimeter, but the Celtics will have counters to limit these kind of situations. Boston is a squad that has the least tendency to blitz ball handlers on pick-and-roll situations, so let's see how they will contain Doncic. Several defensive options will be great for the Celtics, but it will be a high likelihood for Brown to be the main reason for Doncic's down games.\n\nBrown records 5+ assists for at least three games\n\nJaylen Brown has the reputation of being a ball-dominant individual or for some, he may even be a ball hog. For other NBA pundits, that is one primary reason on why the tandem of Brown and Tatum will not work, but they have proven to excel in their seven seasons together. In both contests against Dallas this year, Brown tallied nine combined assists, so there is an increased likelihood he will average around 3.5-4 APG in the finals.\n\nEven if he is not known as a tremendous playmaker, there will be a myriad of opportunities to dish it off to Derrick White or Jrue Holiday for wide-open corner threes. Moreover, Porzingis will be back and healthy for the finals, which will be a welcome sight for Brown because of the commendable chemistry they have built throughout the season.\n\nBrown scores 30+ points in at least three games\n\nSimilar to the assist totals, Brown's scoring production has been excellent against the Mavericks, and there is a legitimate chance that will continue. Their best perimeter defender will be guarding Tatum for the majority of the night, so Brown will get the second or third-best defender on the floor. In the two outings against the Mavericks this year, Brown eclipsed the 25-point plateau.\n\nElevating that to 30 points in the NBA Finals is a plausible scenario, and the Celtics will need an outstanding series for Brown if they want to win it all. A ton of three-pointers will be attempted in the next series, and that will bring a huge advantage to the offensive firepower of the Celtics.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_goal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Field goal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Earth_Lights", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Earth Lights", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Jaylen-Brown-bold-predictions-for-Celtics-vs.-Mavericks-NBA-Finals.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

Some of the greatest players to ever play this game wore this uniform. All of us are honored to follow in their footsteps, the way they paved for us to live out our dream.\n\n\"Essentially, yeah, if you want to be one of the greats to put on this uniform, every great before you won a championship. That's what we try to play for every single season. The expectations are obviously different here. It takes special players to be here and to be a part of an environment like that.\"\n\nTatum and the Celtics are more than familiar with the pressures that come with playing here - particularly after knocking on the door so often over the past several years. Since the start of the 2017 playoffs, the Celtics have reached the Eastern Conference finals six times, and are appearing in the league's championship round for a second time in three years.\n\nOver those eight years, Boston has played in more playoff games - 126 - than any other team in NBA history without winning a championship, all while playing for a franchise that's hoping to move past its forever rival, the Los Angeles Lakers, and back into pole position among all teams in terms of titles won.\n\nTatum, though, said he doesn't spend a lot of time thinking about the future, or what winning a title would mean to him.\n\n\"Yeah, honestly, I don't think about the future or what this may mean for me down the road,\" Tatum said. \"As simple as it sounds, just try to stay present, stay in the moment, enjoy it, right? Keep talking about pressure, pressure, pressure... It's the NBA Finals. This s--- is supposed to be fun.\n\n\"That's kind of where I'm at with it. I'm in the NBA Finals. I have a second opportunity to win a championship. I want to enjoy it. I want to enjoy the moment, enjoy it with my teammates and my family.\n\n\"So that's where my narrow focus is at: competing at a high level, finally getting to play tomorrow, just having fun. Just going out there and doing what I love to do.\"\n\nJoining Tatum and the rest of the Celtics on the court will be center Kristaps Porzingis, who confirmed Wednesday that he will make his return in Game 1 of the NBA Finals, more than five weeks after he suffered a calf strain in Game 4 of Boston's first round series victory over the Miami Heat.\n\nPorzingis, who has never played in a playoff game past the first round of the playoffs in his nine NBA seasons, admitted that he is still unsure what his conditioning level is heading into Game 1 after having such an extended layoff.\n\n\"Yeah, I think it's still kinda open,\" Porzingis said. \"It's still not super clear. I haven't had that much time. We'll see tomorrow night, and then go from there.\"\n\nAfter returning to practice Friday, Porzingis said he hasn't been doing too much strenuous work ahead of the Finals, and has had some Kiniseo tape on his lower right leg.\n\n\"I've been keeping it pretty light the last couple of days,\" Porzingis said. \"Just prepping my body, recovering as much as I can right before the game to be in the best shape possible for tomorrow. It's been pretty light. Today's gonna be another light day and, yeah, just prepping for tomorrow.\"\n\nThe Celtics have been preparing for this moment for years, after their many deep forays into the playoffs. They traded for Porzingis and Jrue Holiday last offseason, in the hopes of giving them more offensive versatility deep in the postseason. Boston then won 64 games in the regular season, and put up an equally dominant plus-11.7 net rating - with the gap between the Celtics and Oklahoma City Thunder in second the same as the one between Oklahoma City and the Indiana Pacers in 10th.\n\nThey then tore through the Eastern Conference with a 12-2 record, dispatching the Heat, Cleveland Cavaliers and Pacers in barely more than the minimum number of games required - helped, in part, by Jimmy Butler, Jarrett Allen, Donovan Mitchell and Tyrese Haliburton all missing time with injuries.\n\nNone of it will matter, though, if the Celtics can't finish the job and close the playoffs out with a victory over Dallas.\n\n\"I think this is a special group,\" Jaylen Brown said. \"I really do. The core group of it has been here for a few years now. We've been able to go through the experiences of having success but not having success at the same time.\n\n\"I think to solidify the ultimate goal is to get over the hump and win. I think that will add a lot to our legacy. But as of right now, that story is kind of still untold.\"", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2017 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Butler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Butler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donovan_Mitchell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donovan Mitchell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrett_Allen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jarrett Allen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0224%2Fr1295425_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

For the bulk of the season the Celtics were the class of the Eastern Conference, finishing with a 64-18 record -- the best in the NBA -- and 14 games ahead of the New York Knicks in the East.\n\nThat led many to wonder if the Celtics would be ready for the playoff run, and to many neutral observers, Boston's path to the Finals was a little easier than expected. Boston squared off with the Miami Heat in the first round, but without Jimmy Butler who was lost with an MCL sprain, Miami struggled against Boston.\n\nThen came the Cleveland Cavaliers, who began the series against the Celtics without rim protector Jarrett Allen, who missed the entire series with broken ribs. Add in a knee injury for Donovan Mitchell and you have a 4-1 series win for Boston, who moved on to face the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nWho were without Tyrese Haliburton for the final two games of that series, as the guard entered the Conference Finals with a groin injury that hampered him in the first two games, and saw him shut down for the final two.\n\nNow they'll take on the Dallas Mavericks, who stormed to the NBA Finals thanks to a tremendous playoff run from Kyrie Irving and Luka Don\u010di\u0107. Don\u010di\u0107 might be playing the best basketball on the planet right now, and in our ranking of the top 15 players in this series, he was a fairly easy choice for the top spot. He has averaged almost a triple-double in the playoffs, averaging 28.8 ppg, 9.6 rpg, and 8.8 apg over Dallas' 17 postseason games. With him, the Mavericks have the best player left standing, even if he is doing it on just one healthy leg as he deals with a knee sprain.\n\nThey also could pose some problems for the Celtics, given their length and athleticism. As outlined above Boston has seen a somewhat easier path to the Finals, but that will change starting Thursday night. Around Don\u010di\u0107 and Irving the Mavericks have players who can frustrate the Boston offense, including P.J. Washington and Derrick Jones Jr.\n\nWashington is big with a massive wingspan, and expect to see him on Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum for most of the series. Jones Jr. is one of the better athletes in the league, who can pose problems both near the rim and around the arc.\n\nDown low Dallas can turn to the combination of Dereck Lively II and Daniel Gafford. The rookie Lively is 7'1, has a massive wingspan, and has been Dallas' third best player on this run. Gafford is another springy rim protector who can disrupt shots and harrass Boston's scorers near the tin.\n\nThose players will need to step up if Dallas has a shot at pulling this off, but in the NBA Finals, anything can happen.\n\nIt all gets started this Thursday.

The Boston Celtics have been the favorite all year since Brad Stevens acquired Jrue Holiday and Kristaps Porzingis, and the Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown-led squad finished with the best record in the NBA (64-18). The Dallas Mavericks, despite doubts, have overcome the odds and made it to the Finals led by the superstar duo of Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving. With so much star power in the Finals, we have named the 10 players with the most pressure.\n\n1. Jayson Tatum\n\nPressure: Prove He Is Good Enough To Lead A Team To A Championship\n\nJayson Tatum's ascension to a top-5 player in the league has been remarkable, but his legacy hinges on his ability to lead the Boston Celtics to an NBA championship. Finishing 5th in MVP voting this year, Tatum has demonstrated his elite skill set and leadership on the court.\n\nWith the Celtics on the brink of capturing their record 18th championship, Tatum has the opportunity to etch his name alongside Celtics legends like Larry Bird, John Havlicek, and Paul Pierce. Winning the Finals MVP would further cement his status as one of the greats, especially if he can deliver when it matters most and make up for his subpar performance in the 2022 Finals when he averaged 21.5 points and 3.8 turnovers per game on 36.7% shooting from the field.\n\nHowever, the stakes are incredibly high. If Tatum fails to perform, the narrative surrounding his career could shift negatively. Critics and fans alike will question his ability to carry a team to the ultimate prize, potentially overshadowing his regular-season accolades and All-Star appearances.\n\nThe pressure is immense, as Tatum's legacy could take a significant hit if he doesn't rise to the occasion. For Tatum, this Finals is more than just about winning a title; it's about proving that he can be the cornerstone of a championship team.\n\n2. Jaylen Brown\n\nPressure: Quiet The Doubts About Him Being A Supermax Player\n\nJaylen Brown's supermax deal, the largest contract of all time, has placed a magnifying glass on his performance, especially in high-stakes games. As an All-Star and All-NBA talent, Brown has faced scrutiny over his ability to deliver in crucial moments.\n\nThis season, he has shown significant improvement, displaying strong handles and exuding confidence on the court. His impressive play earned him the Western Conference Finals MVP when he averaged 29.8 points per game, showcasing his growth and readiness to lead alongside Tatum.\n\nThe 2024 Finals present a pivotal moment for Brown to solidify his worth as a supermax player. A strong performance can silence doubters and validate his place as a key component of Boston's dynamic duo.\n\nConversely, if he falters, questions about his contract and ability to perform under pressure will resurface. This series is Brown's chance to rewrite the narrative from the 2022 Finals (23.5 PPG and 3.3 TOV on 43.1% shooting from the field) and prove that he can be a reliable leader on a championship team.\n\n3. Luka Doncic\n\nPressure: Show The World He Is As Impactful As Larry Bird\n\nLuka Doncic, often compared to Larry Bird, is now at a critical juncture in his career. At 25 years old, Doncic has already established himself as one of the most talented players in the league, but he has yet to secure an NBA title. Bird won his first championship at 24, and the pressure is on Doncic to deliver a similar impact. With an all-time great like Kyrie Irving by his side, Doncic has the support to make a deep playoff run, but the challenge of dethroning the Celtics looms large.\n\nWinning the NBA title and Finals MVP this year would not only validate Doncic's standing among the elite but also solidify his place in Mavericks history, potentially even surpassing Dirk Nowitzki. Achieving these milestones in the same year would elevate Doncic into the conversation of the top 50 players of all time, showcasing his extraordinary talent and competitive drive. This Finals is Doncic's chance to prove that he can lead his team to the ultimate victory and live up to the comparisons with Bird.\n\n4. Kyrie Irving\n\nPressure: Change His Legacy To Win Without LeBron James\n\nKyrie Irving's legacy has long been tied to his 2016 NBA title win alongside LeBron James, where he delivered a historic performance, including the game-winning shot in Game 7 over Stephen Curry. Since then, Irving has struggled to replicate that playoff success, with his teams failing to advance past the second round. Now, back in the Finals, Irving has a golden opportunity to reshape his legacy by winning a championship without LeBron, proving that he can lead a team to glory on his own terms.\n\nA second title would solidify Irving's status as one of the all-time great players, not just an all-time great point guard. It would validate his decision to forge his own path and showcase his ability to thrive under pressure. Failing to deliver, however, would reinforce the narrative that his success was largely dependent on LeBron, potentially diminishing his career achievements.\n\n5. Kristaps Porzingis\n\nPressure: Become The Missing Piece Of A Championship Puzzle\n\nKristaps Porzingis has experienced a rollercoaster career, from being a highly touted draft pick to dealing with significant injuries and a tumultuous exit from Dallas. Now with the Boston Celtics, Porzingis has a chance to reinvent himself and prove that he can be the missing piece in a championship-winning team. His unique combination of size, skill, and shooting ability makes him a valuable asset, and Boston's league-best record this season underscores the potential impact he can have.\n\nPorzingis hasn't played in the last two rounds of the playoffs due to injury, but his return for the Finals could be a game-changer. At 7'4\" with exceptional offensive skills, he has the ability to stretch the floor and create mismatches.\n\nA strong performance in the Finals would not only help Boston secure their 18th championship but also re-establish Porzingis as a star in the league. Conversely, if he underperforms, questions about his durability and consistency will continue to haunt him. This Finals is a pivotal moment for Porzingis to prove his worth and help Boston achieve their championship aspirations.\n\n6. Jrue Holiday\n\nPressure: Make His Hall Of Fame Case\n\nJrue Holiday has long been regarded as one of the best two-way guards in the NBA, known for his defensive prowess and clutch performances. Despite his impressive resume, which includes a 2021 NBA title with the Bucks, two All-Star selections, and six All-Defensive Team honors, Holiday's Hall of Fame case remains to be determined. Winning a second championship, especially as a key contributor to two different teams, would significantly bolster his candidacy.\n\nHoliday's impact on both ends of the floor cannot be overstated. His ability to guard multiple positions and contribute offensively makes him an invaluable asset for the Celtics. A standout performance in the Finals would further highlight his importance to winning teams and strengthen his Hall of Fame credentials.\n\n7. Derrick White\n\nPressure: Make Himself Untouchable On A Title-Contending Team\n\nSince joining the Boston Celtics, Derrick White has transformed into a crucial player, showcasing his defensive prowess and improving his offensive game. Learning under Gregg Popovich with the Spurs, White developed a strong foundation in winning basketball, which he has carried into his role with the Celtics. Making two All-Defensive Teams, he has proven his value as a two-way guard capable of making significant contributions on both ends of the floor.\n\nThe 2024 Finals present White with a chance to further cement his place in Boston's rotation and make himself untouchable on a title-contending team. His ability to impact the game defensively and provide timely scoring can be pivotal in a championship run. A strong performance in the Finals would solidify his reputation as an all-time great role player for the Celtics franchise, ensuring his place in their future plans.\n\n8. Al Horford\n\nPressure: Win One NBA Championship Before Eventual Retirement\n\nAl Horford's illustrious career includes five All-Star appearances, an All-NBA Third Team selection, and a spot on the All-Defensive Second Team. Despite his numerous individual accolades and a previous Finals appearance with the Celtics, Horford has yet to capture an NBA championship. At 38 years old, time is running out for the veteran big man to add a title to his resume, and this year's Finals may represent his best chance.\n\nWinning a championship would solidify Horford's legacy as an exceptional role player and leader in Boston's storied history. His experience, leadership, and defensive acumen have been invaluable to the Celtics' success, and a title would be the crowning achievement of his career. On the flip side, failing to win a championship could leave Horford's career feeling incomplete, despite his numerous accomplishments.\n\n9. P.J. Washington\n\nPressure: Confirm His Place Alongside Luka Doncic And Kyrie Irving As Third Option\n\nPJ Washington has stepped up significantly this postseason, averaging 13.6 points per game and making crucial shots for the Dallas Mavericks. As the team looks to build around Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving for the foreseeable future, Washington has the chance to solidify his role as the third option. His offensive aggression and ability to hit timely shots have been pivotal in the Mavericks' journey to the Finals.\n\nA strong performance in the Finals would confirm Washington's place alongside Doncic and Irving, ensuring his role as a key contributor moving forward. His ability to complement the star duo with his scoring and versatility can make him an indispensable part of the Mavericks' success. Conversely, an underwhelming showing could lead to doubts about his fit and future with the team.\n\n10. Daniel Gafford\n\nPressure: Take Over The Starting Center Role\n\nDaniel Gafford has quietly developed into a reliable player over the past three years, particularly shining since joining the Mavericks. Known for his athleticism, aggressiveness, and tenacity around the rim, Gafford has the potential to become the long-term solution at the center position for Dallas. His ability to rebound, defend, and finish at the rim makes him a valuable asset for the team.\n\nA strong showing in the Finals would bolster Gafford's case to take over the starting center role permanently. His performance on the biggest stage can showcase his growth and readiness to handle more responsibility. On the other hand, if he struggles, it may raise questions about his consistency and ability to perform under pressure. For Gafford, this series is a crucial opportunity to prove that he can be a cornerstone of the Mavericks' future and solidify his place in their lineup.\n\nRelated: 2024 NBA Finals: Celtics vs. Mavericks (Analysis, Comparison, Prediction)\n\nThank you for being a valued reader of Fadeaway World.

We kind of took it for granted at certain moments.\"\n\nAnd now?\n\n\"I'm not thinking about what it would mean for my legacy or anything like that,\" he said. \"Just excited to play some basketball ... and go out there and try to get the job done.\"\n\nDallas' Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving see it as their first opportunity to make good on a partnership that began late last season after Irving was traded from Brooklyn following a tumultuous run of two-plus seasons with the Nets.\n\nBut the duo was still learning to play with each other during their truncated time together last season and didn't make it to the postseason. After a slow start this season, they found cohesion after the All-Star break and emerged from a deep Western Conference field.\n\nFor Irving, it has been a reminder that success can be fleeting. He won his lone championship with Cleveland in 2016 and has played with three teams over the past eight years. His time in Dallas has reinvigorated him.\n\n\"These young guys are very hungry. They want a championship. I want a championship,\" he said. \"So our feelings are very mutual. But I've always reminded them that this is a process. Failure is going to be part of this, too. Get it out your mind that this is about to be a clean sweep or everything is about to feel good throughout this journey and all that.\n\n\"I'm just very real, very honest. That's what's helped me grow as a leader.\"\n\nDoncic credits the partnership with Irving for uncorking the potential of a team that entered the postseason as a fifth seed.\n\n\"His leadership is amazing,\" Doncic said. \"The way he connects us. I think me and Kyrie are the leaders of this team, but he's the one that's been in the Finals. He's the one that won in the Finals. He's the one that is really leading it.\"\n\nThey'll matchup with a Boston team playing like a group that has learned from its recent shortcomings. That was exhibited during a 64-win regular season that established it as a favorite to raise the franchise's 18th championship banner entering the postseason.\n\nThrough the first three rounds, the Celtics have met the challenge, losing just two games along the way under the guidance of second-year coach Joe Mazzulla.\n\nThey've also benefited from an offseason shakeup of its roster that saw longtime emotional leader Marcus Smart and former NBA Sixth Man of the Year Malcolm Brogdon traded in favor of 7-footer Kristaps Porzingis and Jrue Holiday, who won a championship with Milwaukee in 2021.\n\nBrown said a core that features seven players from the 2022 team that lost in the Finals to Golden State, is up to the challenge.\n\n\"I think this is a special group. I really do,\" Brown said. \"We've been able to go through the experiences of having success but not having success at the same time. I think to solidify the ultimate goal is to get over the hump and win. I think that will add a lot to our legacy. But as of right now, that story is kind of still untold.\"\n\nCOACHING PERSPECTIVES\n\nThis stage is nothing new to Mavericks coach Jason Kidd, who is in the Finals for the fifth time as a player or coach.\n\nHe has experienced lows, such as losing back-to-back trips to the Finals in 2002 and 2003 as a player with the New Jersey Nets. He has also seen success, earning his lone title as a player with Dallas in 2011 at age 38 and one as an assistant on the Lakers 2020 championship team.\n\nThe biggest lesson he has taken away is to approach it like business and be ready to live with the results. That has been his message to his team throughout these playoffs.\n\n\"This is the best of the best at the highest level,\" Kidd said. \"It's fun. That's what the Finals are all about, is seeing what team is going to step forward and take advantage of mistakes.\"\n\nMazzulla was an assistant on Ime Udoka's staff in 2022. What he learned from that experience is that the details of winning never change, even on this stage.\n\n\"The toughest team will win,\" Mazzulla said. \"The team that makes the most plays will win. The team that can execute the details at a high level will win. It's no different.\"\n\nFRIENDS AND COMPETITORS\n\nIrving is ready for what he expects to be an icy greeting from Boston's home crowd for Game 1 on Thursday.\n\nCeltics fans haven't held a high opinion of him since he ended two disappointing seasons in Boston by leaving for the Nets and joining Kevin Durant in free agency in 2019.\n\nHe then rankled the Boston faithful even more when he flipped his middle finger at fans after making a shot during Brooklyn's first round playoff series loss to the Celtics in 2022. But he said he is looking forward to matching up with \"brothers\" and former teammates Tatum and Brown.\n\n\"They've gotten tremendously better. They've led their team to this point. So I'm proud of them,\" Irving said. \"I'm looking forward to the competition because this is what we've all strived for since we were kids, basketball at this level playing against the best of the best.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

However, Tatum received a not-so-subtle reminder from former NBA player Keyshawn Johnson that the pressure is on.\n\nSpeaking on \"Undisputed,\" Johnson suggested that if Tatum fails to secure the win, questions about his future in Boston may arise.\n\n\"If Jayson Tatum doesn't win, everyone will start to ask and question if you need to move him,\" he said.\n\nTatum and the Celtics are determined to make this year count after falling short in their quest for the trophy in 2022 against the Golden State Warriors. With a much-improved roster, the Celtics have proven their strength with impressive victories over teams like the Miami Heat and the Cleveland Cavaliers. They continued it with a sweep of the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nThe memory of their defeat in the previous Finals serves as a driving force for Tatum and his teammates. They are ready to avoid a repeat of the disappointment they experienced in 2022 and are more determined than ever to claim victory this time around.\n\nChris Broussard, co-host of \"First Things, First,\" recently discussed the significance of the NBA Finals for Jayson Tatum.\n\nIf Tatum can lead the Boston Celtics to victory, Broussard believes he will earn the respect of his peers. With that, he can also cement his place among the greatest players of the post-LeBron James and Stephen Curry era.\n\n\"Respect. ...

At the same time, I wouldn't be surprised if Luka and Dallas and Kyrie (Irving) and (head coach Jason Kidd) made this a series and won... This is going to be a phenomenal series.\"\n\nStanding in Boston's way is a confident Mavs team under far less pressure and uniquely equipped to ruin the Celtics' title aspirations.\n\nThat starts with Doncic, the 25-year-old Slovenian who is quickly becoming the face of the league.\n\nHe has been the best player in the playoffs and is the first to lead in points (489), rebounds (164) and assists (150) coming into a finals.\n\nBy his side is veteran point guard Irving who, after turbulent stints in Brooklyn and Boston, has looked more comfortable and confident on the court than he has in years.\n\n\"I think it's fair to say that offensively they are as talented as any backcourt in NBA history,\" Redick said of Doncic and Irving.\n\nOne big, 7-foot 2-inch (2.1 metres) question mark hanging over the series is the health of Boston's Kristaps Porzingis, the former Maverick who suffered a calf strain in the Heat series and has been sidelined since.\n\nThe Celtics are hopeful that their prized offseason acquisition, who averaged 20.1 points and 7.2 rebounds and 1.9 blocks during the regular season, will be healthy enough to match up against the Mavs' breakout big men Daniel

At 76-20 on the season (including playoffs) Boston is one of the most-dominant teams in NBA history. The Mavericks were the No. 5 seed in the Western Conference Playoffs and pulled off 3-straight upsets to reach the Finals. Can Luka Doncic and company pull off one more? Or will Jayson Tatum and the Celtics hang an 18th banner when all is said and done? Tune in to ABC at 8:30 p.m. ET on Thursday night to see how Game 1 plays out.\n\nIf you think the Celtics will win Game 1, it makes sense to take them to win big. Boston has only had 3 games decided by less than 10 points this postseason, going 3-0 in those contests. Otherwise, it has been a lot of blowouts for Joe Mazzulla's squad. To the Mavericks' credit, they haven't lost back-to-back games yet this postseason, so even if they lose Game 1 by 7+ points, it's safe to expect them to make adjustments for Game 2.\n\nJayson Tatum has had 10+ rebounds in 11 of his 14 playoff games so far this year. He's made it a point to crash the boards early and often in games. Even with Kristaps Porzingis back in action for Game 1 tonight, don't expect him to be an active rebounder. Boston probably won't want him spending too much time in the paint where he can re-injure his calf. Tatum will continue to carry the burden on the glass.\n\nOn the Dallas side, Luka Doncic is the best player in this series. I expect the Celtics to try to slow down Kyrie Irving and the other Dallas players. Even if Luka goes off for 35 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists (which would easily cover the 49.5 PRA total, if Boston is able to shut down his sidekicks, it should be able to win.\n\nThat same-game parlay, when totaled together on DraftKings, sports +800 odds.\n\nOdds via DraftKings as of June 6. Click here to get $150 in bonus bets when you place an initial wager of $5+ on the NBA Finals today. You'll also receive a free no-sweat same-game parlay token for every Finals game.\n\nAs you can see above, the Mavericks are +190 underdogs to win outright. The Celtics are -230 favorites on the moneyline. The points total is set at over/under 214.5, with even -110 odds on each side. The spread favors Boston by 6.5 points, again with equal -110 odds for both teams.\n\nBoth teams benefited from the time off between the end of the conference finals and tonight's Game 1. The Celtics have a clean injury sheet. Big man Kristaps Porzingis will suit up for the first time in over a month. He hasn't played since Game 4 of the first round against the Miami Heat, but his calf injury is reportedly better.\n\nFor the Mavericks, Luka Doncic continues to be listed on the injury report, but it would be utterly shocking if he didn't play in Game 1. Olivier-Maxence Prosper is the only player who might not suit up, but he likely wouldn't be part of the Dallas rotation in the Finals, anyway.\n\nThese teams are as close to fully healthy as possible for this series, so it should be a ton of fun to watch!", "source": {"uri": "sportsbettingdime.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Betting Dime"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adam_spencer@sportsbettingdime.com", "name": "Adam Spencer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DraftKings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DraftKings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn.sportsbettingdime.com/app/uploads/media/4/USATSI_22662763.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 1821, "textEnd": 1827}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

It helped Brown earn the NBA's first $300 million contract last summer. And, Tatum is expected to get one this offseason.\n\nThe team has branded the All-Stars as \"The Jays\" in a marketing campaign shown during games that pitted them against one another in mini competitions.\n\nIt has created natural comparisons between them along the way, fostering an atmosphere in which fans and sports pundits alike have tried to parse out which one of them is better, whose spot is most untouchable on the roster and which of them is more pivotal to the Celtics' success as they prepare to lead the team to the franchise's 18th NBA title.\n\nIt reached a new level last week during a segment on ESPN's \"Get Up\" in which panelists debated whether the 26-year-old Tatum expressed excitement or disappointment while watching the 27-year-old Brown garner Eastern Conference finals MVP honors.\n\n\"I think it's unfair to both of them,\" Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said of what he viewed as an attempt to manufacture friction between the two stars.\n\nBut even as Tatum and Brown have distinguished themselves as the most important players on Boston's roster and the keys to the Celtics' fate in their NBA Finals matchup with the Dallas Mavericks, Mazzulla has hope that people will start viewing them differently.\n\n\"They're, like, two completely different people. They're two completely different players,\" Mazzulla said. \"They're great teammates, they love each other and they go about winning and they go about their process in a different way. Why they have to always be lumped together I think is unfair.\"\n\nStepping up\n\nTatum and Brown, along with Al Horford, are the only returning starters from the 2021-22 team that lost to the Golden State Warriors in six games in the Finals after holding a 2-1 series lead.\n\nWhile Horford has taken on mostly a reserve role this season, backing up 7-footer Kristaps Porzingis, Tatum and Brown have taken their play up a notch.\n\nTatum's scoring numbers have remained steady from the regular season (26.9 per game) into the playoffs (26.0), while his rebounding has increased from 8.1 to 10.4 per game in the postseason. Brown, too, has seen jumps in those categories, going from 23.0 points and 5.5 rebounds per game to 25.0 points and 6.1 rebounds in the playoffs.\n\nTatum believes they've both used lessons from the 2022 NBA Finals' loss, as well as last year's conference finals loss to Miami, to grow into players more equipped to accomplish their championship goal this time around.\n\n\"Obviously, we've been there before, we came up short,\" Tatum said.\n\nAnd being each other's biggest cheerleaders, too.\n\nAfter Brown made a game-tying 3-pointer late in Game 1 of the conference finals matchup with Indiana to send the game to overtime in an eventual Celtics' victory, the highest praise came from Tatum.\n\n\"Big time players make big time plays,\" Tatum said of Brown.\n\nMotivation\n\nFor Brown, this season has been about focusing on the expectations he has for himself and not worrying about others' perception of him.\n\nInitially, when he was asked about not being included on either the All-NBA or All-Defensive teams, he shrugged it off, saying his attention was focused on getting back to the NBA Finals.\n\nAfter he was named conference finals MVP, he acknowledged it did offer at least some motivation, particularly on the defensive side of the ball which he said he put most of his work into this past offseason.\n\n\"As time has gone by and I got to this point, I stopped caring,\" Brown said.\n\nMazzulla believes the reason the relationship between Brown and Tatum is so often talked about is rooted in outside disbelief that their dynamic doesn't breed any rivalry between them.\n\n\"At the end of the day, like, those two guys, their relationship is their relationship,\" Mazzulla said. \"They love each other. They push each other every single day in practice. They communicate with each other, but they go about it differently. And, I think they both get it unfair being compared to each other.

At the same time, I wouldn't be surprised if Luka and Dallas and Kyrie (Irving) and [head coach Jason Kidd] made this a series and won... This is going to be a phenomenal series.\"\n\nStanding in Boston's way is a confident Mavs team under far less pressure and uniquely equipped to ruin the Celtics' title aspirations.\n\nThat starts with Doncic, the 25-year-old Slovenian who is quickly becoming the face of the league.\n\nHe has been the best player in the playoffs and is the first to lead in points (489), rebounds (164), and assists (150) coming into a finals.\n\nBy his side is veteran point guard Irving who, after turbulent stints in Brooklyn and Boston, has looked more comfortable and confident on the court than he has in years.\n\n\"I think it's fair to say that offensively they are as talented as any backcourt in NBA history,\" Redick said of Doncic and Irving.\n\nOne big, 7-foot 2-inch question mark hanging over the series is the health of Boston's Kristaps Porzingis, the former Maverick who suffered a calf strain in the Heat series and has been sidelined since.\n\nThe Celtics are hopeful that their prized offseason acquisition, who averaged 20.1 points and 7.2 rebounds and 1.9 blocks during the regular season, will be healthy enough to match up against the Mavs' breakout big men Daniel Gafford and

Despite criticism, Tatum's actions speak volumes about how he understands team dynamics and leads by example. Tatum's ability to showcase leadership and adjust his style depending on the team's needs has benefited the Celtics.\n\nOver the past few seasons, the Boston Celtics have come very close to capturing their first NBA title since 2008. They have earned another chance to win the franchise's 18th championship as they prepare to take on the Dallas Mavericks in what should be an exciting and thrilling NBA Finals.\n\nThe Celtics last NBA Finals appearance came back in 2022, and after losing that series, there is much to be desired after coming so close for so many seasons. The Celtics have reached the Eastern Conference Finals six times since the 2016-17 season, and many critics believe that they should have won multiple titles within that span.\n\nWhenever NBA teams are expected to achieve greatness, and whenever players fail to meet lofty expectations, fingers begin being pointed at certain individuals and are often blamed for the team's failures. Celtics all-star forward Jayson Tatum has been a victim of criticism every time the team is eliminated from the postseason.\n\nSome of that criticism is warranted and fair, and some isn't, but that's what comes with being a superstar in today's NBA. Tatum now has another shot to change the narrative of how he can't get his team over the hump, and that he isn't good enough to be the leader of a title-contending team.\n\nTatum Is Ahead of the Curve According to History Due to past playoff failures, Tatum's experience will be invaluable in the Finals.\n\nThere are a few things that Tatum should be able to use to his advantage during this series. Many athletes tend to block out the noise around them when preparing for a championship. No television, no social media and no internet is the route that most players take when trying to remain focused and locked in.\n\nDespite what they say about Tatum, and even if he's tuning everything out, he still knows and understands that he will be the topic of many conversations based on his performance in the Finals.\n\nIf Tatum happens to rise above everyone's expectations, wins the NBA title, and takes home MVP honors in the process, there should be plenty of admissions about being wrong about him. The critics fail to realize that he has done everything other superstars around the league have already done.\n\nThe only thing missing from Tatum's resume is a championship, but he has a history of not completing the job in the postseason, which is a reputation he would rather not be remembered for. There are a lot of critics who want Tatum to prove that he is worth the hype, and they just want to see him elevate his game when it matters most.\n\nIf Tatum had led the Celtics to the title two years ago when he was 24 years old, it would have been a rare occasion (other than Magic Johnson, who won a title during his rookie season with the Los Angeles Lakers) for a player that young to be able to lead his team to a championship.\n\nHe has had unrealistic expectations placed on him, and until he wins a title, those expectations will remain with him. If we look at some of the superstars who won a title and at the age they won it, Tatum is not so far off.\n\nNBA Superstars Age at Time of First Title\n\nPlayer/Team\n\nSeasons\n\nAge\n\nMichael Jordan/CHI\n\n7\n\n28\n\nLeBron James/MIA\n\n9\n\n27\n\nKevin Durant/GSW\n\n10\n\n28\n\nSteph Curry/GSW\n\n7\n\n27\n\nShaquille O'Neal/LAL\n\n8\n\n28\n\nDirk Nowitzki/DAL\n\n13\n\n32\n\nTatum has been a fantastic performer in the postseason other than the NBA Finals, which they lost to the Golden State Warriors. Even though he's gotten deep into the playoffs almost every year of his career, it's scary to know that Tatum is just now entering his prime years.\n\nIf the Celtics win it all this time and get to taste that champagne and the sweet success of victory, the rest of the league could have trouble on their hands with this team for the next couple of years.\n\nTatum's Understanding That Team is Bigger Than Him Leads Celtics to Finals Although his ability to lead has been questioned, Tatum allows his actions to speak for him instead.\n\nThe narrative that Tatum chokes in big games was created by one horrible series against the Warriors on the biggest stage. Unlike many other talented young players, Tatum has not been afforded the luxury of low expectations. He has been blessed to be on a contending team almost every year of his career, and with that came unprecedented playoff success but also higher expectations and scrutiny whenever the Celtics lose.\n\nTatum often gets the most flagrant attention due to the reputation he's earned. Despite what negativity the media spews about him, Tatum has proved to be an elite player who will embarrass a team if he goes unaccounted for. He is double-teamed more often than the average superstar and faces more pressure at the rim.\n\nTatum's biggest flaw at times is when he tries to do too much when he doesn't have to by resorting to hero ball, resulting in stopping the ball movement at inopportune times within the game. That may result from Tatum trying too hard to prove the pundits wrong, but he is a much more efficient player whenever he takes advantage of the team he is surrounded by.\n\nAnother issue that Tatum is often criticized for is his lack of leadership. He will indeed disappear at times, but his leadership shouldn't be questioned. It's never been an issue within the Celtics organization, especially when you have a franchise player who leads the team on deep playoff runs consistently.\n\nAt the end of the day, basketball is a team sport and the Celtics are the best team in the NBA. If Tatum played on another team, it's obvious that his numbers would skyrocket, and he would be at the top of the conversation for league MVP after every season.\n\nThe Celtics are competing for a title, so they take a different approach from other teams. Tatum could be selfish to inflate his stats, but that wouldn't benefit the team by him achieving individual goals. Many talented players surround him, and he is playing with four other All-Star-caliber players.\n\nTatum has never had to carry a team like other stars in the same position have had to. That scenario works out perfectly for the Celtics because it gives Tatum a higher margin for error because even if he has an off night, his team can still pick up the slack and rise to the occasion.\n\nRelated Jayson Tatum's Defense for Celtics a Key to Storyline To Watch in NBA Finals Jayson Tatum's defense for the Boston Celtics may be flying a bit under the radar right now.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Blackhawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Blackhawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Magic Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O'Neal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shaquille O'Neal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Dolphins", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami Dolphins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirk_Nowitzki", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dirk Nowitzki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/nba_tatum-silence-critics.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

That's kind of cool to see because when you look at Kai and Luka, a lot of times they're not known as our defensive guys.\"\n\nIrving and Doncic scored 36 points apiece in the clincher against the Wolves, both shooting better than 50% and combining to make half their 3-pointers.\n\nThe Mavs didn't need double figures from anybody off the bench, and barely from the other starters.\n\nThey can make that formula work, with at least some help.\n\nP.J. Washington Jr. will draw the difficult defensive assignments against Boston co-stars Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. But the midseason acquisition needs to shoot closer to the 47% from 3-point range that he did in the second-round victory over top-seeded Oklahoma City than the 25% he shot against Minnesota.\n\nThe other defense-first starter and key figure in trying to slow Tatum and Brown, Derrick Jones Jr., could provide a boost by matching his 40% shooting from 3 in these playoffs.\n\nThen there's the rim-protecting, pick-and-rolling tandem of centers Daniel Gafford -- the other midseason trade pickup along with Washington -- and rookie Dereck Lively II.\n\nThose two give Dallas an edge over the Celtics, who have a more perimeter-oriented pairing in Kristaps Porzingis and the undersized Al Horford.\n\nBoston also isn't sure what it will get out of Porzingis with the 7-foot-2 Latvian sidelined since the first round by a calf injury.\n\nThe Celtics get the edge in late-playoff experience, but not by much.\n\nThey are on a three-year run of reaching the East finals and made the NBA Finals in 2022, losing to Golden State in six games after the Warriors beat Dallas in the West finals.\n\nIrving, however, has the most experience in the series on the NBA's biggest stage, with 13 games in the finals. He ranks eighth among players with at least 10 games with a scoring average of 27.7 points.\n\nDoncic doesn't figure to be spooked by his first NBA Finals. The 25-year-old was playing professionally in Spain a decade ago and was the title-winning EuroLeague MVP days before getting drafted third overall in 2018.\n\nHe also is the reason Slovenia reached the medal round as a first-time Olympic qualifier at the Tokyo Games three years ago.\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

ESPN analysts are fairly split on who will take home the Larry O'Brien Trophy.\n\nIn a panel of 17 ESPN reporters and pundits, the Mavericks narrowly received a 9-8 edge over the Celtics. That doesn't reflect Boston entering the championship stage as a -210 favorite on DraftKings Sportsbook.\n\nHowever, everyone agrees that the Finals won't be short. Each expert picked the series to go six or seven games.\n\nEvery Celtics backer identified Jayson Tatum as their Finals MVP. Seven people chose Luka Doncic, and two selected Kyrie Irving.\n\nDespite missing Kristaps Porzingis, Boston cruised through the Eastern Conference with little opposition. Facing the Miami Heat without Jimmy Butler, they notched all four wins by double-digits in a five-game set.\n\nThe No. 1 seed caught another break when Donovan Mitchell missed the final two games of their second-round series. Boston dispatched the Cleveland Cavaliers in five, averaging a 15-point victory margin.\n\nThe Celtics cemented their second Eastern Conference crown in the last three years by sweeping the No. 6 seeded Indiana Pacers. Joe Mazzulla's squad took Game 1 in overtime and won the final two matchups by three points each.\n\nOn the other hand, the Mavericks faced a tougher path to the Finals. They defeated the Los Angeles Clippers and Oklahoma City Thunder in six games apiece despite ceding home-court advantage as the No. 5 seed.\n\nDoncic and Irving then led Dallas to a five-game victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves, who previously eliminated the defending champion Denver Nuggets. The public seems to share the confidence of some ESPN experts, as approximately 80 percent of bets this week were placed on the underdogs to prevail.\n\nGame 1 starts Thursday at 8:30 p.m. ET on ABC.", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_gould@postandcourier.com", "name": "Andrew Gould", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DraftKings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DraftKings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_O'Brien_Championship_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Butler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Butler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donovan_Mitchell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donovan Mitchell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Gaming", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Gaming", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Murder-Mystery_and_Deduction", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Murder-Mystery and Deduction", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/d3/2d31cf54-b670-5a8c-9460-2d25b5edac1d/6661da1357639.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C85&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

Other forms of vitriol were also hurled at the Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown-led squad. Some have said that their regular season did not matter while others have come to declare that their postseason run has been fraudulent due to the injuries in other teams. Time and again they have been able to suppress these criticisms. Now, they are just four wins against the Dallas Mavericks from reaching their 18th banner. No one else was fit to hype them up than New England Patriots legend Tom Brady.\n\nThe Celtics got Tom Brady to narrate their pre-NBA Finals hype video. It chronicles the journey that Joe Mazzulla's squad had to undergo. First was taking care of the Miami Heat despite the unfortunate injury to Kristaps Porzingis. Then, getting the work done against the Cleveland Cavaliers as Derrick White and Al Horford stepped up. After that, it was sweeping an Indiana Pacers squad that clawed their way up to the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nDespite all of this, there has still been a lot of disrespect coming towards the Celtics' way. Made-up narratives about how Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are not meshing. The fact that the Mavericks are supposedly a better squad but are set to have the lowest regular season win total among champions if they do win the NBA Finals. All of that and more has been heard around the world despite the efforts that the Celtics have put in.\n\nTired of the Celtics disrespect?\n\nMaybe it's just the disrespect because the city that the Celtics are situated in is just too competitive. After all, Tom Brady and the Patriots experienced the exact same thing when they were ravaging the NFL. The Boston Red Sox also had to hear all of this talk and unsolicited criticism during their World Series runs. It might just come with the territory.\n\nBut, none of these are warranted and the Celtics are ready to show why. They are a 64-win regular season squad for a season and have not gotten a losing record in a span of 10 games throughout the past eight months. Their offense which is rated at 123.2 is the best in the league. Moreover, the defensive intensity that they also give out ranks them third in the league with a 111.6 rating.\n\nAs for individual performances, Jayson Tatum is top 10 in the postseason when it comes to points, rebounds, and assists. Jaylen Brown is just coming off a steaming hot performance that got him an Eastern Conference Finals Most Valuable Player trophy. Derrick White, Jrue Holiday, and Al Horford have all been able to sustain their energy from the start to the clutch. Meanwhile, Kristaps Porzingis is also poised to make a return.\n\nThere are big expectations for the Celtics but even meaner demons to exorcise. They have seven games against the Mavericks to dispel all of these negative and baseless notions. But, if Tom Brady and his herd of Patriots fans believes just like the Celtics faithful, they might not even need all of the games in the series.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jay_postrado@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Jay Postrado", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Ethnic_and_Regional/European", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Ethnic and Regional/European", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Ethnic_and_Regional", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Ethnic and Regional", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Celtics-news-Tom-Bradys-NBA-Finals-hype-video-will-have-fans-pitying-Mavericks.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

The Game 1 spread favoring the Boston Celtics by 6.5 belongs in the same argument, no matter any Dallas Mavericks' objections.\n\nBut there are an abundance of other markets before this series begins, ones that fit into Mavs vs. Celtics predictions.\n\nTarget some of these NBA picks before the NBA Finals tip on Thursday, June 6, and they should make the entire series more entertaining.\n\nJayson Tatum on The Glass\n\nThe Boston Celtics may have two traditional -- well, traditional-ish -- big men in Al Horford and Kristaps Porzingis, but Jayson Tatum has always been their best rebounder. Start with the simple reality of the regular season: Tatum led Boston with 8.1 rebounds per game, nearly a board more per game than Porzingis and almost two compared to Horford.\n\nTatum emphasizes his all-around game in the postseason, averaging 10.4 rebounds, well ahead of Horford's 7.3. With Porzingis returning from a soleus strain, expectations of his leaping ability should be limited. So there is little worry Tatum will not lead the Celtics in rebounds.\n\nLooking at Dallas's postseason numbers, Tatum's only genuine worry should be Luka Doncic. Dereck Lively II is No. 2 among Mavericks on the glass through three rounds, grabbing 7.2 per game. Meanwhile, Doncic has hovered at 9.6.\n\nThose numbers alone should embolden a Tatum bet. In each of the last two postseasons -- 20 games last year, 14 thus far this year -- Tatum has averaged well more than 10 rebounds per game.\n\nAt -180, betting Tatum to grab more rebounds than Doncic (at DraftKings) may seem tempting, but the greater value can be found betting Tatum to lead the series in rebounds.\n\nEntering the Finals, Derrick White may be considered an X-Factor. By the end of it, he may be seen as the key to Boston's success.\n\nWith Porzingis sidelined for the bulk of three rounds, White's usage rate has ticked upward to 20.3%, compared to 18.7% in the regular season. That has not entirely been because of Porzingis's absence. Among genuine Celtics contributors, only Jaylen Brown's (+0.5%) and Al Horford's (+1.8%) usage rates have also gone up. Horford's is obviously tied to Porzingis's absence. Brown's small jump could be chalked up to sample size.\n\nWhite's, however, is rising to the playoff moment. In the regular season, he took 6.8 threes per game. In the last 11 games, he has taken 9 per game, making 40.4% of them.\n\nYet, Luka Doncic sits at +110 to lead the series in 3-pointers.\n\nWhite has been hitting more 3s per game than Doncic has. And he will be the loose piece of Boston's offense, quite possibly with Doncic defending him. If not Doncic, then Kyrie Irving. Meanwhile, Doncic will be going against Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, or Jrue Holiday.\n\nNot to be dramatic, but this may be a legacy-making series for Kyrie Irving. Winning one NBA Finals was impressive, particularly given the game-winner he hit in Game 7. But Irving has been adrift since that 2016 glory, and LeBron James did most of the heavy lifting in that series.\n\nWinning another ring nearly a decade later, against a team that he had an ugly split with, would strengthen Irving's case as an on-court legend in the modern NBA rather than a locker-room cancer that blew up three franchises since his only championship.\n\nIrving deserves every ounce of criticism he gets, but when the games matter most, his game elevates. Three times in his last four postseasons, including this one, Irving has averaged more than five assists.\n\nAgainst Minnesota last round, Irving averaged 4.6 assists. The round before that, he hummed at 6.2 against the Thunder. On a per-game basis this postseason, Boston has given up more assists to opponents than either of those Western Conference defenses.\n\nThis bet does not offer a massive payday, but Irving will have the ball in his hands more than any Maverick not named Doncic. In years past, he has turned that into assists in the postseason.\n\nMaybe this is not the smartest bet. It will be the most fun. At this point, some fun is defensible.\n\nThere are two versions of this bet, and both of them look at Luka Doncic as bringing value.\n\nBetting on the more conservative approach, that there will be at least one overtime in this series, is betting on a close game to remain tense.\n\nYour instinct may be to look at Game 1's 6.5-point spread as a reason to scoff at this thought, but consider what the spread should be in Dallas in Games 3 and 4. The shift in the home venue alone should bring the spread within a bucket, if not to Boston by 1.5 or 2.\n\nBetting on at least one overtime does not sound as illogical now, does it?\n\nIf nothing else, you can cheer for more basketball, and with so little basketball left in this NBA season, we should all cheer for more basketball.", "source": {"uri": "covers.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Covers.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dereck_Lively_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dereck Lively II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "label": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://img.covers.com/cms/covers/73058bac-4cef-460f-9ab5-5ec6a9e23ca0.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 408, "textEnd": 414}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

That's kind of cool to see because when you look at Kai and Luka, a lot of times they're not known as our defensive guys.\"\n\nIrving and Doncic scored 36 points apiece in the clincher against the Wolves, both shooting better than 50% and combining to make half their 3-pointers.\n\nThe Mavs didn't need double figures from anybody off the bench, and barely from the other starters.\n\nThey can make that formula work, with at least some help.\n\nP.J. Washington Jr. will draw the difficult defensive assignments against Boston co-stars Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. But the midseason acquisition needs to shoot closer to the 47% from 3-point range that he did in the second-round victory over top-seeded Oklahoma City than the 25% he shot against Minnesota.\n\nThe other defense-first starter and key figure in trying to slow Tatum and Brown, Derrick Jones Jr., could provide a boost by matching his 40% shooting from 3 in these playoffs.\n\nThen there's the rim-protecting, pick-and-rolling tandem of centers Daniel Gafford -- the other midseason trade pickup along with Washington -- and rookie Dereck Lively II.\n\nThose two give Dallas an edge over the Celtics, who have a more perimeter-oriented pairing in Kristaps Porzingis and the undersized Al Horford.\n\nBoston also isn't sure what it will get out of Porzingis with the 7-foot-2 Latvian sidelined since the first round by a calf injury.\n\nThe Celtics get the edge in late-playoff experience, but not by much.\n\nThey are on a three-year run of reaching the East finals and made the NBA Finals in 2022, losing to Golden State in six games after the Warriors beat Dallas in the West finals.\n\nIrving, however, has the most experience in the series on the NBA's biggest stage, with 13 games in the finals. He ranks eighth among players with at least 10 games with a scoring average of 27.7 points.\n\nDoncic doesn't figure to be spooked by his first NBA Finals.

You can also watch via a subscription to Sling TV, which is offering $25 off any package for the first month or a three-month subscription for just $90.\n\nHere are the top three NBA Finals streaming options:\n\n1. DirecTV Stream (FREE TRIAL)\n\nDirecTV Stream is good option for NBA fans since it carries every channel. Fans can try it for free using this link.\n\n2. SlingTV\n\nSlingTV, which is offering $25 off any package for the first month or a three-month subscription for just $90, offers good value for NBA Fans. Sling's channel lineup includes ABC, but only in certain markets. So it might be more challenging to catch the game with Sling TV.\n\nBOSTON (AP) -- Jason Kidd won an NBA championship as a Dallas player in 2011. He now has a chance to win one as a Dallas coach, which would put him in a very small club.\n\nThere are only 14 people in NBA history to win rings as both a player and a head coach. That group: Rick Carlisle, Larry Costello, Billy Cunningham, Tom Heinsohn, Red Holzman, Phil Jackson, Buddy Jeannette, K.C. Jones, Steve Kerr, Tyronn Lue, Pat Riley, Bill Russell, George Senesky and Bill Sharman.\n\nKidd can join a group within that group, too. Of those 14, there are seven to win titles as a player and a coach with the same team -- those being Cunningham (Philadelphia), Heinsohn, Jones and Russell (Boston), Jeannette (Baltimore), Riley (Los Angeles Lakers) and Senesky (Philadelphia Warriors).\n\nDOMINANT CELTICS\n\nIf Boston wins these NBA Finals, an argument could be made that this was the most dominant team in Celtics history.\n\nBarring anything but a Dallas sweep, the 2023-24 Celtics will finish with either the second- or third-best winning percentage in team history. The 1985-86 Celtics were 82-18 (.820); the best this team can do is 80-20 (.800).\n\nBut where this team will almost certainly set itself apart in Celtics history is point differential. Again, barring something like Dallas winning four games in 30-point blowouts, Boston will finish with the highest differential over a total season in team history. These Celtics are outscoring teams by 11.2 points per game entering this series; the 1985-86 team outscored foes by 9.6 points per game.\n\nLUKA 3K\n\nThe longer this series goes, the better the chance that Dallas' Luka Doncic will become the 11th player in NBA history to score 3,000 points in a season -- including playoffs.\n\nDoncic is entering these NBA Finals with 2,859 points this season, so he needs 141 for 3,000.\n\nIt would be the 24th such season in NBA history if he gets there. Michael Jordan had 10 such seasons, Wilt Chamberlain had five and eight other players -- Bob McAdoo, Elgin Baylor, James Harden, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Kevin Durant, Kobe Bryant, Rick Barry and Shaquille O'Neal -- each did it once.\n\nLeBron James, the league's career scoring leader, got as close as one can to joining the 3,000-point club without ever hitting the milestone. In 2017-18, James finished with exactly 2,999 points.\n\nSIX IN SIX\n\nThis season will see a sixth team win in the last six seasons, after Denver in 2023, Golden State in 2022, Milwaukee in 2021, the Los Angeles Lakers in 2020 and Toronto in 2018.\n\nIt's the second time in NBA history there has been a six-different-champions-in-six-years stretch. The Lakers won in 1980, preceded by Seattle in 1979, Washington in 1978, Portland in 1977, Boston in 1976 and Golden State in 1975.\n\nTHE MONEY\n\nAt stake in this series: the NBA title, the Larry O'Brien Trophy, a pile of bejeweled rings and $4,856,937 in bonus money.\n\nThe NBA's playoff pool is a record $33,657,947 this season and gets distributed to each of the 16 playoff teams. The deeper in the playoffs you go, the more money you get, and there were some additional bonuses for the top regular-season records as well.\n\nBoston is already assured $7,202,498 from the pool, and the Celtics would see that figure rise to $12,059,435 if they win the NBA Finals.\n\nDallas has locked up no less than $5,899,422 in bonus money. The Mavericks would get a total of $10,756,359 if they win the title.\n\nThe bonus pool is typically split in some way among players and staff from the playoff teams.\n\nDIVISION CHAMPS, NBA CHAMPS\n\nOnce again, a division champion will win the NBA title.\n\nBoston won the Atlantic Division by 14 games, Dallas won the Southwest Division by one game. And that means this will be the 12th time in the last 13 seasons that a division champion will be the one that hoists the Larry O'Brien Trophy.\n\nThe exception: Golden State in 2022, when the Warriors beat Boston. Before that, the last team to not win their division but win the NBA title was Dallas in 2011.\n\nSTICK AROUND\n\nNBA teams that have a lead going into the fourth quarter have prevailed 84.1% of the time this season. But Dallas has a knack for rallying.\n\nThe Mavericks, including playoffs, have a league-best 14 wins this season when trailing after three quarters. The Celtics, also including the playoffs, have a league-high 69 wins when leading after three.\n\n5 SEED CURSE\n\nDallas is trying to do something that no team has done under the current playoff seeding format, which goes back 40 years.\n\nNo team seeded No. 5 in either conference has won the NBA title.\n\nOne lower-seeded team did; Houston was a No. 6 seed out of the West in 1995 when it won a title. But all the other teams that made the finals after earning a seed of only No. 5 or worse -- Miami in 2023, Miami in 2020 and New York in 1999 -- lost the title series.\n\nFOUR WITH 50\n\nDallas has a chance at doing something that no team has since 2001 -- beat four teams with at least 50 wins on its way to the NBA championship.\n\nThe Mavericks have beaten a 51-win team in the Los Angeles Clippers, a 57-win team in Oklahoma City and a 56-win team in Minnesota -- starting each of those series on the road. Boston won 64 games in the regular season.\n\nIn 2001, it was the Los Angeles Lakers who, as the No. 2 seed in the West, beat 50-win Portland, 55-win Sacramento and 58-win San Antonio on its way to the NBA Finals -- where they downed 56-win Philadelphia.\n\nSan Antonio nearly did it in 2014, beating three teams with 50 wins on its way to the title. But in the first round, the Spurs' opponent had only 49 wins; that opponent was the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nThe 2002 Lakers also beat three 50-win teams and one 49-win team on their way to that season's championship.", "source": {"uri": "nj.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NJ.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirecTV_Stream", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "DirecTV Stream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sling_TV", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sling TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Senesky", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "George Senesky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_Jeannette", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Buddy Jeannette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Cunningham", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Billy Cunningham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Heinsohn", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tom Heinsohn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._C._Jones", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "K.

However, most fans are expecting a close series.\n\nThe Celtics dominated the 2023-24 regular season from start to finish. As the No.1 seed in the East, they dropped only two games entering the Finals. On the other hand, Dallas was the fifth seed in the West and had to steal home-court advantage to win all three series heading to Thursday's Game 1.\n\nYet because the Mavs, specifically their superstar duo of Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving, played so well in the Western Conference Finals, people are giving the Celtics only a slight edge.\n\nBut according to podcaster Bill Simmons, history says Luka and the Mavs are massive underdogs and would be unlikely champs.\n\n\"There's three giant red flags with the Mavericks thing, and yet I still feel like mentally I'm where you are, like you almost throw it out. It's this different Mavs team that seems like it came together the last six weeks, so ignore the history stuff and concentrate on the six weeks. I think it's the right answer,\" Simmons said.\n\nSimmons' three giant history red flags\n\nThe Mavericks beating the Celtics would be the third largest Finals betting upset since the NBA/ABA merger. Simmons said that at +184, the only bigger upsets in Finals history would be the 2004 Pistons over the Lakers (+500) and the 2019 Toronto Raptors over the Golden State Warriors (+230).\n\nBill also noted that only six teams have won the Larry O'Brien after missing the playoffs the previous year. The 2020 Los Angeles Lakers, who won in the Bubble, and the 2022 Golden State Warriors, who played against the core players of the 2024 Celtics, were the last teams to do it.\n\nThe Ringer founder added that if the Mavericks beat the Celtics, they will be the second-worst Finals winner by record since the first Magic/Bird season. That record belongs to the 1995 Houston Rockets, who were 47-35 during the regular season and 15-7 in the playoffs. The 2006 Miami Heat are next at 52-30/16-7 or 68-37 combined. Meanwhile, the 2024 Mavs have already lost 37 combined games this year (50-32/12-5).\n\nHistory favors Boston\n\nOn the other hand, Simmons says history favors Boston. In the last 50 years, only one team, the 2016 Golden State Warriors, which entered the NBA Finals with 20 total losses, has lost the series. Entering Game 1, the 2024 Celtics have lost 20 games -- 18 during the regular season and two so far in the postseason.\n\nDespite all those, the Dallas faithful remain confident that their dynamic duo can lead them to the promised land. And no matter what historical numbers Simmons pulls out, the teams will start the Finals on equal footing. From there, it could come down to which team is healthier and whose players will shine on the big stage.\n\nRelated: Shaq shares how he changed his approach to making \"Inside the NBA\" unique: \"TNT said, 'Motherf****r, we'll fire your a*s'\"", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shane_garry_acedera@postandcourier.com", "name": "Shane Garry Acedera", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Simmons", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bill Simmons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_O'Brien", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Larry O'Brien"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Pistons", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Pistons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Raptors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Raptors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_the_NBA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inside the NBA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O'Neal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shaquille O'Neal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Rockets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston Rockets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ringer_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Ringer (website)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Flags_and_Banners", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Flags and Banners", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/85/b8564d16-d63e-5e0c-a91c-4666c6da471d/66602e754b7af.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C22&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

He now has a chance to win one as a Dallas coach, which would put him in a very small club.\n\nThere are only 14 people in NBA history to win rings as both a player and a head coach. That group: Rick Carlisle, Larry Costello, Billy Cunningham, Tom Heinsohn, Red Holzman, Phil Jackson, Buddy Jeannette, K.C. Jones, Steve Kerr, Tyronn Lue, Pat Riley, Bill Russell, George Senesky and Bill Sharman.\n\nKidd can join a group within that group, too. Of those 14, there are seven to win titles as a player and a coach with the same team - those being Cunningham (Philadelphia), Heinsohn, Jones and Russell (Boston), Jeannette (Baltimore), Riley (Los Angeles Lakers) and Senesky (Philadelphia Warriors).\n\nIf Boston wins these NBA Finals, an argument could be made that this was the most dominant team in Celtics history.\n\nBarring anything but a Dallas sweep, the 2023-24 Celtics will finish with either the second- or third-best winning percentage in team history. The 1985-86 Celtics were 82-18 (.820); the best this team can do is 80-20 (.800).\n\nBut where this team will almost certainly set itself apart in Celtics history is point differential. Again, barring something like Dallas winning four games in 30-point blowouts, Boston will finish with the highest differential over a total season in team history. These Celtics are outscoring teams by 11.2 points per game entering this series; the 1985-86 team outscored foes by 9.6 points per game.\n\nDallas Mavericks head coach Jason Kidd pauses on the sideline during the second half of Game 5 of the Western Conference finals in the NBA basketball playoffs against the Minnesota Timberwolves, Thursday, May 30, 2024, in Minneapolis. (AP Photo/Abbie Parr)\n\nThe longer this series goes, the better the chance that Dallas' Luka Doncic will become the 11th player in NBA history to score 3,000 points in a season - including playoffs.\n\nDoncic is entering these NBA Finals with 2,859 points this season, so he needs 141 for 3,000.\n\nIt would be the 24th such season in NBA history if he gets there. Michael Jordan had 10 such seasons, Wilt Chamberlain had five and eight other players - Bob McAdoo, Elgin Baylor, James Harden, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Kevin Durant, Kobe Bryant, Rick Barry and Shaquille O\u00b4Neal - each did it once.\n\nLeBron James, the league's career scoring leader, got as close as one can to joining the 3,000-point club without ever hitting the milestone. In 2017-18, James finished with exactly 2,999 points.\n\nThis season will see a sixth team win in the last six seasons, after Denver in 2023, Golden State in 2022, Milwaukee in 2021, the Los Angeles Lakers in 2020 and Toronto in 2018.\n\nIt\u00b4s the second time in NBA history there has been a six-different-champions-in-six-years stretch. The Lakers won in 1980, preceded by Seattle in 1979, Washington in 1978, Portland in 1977, Boston in 1976 and Golden State in 1975.\n\nAt stake in this series: the NBA title, the Larry O\u00b4Brien Trophy, a pile of bejeweled rings and $4,856,937 in bonus money.\n\nThe NBA\u00b4s playoff pool is a record $33,657,947 this season and gets distributed to each of the 16 playoff teams. The deeper in the playoffs you go, the more money you get, and there were some additional bonuses for the top regular-season records as well.\n\nBoston is already assured $7,202,498 from the pool, and the Celtics would see that figure rise to $12,059,435 if they win the NBA Finals.\n\nDallas has locked up no less than $5,899,422 in bonus money. The Mavericks would get a total of $10,756,359 if they win the title.\n\nThe bonus pool is typically split in some way among players and staff from the playoff teams.\n\nOnce again, a division champion will win the NBA title.\n\nBoston won the Atlantic Division by 14 games, Dallas won the Southwest Division by one game. And that means this will be the 12th time in the last 13 seasons that a division champion will be the one that hoists the Larry O\u00b4Brien Trophy.\n\nThe exception: Golden State in 2022, when the Warriors beat Boston. Before that, the last team to not win their division but win the NBA title was Dallas in 2011.\n\nNBA teams that have a lead going into the fourth quarter have prevailed 84.1% of the time this season. But Dallas has a knack for rallying.\n\nThe Mavericks, including playoffs, have a league-best 14 wins this season when trailing after three quarters. The Celtics, also including the playoffs, have a league-high 69 wins when leading after three.\n\nDallas is trying to do something that no team has done under the current playoff seeding format, which goes back 40 years.\n\nNo team seeded No. 5 in either conference has won the NBA title.\n\nOne lower-seeded team did; Houston was a No. 6 seed out of the West in 1995 when it won a title. But all the other teams that made the finals after earning a seed of only No. 5 or worse - Miami in 2023, Miami in 2020 and New York in 1999 - lost the title series.\n\nDallas has a chance at doing something that no team has since 2001 - beat four teams with at least 50 wins on its way to the NBA championship.\n\nThe Mavericks have beaten a 51-win team in the Los Angeles Clippers, a 57-win team in Oklahoma City and a 56-win team in Minnesota - starting each of those series on the road. Boston won 64 games in the regular season.\n\nIn 2001, it was the Los Angeles Lakers who, as the No. 2 seed in the West, beat 50-win Portland, 55-win Sacramento and 58-win San Antonio on its way to the NBA Finals - where they downed 56-win Philadelphia.\n\nSan Antonio nearly did it in 2014, beating three teams with 50 wins on its way to the title. But in the first round, the Spurs\u00b4 opponent had only 49 wins; that opponent was the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nThe 2002 Lakers also beat three 50-win teams and one 49-win team on their way to that season\u00b4s championship.\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA\n\nDallas Mavericks guard Luka Doncic (77) celebrates his score as Minnesota Timberwolves guard Anthony Edwards, left, looks on during the first half of Game 5 of the Western Conference finals in the NBA basketball playoffs, Thursday, May 30, 2024, in Minneapolis.

We kind of took it for granted at certain moments.\"\n\nAnd now?\n\n\"I'm not thinking about what it would mean for my legacy or anything like that,\" he said. \"Just excited to play some basketball ... and go out there and try to get the job done.\"\n\nKELLY: Kyrie Irving is proof of the redemptive power of sport - but supporting that redemption is a different matter\n\nDallas' Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving see it as their first opportunity to make good on a partnership that began late last season after Irving was traded from Brooklyn following a tumultuous run of two-plus seasons with the Nets.\n\nBut the duo was still learning to play with each other during their truncated time together last season and didn't make it to the post-season. After a slow start this season, they found cohesion after the All-Star break and emerged from a deep Western Conference field.\n\nFor Irving, it has been a reminder that success can be fleeting. He won his lone championship with Cleveland in 2016 and has played with three teams over the past eight years. His time in Dallas has reinvigorated him.\n\n\"These young guys are very hungry. They want a championship. I want a championship,\" he said. \"So our feelings are very mutual. But I've always reminded them that this is a process. Failure is going to be part of this, too. Get it out your mind that this is about to be a clean sweep or everything is about to feel good throughout this journey and all that.\n\n\"I'm just very real, very honest. That's what's helped me grow as a leader.\"\n\nDoncic credits the partnership with Irving for uncorking the potential of a team that entered the post-season as a fifth seed.\n\n\"His leadership is amazing,\" Doncic said. \"The way he connects us. I think me and Kyrie are the leaders of this team, but he's the one that's been in the Finals. He's the one that won in the Finals. He's the one that is really leading it.\"\n\nThey'll matchup with a Boston team playing like a group that has learned from its recent shortcomings. That was exhibited during a 64-win regular season that established it as a favourite to raise the franchise's 18th championship banner entering the post-season.\n\nThrough the first three rounds, the Celtics have met the challenge, losing just two games along the way under the guidance of second-year coach Joe Mazzulla.\n\nThey've also benefited from an off-season shakeup of its roster that saw long-time emotional leader Marcus Smart and former NBA Sixth Man of the Year Malcolm Brogdon traded in favour of 7-footer Kristaps Porzingis and Jrue Holiday, who won a championship with Milwaukee in 2021.\n\nBrown said a core that features seven players from the 2022 team that lost in the Finals to Golden State, is up to the challenge.\n\n\"I think this is a special group. I really do,\" Brown said. \"We've been able to go through the experiences of having success but not having success at the same time. I think to solidify the ultimate goal is to get over the hump and win. I think that will add a lot to our legacy. But as of right now, that story is kind of still untold.\"\n\nThis stage is nothing new to Mavericks coach Jason Kidd, who is in the Finals for the fifth time as a player or coach.\n\nHe has experienced lows, such as losing back-to-back trips to the Finals in 2002 and 2003 as a player with the New Jersey Nets. He has also seen success, earning his lone title as a player with Dallas in 2011 at age 38 and one as an assistant on the Lakers 2020 championship team.\n\nThe biggest lesson he has taken away is to approach it like business and be ready to live with the results. That has been his message to his team throughout these playoffs.\n\n\"This is the best of the best at the highest level,\" Kidd said. \"It's fun. That's what the Finals are all about, is seeing what team is going to step forward and take advantage of mistakes.\"\n\nMazzulla was an assistant on Ime Udoka's staff in 2022. What he learned from that experience is that the details of winning never change, even on this stage.\n\n\"The toughest team will win,\" Mazzulla said. \"The team that makes the most plays will win. The team that can execute the details at a high level will win. It's no different.\"\n\nIrving is ready for what he expects to be an icy greeting from Boston's home crowd for Game 1 on Thursday.\n\nCeltics fans haven't held a high opinion of him since he ended two disappointing seasons in Boston by leaving for the Nets and joining Kevin Durant in free agency in 2019.\n\nHe then rankled the Boston faithful even more when he flipped his middle finger at fans after making a shot during Brooklyn's first round playoff series loss to the Celtics in 2022. But he said he is looking forward to matching up with \"brothers\" and former teammates Tatum and Brown.\n\n\"They've gotten tremendously better. They've led their team to this point. So I'm proud of them,\" Irving said. \"I'm looking forward to the competition because this is what we've all strived for since we were kids, basketball at this level playing against the best of the best.\"", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type":

Dallas' last championship came in 2011, while Boston hasn't gone all the way since 2008.\n\nSo, get out the wallet, because at best, you only have seven more NBA games to throw your money on.\n\nWhether you're trying to polish off a season of betting that paid for your kid's college tuition or chasing losses that will prevent that same kid from even going to college, here are three futures bets that you should take a look at for this year's Finals:\n\nJayson Tatum to win Finals MVP (-115 at DraftKings, -120 at FanDuel)\n\nJaylen Brown already completed his redemption arc, and now it's time for Tatum to do the same.\n\nAfter making just 7 of 43 3-pointers (16.3 percent) and committing 3.6 turnovers per game in the 2023 Eastern Conference finals, Brown was named MVP when the series rolled around this year by averaging 29.8 points on 51.7 percent shooting from the field.\n\nTatum was underwhelming -- to say the least -- when Boston went up against the Golden State Warriors in the Finals two years ago, canning just 36.7 percent of his shots from the floor. His 3-for-17 performance in Game 1 was enough to make anyone vehemently ill, and things really didn't get that much better from there.\n\nBut with Finals experience now under his belt and a great team around him, Tatum has no reason not to end up with this award when he returns to the league's biggest stage.\n\nKyrie Irving to hit most 3-pointers in series (+700 at DraftKings, +550 at FanDuel)\n\nWith the bad blood between Irving and his former team, if you don't bet on him in some capacity, you're doing something wrong.\n\nAnd yes, this wager is a bit of a long shot (no pun intended), but we love the value here considering Irving has made the third-most postseason treys among players still around. He trails only teammate Luka Doncic (57 3-pointers) and Boston guard Derrick White (48).\n\nIt's also worth noting that Irving is 0-10 in his past 10 games against the Celtics. He could very well be cursed, and the only way he shakes off that hex is by taking over games alongside Doncic.\n\nExpect Irving to do a lot of his damage from distance, especially if Boston big man Kristaps Porzingis (calf) returns from a 10-game absence to clog up the lane.\n\nOne or more games to reach overtime (+190 at FanDuel).\n\nLet's just pretend like Boston didn't beat Dallas to a pulp for a 138-110 victory back on March 1 in the most recent meeting between these teams.\n\nSurely the Mavericks will be more competitive with the world watching, right?\n\nWe think so, and the Celtics were tied for the fourth-most overtime games during the regular season with six. All signs are pointing toward a tight series, and at least one of these games should have to be decided by some extra basketball.", "source": {"uri": "deadspin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deadspin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DraftKings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DraftKings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FanDuel", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FanDuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Gaming", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Gaming", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://lineup-publishing.s3.amazonaws.com/1717521109116", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-03-01", "textStart": 2691, "textEnd": 2698}], "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

No Big Three. Instead, the Mavericks will square off against the #1 team in the league for the last eight months.\n\nThe Boston Celtics had the NBA's best record in the regular season and are the number one seed in the East.\n\nThe series will begin in Boston for Games 1 and 2. Here are three things to watch for heading into Game 1 of the NBA Finals:\n\n1. Celtics homecourt\n\nDuring the regular season, the C's went 37-4 at the TD Garden - the best home record in the NBA since 2016.\n\nIn the postseason, that home record has \"dipped\" to 6-2. Still, the Celtics are the best home team in basketball.\n\nThe Garden will be rowdy and loud. Far more than anything the Mavs experienced in Los Angeles, Oklahoma City, or Minnesota.\n\nThe Mavs want to get out to a fast start regardless, but it would be especially helpful in a raucous road environment.\n\n2. Road dogs\n\nIf there's a team equipped to handle the Boston crowd, it's the Mavericks.\n\nThe Mavs have gone 7-2 on the road in the NBA Playoffs including five straight victories away from home.\n\nLuka Doncic plays better when opposing fans chirp at him and he will surely get chirped in Beantown.\n\nThe Finals matchups feature the best home team versus the postseason's best road team.\n\nTwo of the most intriguing storylines heading into the Finals are former Celtic/now Maverick Kyrie Irving and former Maverick/current Celtic Kristaps Porzingis.\n\nCeltics fans are not fond of Kyrie, since his departure. And as much as Kyrie looks at peace in Dallas, you would imagine the competitive part of him would like to shut up the Boston crowd with his play.\n\nPorzingis draws less ire from MFFL's but his split from the Mavs was not a cheerful experience either.\n\nYou would presume he's motivated to show the Mavericks they messed up by trading him to the Washington Wizards in 2022.\n\nBoth players are in the Finals, though. So whatever ill will there may be, is no match for fate (or destiny).\n\nThe storylines are plentiful. The on-court matchups are compelling.

We kind of took it for granted at certain moments.\"\n\nTheNightlyGet in front of tomorrow's news for FREE\n\nJournalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion.\n\nREAD NOW\n\nDallas's Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving see the Finals as their first opportunity to make good on a partnership that began late last season after the latter was traded from Brooklyn.\n\nAfter a slow start this season, the superstar pair found cohesion after the All-Star break and emerged from a deep Western Conference field.\n\nFor Irving, it has been a reminder that success can be fleeting.\n\nHe won his lone championship with Cleveland in 2016 and has played with three teams over the past eight years. His time in Dallas has reinvigorated him.\n\n\"These young guys are very hungry. They want a championship. I want a championship,\" he said.\n\n\"So our feelings are very mutual. But I've always reminded them that this is a process. Failure is going to be part of this, too.\"\n\nDoncic credits the partnership with Irving for uncorking the potential of a team that entered the post-season as a fifth seed.\n\n\"His leadership is amazing,\" Doncic said.\n\n\"The way he connects us. Me and Kyrie are the leaders of this team, but he's the one that's been in the Finals. He's the one that won in the Finals. He's the one that is really leading it.\"\n\nAlongside the Mavericks' Australian pair Dante Exum and Josh Green, they will matchup with a Boston team playing like a group that has learned from its recent shortcomings.\n\nBrown said a core that features seven players from the 2022 team that lost in the Finals to Golden State, is up to the challenge.\n\n\"We've been able to go through the experiences of having success but not having success at the same time,\" he said.\n\n\"To solidify the ultimate goal is to get over the hump and win. That will add a lot to our legacy.\"\n\nThis stage is nothing new to Mavericks mentor Jason Kidd, who is in the Finals for the fifth time as a player or coach.\n\nHe has experienced lows - losing in 2002 and 2003 as a player with the New Jersey Nets - as well as the highs of his lone title as a player with Dallas in 2011 and as an assistant on the Lakers' 2020 championship team.\n\n\"This is the best of the best at the highest level,\" Kidd said.\n\n\"It's fun. That's what the Finals are all about - seeing what team is going to step forward and take advantage of mistakes.\"\n\nAccording to Boston's Joe Mazzulla, it's the \"toughest team\" that will take the honours.\n\n\"The team that makes the most plays will win. The team that can execute the details at a high level will win.

Mavericks vs. Celtics picks, predictions and odds", "body": "The Mavericks beat the 51-win Los Angeles Clippers, 57-win Oklahoma City Thunder and 56-win Minnesota Timberwolves with Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving starring and a capable cast of know-their-role guys providing support, including trade-deadline acquisitions P.J. Washington from Charlotte and Daniel Gafford from Washington.\n\nSince the deadline the Mavs have been one of the best teams in the league, showing marked improvement offensively and defensively. They rely on Doncic's playmaking but they have other capable scorers, make enough 3s and love alley-oop lobs.\n\nBoston is a force. The Celtics possessed the NBA's best offense and No. 2 defense and had a league-best 64 victories. When Kristaps Porzingis is in the lineup, the Celtics have the best starting five in the league and are the best two-way team in the league. They have multiple scorers, led by Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum, and it's not unusual for a third player (Jrue Holiday, Derrick White, Porzingis) to score 20 in a game. Defensively, they have size, strength and length and two All-Defense selections in Holiday and White. They come at an opponent several different ways, and the pressure is constant.\n\nThe Celtics like their 3s, and they're proficient at making them. When 3s are going in and Brown and Tatum are both in the 20s, the Celtics are tough to beat.\n\nHere are USA TODAY Sports' NBA experts' picks and predictions for the 2024 Finals:\n\nThis potentially will come down to which duo plays better: Kyrie and Luka or Tatum and Brown? But the X-factor is Kristaps Porzingis. If he can give them anything after coming back from a 10-game absence because of a calf injury, the Celtics should hoist banner No. 18, because they are just too deep and too good.\n\nCeltics in six\n\nThe Celtics had a fairly uncontested route to the NBA Finals, facing the Miami Heat, Cleveland Cavaliers and Indiana Pacers, all of whom were missing major star power, including Jimmy Butler (Heat), Donovan Mitchell (Cavaliers), Jarrett Allen (Cavaliers) and Tyrese Haliburton (Pacers). But the Celtics will face a superstar pair in Doncic and Irving. The series will be a close one, but the Mavericks have the closers to get this done.\n\nMavericks in six\n\nI believe in underdogs - and particularly in Luka's ability to break hearts.\n\nMavericks in seven\n\nThe Celtics have too many offensive weapons and too many defensive options so unless their offense takes a dip for an extended time, the Celtics will win the title.\n\nGannett may earn revenue from sports betting operators for audience referrals to betting services.

At the same time, I wouldn't be surprised if Luka and Dallas and Kyrie (Irving) and (head coach Jason Kidd) made this a series and won... This is going to be a phenomenal series.\"\n\nStanding in Boston's way is a confident Mavs team under far less pressure and uniquely equipped to ruin the Celtics' title aspirations.\n\nThat starts with Doncic, the 25-year-old Slovenian who is quickly becoming the face of the league.\n\nHe has been the best player in the playoffs and is the first to lead in points (489), rebounds (164) and assists (150) coming into a finals.\n\nBy his side is veteran point guard Irving who, after turbulent stints in Brooklyn and Boston, has looked more comfortable and confident on the court than he has in years.\n\n\"I think it's fair to say that offensively they are as talented as any backcourt in NBA history,\" Redick said of Doncic and Irving.\n\nOne big, 7-foot 2-inch question mark hanging over the series is the health of Boston's Kristaps Porzingis, the former Maverick who suffered a calf strain in the Heat series and has been sidelined since.\n\nThe Celtics are hopeful that their prized offseason acquisition, who averaged 20.1 points and 7.2 rebounds and 1.9 blocks during the regular season, will be healthy enough to match up against the Mavs' breakout big men Daniel Gafford and Dereck Lively II.\n\nGame One of the NBA Finals is Thursday in Boston.\n\n(Reporting by Rory Carroll in Los Angeles Editing by Toby Davis)", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

We kind of took it for granted at certain moments.\"\n\nAnd now?\n\n\"I'm not thinking about what it would mean for my legacy or anything like that,\" he said. \"Just excited to play some basketball... and go out there and try to get the job done.\"\n\nGet the latest news\n\ndelivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\n\nDallas' Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving see it as their first opportunity to make good on a partnership that began late last season after Irving was traded from Brooklyn following a tumultuous run of two-plus seasons with the Nets.\n\nBut the duo was still learning to play with each other during their truncated time together last season and didn't make it to the postseason. After a slow start this season, they found cohesion after the All-Star break and emerged from a deep Western Conference field.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Irving, it has been a reminder that success can be fleeting. He won his lone championship with Cleveland in 2016 and has played with three teams over the past eight years. His time in Dallas has reinvigorated him.\n\n\"These young guys are very hungry. They want a championship. I want a championship,\" he said. \"So our feelings are very mutual. But I've always reminded them that this is a process. Failure is going to be part of this, too. Get it out your mind that this is about to be a clean sweep or everything is about to feel good throughout this journey and all that.\n\n\"I'm just very real, very honest. That's what's helped me grow as a leader.\"\n\nBackcourt partnership\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDoncic credits the partnership with Irving for uncorking the potential of a team that entered the postseason as a fifth seed.\n\n\"His leadership is amazing,\" Doncic said. \"The way he connects us. I think me and Kyrie are the leaders of this team, but he's the one that's been in the Finals. He's the one that won in the Finals. He's the one that is really leading it.\"\n\nThey'll match up with a Boston team playing like a group that has learned from its recent shortcomings. That was exhibited during a 64-win regular season that established it as a favorite to raise the franchise's 18th championship banner entering the postseason.\n\nThrough the first three rounds, the Celtics have met the challenge, losing just two games along the way under the guidance of second-year coach Joe Mazzula.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey've also benefited from an offseason shakeup of its roster that saw longtime emotional leader Marcus Smart and former NBA Sixth Man of the Year Malcolm Brogdon traded in favor of 7-footer Kristaps Porzingis and Jrue Holiday, who won a championship with Milwaukee in 2021.\n\nBrown said a core that features seven players from the 2022 team that lost in the Finals to Golden State, is up to the challenge.\n\n\"I think this is a special group. I really do,\" Brown said. \"We've been able to go through the experiences of having success but not having success at the same time. I think to solidify the ultimate goal is to get over the hump and win. I think that will add a lot to our legacy. But as of right now, that story is kind of still untold.\"\n\nCoaching perspective\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis stage is nothing new to Mavericks coach Jason Kidd, who is in the Finals for the fifth time as a player or coach.\n\nHe has experienced lows, such as losing back-to-back trips to the Finals in 2002 and 2003 as a player with the New Jersey Nets. He has also seen success, earning his lone title as a player with Dallas in 2011 at age 38 and one as an assistant on the Lakers 2020 championship team.\n\nThe biggest lesson he has taken away is to approach it like business and be ready to live with the results. That has been his message to his team throughout these playoffs.\n\n\"This is the best of the best at the highest level,\" Kidd said. \"It's fun. That's what the Finals are all about, is seeing what team is going to step forward and take advantage of mistakes.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMazzulla was an assistant on Ime Udoka's staff in 2022. What he learned from that experience is that the details of winning never change, even on this stage.\n\n\"The toughest team will win,\" Mazzulla said. \"The team that makes the most plays will win. The team that can execute the details at a high level will win. It's no different.\"\n\nFriends and competitors\n\nIrving is ready for what he expects to be an icy greeting from Boston's home crowd for Game 1 on Thursday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCeltics fans haven't held a high opinion of him since he ended two disappointing seasons in Boston by leaving for the Nets and joining Kevin Durant in free agency in 2019.\n\nHe then rankled the Boston faithful even more when he flipped his middle finger at fans after making a shot during Brooklyn's first round playoff series loss to the Celtics in 2022. But he said he is looking forward to matching up with \"brothers\" and former teammates Tatum and Brown.\n\n\"They've gotten tremendously better. They've led their team to this point. So I'm proud of them,\" Irving said. \"I'm looking forward to the competition because this is what we've all strived for since we were kids, basketball at this level playing against the best of the best.\"", "source": {"uri": "manilatimes.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Manila times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@manilatimes.net", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author",

It helped Brown earn the NBA's first $300 million contract last summer. And, Tatum is expected to get one this offseason.\n\nThe team has branded the All-Stars as \"The Jays\" in a marketing campaign shown during games that pitted them against one another in mini competitions.\n\nIt has created natural comparisons between them along the way, fostering an atmosphere in which fans and sports pundits alike have tried to parse out which one of them is better, whose spot is most untouchable on the roster and which of them is more pivotal to the Celtics' success as they prepare to lead the team to the franchise's 18th NBA title.\n\nIt reached a new level last week during a segment on ESPN's \"Get Up\" in which panelists debated whether the 26-year-old Tatum expressed excitement or disappointment while watching the 27-year-old Brown garner Eastern Conference finals MVP honors.\n\n\"I think it's unfair to both of them,\" Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said of what he viewed as an attempt to manufacture friction between the two stars.\n\nBut even as Tatum and Brown have distinguished themselves as the most important players on Boston's roster and the keys to the Celtics' fate in their NBA Finals matchup with the Dallas Mavericks, Mazzulla has hope that people will start viewing them differently.\n\n\"They're, like, two completely different people. They're two completely different players,\" Mazzulla said. \"They're great teammates, they love each other and they go about winning and they go about their process in a different way. Why they have to always be lumped together I think is unfair.\"\n\nTatum and Brown, along with Al Horford, are the only returning starters from the 2021-22 team that lost to the Golden State Warriors in six games in the Finals after holding a 2-1 series lead.\n\nWhile Horford has taken on mostly a reserve role this season, backing up 7-footer Kristaps Porzingis, Tatum and Brown have taken their play up a notch.\n\nTatum's scoring numbers have remained steady from the regular season (26.9 per game) into the playoffs (26.0), while his rebounding has increased from 8.1 to 10.4 per game in the postseason. Brown, too, has seen jumps in those categories, going from 23.0 points and 5.5 rebounds per game to 25.0 points and 6.1 rebounds in the playoffs.\n\nToday's Top Headlines\n\nStory continues below\n\nTax bill stunner: $250K owed on former Sand Dunes Club properties on Sullivan's Island Commentary: 'Spartanburgers' baseball team name is a big swing and a miss Editorial: SC voters in 32 districts can put an end to Freedom Caucus chaos.

They push each other every single day in practice. They communicate with each other, but they go about it differently. And, I think they both get it unfair being compared to each other. They're different. And we see other duos around the league don't have to go through that. ... It's because they've been so successful their entire careers, they've been able to for so long stay in success at a high level.\"\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA", "source": {"uri":

Those two teams dominate that board, with a sizable gap between them and the next-fullest trophy case.\n\nHere's a thorough history of all past NBA Finals winners, including how many titles the Celtics have won, when the Mavericks earned their lone ring and which teams are still searching for their first.\n\nThe Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers have won the most NBA Finals, with 17 apiece.\n\nNext is the Golden State Warriors, whose four titles within the last decade brought their all-time total to seven -- counting their 1947 win during the era of the Basketball Association of America, which merged with the National Basketball League to become the NBA in 1949.\n\nAfter them are the Chicago Bulls, whose six championships came in the 1990s with Michael Jordan, and the San Antonio Spurs, who have won five -- all with Gregg Popovich at the helm.\n\nThe 2023-24 season will be the sixth straight season without a repeat NBA Finals winning team.\n\nSeveral times, actually. The first was in 1959, when the Celtics swept the Lakers (then the Minneapolis Lakers). The last was in 2018, when the Warriors swept the Cavaliers.\n\nThe Jordan-led Chicago Bulls three-peated twice in the same decade, winning from 1991-93 and again from 1996-98. If Jordan hadn't retired for the 1993-94 season and most of the next, perhaps it would've been an eight-peat.\n\nInstead, the only eight-peat in NBA history -- and probably the only one the league will ever see -- belongs to the Boston Celtics. They won the title every year from 1959-66.\n\nHowever, there were only eight (until 1961) or nine teams in the league during that Celtics run.\n\nThe Nuggets won their first championship last year, leaving 10 franchises that have yet to reach the mountaintop: Brooklyn Nets, Charlotte Hornets, Indiana Pacers, Los Angeles Clippers, Memphis Grizzlies, Minnesota Timberwolves, New Orleans Pelicans, Orlando Magic, Phoenix Suns and Utah Jazz.\n\nThat would be the Lakers, with 15.

For me, at least, I can say. I don't know if Jayson feels the same way.\"\n\nIn a way, Tatum was the golden child coming to the Celtics on draft night. Brown, who arrived a year earlier, remembers different feelings -- so much so, he was shocked to receive the MVP award for the Eastern Conference finals when the Celtics swept the shorthanded Indiana Pacers.\n\n\"It's kind of been that my whole career, in a sense,\" Brown said. \"Just being booed when you were drafted to saying you were overpaid, saying you were overpaid again. It's been that the whole journey for me.\n\nIn the last three games of that series, Tatum shot 39% from the field and averaged just 21 points. Brown was the lone bright spot in the decisive Game 6 loss at home, scoring 34, but he had five turnovers each in the last two games -- becoming a target for the Warriors' defense and one for fan ire.\n\nThe Celtics wilted beneath that Finals weight and failed to reach June last year in an even more disappointing manner to the Miami Heat in the East finals.\n\nBut the path has been laid for them to have fresh bodies, as Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is has been cleared from the injury report, and they don't have playoff attrition either, with a pretty easy road to get here.\n\n\"We kind of took it for granted at certain moments,\" said Tatum, referencing last year. \"We didn't make it to the Finals. This year put things in perspective. I think you can see in our excitement when we won the conference. Obviously, that's not the end all, be all, but it really is tough to get to this moment.\"\n\nAll that's left is to dissect some silly things, like Tatum's alleged facial expression when Brown was awarded that ECF MVP. And the overall discussion over Tatum's individual offensive play, which certainly seems fair given his numbers, averaging 26 points, 10.4 rebounds and 5.9 assists but shooting 44.2% from the floor and 29% from 3-point range.\n\n\"My mom took it a little tougher than maybe I did. But for me, I don't take it personal, right? Just a long break without NBA basketball, so they had to overanalyze every little thing, have something to talk about,\" Tatum said. \"Did it get old? Yeah. But, you know, it's the Finals. They wouldn't talk about me if I wasn't good, so ... try to take some positives out of it and change the channel.\"\n\nBrown said he's watched the 2022 Finals in its entirety four or five times since and notes the Celtics are a much different team than the inexperienced one relative to Golden State.\n\n\"Yeah, you learn and grow from your experiences, from being a 25-year-old to being a 27-year-old is a big difference,\" Brown said. \"Yeah, I'm 27 [smiling]. You learn from those experiences.\n\n\"We got a different team. We got a different coach, too, as well. We had Ime Udoka; now we have Joe Mazzulla. We had Marcus Smart, Rob Williams; we have Jrue Holiday, Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is. Different team, different coach two years later makes a pretty big difference.\"\n\nMavericks coach Jason Kidd debunks the experience element of being in the Finals, in a way. When he carried the New Jersey Nets to the Finals in 2002 and 2003, they didn't lose because of inexperience, as he saw it.\n\n\"It's simple: talent. Sometimes you don't have enough talent,\" Kidd said. \"As I brought up the Lakers and Nets, we were happy to be there, but we just didn't have enough talent to beat Kobe and Shaq. It could be that simple.\"\n\nSometimes experience or confidence can be the difference between winning and losing when teams are evenly matched, or when the supernova is on the other side, in the case of Dallas' Luka Don\u010di\u0107.\n\nAll that matters is the Celtics believe their past failures have prepared them for this, and they believe it'll help, not hinder.\n\n\"I'm a firm believer in everything happens for a reason,\" Tatum said. \"There's a lesson to be learned in every situation. I do. I do feel a lot different this time, this go-round, two years later. I'm excited for the opportunity for us to get the job done.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Here are 20 stats that will define the series.\n\n1\n\nThe amount of NBA Championships won by the Dallas Mavericks in franchise history. The Mavs have played in two NBA Finals, both against the Miami Heat losing to Dwayne Wade and Shaquille O'Neal in 2006 before beating Wade and LeBron James in 2011.\n\n17\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers and Celtics are both tied for the most NBA Championships in league history at 17. It has been over a decade since the Celtics last won the NBA title in 2008 when Paul Pierce starred for Boston.\n\n64\n\nThe Celtics win total for the regular season making them the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference with a 64-18 record. No other team in the Eastern or Western Conference had 60 wins during the regular season.\n\n50\n\nThe Mavs went 50-32 during the regular season, making them the No. 5 seed in the Western Conference. The fewest number of wins a Mavs team has ever had while still making the NBA Finals.\n\n5\n\nLuka Doncic is leading the NBA playoffs in five categories, total points(489), rebounds (164), assists (150), three-pointers made (57), and steals (28). Doncic could become the first player in NBA history to lead the entire league in all five categories in a single postseason.\n\n181\n\nThe number of postseason games played by Celtics forward Al Horford is the third most in NBA history for a player without a championship victory behind only John Stockon (182) and Karl Malone (193). Horford's defense will be crucial in the upcoming series as the Mavs will look to let Doncic target the 38-year-old on the defensive end to try to create mismatches, score and find teammates for open threes.\n\n6-3\n\nNo team in the NBA has played or won more clutch time games than the Mavs this season who have a 6-3 record in such games. The NBA defines clutch time as the final five minutes of the fourth quarter or overtime when the score is within five points.\n\nClutch time is where NBA Finals champions are made and both teams have excelled in those situations in the postseason. while Dallas has the most wins Boston is undefeated with four wins in clutch time games. If the Mavs want to hoist the Larry O'Brien Trophy they'll most likely have to blemish the Celtics' clutch games record.\n\n35.98%\n\nLuka Doncic has a regular season usage rate of 35.98%, if Doncic and the Mavs win the finals it will be the highest regular season usage rate ever by a player who won the NBA Finals in the same year surpassing Michael Jordan's mark set in the 1992-93 season.\n\nUsage rate is defined by the percentage of offensive possessions that a player ends with a field goal attempt, free throws or a turnover while on the floor. Doncic has lowered his usage to 31.3 in the NBA playoffs and a slight lessening of his offensive burden might help Doncic more easily avoid fatigue in the finals.\n\n7-2\n\nThe Mavs have been road warriors throughout the playoffs and are coming off an exceptional performance in the Western Conference Finals where they won all three road games including game six on the road to clinch a NBA Finals berth.\n\nThe Mavs have been the lower seed in every playoff series this year, making their road prowess even more impressive.\n\n42.7\n\nThe Mavs allow the fourth-fewest points in the paint per game in the NBA Playoffs but will have their hands full with a Celtics team that ranks No. 2 and 6 in points scored in the restricted area and points scored in the paint outside the restricted area.\n\nDereck Lively II and Daniel Gafford have provided excellent rim protection for the Mavs and will have to continue their effectiveness in their toughest matchup yet.\n\n30\n\nDaniel Gafford leads the playoffs in blocks and has defended the rim better than almost any player in the NBA allowing 45.2% shooting at the rim the number one mark in the league for any player guarding at least 50 shots at the rim.\n\nLively has provided a similar impact allowing 49.3% shooting at the rim placing him third-best in the league.\n\n47.4\n\nNo team in the NBA Playoffs takes a higher percentage of their shots from three than the Celtics at 47.4%. Boston is also one of the most accurate teams from three-point range shooting 36.8% for fifth best in the league.\n\nThe Mavs have been average at limiting opponents' three-point percentages, holding teams to 35.6% shooting from three during the playoffs. That places Dallas ninth out of 16 teams.\n\n27.2\n\n27.2 is the number of points Kyrie Irving has averaged over his 13 NBA finals games in addition to 4.2 rebounds and assists. Irving has a 1-2 record in the finals though in 2015 he only played one game due to injury.\n\nThe only player on the Mavs to have played major minutes in the finals, Derrick Jones Jr played nine minutes in four games during the 2020 NBA Finals. Irving's leadership will be key with a team full of players who have never played in the finals.\n\n11.6\n\nThe Mavs have led the NBA in corner three-point attempts and are third in percentage shooting 39.4%. PJ Washington and Derrick Jones Jr have both been major recipients shooting 41% and 46% from the corners respectively.\n\nThe Mavs' ability to hit from the corners has punished teams when they've tried to send help on Doncic or Irving.\n\n31%\n\nThe Mavs have grabbed 31% of available offensive rebounds which places them fourth-best in the playoffs. They've scored 13.4-second chance points per game, also fourth best in the league, thanks to their offensive rebounding prowess.\n\nThe Celtics are well suited to try and limit the Mavs' offensive rebounding, the Celtics were second in defensive rebounding percentage grabbing 77.8% of available defensive rebounds.\n\n377\n\nDoncic has created 377 points off assists in the playoffs 75 more points created than second-place Tyrese Haliburton. Doncic was the leading assist-man on buckets made for every member of the Mavs starting five.\n\n33.3% and 30.4%\n\nOne area of concern for the Celtics could be the lack of elite shot-making from Jayson Tatum on the way to the finals. Tatum has taken the fourth-most pull-up threes and the eighth-most pull-up twos in the entire playoffs but has shot only 30.4% from three and a league-worst 33.3% from two.\n\n61.5%\n\nAmong players with at least five two-point shots attempted per game, Eastern Conference Finals MVP Jaylen Brown ranks tenth among all players and third among guards with a shooting percentage of 61.5%.\n\n47.4%\n\nDerrick White had one of the best seasons of his career averaging 15.1 points 5.2 assists and 4.2 rebounds and has been just as good for the Celtics in the playoffs.\n\nOne area where the Mavs will have to pay attention to White is on catch-and-shoot three-point opportunities. White has taken the fourth most such shots in the league and leads the NBA shooting 47.4% off those opportunities.\n\n12.9\n\nDoncic has scored relentlessly off pick-and-rolls in the postseason ranking third in points scored (12.9) and is tied for eighth in points per possession (1.03).", "source": {"uri": "star-telegram.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fort Worth Star-Telegram"},

Boston hopes to top off its historic 64-18 regular season with the 18th championship in franchise history -- the most of any NBA team.\n\nAccomplishing that feat against Dallas won't be an easy task. Led by superstar Luka Doncic and ex-Celtic Kyrie Irving, the Mavs are by far the toughest team the C's have faced in this postseason. There will be plenty of pressure on Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown to prove themselves as the better star duo in the series.\n\nOf course, Boston will need more than just big games from the Jays to take home the NBA title. Here are the five biggest keys to the Celtics defeating the Mavericks and bringing Banner 18 to TD Garden.\n\nThe Celtics are a perfect 6-0 on the road in this postseason after posting a 27-14 record away from TD Garden during the regular season. Their road success sets them up well against the Mavs, who haven't benefitted from homecourt at all during the 2023-24 campaign. Dallas went 25-16 both at home and on the road during the regular season and is a less-than-stellar 5-3 at American Airlines Center in these playoffs.\n\nContinuing to take care of business on the road will be crucial for the C's, whose two playoff losses have come at the Garden.\n\nThe Celtics will lean heavily on their 3-point shooting prowess to outscore arguably the best offensive duo in the league in Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving. When the 3s aren't falling, it could get ugly.\n\nAs we saw in Boston's Game 2 loss to Cleveland, the missed 3s also hurt on the defensive end. The Celtics' transition defense was non-existent against Donovan Mitchell, so you can imagine how the game will play out if they have a similar effort against the Mavs' superstar tandem.\n\nThis could be a quick series if the C's are hot from 3. Boston has a 66-7 record this season, including the playoffs, when making the same number or more 3s than its opponents. It is 11-13 when opponents make more 3s.\n\nTo this point in the 2024 playoffs, the Celtics have quieted the critics of their clutch-time performance. They're 4-0 in games within five points in the last five minutes and lead all teams with a 49.3 net rating in that scenario.\n\nThat only four of their 14 postseason games have included clutch time speaks to how dominant Boston has been during its run. But barring any injuries, Dallas won't be a cakewalk like the undermanned Miami Heat, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Indiana Pacers. Boston should be prepared for some close, grind-it-out games that are decided in the final minutes.\n\nIn past years, we've been wary about the Celtics' ability to perform in clutch circumstances. However, nothing we've seen this season suggests they can't thrive in such moments this time around. They were 21-12 in clutch games during the regular season with a 15.4 net rating that ranked fourth in the NBA.\n\nThe Mavericks haven't wavered in crunch time either, going 23-9 with a 20.3 net rating during the regular season, followed by a 6-3 record and 1.6 net rating in the playoffs.\n\nThere's a good chance the team that wins the rebounding battle wins it all. That could be a difficult task for the Celtics against the Mavericks' tough frontcourt duo of Daniel Gafford and rookie Dereck Lively II.\n\nC's great Cedric Maxwell discussed the importance of rebounding in this series -- particularly on the offensive glass -- during a recent episode of the Celtics Talk Podcast:\n\n\"I can give you one key: rebounding the basketball,\" Maxwell told Chris Forsberg. \"Not giving up second-chance opportunities. Because Gafford and Lively are around the rim all the time. You don't want to give a team that has these shooters extra opportunities. ...\n\n\"To me, it's going to be not giving up offensive rebounds. Because we've seen Lively, we've seen Gafford, those guys feast on the inside.\"\n\nThat means Boston will lean heavily on its frontcourt trio of Kristaps Porzingis, Al Horford, and Luke Kornet to fight for boards. We could also see more of Oshae Brissett, who brought the energy and helped in the rebounding department during a standout performance against Indiana.\n\nThe Celtics have a 10-0 record in the playoffs when they outrebound their opponent. They're 2-2 when they lose the battle on the boards.\n\nPorzingis is good to go for Game 1 on Thursday. The question is, just how effective will he be?\n\nThe Celtics will need to know the answer relatively quickly. If it's obvious early on that Porzingis still isn't 100 percent, it would be wise to limit his minutes. Now is not the time to leave him on the floor to work through his struggles if he's noticeably rusty. That could throw Boston's offensive rhythm out of whack right out of the gate.\n\nThat said, a healthy Porzingis is a game-changer. The 7-foot-3 Latvian gives Boston an answer for Gafford and Lively at the rim as well as an additional sharpshooter for Dallas to worry about. Having him in the starting lineup also allows the 38-year-old Al Horford to have fresh legs off the bench, making him even more impactful on both ends.\n\nIt isn't farfetched to say Porzingis' performance to start Game 1 could set the tone for the rest of the series.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

While the Celtics and Mavs are connected in plenty of ways, the 2024 Finals will be the first playoff matchup between the two franchises.\n\nTeams getting a rematch in the Finals is somewhat rare in the NBA. In 2022, when the Golden State Warriors and Celtics met, it was just the 12th time in league history that the same matchup had occurred in multiple Finals.\n\nFrom long-standing rivalries to unusual duos, here are those 12 pairs of teams that have squared off in multiple Finals:\n\nThe most storied rivalry in basketball goes all the way back to the Lakers' Minneapolis days. The Celtics dominated the early matchups, winning the first eight Finals showdowns. The Lakers have come back to win three of the last four, including the most recent tilt in 2010.\n\nThe Sixers were the Syracuse Nationals back when they met up with the Lakers in the 1950 and 1954 NBA Finals. The two teams then were the dominant Finals matchup of the early '80s with the Lakers winning in 1980 and 1982 before the Sixers prevailed in 1983. Their latest Finals matchup came in 2001, as Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant earned the second title in their three-peat.\n\nLike the Nationals, the Knicks lost to the Lakers twice in the Finals during the 1950s. The Knicks-Lakers matchup then was the prominent Finals series of the early 1970s with the Knicks winning their first - and only - two championships in franchise history.\n\nThe Celtics' first title came against the Hawks in 1957, and the Hawks returned the favor by beating the Celtics for their first title in the following season. From there, Boston won the next eight NBA championships, including two against St. Louis to start the franchise's dominant run in the 1960s.\n\nThe Warriors and Cavaliers made history in 2017 by becoming the first teams to meet in three consecutive Finals. They one-upped themselves in 2018 by making it four straight. Golden State won three of the four matchups, while Cleveland made history in 2016 on its way to its first NBA championship.\n\nAfter falling to the Showtime Lakers in 1988, the Bad Boys Pistons won their first championship over Los Angeles in 1989. The two organizations faced off once again in 2004 with the Pistons pulling off a 4-1 series drubbing that put an end to O'Neal's time in L.A.\n\nThe Bullets needed seven games to get past the Sonics in the 1978 Finals and secure their first championship. Seattle returned the favor the next season, earning its first championship with a five-game Finals triumph over Washington in 1979.\n\nThe first Celtics-Rockets Finals showdown came in 1981 with the Celtics winning in six games. In 1986, the basketball world was anticipating a Celtics-Lakers Finals rubber match, but the Rockets eliminated the Lakers in that year's Western Conference finals. In the Finals, the Celtics once again prevailed in six games.\n\nThe Jazz got a front-row view of Michael Jordan's \"Last Dance.\" Karl Malone had been named the league MVP prior to the 1997 Finals, but Jordan and the Bulls repeated as champions. Jordan won MVP the following season and capped the year off with his second championship three-peat, giving him the sixth and final title of his career.\n\nThe two Heat-Mavericks Finals saw two completely different versions of Miami. In 2006, a young Dwyane Wade scored nearly 35 points per game and helped the Heat climb out of a 2-0 series hole on their way to their first ever NBA title. In 2011, Wade had LeBron James and Chris Bosh by his side, but Dirk Nowitzki's Mavs beat the Miami superteam in six games. The Heat and Mavs were close to meeting in another Finals in 2022, but they were both eliminated in the conference finals.\n\nSpeaking of the superteam Heat, their last two Finals runs together came against the Spurs. Miami won an iconic seven-game series in 2013 thanks to Ray Allen's Game 6 heroics, giving the Heat back-to-back rings. San Antonio got some payback the following year, completing a gentleman's sweep and winning their fifth NBA championship.\n\nThe Celtics won their first Finals meeting against the Warriors. Wilt Chamberlain averaged over 29 points and 27 rebounds per game, but Bill Russell and Co. came out on top in a five-game triumph. The Warriors finally got revenge nearly 60 years later, with Steph Curry averaging 31.2 points per game as Golden State defeated the Celtics in six games to win their fourth championship in eight years.", "source": {"uri": "nbcconnecticut.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Connecticut"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki",

He faces a Dallas side who last tasted glory in 2011.\n\nAnd the Mavericks have former Celtic Kyrie Irving, part of a dynamic Dallas back court that secured a Finals spot with a blend of finesse and grit.\n\nIt will be a culmination of a season's worth of blood, sweat, and tears - made even spicier by the two returning stars.\n\nThe Boston Celtics have endured 16 years of near-misses, what-ifs and heartbreaking close encounters, moments that have conditioned their fans to brace for the worst.\n\nHowever, as they gear up for their second Finals appearance in two years, the C's now have arguably their best chance to finally get it done, courtesy of Porzingis.\n\nIn June last year, the Celtics made a bold, game-changing decision: trading away guard Marcus Smart in a three-team deal to get centre Porzingis from the Washington Wizards.\n\nThis unexpected move sent shockwaves through the fanbase. Smart was the heart of the team, he even dyed his hair green. It was a move that signalled Boston's all-in approach to clinching the title.\n\nPorzingis never clicked alongside superstar Luka Doncic during his time at Dallas, but his development since leaving in 2022 could come back to haunt them as he returns from injury after missing the play-offs so far.\n\nThe 28-year-old is dubbed 'The Unicorn' for his versatile skill set and shooting prowess, and could be the X-factor in this best-of-seven series.\n\nPorzingis, because of his shooting, will force Dallas into having to defend the perimeter a lot more.\n\nIt's a defensive scheme they haven't frequently employed so far in the play-offs and his presence behind the arc will create space for stars Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown to exploit, potentially stretching the Mavericks.\n\nThe Celtics have lost only two games in the play-offs, beating both the injury-depleted Miami Heat and Cleveland Cavaliers 4-1, before dominating the Indiana Pacers with a 4-0 sweep in the Eastern Conference finals.\n\nWith the league's best regular-season record and arguably the strongest, most balanced starting five, the Celtics, under head coach Joe Mazzulla, might have finally assembled the perfect formula for championship success.\n\nFor Dallas, all eyes will be not only on how Doncic fares in his first Finals, but also on the controversial return of Irving.\n\nIrving, one of the league's most enigmatic and electrifying players, has a well-documented and tumultuous past with the Celtics.\n\nHis departure from Boston in 2019 left a sour taste for many fans, who he'd initially told he would sign a new deal, before his relationship with the organisation worsened, ending with a trade to the Brooklyn Nets.\n\nThis series offers Irving a chance for redemption, not just in silencing the critics in Boston but in showcasing to the world that he can get the job done without LeBron James beside him - the accusation that has hung over him since his 2016 championship win with Cleveland.\n\nThe 32-year-old's ball-handling wizardry, scoring ability and clutch performances are undeniable. With Doncic, he forms one of the most formidable back courts in recent memory.\n\nDoncic has already cemented himself as a generational talent. His vision, court awareness and prolific scoring make him a nightmare for any defence.\n\nFor Irving, this series is more than just a shot at a title, it's a chance to rewrite his narrative and cement his legacy in a city that once spurned him. For Doncic, it's an opportunity to elevate his burgeoning career to historic heights.\n\nDespite their defensive strengths, Boston will have their coverages tested as they attempt to manage Irving's explosive drives and Doncic's deadly shooting.\n\nThe Mavericks, under head coach Jason Kidd, have had a tougher play-off run than Boston, overcoming the LA Clippers, top seeds the Oklahoma City Thunder and the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nBut that resilience should serve them well against an elite Celtics team. If their two star guards can impose their will and maintain their high levels, the Mavericks have the potential to bring it home.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Smart", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Smart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_O'Brien", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Larry O'Brien"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Mazzulla", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Mazzulla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Wizards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington Wizards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Nets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn Nets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kidd", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jason Kidd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/80MiA6PWCDcN5wwcRYgSqw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bbc_us_articles_995/232cbf368fe0b048d9d59a43d3d6fbe8", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

Irving had 36 points, five assists and four rebounds in the series-clinching win over the Timberwolves, finishing without a turnover for the first time in 12 games. His scoring average has dipped from 25.6 points in the regular season to 22.8 points in the postseason, despite his three high-scoring games against Minnesota. Which side of his prop total should you back with your NBA Finals prop bets?\n\nMeanwhile, Celtics forward Jayson Tatum leads Boston with 26.9 points, 8.1 rebounds and 4.9 assists per game. His prop total is 26.5 points for Game 1, so is there any value in his 2024 NBA Finals odds? Before making any Celtics vs. Mavericks picks on sites like PrizePicks or DraftKings Pick6, be sure to check out the NBA predictions and betting advice from the SportsLine AI PickBot.\n\nBuilt using cutting-edge artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques by SportsLine's Data Science team, AI Predictions and AI Ratings are generated for each pick and player prop.

Hear the full conversation on \"Good Word with Goodwill\" - part of the \"Ball Don't Lie\" podcast - and subscribe on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or wherever you listen.\n\nWould you have more confidence in Luka Danic Kyrie Irving in clutch situations, more than anybody on the Celtics, like Jason Tatum and Jalen Brown.\n\nAnd in the postseason, um, I feel like the Boston Celtics are in danger of being the Utah Jazz where they got two really great players that always just, they ran into a buzz saw.\n\nBut the problem is the buzz saw is everybody, like everybody seems to beat these Boston Celtics when it comes to winning the overall championship rather than the Utah Jazz going up against Michael Jordan and the Bulls.\n\nThis is a situation where maybe the Boston Celtics keep it together with John Stockton and their Karl Malone.\n\nBut, um, right now I'm picking the Dallas Mavericks and I feel pretty good about that because of the lack of clutch performance.\n\nYes, it's been good, but it's been good on the B teams, right?\n\nAnd then secondly, when we, when we talk about, uh, the, the strength of schedule, I just have a lot better feelings about the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nThey've been tested, uh, they have a champion on their side in, in Kyrie Irving.\n\nUm and I just feel like when you look at the Boston Celtics, the pressure is on him and Jason Tatum doesn't have, how do I put this?\n\nHe's not an explosive athlete that he can blow by.\n\nYou get to the bucket and you know, dunk on you, right.\n\nJalen Brown is a better athlete.\n\nI'm not saying either guy is a bad athlete, but I'm saying if Anthony Edwards is the line for athleticism as far as blow by you get to the bucket, get, get a bucket.\n\nJason Tatum and Jalen Brown are like steps behind that.\n\nYou know what I mean?\n\nLike there are levels behind that and if your offense, your offensive system isn't creating offense for you, then you've got to be able to do something on your own.\n\nAnd that is my fear for the Celtics is how are you guys going to create shots that are not driving kick three pointers that are not, we're just gonna stand around the perimeter and create a switch and see what happens there.\n\nThat to me is going to be their undoing if it happens, if it's close.\n\nI just, I'm, it's just a weird to me.\n\nA very weird team and you can switch around the point guard, you can switch around the coach, you can switch around all these other different parts, but you don't actually fix anything.\n\nYou're just a very good team that could get to the finals, but won't win it.\n\nAnd then watching this past week when Boston sweeps Dallas or something like that, we gotta sit here and eat some crow.\n\nYou know what I mean?\n\nLike, watch out there and say all of that, like, Boston will run a rough shot over Dallas and we gotta sit up somewhere and be like, well, I guess we were wrong.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo

For Isaiah Thomas, one of the franchise's former stars, the Dallas Mavericks duo of Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving is better,\n\nJaylen Brown first made his way to Boston as the franchise's third pick in the 2016 Draft. A year later, the Celtics' front office traded down with the Philadelphia 76ers to get Jayson Tatum using the third pick as well. These pair of selections formed the primary offensive core of the team, one that has peaked now as Boston dominated both the regular season and playoffs this year.\n\nUnlike Brown and Tatum, Doncic and Irving only had a season and a half of playing together on the court. The one-time NBA champion and former Brooklyn Nets point guard arrived before the trade deadline last year in a move that was heavily criticized at the time.\n\nNow, these two duos have led their respective squads to the biggest stage of them all. This has led people to take sides on which of these pairings is the more talented and which has the best chance to win the NBA Finals.\n\nFormer Boston Celtics Star Isaiah Thomas Admits Duo of Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving Is Better Than Jayson Tatum-Jaylen Brown Tandem\n\nAmong those who have aired their side on this matter is former Boston Celtics star Isaiah Thomas. He shares his preference in a video shared by ClutchPoints on X.\n\nThomas played three-and-a-half seasons in Boston, with two of them as an All-Star. During that peak in his career, the point guard averaged 24.7 points, 2.7 rebounds, and 6.0 assists. Meanwhile, the duo of Doncic and Irving are heading into the Finals with scoring that hasn't been seen in 32 years.\n\nIt remains to be seen which of the two duos will emerge as the better one. In a couple of weeks, both teams will slug it out on the court to see who'll finally become a champion among them.\n\nFor More Great Basketball Content", "source": {"uri": "hardwoodheroics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "hardwoodheroics.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "angelo_guinhawa@hardwoodheroics.com", "name": "Angelo Guinhawa", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Thomas_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Isaiah Thomas (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Nets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn Nets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Tandem", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Tandem", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.hardwoodheroics.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/USATSI_23098400_168400517_lowres-1024x683.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

Both the Boston Celtics and Dallas Mavericks boast big-name stars and strong role players. But what happens when you examine the teams more closely?\n\nFor example, when ranking the rosters together in one big mishmash, who has more guys in the top-five? Who has more in the top-15? And what does this all mean for the upcoming NBA Finals matchup that begins on Thursday? Well, let's dive in, ranking the players in this series 1-through-15.\n\nThe 6-foot-1 guard will likely play a big role off the bench for the Celtics in the series. He is the third guard in the team's rotation, spelling Derrick White and Jrue Holiday. During the regular season, he's the perfect long-range-shooting, change-of-pace player to help out when the starters rest. But will he be big enough to hold up against a stout Mavericks team? As of now, that is unclear.\n\nThe streaky shooting guard had a big game for the Mavs against the Oklahoma City Thunder in the Western Conference Semifinals. In Game 2 of that series, Hardaway Jr. scored 17 points on 6-of-10 shooting, going 2-of-4 from three-point range. If the son of former NBA star Tim Hardaway can have another performance like that in the NBA Finals, that would be huge for the Mavs.\n\nJaden Hardy has been one of the biggest surprises for the Mavs in the playoffs, giving his team huge minutes when they need it most. The second-year player has been a terrific backup guard, giving Kyrie Irving and Luka Don\u010di\u0107 brief breaks during the games. With a nice floater game and a stalwart edge, Hardy will assuredly be a factor in the Finals.\n\nEven more than Hardy, the springy Derrick Jones Jr. has been a revelation for the Mavs this year. Before the season, Jones bet on himself and took a veteran's minimum salary. Now, after shooting nearly 40% from three-point range throughout the 2024 playoffs while also providing lockdown defense, Jones is in line for a big offseason deal and perhaps a championship ring for his efforts.\n\nAcquired prior to the NBA trade deadline, Daniel Gafford has made explosive plays all throughout the 2024 postseason. From finishing Luka lobs to blocking shots, it's as if everything he does comes with a bit of dynamite. Gafford is part of an important two-man center rotation for Dallas with rookie Dereck Lively II that will be tested in the Finals against Boston's stretch bigs. But so far, he's met every challenge with energy and force.\n\nThe veteran. Al Horford has been there, done that. He's seen it all. The 38-year-old has done everything there is to do in the league, except win a ring. This year is his best chance. And in the 2024 playoffs, Horford has been essential to the Celtics' winning ways, playing center on defense and spreading the floor with his outside shooting on offense. It's a minor miracle that he's been able to hold up so well this late in his career. He'll need to do it for upwards of seven more pressure-packed games.\n\nThe other main player acquired by Dallas at this year's trade deadline, the former Charlotte Hornet has been as reliable as it gets for the Mavs. For a team with two bona fide stars in Luka and Kyrie, P.J. Washington has often served as the necessary third scorer for the team, hitting outside shots and providing excellent defense. Making his first playoff run in his five-year NBA career, Washington is averaging 13.6 points and 6.7 rebounds while shooting over 36% from three-point range.\n\nA lot was made when Dallas tanked the end of last season to get the draft pick that would become Dereck Lively II. The NBA even fined the franchise $750,000 for its dubious maneuver. But given how well Lively has been playing this postseason, even as a rookie, the Mavericks would do it all over again 100 times out of 100. He is the quintessential lob finisher, a monster shot-blocker, and a presence that few can match down low. The only thing that has taken him out of the game so far was an errant knee to the head. Now, he will be a huge factor in the Finals. Can he guard Celtics center Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is on the perimeter? That will be a big test throughout the series.\n\nSpeaking of the 7-foot-2 center with three-point range, Porzi\u0146\u0123is hasn't played in more than a month and his health will go a long way in determining this series. If he can suit up and stay in the games, Boston will have a big advantage. He can stretch the floor and keep the lane unclogged while the Celtics are on offense. And he can protect the rim on the other end. The former Maverick, who is also often injured, Porzi\u0146\u0123is can prove a lot if he and the guys in green take home the trophy this year.\n\nAcquired two seasons ago from San Antonio, Derrick White has blossomed into perhaps the most important Celtic. He is a knock-down shooter, an excellent defender, and a team leader who just makes winning plays. But he's also the slightest starter on a team going against Luka, who will likely look to hunt White on defense. But if he can hold up on defense and shoot a high percentage beyond the arc on offense, White could even win Finals MVP. If not, the Celtics may lack that all-important third star and fall to the pressurizing Mavs.\n\nAnother recent acquisition for the Celtics (indeed, this series is full of recently traded players!), Jrue Holiday, like his counterpart Kyrie Irving, has won a ring before (in 2021 with the Bucks). And he will assuredly lean on that championship experience in this series. Holiday will be tasked with guarding Luka, Kyrie, and maybe even P.J. Washington at different times and he will be given his fair share of open jumpers from the outside. Will he knock them down? Can he stay out of foul trouble and get the timely steal? Time will tell. But we would bet on it, given his long resume and playoff pedigree.\n\nThe former Boston Celtic, Kyrie Irving was last seen in Beantown stomping on the center-court mascot and flipping the bird to Boston fans. Now, the point guard seems to be in a different state of mind, more at peace, more Zen. He'll need that to stave off the likely rowdy crowd in Boston. Irving can do things with the ball that few people have ever been able to, and he's been the perfect No. 2 player alongside Luka. He can score almost at will from the outside or at the basket and he knows just when to attack or lay in wait. Will Boston's cadre of talented wing defenders be able to slow him down? That could be the key to the whole series.\n\nFresh off signing a $300-plus million-dollar contract last summer, Jaylen Brown might be the Celtics' best player. Sure, Jayson Tatum gets most of the headlines, but Brown hit the biggest shot for Boston this postseason (in Game 1 against Indiana to force overtime) and he remains the team's best two-way player. He scores, he defends, and he plays with a chip on his shoulder that might just create enough urgency for the Celtics to win. They certainly can't do it without him. Brown was the team's best player in the 2022 NBA Finals. Can he do it again? Can he and Tatum match Luka and Irving on offense? Boston fans hope so.\n\nA lot is on his broad shoulders this series. If the Celtics win, Tatum will vault into the Best-Player-in-the-World conversation. If they don't, he could be part of the Biggest-Disappointments banter. For all his talent, for all his accomplishments to date, there has always been something passive about Tatum's game on the biggest of stages. But he can quiet all of that over the next four-to-seven games. He can become the dominant, snatch-the-win-from-the-other-team guy everyone wants him to be. Is now the time for the 26-year-old star?\n\nA top-three MVP candidate this year, Luka Don\u010di\u0107 could become the unquestioned best player in the world with an NBA Finals win over the next two weeks. The guy can do it all on offense. He can shoot the three, hit game-winners, put a defender on his hip, and pick apart a defense. He is cagey, cerebral, and nasty. Even the refs seem to fear him. But will it be enough? If Boston shuts down Irving and the Dallas role players, can Don\u010di\u0107 win the series on his own? Can he will his team to win against a juggernaut that has gone 76-20 this season and has homecourt advantage? He's the best player in this series and he'll have to play like it each and every game for his team to have a chance to win.\n\nBoston has five players in the top-seven, but Dallas boasts eight in the top-15. Will the stars matter more than the role players? Will a top-heavy team outdo one that's more balanced?

But after just a few moments of treatment in the locker room, Pierce reappeared, nailing a pair of 3-pointers. Boston would go on to win the game and the series in six games to secure their 17th and most recent championship, the most in league history.\n\nRumors persist as to what exactly happened to Pierce on that day -- a possibly apocryphal tale the Californian had a bowel movement seems to have been taken up by Pierce as a joke, but might also have been an admission.\n\nIt is also the birthday of former Celtic guard Marcus Thornton, born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana in 1987.\n\nThornton played his college ball at LSU and would play for the Miami Heat, Sacramento Kings, and Brooklyn Nets before being dealt by the Nets to Boston as part of a three-team trade.\n\nThornton would play 39 games for the Celtics, for whom he would average 8.9 points, 1.9 rebounds, and 0.9 assists.\n\nThe Louisianian would be traded by Boston to the Phoenix Suns as part of the package that brought point guard Isaiah Thomas, Gigi Datome, and Jonas Jerebko to the team.\n\nFinally, it is also the day that Boston big man Meyer \"Mike\" Bloom left us in 1993.\n\nAn alumnus of Temple, Bloom first joined the (now defunct) Baltimore Bullets before he was traded to the Celtics for Connie Simmons in 1948.\n\nWinslow Townson-USA TODAY Sports\n\nBloom played just 14 games to close out that season with Boston before he was on the move again, this time to the (then) Minneapolis (now, Los Angeles) Lakers when his contract was sold to the Celtics' longtime rivals.\n\nBloom averaged 9.2 points and an assist per game (rebounds had yet to be tabulated).

{"uri": "8164426729", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-06-06", "time": "10:05:27", "dateTime": "2024-06-06T10:05:27Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-06-06T10:03:55Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.572549045085907, "url": "https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sports/national/story/2024-06-06/jason-kidd-has-a-chance-to-join-a-very-small-club-in-these-nba-finals", "title": "Jason Kidd has a chance to join a very small club in these NBA Finals", "body": "Jason Kidd won an NBA championship as a Dallas player in 2011. He now has a chance to win one as a Dallas coach, which would put him in a very small club.\n\nThere are only 14 people in NBA history to win rings as both a player and a head coach. That group: Rick Carlisle, Larry Costello, Billy Cunningham, Tom Heinsohn, Red Holzman, Phil Jackson, Buddy Jeannette, K.C. Jones, Steve Kerr, Tyronn Lue, Pat Riley, Bill Russell, George Senesky and Bill Sharman.\n\nKidd can join a group within that group, too. Of those 14, there are seven to win titles as a player and a coach with the same team -- those being Cunningham (Philadelphia), Heinsohn, Jones and Russell (Boston), Jeannette (Baltimore), Riley (Los Angeles Lakers) and Senesky (Philadelphia Warriors).\n\nIf Boston wins these NBA Finals, an argument could be made that this was the most dominant team in Celtics history.\n\nBarring anything but a Dallas sweep, the 2023-24 Celtics will finish with either the second- or third-best winning percentage in team history. The 1985-86 Celtics were 82-18 (.820); the best this team can do is 80-20 (.800).\n\nBut where this team will almost certainly set itself apart in Celtics history is point differential. Again, barring something like Dallas winning four games in 30-point blowouts, Boston will finish with the highest differential over a total season in team history. These Celtics are outscoring teams by 11.2 points per game entering this series; the 1985-86 team outscored foes by 9.6 points per game.\n\nThe longer this series goes, the better the chance that Dallas' Luka Doncic will become the 11th player in NBA history to score 3,000 points in a season -- including playoffs.\n\nDoncic is entering these NBA Finals with 2,859 points this season, so he needs 141 for 3,000.\n\nIt would be the 24th such season in NBA history if he gets there. Michael Jordan had 10 such seasons, Wilt Chamberlain had five and eight other players -- Bob McAdoo, Elgin Baylor, James Harden, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Kevin Durant, Kobe Bryant, Rick Barry and Shaquille O'Neal -- each did it once.\n\nLeBron James, the league's career scoring leader, got as close as one can to joining the 3,000-point club without ever hitting the milestone. In 2017-18, James finished with exactly 2,999 points.\n\nThis season will see a sixth team win in the last six seasons, after Denver in 2023, Golden State in 2022, Milwaukee in 2021, the Los Angeles Lakers in 2020 and Toronto in 2018.\n\nIt's the second time in NBA history there has been a six-different-champions-in-six-years stretch. The Lakers won in 1980, preceded by Seattle in 1979, Washington in 1978, Portland in 1977, Boston in 1976 and Golden State in 1975.\n\nAt stake in this series: the NBA title, the Larry O'Brien Trophy, a pile of bejeweled rings and $4,856,937 in bonus money.\n\nThe NBA's playoff pool is a record $33,657,947 this season and gets distributed to each of the 16 playoff teams. The deeper in the playoffs you go, the more money you get, and there were some additional bonuses for the top regular-season records as well.\n\nBoston is already assured $7,202,498 from the pool, and the Celtics would see that figure rise to $12,059,435 if they win the NBA Finals.\n\nDallas has locked up no less than $5,899,422 in bonus money. The Mavericks would get a total of $10,756,359 if they win the title.\n\nThe bonus pool is typically split in some way among players and staff from the playoff teams.\n\nOnce again, a division champion will win the NBA title.\n\nBoston won the Atlantic Division by 14 games, Dallas won the Southwest Division by one game. And that means this will be the 12th time in the last 13 seasons that a division champion will be the one that hoists the Larry O'Brien Trophy.\n\nThe exception: Golden State in 2022, when the Warriors beat Boston. Before that, the last team to not win their division but win the NBA title was Dallas in 2011.\n\nNBA teams that have a lead going into the fourth quarter have prevailed 84.1% of the time this season. But Dallas has a knack for rallying.\n\nThe Mavericks, including playoffs, have a league-best 14 wins this season when trailing after three quarters. The Celtics, also including the playoffs, have a league-high 69 wins when leading after three.\n\nDallas is trying to do something that no team has done under the current playoff seeding format, which goes back 40 years.\n\nNo team seeded No. 5 in either conference has won the NBA title.\n\nOne lower-seeded team did; Houston was a No. 6 seed out of the West in 1995 when it won a title. But all the other teams that made the finals after earning a seed of only No. 5 or worse -- Miami in 2023, Miami in 2020 and New York in 1999 -- lost the title series.\n\nDallas has a chance at doing something that no team has since 2001 -- beat four teams with at least 50 wins on its way to the NBA championship.\n\nThe Mavericks have beaten a 51-win team in the Los Angeles Clippers, a 57-win team in Oklahoma City and a 56-win team in Minnesota -- starting each of those series on the road. Boston won 64 games in the regular season.\n\nIn 2001, it was the Los Angeles Lakers who, as the No. 2 seed in the West, beat 50-win Portland, 55-win Sacramento and 58-win San Antonio on its way to the NBA Finals -- where they downed 56-win Philadelphia.\n\nSan Antonio nearly did it in 2014, beating three teams with 50 wins on its way to the title. But in the first round, the Spurs' opponent had only 49 wins; that opponent was the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nThe 2002 Lakers also beat three 50-win teams and one 49-win team on their way to that season's championship.", "source": {"uri": "sandiegouniontribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San Diego Union-Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Senesky", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Senesky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_Jeannette", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Buddy Jeannette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Cunningham", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Billy Cunningham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Heinsohn", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Heinsohn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._C._Jones", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "K.

However, the constant outside noise, while not affecting Tatum directly, does impact those around the 26-year-old preparing for a winner-take-all showdown with the Mavericks.\n\n\"My mom took it a little tougher than maybe I did,\" Tatum said during Wednesday's Finals media day. \"But for me, I don't take it personal, right? Just a long break without NBA basketball, so they had to overanalyze every little thing, have something to talk about. Did it get old? Yeah. But, you know, it's the Finals. They wouldn't talk about me if I wasn't good, so... Try to take some positives out of it and change the channel.\"\n\nDuring Tatum's first trip to the Finals in 2022, the Celtics star dealt with a wrist injury that (clearly) impacted his performance. Last year, after Boston battled back from an 0-3 deficit against the Heat in the conference finals, Tatum suffered an ankle injury, directing the Celtics straight to playoff elimination in Game 7.\n\nThe memories of watching Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and the Warriors celebrate on a confetti-plastered TD Garden court two years ago still linger in Tatum's mind, even with a clean slate against Dallas.\n\n\"I hate that I had to go through it,\" Tatum explained. \"I wish we would have won. But I'm a firm believer in everything happens for a reason. There's a lesson to be learned in every situation.\"\n\nBut even with an optimistic perspective following a crushing defeat and a second chance at glory on the final stage, Tatum can't catch a break. The narratives surrounding Boston's 12-2 postseason run -- without Kristaps Porzingis for two full rounds -- haven't directed a focus toward everything the Celtics have done right. Instead, the discourse has surrounded Tatum's offensive shortcomings, highlighting the six-time All-Star's 29% shooting from 3-point territory this postseason and the facial expression following Jaylen Brown's conference MVP reception in Indiana.\n\nThe opportunity to pile on Tatum, whether it'd be from Boston benefitting from injuries throughout each of its first three playoff matchups leading into the Finals or the teammate bail-outs, has been capitalized on.\n\nBrown, a recipient of that exact treatment on multiple occasions throughout his eight-year career, can relate to everything Tatum's endured thus far.\n\n\"You get scrutinized enough for a large part of your career, it becomes normal,\" Brown said Wednesday. \"Then it just rolls off you. For me, at least, I can say. I don't know if Jayson feels the same way. It's kind of been that my whole career in a sense. Just being booed when you were drafted to saying you were overpaid, saying you were overpaid again. It's been that the whole journey for me.\"\n\nIf Tatum and Brown can push the Celtics across the finish line past the Mavericks, there won't be anything left to say -- until next season at least.", "source": {"uri": "nesn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NESN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gio_rivera@nesn.com", "name": "Gio Rivera", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klay_Thompson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Klay Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://nesn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/06/Jayson-Tatum-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

Al Horford, still going strong, has stepped up huge these last few series. It's definitely a worthy successor to all the other eras of Celtics basketball.\"\n\nInside the Garden, the basketball world descended upon Boston for NBA Finals Media Day.\n\nHordes of media from all over the world - China, Europe and South America - came out Wednesday to interact with players from both sides.\n\nCeltics center Kristaps Porzingis, who is set to return Thursday after missing the past 10 games, drew a massive crowd that spun from the baseline out past the 3-point line.\n\nWhile other stars - Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown and Jrue Holiday for the Celtics, and Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving for the Mavericks - talked with reporters inside a conference room, role players and reserves also got healthy recognition.\n\nEvery player highlighted the excitement they have for getting the opportunity to play the game they love on the highest stage. Some even got to drink tea and crack jokes with Guillermo Rodriguez, a sidekick for Jimmy Kimmel.\n\n\"I think we're just excited to get going,\" Celtics forward Sam Hauser said. \"I think, I don't know, it's been eight or nine days since we played our last game. Everybody is anxious to get back on the court, play in front of these fans. I know the Garden is going to be rocking tomorrow. We're excited.\"\n\nHorford added: \"I know our fans are even more excited. It's the Finals. They're going to be rowdy. They're going to get after it. 8:30 start. ... I can't wait to see them bring that energy.\"\n\nIrving, who some Boston media have dubbed as the one of the city's most hated sports villains, knows full well how rowdy the Garden gets for big games. The former Celtic was on the team when Boston lost in Game 7 in 2018 to his former team, the Cavaliers.\n\nHis advice to his younger teammates on handling the Garden atmosphere? \"What they're saying to you, you have to breathe, realize that is not as hostile as you think it is. Don't overthink it.\"\n\nMavericks center Dwight Powell, also a former Celtic, has been in Dallas since being traded from Boston in the 2014-15 season, well before Brown and Tatum were drafted.\n\nThe Celtics team is now entirely different, but Powell said he had \"dreamed of the future to come back here like this.\"\n\n\"It's a special place to play, especially an NBA Finals,\" he said. \"I know the energy is going to be insane. Their fan base is one of the best, for sure. They're going to support their team. We're going to feed off the energy.\"\n\nPatrick Lewis strolled over from his West End home to take in the scene on Causeway Street, watching a replay of an ESPN broadcast segment from inside the Garden while glancing at the same broadcasters who were stationed outside later in the afternoon.\n\nLewis reflected on his fandom for the Celtics over the years and on how pivotal trading Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce to Brooklyn for draft picks in 2013 turned out to be, with those picks later turning into Tatum and Brown.\n\nThe continued growth of the two superstars has Lewis feeling confident.\n\n\"I know there's a lot of pressure to do it this year just because that's how it is in New England - a lot of pressure to win championships in New England,\" he said. \"I think we've got

At the same time, I wouldn't be surprised if Luka and Dallas and Kyrie (Irving) and (head coach Jason Kidd) made this a series and won... This is going to be a phenomenal series.\"\n\nStanding in Boston's way is a confident Mavs team under far less pressure and uniquely equipped to ruin the Celtics' title aspirations.\n\nThat starts with Doncic, the 25-year-old Slovenian who is quickly becoming the face of the league.\n\nHe has been the best player in the playoffs and is the first to lead in points (489), rebounds (164) and assists (150) coming into a finals.\n\nBy his side is veteran point guard Irving who, after turbulent stints in Brooklyn and Boston, has looked more comfortable and confident on the court than he has in years.\n\n\"I think it's fair to say that offensively they are as talented as any backcourt in NBA history,\" Redick said of Doncic and Irving.\n\nOne big, 7-foot 2-inch question mark hanging over the series is the health of Boston's Kristaps Porzingis, the former Maverick who suffered a calf strain in the Heat series and has been sidelined since.\n\nThe Celtics are hopeful that their prized offseason acquisition, who averaged 20.1 points and 7.2 rebounds and 1.9 blocks during the regular season, will be healthy enough to match up against the Mavs' breakout big men Daniel Gafford and

The matchup offers plenty of offensive firepower, as each team's two stars finished top 20 in points per game this season.\n\nWith a new champion on the verge of being crowned, all eyes are on their performances. Given the star power and storylines of the matchup, the NBA Finals MVP odds market is set up to be one of the best betting markets of the series.\n\nBefore Game 1, we're taking a look at the NBA Finals MVP odds on BetMGM Sportsbook.\n\nHere are odds from BetMGM to earn MVP honors of the 2024 NBA Finals:\n\nAlso check: NBA Finals odds | Best sports betting promos | Top sports betting sites\n\nThe Celtics are the favorites to win the series. Since the 1984-85 season, only eight teams have won the NBA Finals after starting the season with odds of 10-1 or greater. The rest had preseason odds of 9-1 or better. This year, the Mavs' preseason odds were 25-1. If the preseason odds hold up, and the Celtics win the title, the best bet to win NBA Finals MVP could be Jaylen Brown.\n\nBrown is averaging 25 points, 6.1 rebounds, and 2.6 assists in 14 playoff games on 54% from the field and 36.8% from deep. He has done this while often drawing the toughest defensive matchup on the court. Surprisingly, he has been the best player on the court for the Celtics and earned the Larry Bird Trophy as MVP of the East Finals.\n\nIf the Celtics are to hold on and win their first title with Brown and Jayson Tatum, the better bet for Finals MVP would be Brown, based on his juicy odds and how he has played so far.\n\nAlthough underdogs, the Mavs are a very live threat to win it all. They have owned the best defensive rating in the league since the late-season trade that brought on PJ Washington and Daniel Gafford, both of whom have contributed significantly to their defensive shift. Combine their redefined defense with their electric offense, and it's no surprise they have made it to this point.\n\nWith both Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving on the court, the Mavs produced a 120.3 offensive rating and went 23-9 in clutch games. Doncic's play-making ability and scoring are key ingredients to the recipe.\n\nAgainst the Minnesota Timberwolves, the best overall defense in the league this year, Doncic averaged 32.4 points, 9.6 rebounds, and 8.2 assists per game. He did so shooting 47% from the field and 43% from deep.\n\nAdditionally, Doncic is averaging 32.6 points per game against the Celtics since 2021. If that level of production continues for him against Boston, he could very well lead them to an upset, earning him Finals MVP.\n\nTatum is the favorite to win the Finals MVP. His odds aren't the most attractive, especially when you consider his play so far in the postseason. He is averaging 26 points, 10 rebounds, and 5.9 assists per game in the playoffs, shooting 44.2% from the field and 29% from deep. He is drawing the opposing team's best defender on a nightly basis, and he isn't producing like fans have grown accustomed this season. Fortunately for him, his teammates have stepped up to get them to this point.\n\nHe'll see a hefty dose of PJ Washington and Derrick Jones Jr., who have been lights out in the postseason. Together, they held Anthony Edwards to a postseason low of 24.6 points per game on 43% from the field, and Paul George to 19.5 points per game on 41% from the field. The likelihood of multiple explosive performances from Tatum seems low given what they have been able to do to stars this postseason.\n\nAmong the stars taking the court in the Finals, Irving is the only player with a championship. He is the most experienced of the bunch and played a significant role in the Cavs' historic comeback from down 3-1 against the Warriors in 2016. In that series, he averaged 27 points on 46% from the field and 40% from deep. He also hit one of the biggest shots in playoffs history with a big dagger over Steph Curry to seal victory in Game 7.\n\nAdditionally, he leads the Mavs in clutch scoring in the playoffs, and the regular season. In a tight game when Doncic is sure to draw the most attention, Irving is set up well to stockpile big plays when they matter most, which are essential to winning Finals MVP. With odds as high as +1400, Irving is definitely worth consideration.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MGM_Resorts_International", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MGM Resorts International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_betting", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sports betting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Bird", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Larry Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_Jones_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derrick Jones Jr."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://library.sportingnews.com/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-06/Jaylen%20Brown%2C%20Kyrie%20Irving%20060424.jpeg?itok=TntOHmgZ", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 44, "textEnd": 50}], "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

He now has a chance to win one as a Dallas coach, which would put him in a very small club.\n\nThere are only 14 people in NBA history to win rings as both a player and a head coach. That group: Rick Carlisle, Larry Costello, Billy Cunningham, Tom Heinsohn, Red Holzman, Phil Jackson, Buddy Jeannette, K.C. Jones, Steve Kerr, Tyronn Lue, Pat Riley, Bill Russell, George Senesky and Bill Sharman.\n\nKidd can join a group within that group, too. Of those 14, there are seven to win titles as a player and a coach with the same team -- those being Cunningham (Philadelphia), Heinsohn, Jones and Russell (Boston), Jeannette (Baltimore), Riley (Los Angeles Lakers) and Senesky (Philadelphia Warriors).\n\nDOMINANT CELTICS\n\nIf Boston wins these NBA Finals, an argument could be made that this was the most dominant team in Celtics history.\n\nBarring anything but a Dallas sweep, the 2023-24 Celtics will finish with either the second- or third-best winning percentage in team history. The 1985-86 Celtics were 82-18 (.820); the best this team can do is 80-20 (.800).\n\nBut where this team will almost certainly set itself apart in Celtics history is point differential. Again, barring something like Dallas winning four games in 30-point blowouts, Boston will finish with the highest differential over a total season in team history. These Celtics are outscoring teams by 11.2 points per game entering this series; the 1985-86 team outscored foes by 9.6 points per game.\n\nLUKA 3K\n\nThe longer this series goes, the better the chance that Dallas' Luka Doncic will become the 11th player in NBA history to score 3,000 points in a season -- including playoffs.\n\nDoncic is entering these NBA Finals with 2,859 points this season, so he needs 141 for 3,000.\n\nIt would be the 24th such season in NBA history if he gets there. Michael Jordan had 10 such seasons, Wilt Chamberlain had five and eight other players -- Bob McAdoo, Elgin Baylor, James Harden, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Kevin Durant, Kobe Bryant, Rick Barry and Shaquille O'Neal -- each did it once.\n\nLeBron James, the league's career scoring leader, got as close as one can to joining the 3,000-point club without ever hitting the milestone. In 2017-18, James finished with exactly 2,999 points.\n\nSIX IN SIX\n\nThis season will see a sixth team win in the last six seasons, after Denver in 2023, Golden State in 2022, Milwaukee in 2021, the Los Angeles Lakers in 2020 and Toronto in 2018.\n\nIt's the second time in NBA history there has been a six-different-champions-in-six-years stretch. The Lakers won in 1980, preceded by Seattle in 1979, Washington in 1978, Portland in 1977, Boston in 1976 and Golden State in 1975.\n\nTHE MONEY\n\nAt stake in this series: the NBA title, the Larry O'Brien Trophy, a pile of bejeweled rings and $4,856,937 in bonus money.\n\nThe NBA's playoff pool is a record $33,657,947 this season and gets distributed to each of the 16 playoff teams. The deeper in the playoffs you go, the more money you get, and there were some additional bonuses for the top regular-season records as well.\n\nBoston is already assured $7,202,498 from the pool, and the Celtics would see that figure rise to $12,059,435 if they win the NBA Finals.\n\nDallas has locked up no less than $5,899,422 in bonus money. The Mavericks would get a total of $10,756,359 if they win the title.\n\nThe bonus pool is typically split in some way among players and staff from the playoff teams.\n\nDIVISION CHAMPS, NBA CHAMPS\n\nOnce again, a division champion will win the NBA title.\n\nBoston won the Atlantic Division by 14 games, Dallas won the Southwest Division by one game. And that means this will be the 12th time in the last 13 seasons that a division champion will be the one that hoists the Larry O'Brien Trophy.\n\nThe exception: Golden State in 2022, when the Warriors beat Boston. Before that, the last team to not win their division but win the NBA title was Dallas in 2011.\n\nSTICK AROUND\n\nNBA teams that have a lead going into the fourth quarter have prevailed 84.1% of the time this season. But Dallas has a knack for rallying.\n\nThe Mavericks, including playoffs, have a league-best 14 wins this season when trailing after three quarters. The Celtics, also including the playoffs, have a league-high 69 wins when leading after three.\n\n5 SEED CURSE\n\nDallas is trying to do something that no team has done under the current playoff seeding format, which goes back 40 years.\n\nNo team seeded No. 5 in either conference has won the NBA title.\n\nOne lower-seeded team did; Houston was a No. 6 seed out of the West in 1995 when it won a title. But all the other teams that made the finals after earning a seed of only No. 5 or worse -- Miami in 2023, Miami in 2020 and New York in 1999 -- lost the title series.\n\nFOUR WITH 50\n\nDallas has a chance at doing something that no team has since 2001 -- beat four teams with at least 50 wins on its way to the NBA championship.\n\nThe Mavericks have beaten a 51-win team in the Los Angeles Clippers, a 57-win team in Oklahoma City and a 56-win team in Minnesota -- starting each of those series on the road. Boston won 64 games in the regular season.\n\nIn 2001, it was the Los Angeles Lakers who, as the No. 2 seed in the West, beat 50-win Portland, 55-win Sacramento and 58-win San Antonio on its way to the NBA Finals -- where they downed 56-win Philadelphia.\n\nSan Antonio nearly did it in 2014, beating three teams with 50 wins on its way to the title. But in the first round, the Spurs' opponent had only 49 wins; that opponent was the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nThe 2002 Lakers also beat three 50-win teams and one 49-win team on their way to that season's championship.", "source": {"uri": "wnewsj.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Wilmington News Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Senesky", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Senesky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_Jeannette", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Buddy Jeannette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Cunningham", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Billy Cunningham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Heinsohn", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Heinsohn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._C._Jones", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "K.

Mavericks star Luka Doncic is listed second at +205 and is getting the most bets (15%) and second-most money (16%). He's also the favorite at Fanatics to lead all players in scoring, assists, and 3-pointers for the series.\n\nFanatics began MVP pricing with Tatum at -105 but he's moved to an even shorter -120. Still, he's received 33.2% of the tickets while Kyrie Irving at +2,000 is second at 27.3%.\n\nThe veteran guard playing in his fourth NBA Finals and first with the Mavs is the biggest Finals MVP liability for BetMGM at +1,800.\n\nJaylen Brown, Boston's other star, is priced between +600 and +650 at online sportsbooks, but he's only getting 17.5% of the money at Fanatics and 14% at DraftKings.\n\nAdditionally, Derrick White has gone from +5,000 to +3,500 at Fanatics after getting 9% of the bets in the MVP market.\n\nBettors don't prefer the Eastern Conference champion Celtics in the series, even though oddsmakers have them as a 6.5-point favorite in Thursday's Game 1.\n\n\"Although the Boston Celtics are the -250 chalk here for Game 1, you'd normally expect a fair majority to be taking them straight up,\" Wattleworth said. \"However, of all tickets, the current rate of play is slightly favoring Dallas, though the amount of handle is bigger on Boston, mainly due to larger singles and parlays overall.\"\n\nThe Mavericks are getting 74% of the bets and 65% of the handle to cover the spread in Game 1 at BetMGM.\n\nDallas' Dereck Lively over 1.5 assists is the most popular player prop at BetMGM.", "source": {"uri": "covers.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Covers.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki",

Boston nearly sleepwalked through the Eastern Conference as they got to face off against injury-riddled teams like the Miami Heat, Cleveland Cavaliers and Indiana pacers while Dallas had to fend off the L.A. Clippers, Oklahoma City Thunder and Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nThe Celtics enter the Finals as the odds-on favorites to win it all, though the Mavericks shouldn't be counted out as they've been a different team since acquiring P.J. Washington and Daniel Gafford at the trade deadline. As much depth and talent as Boston has on their roster, Dallas has the best player in the series in Luka Doncic and a clutch shotmaker and scorer in Kyrie Irving.\n\nAustin Reaves will surely be tuning into the Finals and in a true purple and gold fashion, chose the Mavericks to win the title this year.\n\n\"I gotta go Dallas just because I can't choose Boston,\" Reaves said.\n\nReaves is referring to the historic rivalry between the Celtics and Lakers, who have squared off numerous times in the past. Although Boston has the Finals head-to-head record, the two teams are tied for the most championships in the league with 17.\n\nA Finals win for the Celtics would give them more titles than the Lakers, a reality that any fan in Los Angeles is surely hoping to avoid. Reaves hasn't been with the Lakers for long, but seems to understand the importance of their decades-old rivalry with the Celtics.\n\nSimilar to the 2022 NBA Finals when Boston took on the Golden State Warriors, Los Angeles will be rooting for their nemesis to lose. Dallas has the requisite pieces to conjure up another upset and it should be an electric matchup between two of the best teams in the league.\n\nThroughout the playoffs, it's been made apparent that the best teams have one or two stars and adequate role players as starters and off the bench. The Lakers face an offseason where they can go in a number of directions regarding their roster, but the front office is reportedly leaning toward upgrading the supporting cast versus chasing a third star to pair with LeBron James and Anthony Davis.", "source": {"uri": "lakersnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lakers Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_peralta@lakersnation.com", "name": "Matt Peralta", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Gafford", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Gafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://s22928.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Austin-Reaves-Kyrie-Irving.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

Both the Lakers and Celtics have won 17 titles, the most of any team.\n\nThose title-winning series (and even some of the losses) have produced many memorable moments for the Celtics, but which ones stand alone as the best?\n\nHere are the 10-best NBA Finals moments in Celtics history so far.\n\nThe Celtics trailed the Lakers 88-87 with seven seconds left in Game 4 at the old Boston Garden. Facing a potential 3-1 series deficit, Celtics legend Sam Jones hit a game-winning shot from 20 feet out. The Celtics evened the series with a 89-88 win and eventually won the championship in Game 7 (see below).\n\nThe most memorable play of the game happened in the second quarter when Kevin Garnett got shoved to the floor by Lamar Odom and still made the shot, plus the foul, to boost Boston's lead to 20. The crowd and Boston's bench went wild, and from that point on there was nothing the Lakers could do to stop the Celtics' coronation. The Celtics won by 39 points to claim their first title since 1986 and 17th overall. After the game, Garnett gave his legendary \"Anything's possible!\" interview with ABC's Michelle Tafoya. It was the perfect ending to one of the most impressive Celtics seasons in team history.\n\nBird's championship-clinching performance against the Rockets in Game 6 is one of the best in playoff history. He posted a triple-double with 29 points, 12 assists and 11 rebounds. He also played phenomenal defense with three steals and several other great plays that don't show up in the box score. Bird had a massive impact on every single facet of the game. It was pure domination. A clinic of basketball fundamentals.\n\nThe most memorable moment came in the fourth quarter when Bird received a behind-the-back pass from Bill Walton under the basket. Instead of trying to score at the rim as the shot clock wound down, Bird dribbled out to the 3-point line, drilled a shot from beyond the arc, and raised his fist in the air in celebration. It was a fitting way for the league's greatest team of all time to finish a remarkable season.\n\nThe Celtics won the first ever Larry Bird vs. Magic Johnson playoff matchup with a dramatic Game 7 victory at the old Boston Garden. Bird's dunk on a fast break is one of the most memorable plays of the series (watch a replay here) and increased the Celtics' first-half lead. The Lakers made a run in the second half, but Bird and the Celtics finished the job to clinch the franchise's 15th championship.\n\nJust twice has a Game 7 of the NBA Finals gone to overtime, and the Celtics have won both of them. The Celtics beat the St. Louis Hawks in double-overtime in 1957 for their first championship, and they beat the Lakers in overtime in 1962 for their fifth title (fourth in a row). Bill Russell dominated in this Game 7 with 30 points and 40 rebounds to complete one of the greatest performances in playoff history.\n\nThe Celtics won the first two games of the 2008 Finals at home, but lost Game 3 in Los Angeles. They were headed for another defeat when the Lakers went up by 24 points in the second quarter of Game 4. A tremendous second-half run, during which so many players -- Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett, Ray Allen, James Posey, P.J. Brown, Leon Powe, etc. -- made clutch plays, helped the Celtics take their first lead at 84-83 with 4:07 remaining in the fourth quarter. The C's won 97-91 to take a commanding 3-1 series advantage.\n\nBoston's 24-point comeback is the largest in an NBA Finals game since 1971.\n\nBefore the game, the Lakers made it known how they were going to celebrate winning the title, including the songs that would be played by the USC band, balloons falling from the rafters and the order of postgame interviews. Russell got the script and read it to the players in the locker room and told them the Lakers absolutely could not beat them.\n\nThe Celtics held off the heavily favored Lakers with the help of a memorable shot from Don Nelson in the fourth quarter. Nelson's shot hit the back of the rim, sending the ball high in the air and down through the net for a crucial two points. This shot gave the C's a 105-102 lead with just over a minute remaining. The C's ultimately prevailed 108-106 as Russell retired with 11 championships in 13 years.\n\nThis is one of the greatest games ever played, filled with many memorable moments. John Havlicek's 15-foot bank shot put the Celtics ahead 111-110 with one second left in the second overtime. The Suns didn't have a timeout, but they called one anyway, giving the C's a technical free throw but also allowing them to advance the ball. With one second left on the clock, Gar Heard hit an amazing turnaround shot to force a third overtime, where the Celtics prevailed 128-126 to take a 3-2 series lead. Glenn McDonald came off the bench in the third OT and scored six points, cementing his place as a C's playoff hero. The Celtics won the championship in Game 6 in Phoenix a few days later.\n\nThe Celtics were trailing 113-111 with less than 30 seconds left in Game 2 of the Finals against the rival Lakers. Facing a possible 0-2 series hole, Gerald Henderson stepped up with one of the greatest steals in playoff history. He intercepted a pass by James Worthy and made a layup to tie the game and force OT. The Celtics won in overtime to even the series.\n\nLarry Bird's first Finals game became a memorable one when he made a brilliant play to follow his own shot, jump for the rebound and score from a very difficult angle along the baseline. Bird knew right away that the shot wasn't going in, so he went to where he thought the rebound would go.\n\n\"That is the greatest play I've ever seen. Larry Bird is a player of destiny,\" Celtics legend Red Auerbach once said of the play, per NBA.com.\n\nThe Celtics won the series opener and eventually eliminated the Houston Rockets in six games for Bird's first career title.", "source": {"uri": "nbcsportsboston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports Boston"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Bird", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Larry Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Garnett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Garnett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Jones_(basketball,_born_1933)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Jones (basketball, born 1933)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Russell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bill Russell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamar_Odom", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lamar Odom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Walton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bill Walton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Hawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Hawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shot_clock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shot clock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Magic Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_break", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fast break"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slam_dunk", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slam dunk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clutch_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clutch (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gar_Heard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gar Heard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Henderson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gerald Henderson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Posey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Posey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Worthy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Worthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Trojans_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USC Trojans men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Powe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leon Powe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._J._Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "P.

The Celtics have been off since Memorial Day following their sweep of the Indiana Pacers.\n\nProbably the biggest story line on the court is Mavericks guard Kyrie Irving's return to Boston five years after he left in 2019 to join the Brooklyn Nets. Celtics fans really seem to hate Irving, and they certainly haven't forgotten him stomping on the team's logo in 2021 or flipping the middle finger at the crowd in 2022. One fan went so far as to chuck a water bottle at his head.\n\nSpeaking to reporters this week, Irving said his past actions weren't \"a great reflection\" of the athlete he is today, which has prepared him for what will be a loud and contentious TD Garden.\n\n\"It's going to be a hectic environment, but I'm looking forward to it and I see it as a healthy relationship that I have with the fans,\" Irving told reporters. \"I almost think about 'Gladiator,' just winning the crowd over. It is good to hear the TD Garden silent when you're playing well. They still respect great basketball.\"\n\nThere's also Irving's teammate, Luka Don\u010di\u0107, the five-time All-Star who his heading into his first NBA Finals leading the postseason in points (489), rebounds (164), and assists (150). He's the first player to lead in all three categories heading into the NBA Finals in league history, according to ESPN.\n\n\"Luka seems to solve every riddle thrown in his direction,\" ESPN announcer Doris Burke said during a conference call this week.\n\nThe Celtics enter the NBA finals with 17 championships, tied for the most in league history with the Los Angeles Lakers. Their last title came in 2008, so Jayson Tatum and company could end a 16-year drought while also pushing Beantown one championship ahead of their historic rivals. It would also mean rings for Tatum and Jaylen Brown, who have been flirting with championships for the past six seasons but have been unable to get over the hump.\n\nHere's everything you need to know to watch or stream this year's NBA Finals:\n\n\" READ MORE: The Mavericks have accomplished what the Sixers are setting out to do this offseason\n\nHandling play-by-play for ESPN is Mike Breen, who will be calling his 19th straight NBA Finals, more than any other announcer. Joining him in the booth will be analysts Doris Burke and former Sixers shooter JJ Redick, who is calling the NBA Finals for the first time.\n\nIt could also be his last. Redick, who joined ESPN in 2021, is reportedly at the top of the list to fill the Los Angeles Lakers' vacant head coaching job, where he'd join his podcast partner, LeBron James. The Athletic's Shams Charania reported the Lakers are \"zeroing in\" on Redick, who didn't exactly deny anything on Wednesday.\n\n\"My focus right now is on calling the NBA Finals,\" Redick told Gojo and Golic father-son duo Mike Golic and Mike Golic Jr. \"In terms of Shams, that will be addressed once the season is over. I'll just say that.\"\n\nBurke, who will be calling the NBA Finals for the first time on TV, will also become the first women to serve as a TV game analyst during a men's professional championship event. She does have experience calling the NBA Finals, which she's done for the past four years on ESPN Radio. Burke also served as the NBA Finals sideline reporter for nine years.\n\nJoining the trio will be King of Prussia native Lisa Salters, who will handle sideline reporting duties during the NBA Finals for the third straight year.\n\nBreen called 15 NBA Finals alongside Mark Jackson and Stan Van Gundy, both of whom were victims of companywide cutbacks by parent company Disney. ESPN hired former Sixers head coach Doc Rivers to call the Finals alongside Breen and Burke, but he left the network in January to become the head coach of the Milwaukee Bucks. Breen jokingly thanked Rivers for his \"many weeks of service.\"\n\nThe Mavericks and Celtics best-of-seven NBA Finals series begins tonight at TD Bank in downtown Boston.\n\nIt's the final series before the NBA announces new TV rights deals that will keep the Finals on ABC and ESPN, according to sources. While TNT would still air games during the 2024-25 season, the network is expected to be replaced by both NBC and Amazon beginning with the 2025-26 season.\n\nNikola Joki\u0107 and the Denver Nuggets defeated the Miami Heat in five games to earn the first NBA Finals' win in franchise history.\n\nThis season, both teams sputtered. Joki\u0107 and the Nuggets were eliminated in the second round of the playoffs by the Minnesota Timberwolves, while the Heat didn't make it past the play-in after Jimmy Butler sprained his knee against the Sixers.\n\nThe last Sixers team that advanced all the way to the NBA Finals was the Allen Iverson-led squad way back in 2001. The Sixers won Game 1 of that series, but were ultimately defeated by Kobe Bryant and the Lakers in five games.\n\nIn recent years, the Sixers haven't been able to get out of the second round, even after landing Joel Embiid with No. 3 pick in the 2014 NBA Draft. This year, they snuck into the playoffs thanks to their play-in game win against the Miami Heat and were ultimately eliminated in the first round by the New York Knicks and former Villanova star Jalen Brunson.\n\nAll told, the Sixers have been to the NBA Finals six times, winning three NBA championships in 1983, 1967, and 1955 (though that last one came when they were still the Syracuse Nationals before relocating the Philadelphia).", "source": {"uri": "inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Philadelphia Inquirer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rob_tornoe@inquirer.com", "name": "Rob Tornoe",

At the same time, I wouldn't be surprised if Luka (Doncic) and Kyrie (Irving) and (Dallas head coach Jason Kidd) win... This is going to be a phenomenal series.\"\n\nTatum is raring to go but taking nothing for granted.\n\n\"I hate that we had to go through it. I wish we would have won,\" he said, referring to their 2022 defeat.\n\n\"But I'm a firm believer that everything happens for a reason. There's a lesson to be learnt in every situation. Last year we didn't (even) make it to the Finals. Put things in perspective.\n\n\"You could see our excitement when we won the Conference (this year). I do feel a lot different this time. I'm excited for the opportunity for us to get the job done.\"\n\nBrown said he has watched the 2022 Finals several times to learn how to better manage his emotions and to make better decisions on the court.\n\n\"You learn and grow from your experiences, two years later makes a pretty big difference,\" he said.\n\n\"We've been able to go through experiences, having success but not having success at the same time.

You Want Boston?\" - Tom Brady Narrates Epic Celtics NBA Finals Hype Video That Dunks On Opposing Fans", "body": "As somebody who brought six Super Bowls to the greater Massachusetts area, Tom Brady knows a thing or two about what a championship team looks like. You can say that the Boston Celtics had one of the most ridiculous cakewalks to an NBA Finals berth in the history of basketball. It's not a dissimilar argument to how Brady's New England Patriots benefited for years from an awful AFC East and were virtually guaranteed to host a playoff game, since they could basically sleepwalk to something like a 5-1 divisional record.\n\nThe same counterpoint could be made in both those instances, though: The C's and Pats aren't going to apologize for who they were scheduled to play against. Nor should they. To circle back to what was stated in the lede, if Brady is confident enough to back this Boston team -- whose nucleus hasn't technically won anything of consequence -- I'd be very scared as a Dallas Mavericks fan right now.\n\nBrady's silky voiceover work in this NBA Finals hype video released by the Celtics shows the folly of every opponent's fan base chanting, \"WE WANT BOSTON!\" only to be annihilated by them in the postseason.\n\nIt eludes me as to why fans kept wanting the smoke from a Celtics squad who, regular-season frequent lack of competitive intensity aside, still managed to lap the rest of the NBA with a 64-18 record and +11.4 point differential. That's consistent dominance on a staggering scale.\n\nMeanwhile, the Mavs had to sweat out a highly competitive playoff race out West, and were only one game away in the standings from facing the Minnesota Timberwolves in the first round. Would Dallas have topped their Western Conference Finals opponent if they squared off in Round 1? It's really hard to say. I feel like the Mavs didn't really find their stride until the Conference Finals. They lost Game 1s to the Clippers and the Thunder. Needed six games to close out the Clips, and they were one point away from a Game 7 back in OKC.\n\nCredit Luka Doncic, Kyrie Irving and Dallas' evidently underrated supporting cast for their collective resilience to bounce back from multiple series-opening defeats to get to this stage. I don't want to take away from what they've accomplished. At the same time, they were way out of the West's three-way race for the No. 1 seed between the Thunder, Wolves, and Nuggets. Boston ran away with the East crown -- a full 14 games ahead of the Knicks.\n\nTip of the hat to my old colleague Greenie at Barstool for this documentation of Phil Jackson's 40-20 rule, which states that an NBA championship team must win 40 games before they lose 20 in any given season to have a real chance at a title. History has proven that to be true, with literally only four full exceptions since 1980.\n\nThe Mavs lost their 20th game with only 24 wins in the books; the Celtics obviously didn't reach the 20-loss threshold. Brady is a student of the game in any given sport. He's certainly well aware of Boston sports lore. I'd say there's a 95% chance he knows of this 40-20 rule since, you know, Phil Jackson won eleven NBA championships as a coach and two as a player. The Zen Master's Lakers even topped the Celtics to win his last Larry O'Brien Trophy in 2010.\n\nIf you're Dallas, with that much of a track record and Tom Brady are stacked against you, you might be in trouble.

Mandatory Credit: Peter Casey-USA TODAY Sports / Peter Casey-USA TODAY Sports\n\nAt last, we have finally made it to the NBA Finals. This season of the NBA Playoffs has been an interesting ride, to say the least. During this time, tempers tend to flare up as each game matters. Every game is critical to every player and every team. We've seen it with the Minnesota Timberwolves and Rudy Gobert. He was getting in everyone's face. His feelings were probably hurt as his team failed to make it to the finals unlike former Wizard Daniel Gafford and his new team, the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nThere was even shots taken at a man's pride when the Indiana Pacers got swept against the Boston Celtics. They were without All-Star Point Guard Tyrese Haliburton for half of the series. Without him, Aaron Nesmith had some strong words of encouragement after their season ended. He went on to say: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think we all learned that we belong here,\u00e2\u20ac Nesmith said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think we had a great season. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a great team. We know we can play at this level and we know there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stuff we can learn and get better at. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll do that this summer and I think we all expect to make another deep run next year.\u00e2\u20ac His feelings and pride were hurt as his team loss to the Boston Celtics without their star big man Kristaps Porzingis.\n\nThe former Wizard Kristaps Porzingis has missed 10 of 14 playoff games for the Boston Celtics this postseason. The Celtics have obviously been successful without him thus far as they are preparing for the Dallas Mavericks in the NBA Finals. Porzingis will be available for game 1 however it remains to be seen how many minutes he is expected to play. He will be a critical factor for the Celtics as he stretches the floor well for them and provides a halfcourt offense down low too. It feels as if he may have gotten a free ride to the NBA Finals. However, it will be put up or shut up time as he faces his former team in the NBA Finals.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gobert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Nesmith", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Nesmith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Gafford", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Gafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4643,h_2611,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/inside_the_wizards/01hznf2f6qyntb3hrz0t.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

He now has a chance to win one as a Dallas coach, which would put him in a very small club.\n\nThere are only 14 people in NBA history to win rings as both a player and a head coach. That group: Rick Carlisle, Larry Costello, Billy Cunningham, Tom Heinsohn, Red Holzman, Phil Jackson, Buddy Jeannette, K.C. Jones, Steve Kerr, Tyronn Lue, Pat Riley, Bill Russell, George Senesky and Bill Sharman.\n\nKidd can join a group within that group, too. Of those 14, there are seven to win titles as a player and a coach with the same team -- those being Cunningham (Philadelphia), Heinsohn, Jones and Russell (Boston), Jeannette (Baltimore), Riley (Los Angeles Lakers) and Senesky (Philadelphia Warriors).\n\nDOMINANT CELTICS\n\nIf Boston wins these NBA Finals, an argument could be made that this was the most dominant team in Celtics history.\n\nBarring anything but a Dallas sweep, the 2023-24 Celtics will finish with either the second- or third-best winning percentage in team history. The 1985-86 Celtics were 82-18 (.820); the best this team can do is 80-20 (.800).\n\nBut where this team will almost certainly set itself apart in Celtics history is point differential. Again, barring something like Dallas winning four games in 30-point blowouts, Boston will finish with the highest differential over a total season in team history. These Celtics are outscoring teams by 11.2 points per game entering this series; the 1985-86 team outscored foes by 9.6 points per game.\n\nLUKA 3K\n\nThe longer this series goes, the better the chance that Dallas' Luka Doncic will become the 11th player in NBA history to score 3,000 points in a season -- including playoffs.\n\nDoncic is entering these NBA Finals with 2,859 points this season, so he needs 141 for 3,000.\n\nIt would be the 24th such season in NBA history if he gets there. Michael Jordan had 10 such seasons, Wilt Chamberlain had five and eight other players -- Bob McAdoo, Elgin Baylor, James Harden, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Kevin Durant, Kobe Bryant, Rick Barry and Shaquille O'Neal -- each did it once.\n\nLeBron James, the league's career scoring leader, got as close as one can to joining the 3,000-point club without ever hitting the milestone. In 2017-18, James finished with exactly 2,999 points.\n\nIt's the second time in NBA history there has been a six-different-champions-in-six-years stretch. The Lakers won in 1980, preceded by Seattle in 1979, Washington in 1978, Portland in 1977, Boston in 1976 and Golden State in 1975.\n\nTHE MONEY\n\nAt stake in this series: the NBA title, the Larry O'Brien Trophy, a pile of bejeweled rings and $4,856,937 in bonus money.\n\nThe NBA's playoff pool is a record $33,657,947 this season and gets distributed to each of the 16 playoff teams. The deeper in the playoffs you go, the more money you get, and there were some additional bonuses for the top regular-season records as well.\n\nBoston is already assured $7,202,498 from the pool, and the Celtics would see that figure rise to $12,059,435 if they win the NBA Finals.\n\nDallas has locked up no less than $5,899,422 in bonus money. The Mavericks would get a total of $10,756,359 if they win the title.\n\nThe bonus pool is typically split in some way among players and staff from the playoff teams.\n\nDIVISION CHAMPS, NBA CHAMPS\n\nOnce again, a division champion will win the NBA title.\n\nBoston won the Atlantic Division by 14 games, Dallas won the Southwest Division by one game. And that means this will be the 12th time in the last 13 seasons that a division champion will be the one that hoists the Larry O'Brien Trophy.\n\nThe exception: Golden State in 2022, when the Warriors beat Boston. Before that, the last team to not win their division but win the NBA title was Dallas in 2011.\n\nSTICK AROUND\n\nNBA teams that have a lead going into the fourth quarter have prevailed 84.1% of the time this season. But Dallas has a knack for rallying.\n\nThe Mavericks, including playoffs, have a league-best 14 wins this season when trailing after three quarters. The Celtics, also including the playoffs, have a league-high 69 wins when leading after three.\n\n5 SEED CURSE\n\nDallas is trying to do something that no team has done under the current playoff seeding format, which goes back 40 years.\n\nNo team seeded No. 5 in either conference has won the NBA title.\n\nOne lower-seeded team did; Houston was a No. 6 seed out of the West in 1995 when it won a title. But all the other teams that made the finals after earning a seed of only No. 5 or worse -- Miami in 2023, Miami in 2020 and New York in 1999 -- lost the title series.\n\nFOUR WITH 50\n\nDallas has a chance at doing something that no team has since 2001 -- beat four teams with at least 50 wins on its way to the NBA championship.\n\nSan Antonio nearly did it in 2014, beating three teams with 50 wins on its way to the title. But in the first round, the Spurs' opponent had only 49 wins; that opponent was the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nThe 2002 Lakers also beat three 50-win teams and one 49-win team on their way to that season's championship.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Senesky", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Senesky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_Jeannette", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Buddy Jeannette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Cunningham", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Billy Cunningham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Heinsohn", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Heinsohn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._C._Jones", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "K.

A Boston return was long assumed, even after it melted under a maelstrom of Miami Heat 3s in last season's Eastern Conference finals. But flash back to the spring of 2021, and everything seemed so precarious for a franchise that envisioned a near-decade run of contention around Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown.\n\nThose 2020-21 Celtics finished .500 and whimpered out of the first round, overwhelmed by the East's new superteam -- the Brooklyn Nets of James Harden, Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving. Many within the Celtics still whisper about that series -- the sense of helplessness, the fear the East had passed them by.\n\nThe roster around Brown and Tatum was a mess. Kemba Walker's body betrayed him. Young players were not ready. Free agent signings and trades busted. Illnesses and injuries, including Brown's season-ending wrist injury, did the rest.\n\nIn a two-year whir, Boston reconstructed everything around its two stars -- swapping Walker for Al Horford, then striking deals for Derrick White, Jrue Holiday and Kristaps Porzingis. The Celtics rectified mistakes and were aggressive trading assets for talent.\n\nThe Mavs went through an even more accelerated remake after their 2022 Western Conference finals run. The only holdovers are Doncic, Maxi Kleber, Josh Green and Dwight Powell. The Mavs assumed more future risk than Boston in undoing past errors -- including the seismic blunder of letting Jalen Brunson escape -- but no one is much worried about that now after watching the Mavs confound three of the West's top-four seeds.\n\nZoom further out and you gain even more appreciation for all the variables that could have torpedoed this matchup -- of how that history underlines the massive stakes now.\n\nBoston had so many chances to speed up the Tatum/Brown era by trading one of them -- or the picks it ended up using to select both -- for restless superstars: Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis.\n\nThe Celtics used their final Nets pick to acquire Kyrie Irving in 2017, pairing him with Gordon Hayward as splashy offseason acquisitions. Internally, Boston envisioned Irving as the lure to convince Davis to push his way to Boston -- a trade that almost surely would have cost the Celtics either Tatum or Brown.\n\nThat plan teetered five minutes into Hayward's Celtics debut, when he shattered his leg. It was a basketball tragedy; Hayward was never the same. It is also a massive sliding-doors moment. If Hayward stays healthy, do Brown and Tatum develop as fast?

Prior to this year, 31 of the past 33 NBA champions had a current or former MVP on the roster.\n\nSince the MVP award was first given out, 65 of the 67 NBA Finals featured a player who had won it. The two outliers: 1977, which had ABA MVP Julius Erving, and 1990, which had the previous year's Finals MVP Joe Dumars.\n\nMore from Sportico.com\n\nBy that criterion, the 2024 NBA Finals between the Boston Celtics and Dallas Mavericks will be the first in league history without a \"proven\" superstar. Jayson Tatum has only finished as high as fourth in MVP voting, while Luka Doncic received the third-most votes this season.\n\nIf we include off-court indicators of stardom into the analysis, then this year's title series isn't unique, but it's still far from the norm. The highest-paid player in the Finals is Doncic, whose $52 million in earnings this season from both salary and endorsements lands him at No. 14 on the list. The 2023 NBA Finals also didn't feature anyone in the top 10, since Nikola Jokic's sponsorship deals don't quite stack up to what you'd expect from a three-time MVP. But you have to go all the way back to 2005 to find another Finals with no representation among the league's 10 highest-paid players.\n\nUsing Instagram followers as a proxy for fame, this series does have a household name in Kyrie Irving, one of only four NBA players with at least 20 million followers on the platform, as well as Doncic, who ranks 15th. But the Celtics' personalities have yet to catch on with the masses, as Tatum (No. 19), Jaylen Brown (No. 30) and Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is (No. 45) trail guys like LeBron James and Stephen Curry by an order of magnitude.\n\nFor better or for worse, this is not exactly a star-studded NBA Finals, and that's been in keeping with the playoffs in general. James lost in the first round, Kevin Durant was swept, Curry missed the postseason entirely, Kawhi Leonard suited up for two games, and Giannis Antetokounmpo was sidelined with an injury.\n\nTV ratings indicate that fans miss their beloved 2010s figures -- through the first three rounds, viewership is down 14% year-over-year. It's worth noting, however, that overall TV usage was down 7% during that time span. Throw in the fact that 2023 audiences were treated to a 50-point Game 7 from Steph in the first round in addition to a second round LeBron vs. Curry showdown, and the viewership decline doesn't seem too bad after all. The 4.35 million viewers the networks have averaged per playoff game this year are just 4% short of 2022's 4.53 million average despite an overall TV usage drop of 17%.\n\nThe first three consecutive Cavs vs. Warriors Finals series were the three most-watched of the post-Jordan era of the NBA, but the league was never going to be able to ride that high forever, nor does it need to. While ABC likely cares about the bottom line numbers, the additional casuals who tune in only when one of the most famous people on the planet is involved aren't the folks the NBA needs to court.\n\nLuka has averaged 31.1 points per game in his postseason career, second all-time behind only Michael Jordan. Fans may not have realized it yet, but they are likely witnessing the early stages of a historically great career.\n\nA Mavs win could catapult Don\u010di\u0107 to a new level of fame similar to Antetokounmpo's rise after winning the 2021 Finals MVP. The Greek Freak is now the leader in endorsement earnings among all NBA players aged 35 or under, with a $45 million haul last year. By comparison, Don\u010di\u0107 brought in $12 million off the court in 2023, showing how much room he has to grow his brand.\n\nThis championship series features a record 13 international players, surpassing the 2013 Finals which had 10. A third non-American Finals MVP in the span of three years would further the league's goal of expanding its global reach heading into the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris.\n\nIf the Celtics win relatively easily, they will be crowned as one of the best teams of all-time after going 64-18 in the regular season with the fourth-best point differential ever. In a weak Eastern Conference, they should be back in the years to come.\n\nNo MVPs? No problem. Don\u010di\u0107 is one of the most skilled offensive players in the history of the sport, and the 2024 Celtics had the most efficient offense of all-time. Anyone who isn't excited about this matchup isn't much of a basketball fan, anyway.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Celtics' versatile lineup offers no exploitable weaknesses, while Mavericks rely on star duo Don\u010di\u0107 and Irving with strong role players. The battle between Boston's talent advantage and Dallas' clutch performance will determine the NBA champion.\n\nThe age-old NBA question of how to properly build a championship squad will never be fully answered, and is changing every single year in the modern league. Franchises have built lasting contenders and title teams through many different formulas, each as valid as the next, while some models have proven not to work.\n\nWhat we do know is that there are several different ways to build a team that can result in winning at the highest level, albeit unclear which is the best method. The Dallas Mavericks-Boston Celtics NBA Finals matchup pits two teams against each other who have put their rosters together with a completely opposite blueprint.\n\nBoth squads have been very effective with their style of team, and this NBA Finals may shed some light on which model is superior.\n\nBoston Built a Lineup Based On Versatility Every player on the Celtics can fill any role on the floor\n\nThe Celtics have been one of the league's most dominant teams of all-time through 82 regular season games and three rounds of the playoffs behind an elite grouping of six extremely versatile players. Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Derrick White, Jrue Holiday, Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is, and Al Horford are all guys with few weaknesses in their games, allowing each player to fill whichever responsibility Boston needs on a given night.\n\nBoston Celtics Versatility\n\nPlayer\n\nPPG\n\n3P%\n\nCareer 3P%\n\n2P%\n\nTatum\n\n26.9\n\n37.5%\n\n37.5%\n\n54.2%\n\nBrown\n\n23.0\n\n35.4%\n\n36.4%\n\n57.0%\n\nPorzi\u0146\u0123is\n\n20.1\n\n37.5%\n\n36.1%\n\n60.6%\n\nWhite\n\n15.2\n\n39.6%\n\n36.3%\n\n55.5%\n\nHoliday\n\n12.5\n\n42.9%\n\n37.1%\n\n52.6%\n\nHorford\n\n8.6\n\n41.9%\n\n37.9%\n\n65.8%\n\nNot only can every player in the lineup take on any role, they eliminate the opposing team's advantages by offering little to no attack points on either side of the ball. For example, most teams enter a playoff series looking to exploit the opponent's worst defender in switches, while finding the weakest offensive player to help off of.\n\nWith Boston, you simply cannot find these openings. Each of the six main guys in their lineup can defend extremely well for their position both on the perimeter and in the paint. Furthermore, all the Celtics' starters can defend competently in isolation, screening actions, in the post, or at the rim, limiting the type of plays opponents can run to gain an advantage. Only Horford is exploitable in some situations at his old age, and even the 38-year-old still has some juice left.\n\nOffensively, there isn't a single guy a defense can scheme for by leaving open to offer extra help on Boston's terrific group of scorers. Every player that gets major minutes is an All-Star level scorer that can shoot, dribble, and pass, giving no one for an opponent to help off of or give their weaker defender some relief.\n\nJust as on defense, all six of Boston's most important players can attack off-the-dribble, in the post, at the rim, and are able to shoot from anywhere on the floor. They force teams to pick between guarding one-on-one across the board with no rim presence, or leaving open an elite three-point shooter.\n\nThe Celtics have built a team that has a bunch of guys who can do anything the situation dictates, making them extremely difficult to game plan for.\n\nDallas Runs Through Two Main Superstars Don\u010di\u0107, Irving run the show while role players fill specific responsibilities\n\nThe flipside of the Celtics' versatility-based formula is the two (or three) star model where a superstar duo handles all the offensive creation responsibilities while the rest of the players take on certain roles needed to fill in the gaps.\n\nWe've seen this work in recent memory, with LeBron James teaming with Kyrie Irving himself to carry the Cleveland Cavaliers to a championship solely on their offensive production while elite role players did the rest. Even an All-Star forward in Kevin Love was reduced to a spot-up shooter who protects the rim and controls the glass.\n\nDallas is using this blueprint to near perfection after an off-season where they filled in the gaps of a weak roster around Luka Don\u010di\u0107 and Irving with several sneaky underrated moves. They knew they had all the scoring they would ever need, and had to address their deficiencies on the glass, defensively, and with finishing chances created by the duo.\n\nThe Mavericks added several high-level athletes who could help in all three areas of need. Derrick Jones Jr., PJ Washington, Daniel Gafford, and Dereck Lively have all contributed on both sides of the ball in their own way.\n\nJones Jr. is an incredible on-ball defender and dunker, and has improved as a catch-and-shoot player, and Lively is a versatile defender as well as a lob threat. Gafford is a good rebounder, finisher, and rim defender, and Washington has brought a tertiarty scoring option to go with great perimeter defense.\n\nDallas now has an eight-man rotation that can compete in any style of playoff basketball, and is the best clutch team in the league due to the wizardry of Irving and Don\u010di\u0107. It's a tough formula to beat.\n\nDallas Mavericks Clutch Dominance\n\nCategory\n\nStat\n\nNBA Rank\n\nRecord\n\n23-9\n\n2nd\n\nWin %\n\n71.9%\n\n2nd\n\nNRTG\n\n+2.4\n\n2nd\n\nFG%\n\n47.5%\n\n5th\n\nPlayoff W-L\n\n6-3\n\n3rd\n\nWho Will Triumph In The Battle Of Contrasting Styles? Each team has their own specific advantages\n\nBoth teams have been incredible this postseason, making it difficult to pick a winner of this highly-anticipated NBA Finals. The outcome may just come down to whichever team's players step up and perform up to their standard, but there are definite advantages for both squads. Whichever side is able to capitalize on theirs will likely be the NBA Champion.\n\nOn Boston's side, they have the clear talent advantage down the roster: their eight-man rotation is significantly \"better\" than the Mavericks' eight-man grouping. They have five All-Star level players, while Dallas only has two. The Celtics also offer no exploitable matchups for the Mavericks to take advantage of, leaving Dallas at a strategic disadvantage on both sides of the floor.\n\nFor the Mavericks, their edge revolves around their two best players and all the benefits from the duo. Playoff series often come down to whose top guys deliver more consistently, and Don\u010di\u0107 and Irving should be counted on to be great every night. However, Tatum and Brown shouldn't be overlooked as a pairing for their ability to take over the series.\n\nDallas also has a huge edge in clutch performance, which is massively important in what should be a closely-contested NBA Finals (Although Brown and Tatum have been great in the clutch in these playoffs).\n\nStar Duo Comparison (Playoffs)\n\nPlayer\n\nPPG\n\n% of Team PPG\n\nClutch PPG\n\n% of Team Clutch PPG\n\nDon\u010di\u0107/Irving\n\n51.6\n\n47.8%\n\n5.3\n\n49.5%\n\nTatum/Brown\n\n51.0\n\n45.7%\n\n6.5\n\n48.8%\n\nIt will be interesting to see which formula wins out: the star-driven team with a well-built supporting cast, or the versatile squad with no weaknesses.\n\nRelated Everything You Need to Know About the 2024 NBA Finals: Key Storylines, Schedule, Betting Odds Can Boston capture an 18th title?

We kind of took it for granted at certain moments.\"\n\nAnd now?\n\n\"I'm not thinking about what it would mean for my legacy or anything like that,\" he said. \"Just excited to play some basketball ... and go out there and try to get the job done.\"\n\nLuka Doncic and Kyrie Irving of Dallas see it as their first opportunity to make good on a partnership that began late last season after Irving was traded from Brooklyn following a tumultuous run of two-plus seasons with the Nets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut they were still learning to play with each other during their truncated time together a year ago and didn't make it to the postseason. After a slow start this season, they found cohesion after the All-Star break and emerged from a deep Western Conference field.\n\nFor Irving, it has been a reminder that success can be fleeting. He won his lone championship with Cleveland in 2016 and has played with three teams over the past eight years. His time in Dallas has reinvigorated him.\n\n\"These young guys are very hungry. They want a championship. I want a championship,\" he said. \"So our feelings are very mutual. But I've always reminded them that this is a process. Failure is going to be part of this, too. Get it out your mind that this is about to be a clean sweep or everything is about to feel good throughout this journey and all that.\n\n\"I'm just very real, very honest. That's what's helped me grow as a leader.\"\n\nDoncic credits the partnership with Irving for uncorking the potential of a team that entered the postseason as a fifth seed.\n\n\"His leadership is amazing,\" Doncic said. \"The way he connects us. I think me and Kyrie are the leaders of this team, but he's the one that's been in the Finals. He's the one that won in the Finals. He's the one that is really leading it.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey'll match up with a Boston team playing like a group that has learned from its recent shortcomings. That was exhibited during a 64-win regular season that established it as a favorite to raise the franchise's 18th championship banner entering the postseason.\n\nThrough the first three rounds, the Celtics have met the challenge, losing just two games along the way under the guidance of second-year coach Joe Mazzulla.\n\nThey've also benefited from an offseason shakeup of its roster that saw longtime emotional leader Marcus Smart and former NBA Sixth Man of the Year Malcolm Brogdon traded in favor of 7-footer Kristaps Porzingis and Jrue Holiday, who won a championship with Milwaukee in 2021.\n\nBrown said a core that features seven players from the 2022 team that lost in the Finals to Golden State is up to the challenge.\n\n\"I think this is a special group. I really do,\" Brown said. \"We've been able to go through the experiences of having success but not having success at the same time. I think to solidify the ultimate goal is to get over the hump and win. I think that will add a lot to our legacy. But as of right now, that story is kind of still untold.\"\n\nCOACHING PERSPECTIVES\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis stage is nothing new to Mavericks Coach Jason Kidd, who is in the Finals for the fifth time as a player or coach.\n\nHe has experienced lows, such as losing back-to-back trips to the Finals in 2002 and 2003 as a player with the New Jersey Nets. He has also seen success, earning his lone title as a player with Dallas in 2011 at age 38 and one as an assistant on the Lakers' 2020 championship team.\n\nThe biggest lesson he has taken away is to approach it like business and be ready to live with the results. That has been his message throughout these playoffs.\n\n\"This is the best of the best at the highest level,\" Kidd said. \"It's fun. That's what the Finals are all about, is seeing what team is going to step forward and take advantage of mistakes.\"\n\nMazzulla was an assistant on Coach Ime Udoka's staff in 2022. What he learned from that experience is the details of winning never change, even on this stage.\n\n\"The toughest team will win,\" Mazzulla said. \"The team that makes the most plays will win. The team that can execute the details at a high level will win. It's no different.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFRIENDS AND COMPETITORS\n\nIrving is ready for what he expects to be an icy greeting from Boston's home crowd for Game 1.\n\nCeltics fans haven't held a high opinion of him since he ended two disappointing seasons in Boston by leaving for the Nets and joining Kevin Durant in free agency in 2019.\n\nHe then rankled the Boston faithful even more when he flipped his middle finger at fans after making a shot during Brooklyn's first-round playoff series loss to the Celtics in 2022. But he said he's looking forward to matching up with \"brothers\" and former teammates Tatum and Brown.\n\n\"They've gotten tremendously better. They've led their team to this point. So I'm proud of them,\" Irving said. \"I'm looking forward to the competition because this is what we've all strived for since we were kids, basketball at this level playing against the best of the best.\"\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

Well ...\n\nLast week, the four-letter network made waves by reigniting a long-dormant debate about Tatum and Brown's relationship. Only there is no debate. Tatum and Brown are fine. Always have been. They have known each other since high school, when they competed at an Under Armour camp. They are, as Brown noted last week, \"polar opposites.\" But whenever the trade rumors swirled around Brown over the years, Tatum has backed him. When Tatum won a gold medal at the 2021 Olympics, Brown celebrated with him. In '22, while reporting a Sports Illustrated cover story on the Boston Celtics, I asked Tatum's longtime trainer, Drew Hanlen, if he had any thoughts on the Tatum-Brown relationship.\n\n\"Jayson brags about how good Jaylen is,\" Hanlen told me. \"How there aren't many players he would trade straight up for him. Any narrative that they didn't like each other, that they can't win together is totally made up.\"\n\nIndeed, they can win together. Boston has made six conference finals in the Tatum-Brown era. Two NBA Finals. Four seasons of 50-plus wins. In a league that covets elite two-way wings, the Celtics have a pair of them.\n\nStill, Boston's duo has reached a critical juncture. The 2022 Finals defeat was disappointing. But, in a way, excusable. The Golden State Warriors were elite. They had championship-level talent and years of experience with it. Did the Celtics gag away a potential 3-1 series lead in Game 4? Maybe. More accurate would be Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and the Warriors went out and took it.\n\n\"This time, this go-around is a lot different,\" Tatum said. \"You don't always get a second chance, so really just looking at it as a second chance and trying to simplify things as much as we can.\"\n\nAdded Al Horford, \"The first time [in 2022], it felt like a roller coaster, just a lot going on, increased coverage in media, all the responsibilities we had and everything that came with it. This time around, we all have an understanding. We know what things are like and I feel like we'll be able to manage it better.\"\n\nThis year, there are no Warriors. The Dallas Mavericks are good. They have Luka Doncic, a superstar. Kyrie Irving, a premiere wingman. P.J. Washington, Dereck Lively II and Derrick Jones Jr. can play. The defense has improved considerably since midseason acquisitions to acquire Washington and Daniel Gafford. While the Celtics were cruising through the Miami Heat, Cleveland Cavaliers and Indiana Pacers, the Mavericks were muscling out the Los Angeles Clippers, Oklahoma City Thunder and Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nStill, the Celtics are heavy favorites. They are six deep with All-Star-level talent. Jrue Holiday and Derrick White are elite defenders. Kristaps Porzingis, who appears to be tracking toward a Game 1 return, is a terror on both ends of the floor. Horford, who celebrated his 38th birthday on Monday, is ageless.\n\nAnd they have Tatum and Brown. This has not been a flawless postseason run. There have been some clunkers. Tatum's 7-for-17 performance in a Game 2 loss to Cleveland. Brown's 0-for-6 three-point stat line in the same game. But the Celtics are 12-2 in the playoffs, with Tatum (26.0 points on 44.2% shooting) and Brown (25.0 points, 54.1% shooting) leading the way.\n\nNow, though, comes the real test. The scrutiny of Tatum and Brown's relationship is unfair. \"The whole thing about that really pisses me off,\" coach Joe Mazzulla said. Raising expectations for their play is not. Curry and Thompson won't be remembered for conference championships. Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray aren't defined by 50-win seasons. If Tatum and Brown want to be regarded as an elite duo, they need to win a title.\n\nFor years, Tatum has been among the NBA's most scrutinized stars. He's a great scorer ... just not always in the clutch. He's a strong defender ... just not one of the best. Even as Tatum's game has grown -- in the post, at the rim, in his playmaking -- he's often viewed as a cut below the NBA's best.\n\nBrown, too. Brown signed the richest contract in NBA history last summer. He responded with a season (23.0 points, 5.5 rebounds, a career-best 3.6 assists) worthy of it. In Boston, Brown will always be the second star. But that doesn't mean he can't be one of the best wings in the game.\n\n\"As long as my team knows my value, my city knows my value, my family, that's all I really care about,\" Brown said. \"But I like to set my hat on just being a versatile two-way wing [who] can do both at any point in time.\"\n\nTatum and Brown understand the stakes. A series win springboards them into rarified air, a tandem with a title, and a chance to win more. A loss opens them up for criticism and more questions about whether the pairing really works.\n\n\"I think [it's unfair] being compared to each other,\" Mazzulla said. \"They're different. And you see other duos around the league don't have to go through that. And it's because of the platform that they have. It's because they've been so successful their entire careers. They've been able to long stand success at a high level.\"\n\nNow it's time to do it at the highest. Two years ago, in the immediate aftermath of a Game 6 loss, Tatum slumped in his locker. In TD Garden, the visiting locker room is directly across from the home one, making the roar of the Warriors' celebration unavoidable. Walking to his car that night, Tatum could hear the Champagne-soaked afterparty still raging. He vowed never to forget that feeling. He swore he would never let an opportunity like that slip away again. Two years later, Tatum, still alongside Brown, will get that chance.\n\nCHRIS MANNIX\n\nSenior Writer, Sports Illustrated Sports Illustrated senior writer Chris Mannix has boxed with Juan Manuel Marquez, played guard in the NBA's D-League and even tried his hand at bull riding at the Sankey Rodeo School in Martin, Tenn. The latter assignment left him with a bunch of bruises and a fractured collarbone. \"I liked all the first-person experiences, but fighting Juan was my favorite assignment for SI,\" says Mannix. \"It was a tremendous experience that required brutal training and introduced me to a fear I never knew I had.\" Mannix has covered the NBA since he arrived at SI in 2003. He currently writes columns and profiles in the magazine and for SI.com and also serves as SI's NBA draft expert. Among the NBA stars he has profiled: Chris Bosh, Russell Westbrook and Andrei Kirilenko. As a teenager Mannix was a locker room attendant with the Boston Celtics for eight seasons (1995-2003) and covered high school sports for the Boston Globe. \"Working for the Celtics was like attending a different fantasy camp every game. I spent pregames D'ing up the likes of Tracy McGrady, Ray Allen and yes, Michael Jordan. Last time I went one-on-one with MJ he beat me 48-0. I got one shot off ... and it was blocked.\" Boxing is also one of Mannix's specialties. He has reported for SI on several championship fights, annually hands out SI.com's boxing awards and writes the website's \"Inside Boxing\" column. Mannix won the 2012 Boxing Writers Association of America's awards for Best Feature over 1,750 words and Best Feature under 1,750 words. In addition to his duties at SI, Mannix serves as host of The Chris Mannix Show on NBC Sports Radio (Sundays 6-9 p.m. ET) and is a co-host of Voices of the Game, with Newy Scruggs every Wednesday from Noon-3 p.m. ET. In addition, Mannix is a ringside reporter for Epix and Fight Night on NBC and NBC Sports Network, and is a regular guest and fill-in host on The Dan Patrick Show and The Crossover on NBC Sports Network. He also regularly appears on sports radio shows across the country, including weekly appearances in Miami, Orlando and Salt Lake City. Mannix received a Bachelor of Arts degree in English from Boston College in 2003 and graduated from Boston College High School in 1998 (which makes him a double Eagle). He resides in New York City.", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_mannix@postandcourier.com", "name": "Chris Mannix",

He's also posting 3.9 rebounds, 5.2 assists and 1.2 steals per contest.\n\nIn Dallas' win in Game 5 of the Western Conference Finals -- which secured the Mavericks their first NBA Finals berth since 2011 -- he dropped 36 points on 14-of-27 shooting from the floor and 4-of-10 shooting from deep while also dishing out five assists.\n\nBefore Dallas dispatched the Minnesota Timberwolves in five games, Irving and the Mavericks eliminated the Oklahoma City Thunder in six games in the second round of the playoffs and Los Angeles Clippers in six games in the opening round.\n\nDallas became the first team since the 2010 Los Angeles Lakers -- who later went on to win that year's title -- to beat three teams who won 50-plus games during the regular season on its path to the NBA Finals.\n\nWhile it would make for a memorable title run if Irving's Mavericks were to finish the job against the Boston Celtics in the 2024 NBA Finals, the 32-year-old's title run with the Cavaliers included the most improbable comeback in the history of the NBA Finals.\n\nWith the help of Irving, the Cavaliers became the first team in NBA Finals history to rally back from a 1-3 series deficit to win the championship series in seven games. The former Duke University star played at the top of his game against Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and the Golden State Warriors, considering he averaged 27.1 points per contest on 46.8 percent accuracy from the field and 40.5 percent shooting from 3-point range.\n\nAll in all, it's open to debate as to whether Irving winning a title with the Mavericks in 2024 would mean more than the championship he won playing alongside arguably the best player in NBA history in LeBron James.", "source": {"uri": "cavaliersnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cavaliers Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jesse_cinquini@cavaliersnation.com", "name": "Jesse Cinquini", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Sixth_Man_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Crawford", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Crawford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Duke University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klay_Thompson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Klay Thompson"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Legal", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Legal", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://cavaliersnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/USATSI_23427458_168403910_lowres-e1717514205965.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

Here's what to watch for as Game 1 starts Thursday", "body": "The Dallas Mavericks are in the NBA Finals, and their matchup against the Boston Celtics is absolutely loaded with compelling storylines.\n\nHere's a look at what to watch out for going into Game 1 Thursday night in Boston, which tips off at 7:30 a.m. on ABC.\n\nThe Celtics have arguably been the best team in the NBA all year, earning the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference and coasting to the Finals.\n\nThe Mavericks are the real surprise here: As the fifth seed in the Western Conference, they won three playoff series in which they were underdogs. If they're somehow able to win a fourth in that role, they would be the lowest-seeded team to win it all since the 1994-95 Houston Rockets.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting story of these Finals is Kyrie Irving facing off against the team he played for from 2017-2019.\n\nIrving's two seasons with the Celtics were solid. But ever since a 2022 playoff game in which Irving -- then playing for the Brooklyn Nets -- got into it repeatedly with Celts fans and was fined $50,000 for doing so, he's been Public Enemy No. 1 in Boston. Don't be surprised if he gets booed every time he touches the ball in Game 1.\n\nAll of that animosity will likely overshadow another significant reunion when Kristaps Porzingis takes on his former team. Mavs fans don't have near the hate for KP, whose three seasons in Dallas were mostly marked by injury and an inability to gel with a young Luka Doncic and coach Rick Carlisle.\n\nStill, pro athletes are motivated by even the slightest of slights, so Porzingis will surely be looking to reward the Celtics for taking a chance on him.\n\nThis one's more for the basketball nerds out there, but these two teams offer a real contrast in styles.\n\nThe Celtics thrive in what's known as a \"five-out\" action, in which all five players set up around the three-point arc and work a variety of screens to set up open three-point shots and drives to the basket.\n\nThis strategy takes away from one of the Mavericks' biggest defensive strengths, which is allowing centers Daniel Gafford and Derek Lively to plant themselves near the basket and wait for the action to come to them before swatting the ball back out. With the five-out scheme, none of the offensive players are anywhere near the lane, forcing those bigger Mavericks to venture away from their comfort zone and guard players in space -- a much tougher task.\n\nMeanwhile, the Mavericks have excelled at having Doncic and Irving use their excellent ball-handling to drive to the basket and set up easy dunks for -- you guessed it -- Gafford and Lively.\n\nThe chess match between Mavs coach Jason Kidd and Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla - particularly how they adjust their strategies as the series unfolds - will be intriguing.", "source": {"uri": "keranews.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "KERA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Rockets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston Rockets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Nets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn Nets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Mazzulla", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Mazzulla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Gafford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Gafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kidd", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jason Kidd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slam_dunk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slam dunk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4766a98/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4556x2392+0+323/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F21%2F67%2F9791ae3d4c49abfd5a7afe9ae025%2Fmavs-celts.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

Here's a glimpse at how home court works for the NBA Finals, as well as how important it is in determining a champion:\n\nUnlike the first three rounds of the playoffs, where home-court advantage is granted based on seeding, the team with the better regular season record gets it in the NBA Finals.\n\nThis year, the Celtics have the advantage in both seeding and record. They earned the East's No. 1 seed with a 64-18 regular season record, while the Mavericks were the West's No. 5 seed with their 50-32 record.\n\nIn most cases, the team with the higher seed also has the better record. Since 2008, only two teams have started the Finals on the road despite being the higher seed. In 2019, the 57-25 Golden State Warriors were the No. 1 seed in the West but had to play Game 1 of the Finals in Toronto against the 58-24 Raptors, who entered the playoffs as the East's No. 2 seed. Three years later, the No. 3 Warriors went 53-29 during the regular season and the No. 2 Celtics went 51-31, so home court was granted to Golden State.\n\nWhile the method for determining home-court advantage differs in the Finals, the series layout is consistent through all four rounds of the playoffs. The team that hosts Game 1 also hosts Games 2, 5 and 7. The team that begins the series on the road hosts Games 3, 4 and 6.\n\nIt definitely helps to have home-court advantage in the NBA Finals.\n\nExcluding the Orlando bubble in 2020, 55 of the 76 teams with home-court advantage in the NBA Finals went on to win the championship.\n\nHome-court advantage plays an even bigger role at the start of the Finals.\n\nFifty-eight of the 76 teams that began the series at home won Game 1, good for a .763 win percentage.\n\nHome court has a similar effect on Game 7s in the Finals as it does Game 1s.\n\nOf the 19 Game 7s in Finals history, the home team came out on top 15 times (.789 win percentage). The Celtics (1969 and 1974), Washington Bullets (1978) and Cavaliers (2016) are the only teams to ever win a Finals Game 7 on the road.", "source": {"uri": "nbcdfw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC 5 Dallas-Fort Worth"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_advantage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Home advantage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Raptors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Raptors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_NBA_Bubble", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2020 NBA Bubble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Wizards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington Wizards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Field_Crops", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Field Crops", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://media.nbcdfw.com/2024/06/web-240604-jayson-tatum-mavericks.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\n\"You think that you're young, if you've been once, you'll continue to keep going,\" Tatum said. \"We realized that last year. We kind of took it for granted at certain moments.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAnd now?\n\n\"I'm not thinking about what it would mean for my legacy or anything like that,\" he said. \"Just excited to play some basketball ... and go out there and try to get the job done.\"\n\nDallas' Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving see it as their first opportunity to make good on a partnership that began late last season after Irving was traded from Brooklyn following a tumultuous run of two-plus seasons with the Nets.\n\nBut the duo was still learning to play with each other during their truncated time together last season and didn't make it to the postseason. After a slow start this season, they found cohesion after the All-Star break and emerged from a deep Western Conference field.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nFor Irving, it has been a reminder that success can be fleeting. He won his lone championship with Cleveland in 2016 and has played with three teams over the past eight years. His time in Dallas has reinvigorated him.\n\nYou might be interested in Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"These young guys are very hungry. They want a championship. I want a championship,\" he said. \"So our feelings are very mutual. But I've always reminded them that this is a process. Failure is going to be part of this, too. Get it out your mind that this is about to be a clean sweep or everything is about to feel good throughout this journey and all that.\n\n\"I'm just very real, very honest. That's what's helped me grow as a leader.\"\n\nDoncic credits the partnership with Irving for uncorking the potential of a team that entered the postseason as a fifth seed.\n\n\"His leadership is amazing,\" Doncic said. \"The way he connects us. I think me and Kyrie are the leaders of this team, but he's the one that's been in the Finals. He's the one that won in the Finals. He's the one that is really leading it.\"\n\nThey'll matchup with a Boston team playing like a group that has learned from its recent shortcomings. That was exhibited during a 64-win regular season that established it as a favorite to raise the franchise's 18th championship banner entering the postseason.\n\nThrough the first three rounds, the Celtics have met the challenge, losing just two games along the way under the guidance of second-year coach Joe Mazzulla.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThey've also benefited from an offseason shakeup of its roster that saw longtime emotional leader Marcus Smart and former NBA Sixth Man of the Year Malcolm Brogdon traded in favor of 7-footer Kristaps Porzingis and Jrue Holiday, who won a championship with Milwaukee in 2021.\n\nBrown said a core that features seven players from the 2022 team that lost in the Finals to Golden State, is up to the challenge.\n\n\"I think this is a special group. I really do,\" Brown said. \"We've been able to go through the experiences of having success but not having success at the same time. I think to solidify the ultimate goal is to get over the hump and win. I think that will add a lot to our legacy. But as of right now, that story is kind of still untold.\"\n\nCOACHING PERSPECTIVES\n\nThis stage is nothing new to Mavericks coach Jason Kidd, who is in the Finals for the fifth time as a player or coach.\n\nHe has experienced lows, such as losing back-to-back trips to the Finals in 2002 and 2003 as a player with the New Jersey Nets. He has also seen success, earning his lone title as a player with Dallas in 2011 at age 38 and one as an assistant on the Lakers 2020 championship team.\n\nThe biggest lesson he has taken away is to approach it like business and be ready to live with the results. That has been his message to his team throughout these playoffs.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"This is the best of the best at the highest level,\" Kidd said. \"It's fun. That's what the Finals are all about, is seeing what team is going to step forward and take advantage of mistakes.\"\n\nMazzulla was an assistant on Ime Udoka's staff in 2022. What he learned from that experience is that the details of winning never change, even on this stage.\n\n\"The toughest team will win,\" Mazzulla said. \"The team that makes the most plays will win. The team that can execute the details at a high level will win. It's no different.\"\n\nFRIENDS AND COMPETITORS\n\nIrving is ready for what he expects to be an icy greeting from Boston's home crowd for Game 1 on Thursday.\n\nCeltics fans haven't held a high opinion of him since he ended two disappointing seasons in Boston by leaving for the Nets and joining Kevin Durant in free agency in 2019.\n\nHe then rankled the Boston faithful even more when he flipped his middle finger at fans after making a shot during Brooklyn's first round playoff series loss to the Celtics in 2022. But he said he is looking forward to matching up with \"brothers\" and former teammates Tatum and Brown.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"They've gotten tremendously better. They've led their team to this point. So I'm proud of them,\" Irving said. \"I'm looking forward to the competition because this is what we've all strived for since we were kids, basketball at this level playing against the best of the best.\"\n\n___\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba", "source": {"uri": "thepeterboroughexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "thepeterboroughexaminer.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Here are three bets worth considering for Thursday night's series opener.\n\nThis one doesn't require much overthinking. We've been treated to an abundance of close playoff games in recent weeks -- well, at least out of the West -- but the Celtics are favored at -225 to win this series for a reason. They're the better team top to bottom, they were hardly tested throughout the Eastern Conference bracket and they've had a week for Tatum and Brown to rest and heal up.\n\nDon't get us wrong, Dallas is dangerous enough to make the series close. That's just unlikely to start in Game 1 in a raucous TD Garden. The Celtics swept the two-game season series with the Mavericks, including a 138-110 pounding at home in March. A Boston win by at least seven points isn't hard to see coming.\n\nBrown was hot and cold from the arc during the Eastern Conference Finals, but he didn't need to hit as many threes with the likes of Jrue Holiday, Derrick White and 76-year-old Al Horford stepping up from long range.\n\nThat said, there's something you should know about Brown's 3-point tendencies. He's made them at a far better clip at home than on the road this year. During the regular season, Brown knocked down 39.5 percent of his triples at TD Garden and just 31.6 percent away from home. He made at least three 3-pointers in five of his final seven regular-season home games, and he's hit that mark in four of eight playoff games at home. And packing the paint has been Dallas' specialty more than defending the perimeter.\n\nThanks to BetMGM's \"alternate player prop\" options, you can turn up the dial on Brown's over/under and bet on him to drain at least three from three.\n\nApart from the handful of hardcore, professional sports bettors among us, why are you placing wagers on sports if not to have a little fun? And what's more fun than rooting for one of the league's most electric players to rack up the rebounds and assists he needs for that elusive triple-double?\n\nExcept with Doncic, it's not elusive in the slightest. He's followed up his 21 triple-doubles in the regular season by notching six in the playoffs, including five in his last eight games. As long as his Mavericks teammates are knocking down shots the way they were by the end of the Western Conference Finals, the Slovenian star should have no shortage of assist opportunities.\n\nIf you're concerned about Boston's defense or general superiority, note that Doncic posted triple-doubles in both meetings with the Celtics in the regular season -- 33 points, 18 rebounds, 13 assists at home; 37 points, 12 rebounds, 11 assists on the road -- and Boston still won both games.", "source": {"uri": "sportal.co.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportal - World Sports News - Live Scores"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Gaming", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Gaming", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://sportal.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/1717598070818", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

Since coming into the league, Doncic is 5-6 versus the Celtics, averaging 29.9 points per game, 8.8 boards, and 7.5 assists. The Celtics have easily won the last four against them, keeping Doncic's +/- under -10 in each contest, but the painful losses are impossible to ignore.\n\nThe Cs have had strong defensive rosters in every matchup against Doncic, but have only kept him under 40% from the field in one game. Although this year's team can create the most problems for Doncic offensively, his step-back jumper, ability to draw contact and control over the game's pace makes him by far the biggest challenge the Celtics will face these playoffs.\n\nPrior to the Celtics' 4-game win streak against the Mavericks, it was Luka who had bested the Celtics in four straight games -- all of which in dramatic fashion. In February 2021, Luka nailed a ridiculous step-back with 0.1 seconds remaining on the clock, less than a minute after hitting another go-ahead step-back over former Celtics' big Daniel Theis identical to his game-winner over Rudy Gobert in game 4 of the Western Conference Finals. One month later, Doncic hit his seventh three of the game in crunch time before drawing a huge foul on Kemba Walker behind the arc and sinking three free throws to help close out another win. Both Celtics' stars, Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown failed to answer, and the Celtics fell 113-108.\n\nThe following season, Luka hit one of the wildest shots of his career, another step-back game winner that this time swished through the net after the buzzer sounded. Like the other two losses, the Celtics fought back from a deficit and delivered strong fourth quarter performances -- a troubling area for them -- but still fell short to Doncic's greatness in the clutch.\n\nAnd in March 2022, the Celtics squandered a close home game, with Luka drilling a three to tie the game before finding Spencer Dinwiddie for the eventual game winner. Tatum notably struggled, especially down the stretch, perhaps giving him all the motivation he needed to make this their last loss versus the Mavericks.\n\nSo if the Celtics hold a positive record over Doncic, including four straight dominant showings, and he seemingly needs last-minute magic to pull off his wins against them, what does that mean for this seven-game series?\n\nThe Celtics have the tools to either run away with the series or allow heartbreaking history from the NBA's biggest star to repeat itself.", "source": {"uri": "hardwoodhoudini.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hardwood Houdini"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Theis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Theis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gobert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_Dinwiddie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spencer Dinwiddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kemba_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kemba Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "label": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3600,h_2025,x_0,y_818/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/18/01hzmeqvp9nvm897pk6z.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

I wish we would have won,\" Tatum said Wednesday. \"But I'm a firm believer that everything happens for a reason. There's a lesson to be learned in every situation.\n\n\"I do feel a lot different this time. I'm excited for the opportunity for us to get the job done. I told myself if I ever got the opportunity again to make it to the finals, never take it for granted. We're here now and I'm excited to get ready to play and have fun.\"\n\nBrown said he has watched the 2022 finals several times to learn how to better manage his emotions and to make better decisions on the court.\n\n\"You learn and grow from your experiences,\" Brown said. \"Two years later makes a pretty big difference.\n\n\"This is a special group. The core group has been here for a few years now. We've been able to go through experiences, having success but not having success at the same time.\n\n\"The ultimate goal is to get over the hump and win. I think that will add a lot to our legacy as a team, but as of right now, that story is still kind of untold.\"\n\nAnother factor is that the Celtics seek an unprecedented 18th NBA crown, one more than the all-time record they share with the rival Los Angeles Lakers.\n\n\"Some of the greatest players to ever play this game wore this uniform. We're honored to follow in their footsteps. They paved the way for us to live out our dreams,\" said Tatum.\n\n\"If you want to be one of the greats to put on this uniform, every great before you won a championship. It takes special players to be part of an environment like that.\"\n\nOne of those is Jrue Holiday, who won a 2021 NBA title with Milwaukee and was obtained in a trade deal just before the season began.\n\nMore from this section Georgia woman faces manslaughter, other charges in fatal Massapequa crash Boxer Huang Hsiao-wen Qualifies for Paris Olympics - TaiwanPlus News Louisiana approves surgical castration bill for sex crimes against children\n\n\"To be a part of history would be cool, the history the Celtics have,\" Holiday said. \"To add to that is part of the reason I was brought here -- and part of the reason I wanted to come.\"\n\n- 'The will to win' -\n\nThe defensive standout sees something special in the Celtics, who led the NBA with 64 wins this season.\n\n\"The pressure JB and JT have to take on is something different,\" Holiday said. \"It's really impressive how they handle themselves.\n\n\"I know sometimes talent doesn't mesh together but this does. You saw it in the regular season. You've seen it in the playoffs. Any given night we sacrifice for each other. we're unselfish and I think that's what makes it go.\"\n\n\"And then it's just the will to win. They've been to the Eastern Conference finals a million times and they have been to the finals so they've been to the top, just didn't execute the way they wanted.\n\n\"Now that we're here, we want to get the job done.\"\n\nTatum appreciates the finals more after losing to Miami in seven games in last year's East finals.\n\n\"Last year we took that for granted and we didn't make it to the finals. Put things in prespective,\" Tatum said.\n\n\"You could see our excitement when we won the conference (this year). That's not the be-all, end-all but it really is tough to get to this moment.\n\n\"I'm staying in the moment. I'm not thinking of what this would mean to my legacy or anything like that.

(AP Photo/Gareth Patterson)\n\nIrving and Doncic scored 36 points apiece in the clincher against the Wolves, both shooting better than 50% and combining to make half their 3-pointers.\n\nThe Mavs didn't need double figures from anybody off the bench, and barely from the other starters.\n\nThey can make that formula work, with at least some help.\n\nP.J. Washington Jr. will draw the difficult defensive assignments against Boston co-stars Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. But the midseason acquisition needs to shoot closer to the 47% from 3-point range that he did in the second-round victory over top-seeded Oklahoma City than the 25% he shot against Minnesota.\n\nThe other defense-first starter and key figure in trying to slow Tatum and Brown, Derrick Jones Jr., could provide a boost by matching his 40% shooting from 3 in these playoffs.\n\nThen there's the rim-protecting, pick-and-rolling tandem of centers Daniel Gafford - the other midseason trade pickup along with Washington - and rookie Dereck Lively II.\n\nThose two give Dallas an edge over the Celtics, who have a more perimeter-oriented pairing in Kristaps Porzingis and the undersized Al Horford.\n\nBoston also isn't sure what it will get out of Porzingis with the 7-foot-2 Latvian sidelined since the first round by a calf injury.\n\nThe Celtics get the edge in late-playoff experience, but not by much.\n\nThey are on a three-year run of reaching the East finals and made the NBA Finals in 2022, losing to Golden State in six games after the Warriors beat Dallas in the West finals.\n\nIrving, however, has the most experience in the series on the NBA's biggest stage, with 13 games in the finals. He ranks eighth among players with at least 10 games with a scoring average of 27.7 points.\n\nDoncic doesn't figure to be spooked by his first NBA Finals. The 25-year-old was playing professionally in Spain a decade ago and was the title-winning EuroLeague MVP days before getting drafted third overall in 2018.\n\nHe also is the reason Slovenia reached the medal round as a first-time Olympic qualifier at the Tokyo Games three years ago.\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA\n\nDallas Mavericks center Daniel Gafford (21) celebrates a Minnesota Timberwolves shot clock violation as Minnesota Timberwolves forward Kyle Anderson (1) pauses on the court during the first half of Game 5 of the Western Conference finals in the NBA basketball playoffs, Thursday, May 30, 2024, in Minneapolis.

What makes their tandem more deadly is that there is no clear Batman and Robin, as either can be the #1 option on any given night. And not only do they excel on offense, but both are also excellent defenders.\n\nHowever, aside from Tatum and Brown, Mavericks head coach Jason Kidd is concerned about a third Celtic. During his recent appearance on the 'Stephen A.

He is considered one of the best defensive guards in the NBA and is coming off a second straight appearance in the NBA All-Defensive First team.\n\nNot only is Derrick a standout on defense, but he is also a knockdown three-point shooter. At 40.7%, White leads the team in three-point shooting percentage. The Celtics are 8-0 in the playoffs when he hits at least three three-pointers in a game. Boston has won by at least 12 points when he makes at least four triples in a game.\n\n\"When you talk about his ability to shoot the three, again he's one that a lot of times goes under the radar, but when he's able to knock down threes and he gets a lot of looks at them, it takes their offense to another level. They got a lot of lasers out there, we gotta be able to guard the three but White is the one that we are concerned about,\" added Kidd.\n\nReggie says Boston has an unfair backcourt duo\n\nCoach Kidd's concern is valid. As Indiana Pacers Hall of Famer recently said, the Celtics having both White and Jrue Holiday is an unfair advantage. According to Uncle Reg, Derrick and Jrue are the most important players for the current Boston team.\n\n\"Let me say this about the Boston Celtics. Jrue Holiday and Derrick White, it's almost unfair. Seriously, those two dudes do every single little thing that impacts winning,\" Reggie said on The Dan Patrick Show. \"They take their team's temperature, whatever their team will need that night. I know all the headlines go to Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown... But this team, the bread-and-butter, to me, is Holiday and White.\"\n\nNo one will argue that Jayson and Jaylen are the No.1 and No. 2 options for the Celtics and that the ranking is interchangeable. However, when you look at every playoff series, the stars on both teams always cancel each other out. The team with the role players who come up big always wins in the playoffs. Unfortunately for Kidd, that's White's specialty.\n\nRelated: Bill Simmons on why Dallas beating Boston would be a huge upset: \"There's three giant history red flags with the Mavericks\"", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shane_garry_acedera@postandcourier.com", "name": "Shane Garry Acedera", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kidd", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jason Kidd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_A._Smith", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen A.

Boston is a -225 favorite to win it all, meaning someone would need to wager $225 to win $100.\n\nAs for the series opener, the Celtics are 6 1/2-point favorites, but 63% of the money has been on the Mavericks to cover the spread. Dallas is receiving 70% of the bets to win the game outright at +200.\n\n\"Pretty much, the public is just believing in the Mavericks,\" Egeland said.\n\nDespite that, the Celtics' odds have remained consistently solid not only at BetMGM but other sportsbooks as well. Even though Egeland said professional bettors are largely sitting out this series because they don't find much betting value, he said he didn't expect the lines to be significantly affected.\n\n\"We feel it's the correct betting line,\" Egeland said. \"If we were trading strictly off money, we would've moved it towards the Mavericks because it's all Mavericks money. But we're trying to get to a point where we're at like an equilibrium -- half the time (betting is) going to be on one side, half the time it's going to go on the other. We've landed at 6 1/2 and that's the strategy you take.\"\n\nEgeland said there's a reason the Celtics are favored.\n\n\"The Celtics had an 82-game season and they've been the best team all year,\" he said. \"I know they haven't had the toughest competition to get to the Finals, but like I said, they've had 82 games to prove themselves, and they've done nothing but show you that they're that good of a team.\"\n\nTHE PORZINGIS FACTOR\n\nPart of the reason for the opening-game spread, Egeland said, is the expected return of Boston's Kristaps Porzingis. He hasn't played since straining his left calf in Game 4 of the opening round against the Miami Heat.\n\nPorzingis not only would give the Celtics size if he is back, but the 7-footer is an effective 3-point shooter, creating a difficult matchup for the Mavs. He averaged 20.1 points and 7.2 rebounds during the regular season.\n\nEgeland said if the Celtics have to sit Porzingis yet again, they likely would drop to 4 1/2- or 5-point favorites.\n\n\"The team's been pretty good without him,\" DraftKings sportsbook operations director Johnny Avello said. \"So with him, it makes them even that much better. Will he be able to get back into the mix kind of quickly? I think so. This series could be a seven-game series, so any bodies you can get in there and contribute, they are welcome for both sides.\"\n\nRUST VS. REST\n\nBoth teams have received extended time off to prepare for this series after the Celtics swept the Indiana Pacers and the Mavericks eliminated the Minnesota Timberwolves in five games.\n\n\"I would say the Mavs had it a little bit harder than the Celts did, so maybe (the layoff) would affect the Celtics more since they didn't get pushed much,\" Avello said. \"The Mavs' 4-1 (series victory) wasn't really reflective of how that series went, although you consider the Celtics, too. They could've lost an early game (to Indiana). It certainly would've changed the complexion of that series.\"\n\nEgeland said the extra prep time should especially benefit Porzingis, but also noted that Doncic has been playing on a gimpy knee and ankle.\n\nM-V-P!\n\nJayson Tatum is a -120 favorite to be the Finals MVP at BetMGM, but Doncic is close behind at +200. DraftKings has Doncic at -205 and Tatum at +280, nearly a complete flip from late last week.\n\n\"He's taking more money,\" Avello said of Doncic before the odds changed.\n\nHOW LONG CAN IT GO?\n\nThe odds at BetMGM favor the series ending in anywhere between five and seven games, with the odds ranging from +200 to +225. A sweep is at +450.\n\nDraftKings is even more bullish on a long series, posting the chances of it going six or seven games at -150 compared to +125 to be shorter.\n\nThank you for relying on us to provide the journalism you can trust.

Boston is a -225 favorite to win it all, meaning someone would need to wager $225 to win $100.\n\nAs for the series opener, the Celtics are 6 1/2-point favorites, but 63% of the money has been on the Mavericks to cover the spread. Dallas is receiving 70% of the bets to win the game outright at +200.\n\n\"Pretty much, the public is just believing in the Mavericks,\" Egeland said.\n\nDespite that, the Celtics' odds have remained consistently solid not only at BetMGM but other sportsbooks as well. Even though Egeland said professional bettors are largely sitting out this series because they don't find much betting value, he said he didn't expect the lines to be significantly affected.\n\n\"We feel it's the correct betting line,\" Egeland said. \"If we were trading strictly off money, we would've moved it towards the Mavericks because it's all Mavericks money. But we're trying to get to a point where we're at like an equilibrium -- half the time (betting is) going to be on one side, half the time it's going to go on the other. We've landed at 6 1/2 and that's the strategy you take.\"\n\nEgeland said there's a reason the Celtics are favored.\n\n\"The Celtics had an 82-game season and they've been the best team all year,\" he said. \"I know they haven't had the toughest competition to get to the Finals, but like I said, they've had 82 games to prove themselves, and they've done nothing but show you that they're that good of a team.\"\n\nTHE PORZINGIS FACTOR\n\nPart of the reason for the opening-game spread, Egeland said, is the expected return of Boston's Kristaps Porzingis. He hasn't played since straining his left calf in Game 4 of the opening round against the Miami Heat.\n\nPorzingis not only would give the Celtics size if he is back, but the 7-footer is an effective 3-point shooter, creating a difficult matchup for the Mavs. He averaged 20.1 points and 7.2 rebounds during the regular season.\n\nEgeland said if the Celtics have to sit Porzingis yet again, they likely would drop to 4 1/2- or 5-point favorites.\n\n\"The team's been pretty good without him,\" DraftKings sportsbook operations director Johnny Avello said. \"So with him, it makes them even that much better. Will he be able to get back into the mix kind of quickly? I think so. This series could be a seven-game series, so any bodies you can get in there and contribute, they are welcome for both sides.\"\n\nRUST VS. REST\n\nBoth teams have received extended time off to prepare for this series after the Celtics swept the Indiana Pacers and the Mavericks eliminated the Minnesota Timberwolves in five games.\n\n\"I would say the Mavs had it a little bit harder than the Celts did, so maybe (the layoff) would affect the Celtics more since they didn't get pushed much,\" Avello said. \"The Mavs' 4-1 (series victory) wasn't really reflective of how that series went, although you consider the Celtics, too. They could've lost an early game (to Indiana). It certainly would've changed the complexion of that series.\"\n\nEgeland said the extra prep time should especially benefit Porzingis, but also noted that Doncic has been playing on a gimpy knee and ankle.\n\nM-V-P!\n\nJayson Tatum is a -120 favorite to be the Finals MVP at BetMGM, but Doncic is close behind at +200. DraftKings has Doncic at -205 and Tatum at +280, nearly a complete flip from late last week.\n\n\"He's taking more money,\" Avello said of Doncic before the odds changed.\n\nHOW LONG CAN IT GO?\n\nThe odds at BetMGM favor the series ending in anywhere between five and seven games, with the odds ranging from +200 to +225. A sweep is at +450.\n\nDraftKings is even more bullish on a long series, posting the chances of it going six or seven games at -150 compared to +125 to be shorter.\n\nThank you for relying on us to provide the journalism you can trust.

We kind of took it for granted at certain moments.\"\n\nDallas's Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving see the Finals as their first opportunity to make good on a partnership that began late last season after the latter was traded from Brooklyn.\n\nAfter a slow start this season, the superstar pair found cohesion after the All-Star break and emerged from a deep Western Conference field.\n\nFor Irving, it has been a reminder that success can be fleeting.\n\nHe won his lone championship with Cleveland in 2016 and has played with three teams over the past eight years. His time in Dallas has reinvigorated him.\n\n\"These young guys are very hungry. They want a championship. I want a championship,\" he said.\n\n\"So our feelings are very mutual. But I've always reminded them that this is a process. Failure is going to be part of this, too.\"\n\nDoncic credits the partnership with Irving for uncorking the potential of a team that entered the post-season as a fifth seed.\n\n\"His leadership is amazing,\" Doncic said.\n\n\"The way he connects us. Me and Kyrie are the leaders of this team, but he's the one that's been in the Finals. He's the one that won in the Finals. He's the one that is really leading it.\"\n\nAlongside the Mavericks' Australian pair Dante Exum and Josh Green, they will matchup with a Boston team playing like a group that has learned from its recent shortcomings.\n\nBrown said a core that features seven players from the 2022 team that lost in the Finals to Golden State, is up to the challenge.\n\n\"We've been able to go through the experiences of having success but not having success at the same time,\" he said.\n\n\"To solidify the ultimate goal is to get over the hump and win. That will add a lot to our legacy.\"\n\nThis stage is nothing new to Mavericks mentor Jason Kidd, who is in the Finals for the fifth time as a player or coach.\n\nHe has experienced lows - losing in 2002 and 2003 as a player with the New Jersey Nets - as well as the highs of his lone title as a player with Dallas in 2011 and as an assistant on the Lakers' 2020 championship team.\n\n\"This is the best of the best at the highest level,\" Kidd said.\n\n\"It's fun. That's what the Finals are all about - seeing what team is going to step forward and take advantage of mistakes.\"\n\nAccording to Boston's Joe Mazzulla, it's the \"toughest team\" that will take the honours.\n\n\"The team that makes the most plays will win. The team that can execute the details at a high level will win. It's no different,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "perthnow.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Perth Now"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Weekend", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Weekend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Mazzulla", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Mazzulla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dante_Exum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dante Exum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Nets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn Nets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kidd", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jason Kidd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Education_and_Training/Team_Building", "label": "dmoz/Business/Education and Training/Team Building", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-14927215/e653dc83c81e2dbe0dc9547b22e19f156948bf97-16x9-x0y0w1279h719.jpg?imwidth=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

They did and they swept.\n\nNelson, who has watched nearly every Celtics game this season, is back for the NBA Finals, the Celtics versus the Dallas Mavericks.\n\n\"This is going to be their toughest series by far,\" said Nelson, who scouted games this past season for the Phoenix Suns. \"This is going to be a real series, with two elite teams with each team having stars.\n\n\"Obviously, there are a lot of factors, matchups, etc., but in the end it usually comes down the superstars,\" he said. \"I believe it will come down to which duo, Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, and Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving. Whichever duo plays the best will win.\"\n\nThat being said, there is a lot to break down.\n\n\"The Celtics strength will be their ability to throw several players at Luka, like Jrue Holiday, Brown and Derrick White,\" said Nelson. \"At the other end, how does Dallas match up with Brown and Tatum. The Mavs have Derrick Jones, who is a great defender. How will they both the Celtics best two players.\"\n\nThe wild card in the series, said Nelson, is Kristaps Porzingis. He can be the X-factor.\n\n\"Will Porzingis be a luxury for the Celtics, playing part-time, or will he be a necessity?\" said Nelson. \"If he is healthy and playing big minutes, he can have a big impact if he's hitting three's from deep. It will make it harder for the Mavs to load up on Brown and Tatum.\"\n\nNelson expects White to be a key defender on Kyrie.\n\n\"I believe Dallas would love opportunity to have White on Kyrie,\" he said. \"White is a very good defender, but Kyrie can crush that matchup. He's playing with a lot of confidence right now. If White can contain Kyrie, that would be huge for the Celtics. But I see Kyrie winning that battle.\"\n\nAnother key for the Mavericks, if they are going to have success in the series, is rebounding.\n\n\"The Celtics sometimes have problems rebounding. That where (Dereck) Lively, (Daniel) Gafford and (P.J.) Washington could help the Mavs cause,\" said Nelson. \"Those three are very athletic and could cause the Celtics some problems.\"\n\nWhile the Celtics bench was not a big factor in their run to the finals, Nelson expects Payton Pritchard and Sam Hauser to up their games in this series.\n\n\"Pritchard doesn't always have to score to add value,\" said Nelson. \"He is a threat as a three-point shooter, but he adds energy off the bench. He seems to get a lot of big offensive rebounds.\n\n\"Hauser has had some time to find his game,\" said Nelson. \"I expect him to play better in this series, hit some open shots.\"\n\nNelson is not sure if there is a good plan to \"shut down\" Doncic.\n\n\"The Timberwolves tried eight different ways to guard him and none worked,\" said Nelson. \"They tried doubling. They tried straight up, one on one. They tried under screens. They tried drop coverage, allowing him to shoot from the logo ... and he did. and made almost every shot. I think you have to live with Luka getting his 40 points.\"\n\nNelson said the key for the Celtics is on the other end, making Doncic and Kyrie play defense.\n\n\"I think the Celtics can attack the Mavs in transition and be physical with them,\" said Nelson. \"I believe the Celtics would wear them out. The Timberwolves didn't really try that. You want to make their two stars play defense.\"\n\nA key for the Celtics, on offense, said Nelson, is to make the extra pass and shoot 3-pointers on transition, moving the ball.\n\n\"The Celtics would be playing into the Mavs hands if they do a lot of isolation, one on one stuff,\" said Nelson. \"The Celtics can slow down the Mavs transition game by scoring.\"\n\nOverall, Nelson sees a good, hard-fought, emotional series led by stars in the NBA.\n\n\"I'm sticking with the Celtics. They have had the better year all year,\" said Nelson. \"I think the national media's bashing of the Celtics is unfounded, that they don't 'trust' them, that 'Tatum and Brown don't like each other,' that 'Joe Mazzulla can't coach.'\n\n\"I think this is their year and now they have to prove it against a quality, quality team,\" said Nelson. \"I'm going to pick the Celtics in six.\"\n\nYou can email Bill Burt at bburt@eagletribune.com.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bill_burt@eagletribune.com", "name": "Bill Burt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scout (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payton_Pritchard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Payton Pritchard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Mazzulla", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Mazzulla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Ethnic_and_Regional", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Ethnic and Regional", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/eagletribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/ca/1ca571f3-77e6-5cea-be24-0db994696a04/6653af9a35f6e.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C125&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

Tatum is better than even money to win at -120, while Don\u010di\u0107 is at +200.\n\nEven though Don\u010di\u0107 is the consensus best player in the series, Tatum has significantly better odds than Don\u010di\u0107 because the Celtics enter the Finals as the clear favorites. Boston is still -225 to win the Finals, while Dallas is +180. The Celtics are 6.5-point favorites at home on Thursday night.\n\nTatum has averaged 26 points per game on 44% shooting during the postseason so far. If his 3-point percentage rebounds, he could be in for a big Finals. Tatum is shooting just 29% from behind the arc over 14 postseason games after shooting 37.6% from deep during the regular season.\n\nDon\u010di\u0107's field goal percentage has also dropped this postseason as he's dealt with some lingering injuries and more defensive focus. After averaging nearly 34 points a game in the regular season, Don\u010di\u0107 is scoring just under 29 points per game this postseason and shooting 43.8% from the field compared to 48.7% in the regular season.\n\nAfter struggling in Dallas' Game 4 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves in the Western Conference Finals, Don\u010di\u0107 rebounded with a huge game in Game 5. He shot 63.6% from the field as he had 36 points, 10 rebounds and five assists.\n\nJaylen Brown is the clear No. 3 favorite behind Tatum and Don\u010di\u0107 at +625. Brown is averaging 25 points pr game and shooting over 54% from the field in the playoffs. If you like Boston to cash in as favorites, he may be a better bet than Tatum.\n\nKyrie Irving is +1800 to win Finals MVP as he heads back to Boston for the first time as a member of the Mavericks. Irving last played against his former team in Boston during the 2022 postseason as a member of the Nets.\n\nIrving has been phenomenal so far for the Mavericks in the playoffs.

When comparing the two teams, the Celtics have 17 NBA titles in franchise history, while the Mavs are seeking their second-ever championship, as the last came in 2011 when Dirk Nowitzki helped lead the team to upset the Miami Heat (4-2). On the other hand, Boston is looking for their first ring since 2008, when Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett, and Ray Allen defeated Kobe Bryant and the Los Angeles Lakers (4-2).\n\nThe storyline for this series has a revenge undertone, considering there are two players who will be facing their old teams, as Kyrie used to play for the Celtics from 2017-19 and Porzingis is a former Mavericks player from 2019-22. With that being said, both players are difference makers for their new respective teams, and the fans and teammates of their past teams have undoubtedly not forgotten about them.\n\nThat is to say, Kyrie will most likely be more hated by the Boston fans than Porzingis upon his return to Dallas. Kyrie left in free agency to join the Nets after two seasons, while Porzingis was traded to the Washington Wizards ahead of the 2022 trade deadline.\n\nPorzingis made the following statement, \"It's going to be fun going up against my old team.\"\n\nThen Kyrie stated that he is not scared of the Celtics fans.\n\n\"There's no fear out here, man. It's basketball,\" Irving said. \"The fans are gonna say what they're gonna say.\"\n\nAs both players didn't fit with their previous teams, after finding their new homes, they have certainly flourished and will be counted on by their teammates in order to win their respective organizations a title.\n\nEspecially Kyrie who has by far the most playoff experience on a young Mavs team that has only made it passed the first round one time since their last '11 championship. Notably, this is Kyrie's fourth NBA championship appearance, as he memorably won the 2016 Finals with the Cleveland Cavaliers. To point out, Kyrie ranks eighth all-time for highest points per game in NBA Finals history (27.7 ppg).\n\nThen when looking at Kyrie's backcourt partner, Luka Doncic, the Slovenian is hoping to follow in his old teammate Nowitzki's footsteps, in bringing a championship to Dallas. Seemingly, Luka is the best player in the series, as he leads the Mavericks in almost every statistical category. To emphasize, the 25-year-old superstar had the highest usage rating (35.9%) out of any player this season and went on to win the 2023-24 NBA scoring title, averaging 33.9 points (48.7% FG; 38.2% 3P), 9.2 rebounds, and 9.8 assists.\n\nThe supporting cast for the Mavs features two pieces, Daniel Gafford and PJ Washington, both of which were acquired ahead of the NBA trade deadline. Gafford, the former Washington Wizards center, is averaging 9.2 points, 5.9 rebounds and 1.8 blocks (team-leader) in 21.8 minutes per game in the playoffs. Throughout the postseason, Washington, the former Charlotte Hornets player, is currently averaging 13.6 points, 6.7 rebounds in 36.5 minutes per game.\n\nThe Celtics' top scorers throughout the postseason have been Jayson Tatum (26.0 ppg; 44.2% FG) and Jaylen Brown (25.0 ppg; 54.1% FG), but the team has an arsenal of weapons surrounding the two co-stars. Meaning to say, Boston's supporting cast has a big three of their own that includes Derrick White (17.8 ppg), Jrue Holiday (12.7 ppg), and Porzingis (returning from calf injury), who can all impact the game on both the offense and defensive side of the ball.\n\nTatum, is leading his team in three major stat categories this postseason with 26.0 points, 10.4 rebounds, 5.9 assists. The 26-year-old will hope to improve on his 2022 Finals performance in which he averaged 21.5 ppg on 36.7% FG shooting.\n\nWhen looking at the underdogs and their chances, head coach Jason Kidd, who was on the 2011 Mavericks team that won the championship, said the team will rely on their star players.\n\n\"Some of us for the Mavs have been here, some of us haven't... We're going to embrace that and find a way to hopefully win a series.\"\n\nKyrie Irving, who is the veteran leader of the Mavs, will be going up against his one-time teammates in Tatum and Brown, and will without a doubt hear an array of boos as he goes back to play at Boston's TD Garden for Game 1 which will tip-off June 6 at 8:30 pm ET.", "source": {"uri": "fanbuzz.com", "dataType": "news",

Although, even with a clean slate and improved roster working to Boston's advantage, those who experienced the anguish of watching TD Garden host a champagne/confetti-filled Warriors celebration in 2022, haven't forgotten the heartbreak and disappointment.\n\n\"I've watched (the 2022 Finals) a few times now, maybe four or five times. As well as last year's (Eastern) conference finals,\" Jaylen Brown revealed during Wednesday's Finals media day at TD Garden. \"I think you can always learn from anything really. But just being able to watch those moments and learn from them, how to manage your emotions, like, what you would have did differently potentially. I don't think that's bad to look at and acknowledge and be aware of.\"\n\nBoston held a 2-1 series lead over Golden State, closer than the team had been in raising Banner 18 in over a decade, but crumbled. The inexperience a jitters of performing on the highest stage against a dynasty sunk the Celtics and allowed the Warriors to put them away in six games.\n\nSince that series, it's felt like a long road to returning.\n\nThe chance at a second consecutive trip was there for the taking last season as Boston drew a favorable opponent in the No. 8 seed Heat in the conference finals. But, once again, the lack of urgency, hunger, and non-existent killer instinct backfired on the then-nonchalant Celtics, prompting some much-needed roster reconstruction during the offseason.\n\nMarcus Smart and Robert Williams III, who both partook in the 2022 Finals run, packed their bags and departed Boston as the team's sacrificial lambs.\n\n\"I give a lot of credit to that team, the Warriors,\" Tatum said when looking back. \"I think we understood what it took to get there. They understood what it took to get over the hump. That was really a special team that didn't make many mistakes, obviously well-coached.\"\n\nTatum added: \"I told myself that if I ever got the opportunity again to make it to the Finals, never take it for granted. Obviously, we're here now. Thankful to be here. I'm excited to get ready to play and have fun tomorrow.\"\n\nAt every opportunity leading up to the Finals, the Celtics have played the part of a team on the hunt for vengeance. They held on tight to their No. 1 seed after ripping it from the Sixers on Nov. 14, and didn't cough it up until the end of the regular season. Boston didn't lose more than twice consecutively, and that trend has extended to the postseason.

He announced his commitment to re-sign with the organization only to turn his back and flee in free agency. He then met the relentless boos of Celtics fans in his returns to Boston by flipping the bird and mocking them.\n\nBut Irving's actions aren't new to the Boston fan base. In fact, the talented guard is just the latest in a long list of villains to face the Celtics on the NBA's grandest stage.\n\nAnd while Irving might play the role of Celtics villain better than anyone, these players -- many of them who wore Los Angeles Lakers jerseys -- also stood out for drawing the ire of the fans in the Finals.\n\nDraymond Green\n\nThe Golden State Warriors forward knows how to rile up a fan base and he did that two years ago against the Celtics. Green became a target for Celtics fans when he got in a dust up with Jaylen Brown in Game 2.\n\nWhen the Warriors traveled to Boston as the series continued, Green got an earful from Celtics fans, including his name being included in expletive-filled chants. Green didn't back down after that and only seemed to be fueled by fans' hatred of him.\n\nGreen and the Warriors got the last laugh with Golden State securing an NBA title on the famed parquet floor in Game 6. Green, an able and willing trash talker, left Celtics fans know how he felt as a parting gift.\n\nRalph Sampson\n\nSampson became a mortal enemy in Game 5 of the 1986 Finals when he threw a right hook at Celtics guard Jerry Sichting. The fight was the definition of Sampson not picking on someone his own size. At 7-foot-4, the Hall of Fame center decided to go after the 6-foot-1 Sichting in the second quarter before taking on every other member of the Celtics on the floor at that moment.\n\n\"I don't know why he hit me. What could I do? I threw a couple of elbows, and then he was punching everybody,\" Sichting told reporters after the game, per The Los Angeles Times.\n\nThe Rockets went on to win the game even after Sampson was ejected -- Sichting remained in the game. Sampson got a nasty welcome back in Boston for Game 6 with fans in the stands hanging a Sampson mannequin by a noose.\n\nPat Riley\n\nRiley was the constant figure on the sidelines for the three legendary Finals battles between the Lakers and Celtics in the 1980s. He was one of the main faces of the Showtime Lakers with his slick back hair and fancy suits, which seemed to stand for everything the lunch-pail Celtics of that time were not.\n\nBoston's mystique seemed to get Riley, too. According to The Boston Globe's Dan Shaughnessy, Riley moved the Lakers to three different hotels during the 1984 series to get away from rowdy Boston fans.\n\nRiley's hatred for the Celtics seemed to ooze out of him even well after taking two out of those three Finals matchups. He exchanged heated words with then-Celtics president of basketball operations Danny Ainge in 2013 after Ainge complained about how LeBron James was officiated.\n\n\"Danny Ainge needs to shut the (expletive) up and manage his own team,\" Riley said in a statement, per ESPN. \"He was the biggest whiner going when he was playing and I know that because I coached against him.\"\n\nWilt Chamberlain\n\nIt was a clash of styles between Chamberlain's all-around individual greatness and Bill Russell's team-first mentality. Russell only lost one playoff series in his career against Chamberlain and beat Chamberlain twice in the Finals, including going out in style in 1969.\n\nIt was easy to root against Chamberlain, especially with him struggling continuously against the Celtics and Russell.\n\nThere's a reason the Finals MVP award is named after Russell and not Chamberlain.\n\nMetta World Peace\n\nThere had to be someone on this list from the two Finals showdown the Celtics had with the Lakers this century. Peace, formerly known as Ron Artest, fit the billing of the Lakers villain. His physical style of play, especially on the defensive end, seemed to always tip-toe staying on the line and had Celtics fans watching his every move.\n\nPrior to joining the Lakers, Peace had a run-in with Paul Pierce while a member of the Indiana Pacers. He tried to slow Pierce down by pulling down Pierce's shorts, but the tactic ultimately failed with Pierce hitting a 3-pointer on the play.\n\nIt always hurts that Peace, not Kobe Bryant, made the biggest shot of Game 7 of the 2010 Finals by sinking a 3-pointer with a minute left.\n\nMoses Malone\n\nMalone thought it was a wise decision to unleash some trash talk prior to Game 5 of the 1981 Finals. Bad decision.\n\n\"I could get four guys off the street in Petersburg (Virginia, Malone's hometown) and beat them,\" Malone said.\n\nThe Celtics responded by handling Malone and the Rockets as Boston won the next two games after Malone's remarks to close out the series. According to Celtics great Cedric Maxwell, he and his teammates taunted Malone on the floor for his comments, telling the Hall of Famer he \"better go get them other four guys, because they have to be better than the four you have right now.\"\n\nMalone really should have been more careful with what he said in that moment and it completely backfired on him.", "source": {"uri": "nesn.com",

Well ...\n\nLast week, the four-letter network made waves by reigniting a long-dormant debate about Tatum and Brown's relationship. Only there is no debate. Tatum and Brown are fine. Always have been. They have known each other since high school, when they competed at an Under Armour camp. They are, as Brown noted last week, \"polar opposites.\" But whenever the trade rumors swirled around Brown over the years, Tatum has backed him. When Tatum won a gold medal at the 2021 Olympics, Brown celebrated with him. In '22, while reporting a Sports Illustrated cover story on the Boston Celtics, I asked Tatum's longtime trainer, Drew Hanlen, if he had any thoughts on the Tatum-Brown relationship.\n\n\"Jayson brags about how good Jaylen is,\" Hanlen told me. \"How there aren't many players he would trade straight up for him. Any narrative that they didn't like each other, that they can't win together is totally made up.\"\n\nIndeed, they can win together. Boston has made six conference finals in the Tatum-Brown era. Two NBA Finals. Four seasons of 50-plus wins. In a league that covets elite two-way wings, the Celtics have a pair of them.\n\nStill, Boston's duo has reached a critical juncture. The 2022 Finals defeat was disappointing. But, in a way, excusable. The Golden State Warriors were elite. They had championship-level talent and years of experience with it. Did the Celtics gag away a potential 3-1 series lead in Game 4? Maybe. More accurate would be Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and the Warriors went out and took it.\n\n\"This time, this go-around is a lot different,\" Tatum said. \"You don't always get a second chance, so really just looking at it as a second chance and trying to simplify things as much as we can.\"\n\nAdded Al Horford, \"The first time [in 2022], it felt like a roller coaster, just a lot going on, increased coverage in media, all the responsibilities we had and everything that came with it. This time around, we all have an understanding. We know what things are like and I feel like we'll be able to manage it better.\"\n\nThis year, there are no Warriors. The Dallas Mavericks are good. They have Luka Doncic, a superstar. Kyrie Irving, a premiere wingman. P.J. Washington, Dereck Lively II and Derrick Jones Jr. can play. The defense has improved considerably since midseason acquisitions to acquire Washington and Daniel Gafford. While the Celtics were cruising through the Miami Heat, Cleveland Cavaliers and Indiana Pacers, the Mavericks were muscling out the Los Angeles Clippers, Oklahoma City Thunder and Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nStill, the Celtics are heavy favorites. They are six deep with All-Star-level talent. Jrue Holiday and Derrick White are elite defenders. Kristaps Porzingis, who appears to be tracking toward a Game 1 return, is a terror on both ends of the floor. Horford, who celebrated his 38th birthday on Monday, is ageless.\n\nAnd they have Tatum and Brown. This has not been a flawless postseason run. There have been some clunkers. Tatum's 7-for-17 performance in a Game 2 loss to Cleveland. Brown's 0-for-6 three-point stat line in the same game. But the Celtics are 12-2 in the playoffs, with Tatum (26.0 points on 44.2% shooting) and Brown (25.0 points, 54.1% shooting) leading the way.\n\nNow, though, comes the real test. The scrutiny of Tatum and Brown's relationship is unfair. \"The whole thing about that really pisses me off,\" coach Joe Mazzulla said. Raising expectations for their play is not. Curry and Thompson won't be remembered for conference championships. Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray aren't defined by 50-win seasons. If Tatum and Brown want to be regarded as an elite duo, they need to win a title.\n\nFor years, Tatum has been among the NBA's most scrutinized stars. He's a great scorer ... just not always in the clutch. He's a strong defender ... just not one of the best. Even as Tatum's game has grown -- in the post, at the rim, in his playmaking -- he's often viewed as a cut below the NBA's best.\n\nBrown, too. Brown signed the richest contract in NBA history last summer. He responded with a season (23.0 points, 5.5 rebounds, a career-best 3.6 assists) worthy of it. In Boston, Brown will always be the second star. But that doesn't mean he can't be one of the best wings in the game.\n\n\"As long as my team knows my value, my city knows my value, my family, that's all I really care about,\" Brown said. \"But I like to set my hat on just being a versatile two-way wing [who] can do both at any point in time.\"\n\nTatum and Brown understand the stakes. A series win springboards them into rarified air, a tandem with a title, and a chance to win more. A loss opens them up for criticism and more questions about whether the pairing really works.\n\n\"I think [it's unfair] being compared to each other,\" Mazzulla said. \"They're different. And you see other duos around the league don't have to go through that. And it's because of the platform that they have. It's because they've been so successful their entire careers. They've been able to long stand success at a high level.\"\n\nNow it's time to do it at the highest. Two years ago, in the immediate aftermath of a Game 6 loss, Tatum slumped in his locker. In TD Garden, the visiting locker room is directly across from the home one, making the roar of the Warriors' celebration unavoidable. Walking to his car that night, Tatum could hear the Champagne-soaked afterparty still raging. He vowed never to forget that feeling. He swore he would never let an opportunity like that slip away again. Two years later, Tatum, still alongside Brown, will get that chance.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_mannix@si.com",

The top-seeded Celtics steamrolled their way through the Miami Heat, Cleveland Cavaliers and Pacers while losing a combined two games and now have their sights set on the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nLuka Don\u010di\u0107, Kyrie Irving and Co. will be a more daunting challenge than the shorthanded teams the Celtics dispatched of in the Eastern Conference playoffs.\n\nBut Boston finished with the best record in the NBA for a reason, and it has home-court advantage in the Finals as a result.\n\nThe chanting from opposing fans hasn't worked to this point.

The Mavs went up 3-0, including two very closely contested games to start the series, before dropping a 105-100 decision to the T-Wolves in Game 4. They left no doubt in Game 5, torching Minnesota out of the playoffs by 21 points.\n\nAs expected, the two man show of Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving carried the Mavs most of the way through the series. Doncic averaged 32.4 points, 9.6 rebounds, and 8.2 assists per game, which is just wild to type out for a stat line in the conference finals. Irving had a great series as well, chipping in 27.0 points, 3.6 rebounds, and 4.6 assists per game. We did not actually see OMax Prosper on the floor in this series, as he picked up an ankle injury in practice during the first round and has not played since.\n\nI feel like we won't see Prosper in the Finals, but who's to say what head coach Jason Kidd is thinking?\n\nDallas will be matched up against the Boston Celtics in the Finals. The C's were the #1 team in the entire NBA this season at 64-18 in the regular season, and they've barely been challenged in the playoffs. They won their first two rounds in five games and then swept the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals. That series was not without its drama, but it still ended in four games.\n\nJayson Tatum came away as the leading scorer in four games against the Pacers, beating out Jaylen Brown, 30.3 points to 29.8 points per game. Tatum averaged a double-double with 10.3 rebounds, and he just barely lost out to Derrick White for the team high in assists, 6.5 to 6.3. Boston goes a little bit deeper in who's carrying the workload than Dallas does, or at least they did in the Conference Finals. Both Jrue Holliday and Derrick White averaged north of 16 points per game while Doncic and Irving were the only Mavericks to clear that hurdle against Minnesota.", "source": {"uri": "anonymouseagle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anonymous Eagle"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brewtown_andy@anonymouseagle.com", "name": "Brewtown Andy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquette_Golden_Eagles_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marquette Golden Eagles men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kidd", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jason Kidd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Gaming", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Gaming", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Murder-Mystery_and_Deduction", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Murder-Mystery and Deduction", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jDoZ89vTjJe-1pWyYsvwwaeBGY8=/0x0:4797x2399/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25479764/2043998524.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

I wish we would have won,\" Tatum said Wednesday. \"But I'm a firm believer that everything happens for a reason. There's a lesson to be learned in every situation.\n\n\"I do feel a lot different this time. I'm excited for the opportunity for us to get the job done. I told myself if I ever got the opportunity again to make it to the finals, never take it for granted. We're here now and I'm excited to get ready to play and have fun.\"\n\nBrown said he has watched the 2022 finals several times to learn how to better manage his emotions and to make better decisions on the court.\n\n\"You learn and grow from your experiences,\" Brown said. \"Two years later makes a pretty big difference.\n\n\"This is a special group. The core group has been here for a few years now. We've been able to go through experiences, having success but not having success at the same time.\n\n\"The ultimate goal is to get over the hump and win. I think that will add a lot to our legacy as a team, but as of right now, that story is still kind of untold.\"\n\nAnother factor is that the Celtics seek an unprecedented 18th NBA crown, one more than the all-time record they share with the rival Los Angeles Lakers.\n\n\"Some of the greatest players to ever play this game wore this uniform. We're honored to follow in their footsteps. They paved the way for us to live out our dreams,\" said Tatum.\n\n\"If you want to be one of the greats to put on this uniform, every great before you won a championship. It takes special players to be part of an environment like that.\"\n\nOne of those is Jrue Holiday, who won a 2021 NBA title with Milwaukee and was obtained in a trade deal just before the season began.\n\n\"To be a part of history would be cool, the history the Celtics have,\" Holiday said. \"To add to that is part of the reason I was brought here -- and part of the reason I wanted to come.\"\n\n- 'The will to win' -\n\nThe defensive standout sees something special in the Celtics, who led the NBA with 64 wins this season.\n\n\"The pressure JB and JT have to take on is something different,\" Holiday said. \"It's really impressive how they handle themselves.\n\n\"I know sometimes talent doesn't mesh together but this does. You saw it in the regular season. You've seen it in the playoffs. Any given night we sacrifice for each other. we're unselfish and I think that's what makes it go.\"\n\n\"And then it's just the will to win. They've been to the Eastern Conference finals a million times and they have been to the finals so they've been to the top, just didn't execute the way they wanted.\n\n\"Now that we're here, we want to get the job done.\"\n\nTatum appreciates the finals more after losing to Miami in seven games in last year's East finals.\n\n\"Last year we took that for granted and we didn't make it to the finals. Put things in prespective,\" Tatum said.\n\n\"You could see our excitement when we won the conference (this year). That's not the be-all, end-all but it really is tough to get to this moment.\n\n\"I'm staying in the moment. I'm not thinking of what this would mean to my legacy or anything like that.

And it's a finals series that has all of the ingredients of a blockbuster.\n\nThe Beast of the East meets the Best of the West and there has never been a dueling duo that is so much different and so much alike. Different because sixth place Dallas is going up against top-seed Boston in a storyline similar to rich, privileged kid meeting struggling, self-made man.\n\nBut not really, because before getting to wear an armor of seeming invincibility, Boston had shed tears and had its heart broken, too many times before. And Dallas had conquered the playoffs because it made the best roster-building decisions of its life since drafting Luka Doncic in 2018 by adding Kyrie Irving, Dereck Lively, Grant Williams and Derrick Jones, Jr.\n\nThe two teams are alike in more ways than one. Both have the stars, both have young coaches. Both have played the waiting game too long. The Dallas Mavericks last won their one and only NBA championship in 2011. The 17-going-on-18 Boston Celtics last wore a ring in 2008.\n\nNow the stars have aligned and the waters have parted and these two long-suffering teams are ready and eager to raise another banner to their rafters. It is time.\n\nWill the Boston Celtics continue their season-long dominance in the series? Will the Dallas Mavericks pull off a surprise and negate the luck of the Irish in this one?\n\nSo many factors to consider, but here's one. It's going to be a Battle of Best Duos. Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving versus The Jays of Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum. But wait, there's a third J named Jrue Holiday.\n\nAdmittedly, the two-headed monster that is Luka and Kyrie will be a problem for the Celtics. When they're on, they're on and both Luka and his new pardner always find a way to score, somehow or other.\n\nThe Mavs are also excellent rim protectors. And the Celtics are elite 3-point shooters. When the Celtics' threes come pouring in, the rim may lose its protection, and the Green cavalry can come charging in. Boston's offense is hard to stop when all five men are locked in. The dynamics in this aspect of the game will be an interesting thing to watch.\n\nGoing back to the Duo scenario, did you know that championships past have been won on the shoulders of star duos? Shaq and Kobe for the Lakers, LeBron and Dwayne Wade for Miami. Steph Curry and Klay Thompson for GSW. MJ and Scottie Pippen for the 90s Chicago Bulls.\n\nSo many things to watch out for in this kaleidoscopic match-up. Like who's good enough on the Celtics' side to guard Luka and Kyrie and keep their production low? What's the Mavs' formula for eluding or crushing the vaunted Celtics defense? In turn, what kind of defense will the Mavs concoct to stop the Celtics' fluid offense?\n\nSo many scenarios that are just as good to watch on the side. What will Kyrie's new adventure in the Garden be? Everybody seems to have grown up since the days when Uncle Drew burned sage, stomped on Lucky on the Celtics' logo and did a smooth but not so subtle raising of two dirty fingers behind the back of his head at the Garden crown. Kyrie has acknowledged that his past TD Garden moment was regrettable -- \"wasn't a great reflection of himself.\" But the Boston faithful don't forgive easy. And they never forget.\n\nBrian Martin of NBA.com says there are eight things that the Celtics have in common with other past champions. They are: a star duo, elite offense, elite defense, scoring more points than they allow their opponents, three-point shooting prowess, two all-defensive guards, 75+ wins and 20 or fewer losses in the season, and the privilege and luxury of being well-rested.\n\nLook, the 2023 Denver Nuggets had nine days off last year before they played their NBA finals series. As did the Golden State Warriors in 2017.\n\nThe Boston Celtics were 2-1 in the playoffs when they were on exactly 9 days of rest, all-time, says StatMuse.\n\nIf the stats hold true, we can all raise a cup of joe to the coach, Mazzula. And Boston's rafters will finally have that No. 18 hanging up there along with the rest.\n\nIn the end though, the basketball gods decide. Luka and Kyrie can ride off beaming into the sunset. Or the three Jays plus 'Old Man\" Al, Derrick White, the comebacking Kristaps Porzingis and the rest of the crew will be grinning from ear to ear.", "source": {"uri": "businessmirror.com.ph",

In the 2022 NBA Finals against the Golden State Warriors, JT shrank under the pressure only averaging 21 points, seven assists, and seven rebounds on a measly 37% shooting from the field. These games were marked by either Tatum getting off to ridiculously slow starts or trying to do everything himself and forcing the issue. Neither version of the star forward will win a championship.\n\nJayson Tatum is having a tremendous playoff run thus far no matter what media pundits and casual fans will say to discredit his performance. Through all three rounds, he is leading the team in points, rebounds, and assists becoming the first player to do this since 2018 LeBron James. He is averaging 26 points, 10.4 rebounds, and 5.9 assists on 44% shooting. The only notable improvement comes from him needing to knock down the three more efficiently as 29% is not ideal. However, in turns of complete play, this has been his best playoff stint to date.\n\nWhen the lights are brightest will the wing fold or win gold?\n\nA story as old as time when the Boston Celtics played drop coverage against the Golden State Warriors back in 2022 and regretted it deeply because of how Stephen Curry dominated. In these playoffs, under Joe Mazzulla, the Celtics have kept playing drop coverage throughout to mixed success. He's been willing to live with getting burned in the mid-range by opposing teams, but there is a difference in the type of opponents now.\n\nRound one saw guards like Tyler Herro, and Delon Wright so it worked pretty well. Round two saw an injured Donovan Mitchell and the inconsistency of Darius Garland and Caris LeVert. The Eastern Conference Finals saw Tyrese Haliburton thrive before getting injured and Andrew Nembhard absolutely cook in those moments. The difference is on the other end, the Celtics were always able to dominate the perimeter with these teams and get timely stops when they needed to in order to win.\n\nAgainst the Dallas Mavericks, doing a drop coverage against two mid-range maestros would prove disastrous for the Boston Celtics. Kyrie Irving and Luka Doncic may very well be the most dangerous offensive backcourt the game has ever seen.\n\nIn the 2022 Finals, the Celtics bench went into ghost mode providing no depth on the biggest stage. Al Horford will supposably join and lead this second unit. Big Al is in year 17 and this may very well be his last chance to win a ring. The level of urgency for the big man means we are more than likely to count on a legacy game or two in the series. In six games of the 2022 NBA finals, Payton Pritchard averaged three points, two rebounds, and one assist on 30% shooting and did not score in the final three games he played in during the series. Sam Hauser was not a part of the rotation back then and is struggling to replicate his shooting prowess from the regular season.\n\nHauser was signed on to the C's bench to do two things: hit threes and play defense well enough to hold his own. There is no reason he is not fully capable of having a game where four or five threes are netted. We will dub it the Sam Hauser game, and hold it in the same lore as legendary performances of other role players such as Grant Williams, Kelly Olynyk, and Leon Powe.\n\nPritchard has been on a heater recently and should be a top-three bench player in the Finals. He has hit double-digit scoring marks in five of the Celtics 14 playoff games -- they are 4-1 when he scores 10 or more points. It is time to redeem himself from his disappearance in 2022.", "source": {"uri": "hardwoodhoudini.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hardwood Houdini"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Mazzulla", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Mazzulla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Herro", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Herro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darius_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Darius Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delon_Wright", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delon Wright"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donovan_Mitchell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donovan Mitchell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caris_LeVert", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caris LeVert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Powe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leon Powe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Olynyk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kelly Olynyk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payton_Pritchard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Payton Pritchard"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_6810,h_3830,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/18/01hzmrgn9hgx250qwcfx.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

Both Tatum and Brown's offensive prowess overwhelmed the Indiana Pacers. Derrick White's defense and clutch three-point shooting were key for the Celtics' series win. GIVEMESPORT VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\nThe final step prior to the NBA Finals is the Conference Finals. By the time the penultimate round of the NBA Playoffs rolls around, four teams (two in each conference) remain.\n\nBut upon the round's conclusion, the pain sets in for two teams as they realize they made it potentially within a game of reaching the NBA Finals, but ultimately lost. For the other team, euphoria sets in as they officially punch their ticket to the Finals, earning the right to take on the respective club in the mirroring conference that did the same.\n\nA team must possess no shortage of star power to even reach the Conference Finals, let alone win it. And in this year's Eastern Conference Finals, both the Boston Celtics -- the winner -- and the Indiana Pacers -- the loser -- that was surely the case.\n\nThe Celtics defeated the Pacers thanks to said talent, but if not for the Pacers' assortment of talent, they would not have reached this point. The following are the five best performers of the 2024 Eastern Conference Finals.\n\n1 Jaylen Brown Brown's elite performance earned him the series MVP\n\nThe current iteration of the Celtics has been, for the most part, headlined by Jayson Tatum, with Jaylen Brown serving as his 1A. When it mattered most in these playoffs, they both shone, but Brown took his clutch factor to another level, and that earned him the series MVP award over Tatum.\n\nIn the Eastern Conference Finals, which ended up being a four-game sweep, Brown averaged 29.8 points, 5 rebounds, and 3 assists per game. He shot 51.7 percent from the field and 37.0 percent from three-point range.\n\nJaylen Brown - 2024 ECF Stats\n\nPTS\n\n29.8\n\nREB\n\n5.0\n\nAST\n\n3.0\n\nFG%\n\n51.7\n\n3PT%\n\n37.0\n\nBut it was his performance in clutch moments that earned him the series MVP and made him the series' best performer, in addition to his otherworldly offensive stats. In Game 1, he would nail the corner three-point shot that sent the game to overtime, where the Celtics would eventually win it.\n\nThen he doubled down on his team's Game 1 win by putting up 40 points in Game 2, tied for his most ever in a playoff game. Tatum won the inaugural Larry Bird trophy for the Eastern Conference Finals MVP in 2022, and now, it was Brown's elite play that earned him the 2024 iteration of that award.\n\n2 Jayson Tatum Tatum put up offensive numbers that the Pacers could not counter\n\nWhere Brown was, Tatum was right by his side. It has been no secret that Tatum is the centerpiece of this current Celtics squad, which finished miles above any other team in the standings.\n\nBut in the Eastern Conference Finals, Tatum would be his usual self, which is all that is needed for him to automatically be one of the series' best performers. He meshed with Brown perfectly to dominate the Pacers on all ends of offense, averaging a double-double of 30.3 points and 10.3 rebounds per game.\n\nJayson Tatum - 2024 ECF Stats\n\nPTS\n\n30.3\n\nREB\n\n10.3\n\nAST\n\n6.3\n\nFG%\n\n46.3\n\n3PT%\n\n30.6\n\nIn addition to those stats, Tatum averaged 6.3 assists and 3.3 turnovers in the four-game sweep, while shooting 46.3 percent from the field and 30.6 percent from three-point range. Tatum's ability to come up when it matters most was on full display in this series, easily making him one of its top performers.\n\n3 Derrick White White's elite defense and ability to hit clutch threes meshed perfectly\n\nThe Celtics' primary gameplan has become the reliance on splash threes to blow opponents away, and Derrick White brought that ability in addition to elite defense in this series. The All-Defender shot 33.3 percent from the three point range this series, but it would be his huge corner three in Game 4 that would solidify the Celtics' comeback, win, and series sweep.\n\nWhite finished Game 4 with 16 points, which was his average for the series. He also notched five steals and three blocks in that game, becoming the first player to do so in a Conference Finals game since Scottie Pippen.\n\nOverall, White averaged 16.8 points, 4.8 rebounds, and 6.5 assists in the series, while shooting 43.4 percent from the field and the aforementioned 33.3 percent from three-point range. Those numbers, combined with his ability to put them up in clutch moments and towering defense, made White one of the best players in the series.\n\n4 Pascal Siakam Siakam stepped up in the absence of Tyrese Haliburton\n\nDespite the Pacers' series loss, which was a lot closer than a close glance would indicate, Pascal Siakam stepped up as the player they traded for at the Trade Deadline. Tyrese Haliburton, the main star of the team, got hurt after Game 2 and missed the rest of the series, and Siakam did his best to step up in Haliburton's absence.\n\nPascal Siakam - 2024 ECF Stats\n\nPTS\n\n23.3\n\nREB\n\n7.5\n\nAST\n\n4.5\n\nFG%\n\n55.3\n\nHe led the Pacers in offense this series, averaging 23.3 points, 7.5 rebounds, and 4.5 assists per game. He also shot 55.3 percent from the field, continuing the trend of the Pacers' elite shooting.\n\nWhile the series was a four-game sweep, each game was pretty close, with Boston making a late comeback in two instances. That is inexcusable if you're the Pacers, but Siakam did what he could to serve as an offensive threat for the Celtics in Haliburton's absence, earning him a spot on the list.\n\n5 Jrue Holiday Holiday rounded out a dynamic Celtics rotation that pounded the Pacers\n\nThe Celtics had it all in this series: a dynamic offense, pinpoint shooting, and towering defense. Jrue Holiday served as the Celtics' fourth-best player in the Eastern Conference Finals, but thanks to how talented Boston truly is, that still meant that he was one of the series' best performers.\n\nJrue Holiday - 2024 ECF Stats\n\nPTS\n\n18.5\n\nREB\n\n7.3\n\nAST\n\n5.8\n\nFG%\n\n58.7\n\n3PT%\n\n41.7\n\nThe Celtics traded for Holiday in the 2023 offseason with the hopes of bolstering their defense, and he has brought that in addition to offense. In the Eastern Conference Finals, Holiday averaged 18.5 points, 7.3 rebounds, and 5.8 assists per game, while shooting 58.7 percent from the field and 41.7 percent from three-point range.\n\nThose are not bad stats for a fourth player, and a defender at that, and it is why he was easily one of the best performers of the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nRelated Top 5 Performers of the 2024 NBA Western Conference Finals The Western Conference Finals saw multiple players step up on both fronts, but which ones were the best?", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_goal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Field goal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Bird", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Larry Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Pippen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Pippen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Gaming", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Gaming", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Conferences", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Murder-Mystery_and_Deduction", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Murder-Mystery and Deduction", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/nba_top-east-performers.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

It's Game 1 of the 2024 NBA Finals Finals. Can the Mavericks cover the 6.5-point spread as road underdogs? Keep reading for our Mavericks vs. Celtics betting prediction.\n\nThe series is tied 0-0.\n\nThe Dallas Mavericks went 50-32 straight up in the regular season and are 12-5 straight up and 11-6 ATS in the postseason this year. The Mavericks are 59-40 ATS this season.\n\nThe Boston Celtics went 64-18 straight up in the regular season and are 12-2 straight up and 7-7 ATS in the postseason this year. The Celtics are 48-43-5 ATS this season.\n\nMavericks vs. Celtics Public Betting Information\n\nOur NBA Public Betting Information page indicates that 70% of public bettors are currently backing the Mavericks when it comes to the spread. This information is subject to change throughout the day, however, so be sure to check the link so you're receiving the most up-to-date public betting data.\n\nDallas Mavericks Daily Fantasy Spin\n\nMavericks superstar point guard Luka Doncic is probable to play on Thursday night. He's been managing a right knee sprain and left ankle soreness for most of the postseason, but those ailments shouldn't impact his status for Game 1. Doncic should be all systems go.\n\nDallas forward Olivier-Maxence Prosper is questionable to play on Thursday due to an ankle sprain. Prosper averaged 3.0 points per game in 8.4 minutes per contest during the regular season. He's played in 1 playoff game so far this year.\n\nBoston Celtics Daily Fantasy Spin\n\nCeltics forward Kristaps Porzingis is probable for Game 1 against the Mavericks on Thursday night. Porzingis hasn't played since April 29th due to a left calf strain, but he should be good to go for the opening game of the NBA Finals on Thursday.\n\nBoston backup center Luke Kornet is also probable for Thursday's game. He had been dealing with a left wrist sprain, but that shouldn't impact his ability to play in Game 1. With Porzingis back in the lineup Kornet will likely slide back into the third-string center spot behind backup pivot Al Horford.\n\nDallas is an NBA-best 34-16 ATS as the road team this season.\n\nBoth teams should be well-rested for this game. Dallas last played on May 30th while Boston last played on May 27th. That means the Mavericks will be playing on 6 days of rest while the Celtics will tip off Thursday's game after 9 days of rest. While that long layoff may seem to favor Boston, I'm not sure that it does. The Mavs are 10-8 ATS this season when playing with the rest disadvantage. Dallas has also been solid as an underdog all year. The Mavericks are 20-18 ATS as an underdog this season and 14-11 ATS when getting points on the road in 2024.\n\nDallas point guard Luka Doncic is the best player remaining in these playoffs. He's averaging 28.8 points, 9.6 rebounds, 8.8 assists, and 1.6 steals per game across 17 postseason contests this season. He will likely single-handedly win multiple games in this series. Doncic has played in big games his entire life coming up through the European youth basketball system, and I think he'll be ready to play at an elite level on Thursday night. I think Dallas is a live underdog, so I'm taking Luka Doncic, the Mavs, and the points on the road in Game 1.", "source": {"uri": "thespread.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheSpread.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_becker@thespread.com", "name": "Alex Becker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATS_Wheels", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ATS Wheels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mavericks", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprained_ankle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sprained ankle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Kornet", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luke Kornet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.thespread.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Luka-Doncic-Mavericks-3.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-29", "textStart": 1703, "textEnd": 1713}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-30", "textStart": 2260, "textEnd": 2268}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-27", "textStart": 2297, "textEnd": 2305}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

What's equally true, however, is that both team's defenders will play every ounce as vital a role as their leading men.\n\nRead on and we'll show you how to watch NBA Finals 2024 from anywhere in the world with a VPN.\n\nWhat makes this such a fascinating duel is both teams' ridiculous prowess from range. The Celtics ranked as the deadliest 3-point shooters in the regular season, with the Mavericks close behind in third, and the teams have swapped places in the postseason.\n\nAs outstanding as Tatum and Brown were through the Playoffs, the performances of Jokic and Irving were simply out of this world. That said, with Derrick Jones Jr. and P.J. Washington, the Celtics look better-equipped to slow Jokic and Irving down than the Mavericks do Tatum and Brown.\n\nIrving's deeply unhappy stint with the Celtics has been well-documented, and while he seems to have now got most of the ill-feeling out of his system, it remains to be seen if he'll be able to keep his cool with a full TD Garden contingent raining unpleasantries down on him.\n\nHere's everything you need to know to watch NBA Finals 2024 online, plus the full schedule, TV channels and all the live stream information, with or without cable.\n\nIn the U.S., all seven games of the 2024 NBA Finals are set to be shown on both ABC and ESPN3.\n\nIf you've already cut the cord and don't have a cable package, you can get either of the channels through an OTT cable TV alternative.\n\nSling TV is one of the better options. It includes ESPN3 in its Orange plan, with prices starting from $40/month and your first month half-price.\n\nAway from home at the moment and blocked from watching the Celtics vs Mavericks series on your subscriptions?\n\nYou can still watch the NBA Finals live thanks to the wonders of a VPN (Virtual Private Network). The software allows your devices to appear to be back in your home country regardless of where in the world you are. So ideal for hoops fans away on vacation or on business. Our favorite is NordVPN. It's the best on the market:\n\nTo stream TNT Sports, you'll need Discovery Plus -- a combo subscription that allows fans to access TNT Sports, Eurosport and entertainment all in one place.\n\nThe NBA League Pass is another good option, costing from \u00a329.99 for the rest of the season after a 7-day FREE trial.\n\nIf you're not in the U.K. right now, you can still watch an NBA Finals live stream by using one of the best VPN services, such as NordVPN.\n\nTSN has the rights to show 2024 NBA Finals live streams in Canada.\n\nIf you don't have cable, you could subscribe to TSN+ instead, which lets you get access to all TSN has to offer on an $8/month or $80/year subscription basis.\n\nAussies will find NBA Finals live streams on ESPN via Foxtel.\n\nDon't have Foxtel and don't want to subscribe? Specialist streaming service Kayo Sports is also showing the NBA Finals, with its affordable, commitment-free plans starting from just $25/month, and hosting plenty of cricket, AFL, rugby, F1 and loads of other live sports besides.\n\nThere's also a 7-day FREE trial for anybody who hasn't used the service before.\n\nNot in Australia right now? You can simply use a VPN like NordVPN to watch all the action on your Kayo account as if you were back home.", "source": {"uri": "tomsguide.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tom's Guide"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aatif_sulleyman@tomsguide.com", "name": "Aatif Sulleyman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cable television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virtual private network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestreaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Livestreaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN3", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_Jones_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Derrick Jones Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

Despite his impactful play, he did not win the Finals MVP.\n\nJayson Tatum reached the NBA Finals with the Boston Celtics in 2022. Though the Golden State Warriors defeated the Celtics, Tatum's strong performance highlighted his potential as a future Finals MVP contender.\n\nLuka Doncic has yet to appear in the NBA Finals. However, his playoff performances for the Dallas Mavericks suggest that he has the capability to lead his team to the Finals and compete for the MVP award.\n\nThis year, all three players will have a chance to compete for the Finals MVP in the Dallas Mavericks vs. Boston Celtics Finals matchup.

Unsurprisingly, Dallas fans promptly followed suit with \"We want Boston!\" chants of their own.\n\nJudging by how this postseason has gone, they should be careful what they wish for. That's the subject of the hype video the Celtics released ahead of Thursday's Game 1, narrated by legendary New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady.\n\n\"Really? You want Boston? Take it from me: that's a bad idea,\" Brady says. \"The (Heat) culture? History. Cleveland? Done for. ... And Indy? Over with. But us? We're still here. Right now, you're gonna want anyone but Boston.\"\n\nWatch the video below:\n\nDallas presents Boston with by far its toughest test yet in these playoffs, but the Celtics are heavy favorites for a reason. They earned the No. 1 overall seed with a historic 64-18 regular-season record and have lost only two postseason games. They certainly aren't a team fans should \"want\" their team to go up against with a championship on the line.\n\nThe NBA Finals will begin Thursday at TD Garden at 8:30 p.m. ET.

That's kind of cool to see because when you look at Kai and Luka, a lot of times they're not known as our defensive guys.\"\n\nIrving and Doncic scored 36 points apiece in the clincher against the Wolves, both shooting better than 50% and combining to make half their 3-pointers.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe Mavs didn't need double figures from anybody off the bench, and barely from the other starters.\n\nYou might be interested in Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThey can make that formula work, with at least some help.\n\nP.J. Washington Jr. will draw the difficult defensive assignments against Boston co-stars Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. But the midseason acquisition needs to shoot closer to the 47% from 3-point range that he did in the second-round victory over top-seeded Oklahoma City than the 25% he shot against Minnesota.\n\nThe other defense-first starter and key figure in trying to slow Tatum and Brown, Derrick Jones Jr., could provide a boost by matching his 40% shooting from 3 in these playoffs.\n\nThen there's the rim-protecting, pick-and-rolling tandem of centers Daniel Gafford -- the other midseason trade pickup along with Washington -- and rookie Dereck Lively II.\n\nThose two give Dallas an edge over the Celtics, who have a more perimeter-oriented pairing in Kristaps Porzingis and the undersized Al Horford.\n\nBoston also isn't sure what it will get out of Porzingis with the 7-foot-2 Latvian sidelined since the first round by a calf injury.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe Celtics get the edge in late-playoff experience, but not by much.\n\nThey are on a three-year run of reaching the East finals and made the NBA Finals in 2022, losing to Golden State in six games after the Warriors beat Dallas in the West finals.\n\nIrving, however, has the most experience in the series on the NBA's biggest stage, with 13 games in the finals. He ranks eighth among players with at least 10 games with a scoring average of 27.7 points.\n\nDoncic doesn't figure to be spooked by his first NBA Finals. The 25-year-old was playing professionally in Spain a decade ago and was the title-winning EuroLeague MVP days before getting drafted third overall in 2018.\n\nHe also is the reason Slovenia reached the medal round as a first-time Olympic qualifier at the Tokyo Games three years ago.\n\n___\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW", "source": {"uri":

Who has the edge heading into the NBA Finals?", "body": "After a longer than expected break, the NBA Finals is finally on the verge of tipping off and the 2024 Finals could be the most high-profile finals since the Golden State Warriors run in the late 2010's.\n\nWhy? Because unlike last year's Finals between the Nuggets and Heat, there's a lot more starpower between both the Mavericks and Celtics.\n\nThe storylines are lot juicier, too, with Kyrie Irving and Boston big man Kristaps Porzingis facing their former teams on the biggest stage.\n\nThen there's the battle between Luka Doncic and Jayson Tatum, two of the game's brightest superstars who are entering their primes and trying to stake their claim as the best player in the world. On paper, both teams have reasons to feel confident, but who really has the edge?\n\nBreakdown: Just one of the many high-profile individual battles this series, Doncic and Holiday are two of the best at what they do. Doncic is arguably the most lethal scorer in the game and one of the best playoff performers the NBA has had despite him only being 25 years old. In four playoff runs, Doncic is averaging over 30 points per game and this postseason he's picked apart Minnesota's No. 1-rated defense, the No. 1 seed Oklahoma City Thunder and future Hall of Famers Paul George, Kawhi Leonard and James Harden.\n\nBelieve it or not Doncic's averages this postseason (28.8 points, 9.6 rebounds, 8.8 assists) are slightly below his standards. As crazy as it sounds, that's just how dominant Doncic has been in the postseason. On the flip side Holiday had a case as being the league's top perimeter defender for nearly half a decade with a length run of NBA All-Defense selections. One reason the Celtics are back in the finals is the fact they acquired Holiday from rival Milwaukee this off-season.\n\nHoliday was also a catalyst in the Bucks championship run in 2021. Holiday's numbers (12.7 points, 5.6 rebounds, 4.6 assist) are modest compared to Doncic's, but Holiday's the fourth or fifth option for the Celtics and is primarily there for his defense and intangibles, which he has plenty of. There's really no achetype to slow down Doncic, but Holiday might be the closet to it as he has a similar stature to OKC forward Lu Dort, the only defender that's been able to bother Doncic this postseason.\n\nHoliday has enough of an offensive game to where Doncic will have to be engaged defensively the entire series, but this is still the type of matchup Doncic lives for.\n\nBreakdown: Irving will have his hands full when he goes up against White, maybe the most underrated player in the NBA. Irving is a superstar talent that can heat up at any moment and is one of the best closers in the NBA when the fourth quarter arrives. Irving has been up and down throughout the playoffs as his scoring average has gone from 25.6 in the regular season to 22.8 in the postseason as defenses have thrown more double teams at him.\n\nWhite saw his numbers take a step up as his offensive usage increased with Porzingis out of the lineup most of the playoffs. White averaged 15.2 points in the regular and is up to 17.8 points while knocking down 40 percent of his 3-pointers. White has been selected All-Defense two straight seasons and will have a slight size advantage over Irving. Boston will try to use White to wear down Irving on defense as well by running him through screens to get him open looks from deep and White is capable of finishing in the paint.\n\nOn paper, most would say this matchup heavily favors Dallas, but it could be a lot closer than you think.\n\nWings\n\nJaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum vs. P.J. Washington and Derrick Jones Jr.\n\nBreakdown: Two superstar forwards vs. two forwards that just arrived in Dallas this past season. This is the matchup where the Finals could be won or lost for Dallas. Tatum and Brown have arguably been the best duo in the NBA since Tatum joined the franchise in 2017. Boston has had deep playoff run after deep playoff thanks to the brilliance of both. Tatum is a top-10 player in the league while Brown is one of the highest paid and a multi-time all-star.\n\nBoth have great size, athleticism and are three-level scoring threats. Tatum joined Doncic as one of the only players in NBA history to lead to their team in points, rebounds and assists in a playoff series. Tatum is averaging 26.0 points, 10.4 rebounds and 5.9 assists. Brown was voted MVP of the Eastern Conference finals and is averaging 25.0 abd 6.2 rebounds this postseason. Both are also upper echelon defenders on the wing and will likely guard Doncic and Irving at some point.\n\nOn the flip side Washington and Jones have fully embraced their roles this postseason. Washington's provided toughness, rebounding and spacing with his consistency knocking down corner 3s. The same can be said for White, who has guarded the opposing team's best perimeter scorers while also being a factor in transition and knocking 39.6 percent of his 3s. Jones will likely start on Brown with Washington getting a crack at Tatum.\n\nIf either is able to slow their matchup down, then it'll make things easier for Dallas.\n\nBigs\n\nKristaps Porzingis and Al Horford vs. Daniel Gafford and Dereck Lively II\n\nBreakdown: Lively and Gafford have also been a big reason the Mavericks have advanced this far in the playoffs. The pairing bullied Oklahoma City's smaller frontline and mostly outperformed Minnesota's expensive core of bigs in the Western Conference finals. Gafford is the older veteran that starts the game while Lively is the talented rookie that comes off the bench and has been able to be a sparkplug with his athleticism on both ends of the floor.\n\nBoth have thrived with Irving and Doncic as lob threats while also being quality rim protectors on defense. However, the Celtics frontline will test Dallas in a different way as both Horford and Porzingis do plenty of their damage away from the basket. Horford and Porzingis combine to average over 11 3-point attempts per game and knock roughly 37 percent. Porzingis can also do damage inside, but it's fair to wonder how he'll look after missing the last two rounds of the playoffs with a calf injury.\n\nIf Porzingis is healthy, the edge likely goes to Boston, but if he's rusty then this could be another series for Lively in particular to make an impact.\n\nBench\n\nLively, Maxi Kleber, Josh Green, Jaden Hardy, Tim Hardaway Jr., Dante Exum vs. Horford, Payton Pritchard, Sam Hauser\n\nBreakdown: The Mavericks have the edge with the reserves as Jason Kidd has been able to find valuable minutes from almost every member on the bench. Boston's bench will get a boost with Horford returning to the unit after starting for Porzingis, but Dallas' bench is still younger and more versatile. Hardy has found a groove as a secondary scorer and ballhandler while Green and Exum have provided some sparks on the wing.\n\nHardaway has yet to catch fire this postseason, but averaged 14.4 points per game during the regular season. While Dallas should confident in its reserve, it's important to remember that bench play will only impact the series so much. These are role players and the the trophy will ultimately be decided by which stars shine the brightest between Doncic, Tatum, Brown and Irving.", "source": {"uri": "kansascity.com", "dataType":

For Jayson Tatum, this series is a chance to win a first championship ring as a professional and deliver Boston a coveted 18th banner. And though it would be a massive step forward in his career, Tatum is already on a special trajectory regardless of the outcome.\n\nThe NBA's current guard is getting ready to exit stage left, and soon players like LeBron James, Steph Curry, and Kevin Durant will retire. Already debates concerning the next \"face of the league\" have swirled as people begin to imagine a new hierarchy of NBA stardom. Media and fans alike pore over advanced analytics and squeeze every data point to support their position with bared teeth and steely resolve. With the hot take economy churning like never before, every statistic, every award, and every game seems to be a referendum on a player's status in that pecking order.\n\nBut this sort of analysis misses the point of what it really means to be the brightest star in the NBA galaxy. Superstardom is about much more than personal accolades or getting buckets. Take a step back and it becomes clear. This is Jayson Tatum's league now.\n\nYes, to be the biggest name in the NBA, a player does have to be among the very best on the hardwood. The 26-year old Tatum is only now stepping into his prime, but has already authored a nearly unimpeachable resume.\n\nIn 2024 Tatum was named to the All-NBA First Team for a third consecutive season, and he's been an All-Star for five straight years. Since becoming the focal point of the Celtics scoring effort, he's been one of the NBA's most prolific offensive weapons in the league while becoming a very effective defender, too.\n\nSure, Tatum hasn't yet won an MVP award. But he has been firmly in the mix each of the past few years. In 2024 he finished fifth place in voting. He was thirrd in 2023 and sixth in 2022. Statistically only Nikola Jokic, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and Joel Embiid have been in the heart of the MVP conversation this decade as consistently as Tatum.\n\nRegardless of individual accolades, Tatum is one of the most productive stars in the league. This year he piloted his Celtics to 64 wins and a No. 1 seed, earning his fifth trip to the Eastern Conference finals in seven seasons as a pro. Thus far during the 2024 playoffs, he has led Boston in points, rebounds, and assists.\n\nTatum's high level of play is the engine behind his superstardom. Heading into the 2024 finals, he has played in 80 postseason games, the highest number of any NBA player this decade. Besides his teammate Jaylen Brown, the next closest player is Bam Adebayo of the Miami Heat with 69 games played.\n\nNot only has he already been to more conference finals than 11 NBA franchises, Tatum has never missed a playoff game in his career. Load management be damned, when you tune into a Celtics game, Tatum shows up as advertised.\n\nApr 11, 2024; Boston, Massachusetts, USA; Boston Celtics forward Jayson Tatum (0) signs an autograph for a fan prior to a game against the New York Knicks at TD Garden. Mandatory Credit: Bob DeChiara-USA TODAY Sports\n\nIf Tatum wins a title or MVP in the next few seasons, his status as generational star will only grow, although the debate around specific awards and accomplishments will continue. Even if he isn't the single best player in the league, his knack for success has allowed him to take the NBA centerstage again and again. It's a feedback loop, where winning begets more exposure.\n\nWhat this means is that Tatum is incredibly visible to even casual fans. And the league understands he is an attractive star. Boston has the 11th biggest market in the NBA, but has had more nationally televised regular season games than any team in the league in the last few years save the Golden State Warriors and the Los Angeles Lakers. Playing in a second finals in three seasons doesn't hurt either.\n\nTatum has proven himself to be one of the best players in the league, and he and the Celtics are consistently on national television as a result. This alone doesn't always lead to superstardom, however. Tim Duncan is a good example of a generational great who was indifferent to the spotlight. Some guys don't become cultural icons, even if they are the best players on the court. But Tatum has thrived under the bright lights and what comes with. Just ask the NBA's biggest partners.\n\nMarketability and visibility are the key to becoming the true face of a brand as big as the NBA, and Tatum is everywhere when it comes to league sponsorships. More importantly, these partners proactively try to work with the St. Louis native.\n\nAfter SoFi inked a deal to become the official banking service of the NBA, they specifically sought out Tatum as their chosen spokesperson. SoFi told CelticsWire they appreciated Tatum's style and charisma, and how easy he was to work with. He had a reputation as a reliable, effective star for promoting their brand.\n\nThis is a common theme among the NBA's biggest partners. For example, Tatum is one of five players who will be featured in an upcoming Netflix documentary about the Association. He recently graced the cover of NBA 2K's mobile edition, and he's reportedly already developing a third signature shoe with Jordan Brand. The league's most important corporate constituents love Tatum.\n\nPlayers Tatum's age jostling for the status as the NBA's biggest star have their own endorsement deals, too. Most professional athletes do, after all. But Tatum's portfolio of commercials and partnerships is hard to top, and it's difficult to find an area where Tatum hasn't proven to be a marketable star.\n\nImportantly, he isn't just an individual spokesperson. Brand's often put him alongside league's signature stars. Tatum is in commercials for Ruffles chips alongside LeBron James. He does Subway ads with Steph Curry. He helps sell Gatorade with Michael Jordan and Caitlin Clark.\n\nTatum also has appeal across sports leagues. Earlier this year Fanatics and Make-A-Wish paired Tatum with MLB star Aaron Judge and NFL legend Tom Brady. The company Tatum keeps when doing promotional work is unrivaled for his peer group, and another measure of how he is regarded by cultural tastemakers.\n\nThe NBA is an entertainment product at the end of the day. So it's not enough to just show up in a bunch of commercials. Consumers have to have a positive reaction to all of that visibility.\n\nOrdinary fans have indeed responded, and they themselves can't get enough of the former Duke Blue Devil. In 2024, Tatum was third in the entire NBA in jersey sales behind only James and Curry. He was third last year as well, and has been in the top five every season since 2020. Only James and Curry have sold as many or more jerseys than Tatum this decade.\n\nTatum has reach across the broader public, and with great effect. His winning ways have made him one of the most visible players on and off the court. And his personal charm and style have earned him serious exposure, at least to the American public.\n\nThere's an interesting bend to this debate around the next crop of NBA superstars and the possibility of a single \"face of the league.\" For the first time in NBA history, the top players are predominantly international.\n\nAlong with the aforementioned trio of Jokic, Embiid, and Antetokounmpo, it's fair to argue that Luka Doncic and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander are as good or better than Tatum on the court. Victor Wembanyama looks ready to join that conversation soon enough. Tatum is probably the best American-born basketball player, for whatever that's worth.\n\nTatum's star power here in the United States is rock solid, but perhaps his international contemperaries have greater pull overseas. During the upcoming 2024 Olympics in Paris, though, Tatum has a chance to win another gold medal with the entire world watching. Expect his sponsorship partners to ensure his stardom and global reach grow further in that time.\n\nTatum does keep a lower profile compared to other stars. He can be soft-spoken, even in public appearances. He openly admits that he considers himself a shy person.\n\nRegardless, there's a reason the television cameras love seeing him and his son \"Deuce\" prior to Celtics games, or Tatum is often seen embracing his mother afterward. There's an endearing element to Tatum's stardom that seems to connect with people. He's earnest and real, and that resonates with fans.\n\nSo, no. Being a dedicated father who loves to golf isn't the sexiest tagline for a superstar. And Tatum isn't as sharp-tongued as Jordan or Durant. His story isn't as sensationalized as James or Curry. Up-and-coming stars like Doncic or Anthony Edwards have better soundbites. Even Tatum's co-star in Boston Jaylen Brown is usually a better quote.\n\nAs an aside, Brown hasn't sought out the same types of partnerships or exposure as Tatum. He's spent more time and energy in different areas, and pitting the two against one one another isn't really the point. They have their unique niches in the NBA and in the culture. Tatum's more conventional approach to stardom has had broader appeal and reach, at least thus far in their careers, but they're a little apples and oranges in that regard.\n\nJust because Tatum doesn't always go viral after each press conference isn't a huge knock, however. Tatum is careful when speaking to the media. Within reason, he's good at controlling his own narrative, and his mild approach helps him maintain his public image.\n\nTatum has the perfect mix of ingredients to be the league's top superstar. He is one of the best players in the league and only getting better, with a Duke pedigree to boot. Basketball devotees have known his name for years now, and Tatum's resume is only getting stronger.\n\nHe's built the right partnerships, and he has a sterling reputation among advertisers and casual fans. The NBA is eager to elevate his star status further, and the league's most important partners seem to feel the same way.\n\nStardom is about so much more than counting stats and titles, even if rings are the ultimate currency within NBA circles. It's about connecting with casual fans and making a broader impact on the culture. It's about transcending the role of NBA player into a bigger touchstone across interests and communities. No one has hit that mark as well as Tatum.\n\nThe 2024 NBA Finals represent a huge pivot point for Tatum's career. Some of the most prevalent narratives in the league zeitgeist could rise or fall with the outcome of the series. A loud win will put to bed some of the biggest doubts tied to Tatum's name. Imagine if Tatum wins a title in a few weeks, though. He could follow that up by signing a historic contract extension and earning Olympic gold.\n\nA loss would end up being a major stain on Tatum's basketball resume. And the takes would rain down for weeks and months. But even if Tatum and the Celtics come up short, it won't matter. His role as the future center of the NBA landscape is secure.\n\nThis is Tatum's league now.", "source": {"uri": "celticswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Celtics Wire"}, "authors":

He played all 48 minutes, shot 22-for-46 overall and made 17 of 19 free throw attempts in a 126-121 win. Though the Lakers wound up losing the series in seven games, Baylor holds the Finals record for most points in a series with 284.\n\nBaylor is one of just seven players to ever score 50 or more points in a Finals game. Giannis Antetokounmpo is the most recent star to reach that number, doing so in a series-clinching Game 6 win for the Milwaukee Bucks over the Phoenix Suns in 2021.\n\nWho has the most 3-pointers in an NBA Finals game?\n\nThe best 3-point shooter in NBA history is also the best 3-point shooter in NBA Finals history.\n\nSteph Curry holds the all-time and single-game records for most 3-point attempts and makes in the NBA Finals. He set the single-game marks in Game 2 of the 2018 Finals, where the Golden State Warriors guard went 9-for-17 from 3-point range in a 122-103 rout over the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nAlong with the nine 3-pointer game, Curry also drained seven 3s in six Finals contests, two of which came in the 2022 Finals against the Celtics.\n\nWho has the most rebounds in an NBA Finals game?\n\nJust like his team won most of their Finals matchups, Bill Russell edged Wilt Chamberlain for the most rebounds in an NBA Finals game.\n\nRussell has two Finals games with 40 rebounds. The first came in 1960 against the St. Louis Hawks and the second came against the Lakers in Game 7 of the 1962 Finals. By comparison, Chamberlain's highest rebounding total for a Finals game was 38, a number he reached twice.\n\nRussell and Chamberlain have an overwhelming presence in the Finals rebounding records. The two centers combined for 73 of the top 100 single-game rebounding outputs in Finals history: 48 from Russell and 25 from Chamberlain.\n\nWho has the most assists in an NBA Finals game?\n\nIt should come as no surprise that Magic Johnson's name is all over the NBA Finals assists records.\n\nThere have been just six times in Finals history that a player has tallied 19 or more assists in a game, and five of them came from Johnson. His highest total came in Game 3 of the 1984 Finals, where he dished out 21 assists in a 137-104 win over the Celtics.\n\nWho has the most turnovers in an NBA Finals game?\n\nAlong with the most assists in an NBA Finals game, Johnson also holds the record for most turnovers in a Finals game.\n\nJohnson turned it over 10 times against the Philadelphia 76ers in Game 5 of the 1980 Finals, which came during his rookie season. The Lakers star struggled with his turnovers and shooting, but he still picked up a triple-double in a 108-103 victory.\n\nJohnson also holds the second-highest mark for turnovers in a Finals game. He turned it over nine times in the Sixers' Game 4 clincher over the Lakers in the 1983 Finals.\n\nWho has the most steals in an NBA Finals game?\n\nSeven is a significant NBA Finals number for Robert Horry.\n\nFirst and foremost, Horry won seven championships in his career. The first two came with the Houston Rockets, the middle three came with the Lakers and the last two came with the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nOn top of that, Horry holds an NBA Finals record involving the number seven. He became the first and only player in league history to pick up seven steals in a Finals game, doing so in Game 2 of the 1995 Finals. The Rockets won that game 117-106 en route to a sweep over the Orlando Magic.\n\nWho has the most blocks in an NBA Finals game?\n\nThe 2009 Finals did not go Dwight Howard's way, but he still made some history during the series.\n\nThe Magic center set an NBA Finals record with nine blocks in a Game 4 loss to the Lakers. He also added 16 points and 21 rebounds, but Orlando fell 99-91 and lost the series in the following game.\n\nPrior to Howard's nine-block performance, five Hall of Famers shared the Finals record with eight blocks in a game: Tim Duncan, Shaquille O'Neal, Patrick Ewing, Hakeem Olajuwon and Bill Walton.", "source": {"uri": "nbclosangeles.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Southern

Just to quickly recap, it is the Boston Celtics and Dallas Mavericks facing off, with the Celtics advancing to the finals for the first time since 2022 with a 12-2 post-season result. The Mavs, on the other hand, conquered the West and will be making their first Finals appearance since the 2010-11 season. And this will be their first time to face off on the court of the NBA Finals.\n\nIn the 23-24 season, the Celtics led by Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, won both head-to-head matchups between the two teams, which may give the Celtics the edge. The only thing standing in the way of these ace players is Luka Doncic, one of the biggest talents in NBA history, who has played remarkably well throughout the playoffs. The thrilling thing is that, in this final, both players will be in search of their first championship ring.\n\nIf you are reading this, we would assume that you are perhaps in Japan during the unmissable NBA Finals. But worry not. In this article, I would like to show you how to watch the NBA Finals while you are in Japan.\n\nMany sports fans can sometimes be passionate punters. If you bet on sports regularly, you probably know that some bookmakers offer live-streaming features.\n\nIn Japan, you can access many bookmakers, including global sites such as bet365 and 1xbet, as well as local sites specializing in the Japanese betting market. However, due to the licensing situation, we have to emphasize there is no guarantee that the NBA Finals will be streamed on bookmakers accessible in Japan.\n\nAlso, the fact that the NBA Finals are held at night time in the US, which falls in the morning through early afternoon in Japan time, makes this a non-preferred option. So what are other options?\n\nThe most reliable and basic way to watch the NBA Finals from Japan is Rakuten. Rakuten is almost like the Japanese version of Amazon of Japan (although Amazon does exist in Japan as well) and offers a platform called Rakuten TV that allows its subscribers to watch a variety of sports like the NBA and European soccer leagues.\n\nThe LEAGUE PASS is a monthly subscription that allows users to watch all NBA games live or on-demand for 4,500 JPY per month. The price is at the highest end of the other available options, but it is worth signing up for, especially if you have lived in Japan for a long time.\n\nWOWOW was Japan's first SVOD channel and now offers exclusively many international sports, movies, stage shows, music programs, and anime, as well as original drama productions.\n\nWhat is available here is live and on-demand coverage of all NBA Finals games. The price is much lower than Rakuten's, at 2,530 JPY per month. If you are interested in watching only the Finals, this option is highly recommended.\n\nABEMA is an online TV channel. There are regular programs that are available for free and premium programs that are accessible to viewers on a subscription basis.\n\nThey became famous as an international sports channel when they won the exclusive rights for FIFA World Cup 2022. Currently, Abema is partnering with the aforementioned WOWOW, to offer some of the sports programming available on WOWOW, including the NBA Finals, where you can watch the Finals games for less than half the price.\n\nHere we have provided some possible options for those who wish to watch the NBA Finals during their stay in Japan. We hope you enjoy your stay in Japan and wish you the best NBA viewing experience!", "source": {"uri": "thespread.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheSpread.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmaker_(gambling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bookmaker (gambling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakuten", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rakuten"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestreaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Livestreaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_on_demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video on demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japanese yen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abema", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakuten_TV", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rakuten TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wowow", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wowow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anime"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Clocks_and_Watches", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Clocks and Watches", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://www.thespread.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Karl-Anthony-Towns-Timberwolves.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

Explaining the origin of Boston's nickname, NBA mascot history", "body": "No NBA team has won more championships. No NBA team has won more individual games. And no NBA team has played more games.\n\nBoston's basketball history is rich, and to many, the word, \"Celtics,\" just means basketball.\n\nBut while the Celtics and their name have been a part of the NBA for nearly 80 years, it's likely not everyone knows how the team got its name or its mascot.\n\nSporting News is taking a look back at the history of the Celtic name and mascot history in Boston.\n\nMORE: Jayson Tatum gets candid about Kyrie Irving's Celtics tenure\n\nTo many in the United States, the first thing that comes to mind when hearing \"Celtic\" is the basketball team. But that's not the case globally.\n\nCeltic, internationally, is more widely recognized as the descriptor of Celts, which are people who speak using the Celtic language. The Celtic people have lived across Europe throughout history, though today are best known as Irish, Scottish Gaelic and Welsh people. Many most strongly associated \"Celtics\" as Irish.\n\nWhen it comes to the team name, ironically, it comes from Boston's fiercest sports city rival: New York. The New York Celtics were started in 1914 but disbanded due to World Were I. They were reformed after World War I and called the Original Celtics. They played at Madison Square Garden, but were also largely a barnstorming team, playing up to 205 games nationally, per the Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\nMORE: Will Celtics follow LeBron James' example for defending Luka Doncic?\n\nThe Original Celtics stopped barnstorming in 1926 and joined the ABL in 1926, and won ABL titles in 1926 and 1927. They then returned to barnstorming in 1930 but stopped by 1941.\n\nWhen Walter Brown formed Boston's basketball team, he and Howie McHugh, who handled public relations, went through a range of nicknames, including the Whirlwinds, Unicorns and Olympics, per the Boston Irish Tourism Association. But Brown decided on the Celtics.\n\nThe reason was two-fold: first, the Original Celtics; second, Boston's Irish population.\n\n\"We'll put them in green uniforms and call them the Boston Celtics,\" Brown said, per the Boston Irish Tourism Association.\n\nIt didn't take long before the Celtics adopted a mascot, Lucky the Leprechaun.\n\nRed Auerbach, the coach of the Celtics, asked his brother to design a logo for Boston, per the Boston Irish Tourism Association. The mascot featured aspects of 1950s Irish Americans, which included a bowler hat, a pipe, shamrock clothing and holding a shillelagh.\n\nThe mascot has remained almost the same over the years. In early years, he was leaping in the air, but by 1968-69, he had moved down to a standing posture with his legs crossed and leaning on the shillelagh, per SportsLogos.net. Since then, a few minor color adjustments have been the extent of the changes.\n\nThe Celtics have won 17 championships, tied with the Lakers for the most in the NBA. Boston hasn't won a title since the 2007-08 championship but was the most dominant team of the 1950s and 1960s, winning 11 championships in 13 seasons between 1956-57 and 1968-69.\n\nHere's a look at every Celtics' NBA Finals appearance:\n\nGames 1, 2, 5 and 7 are scheduled to be played at TD Garden in Boston.

The Fiery Patrick Beverley Weighs In", "body": "Getty Veteran guard Patrick Beverley weighs in on whether or not the Boston Celtics are a \"soft\" team.\n\nThe Boston Celtics begin their quest to bring home Banner 18 on Thursday, June 6, when they host the Dallas Mavericks in Game 1 of the 2024 NBA Finals. The Celtics haven't won a championship since 2008.\n\nLed by Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, the Celtics are the favorites in the series after finishing with the best record in the NBA. Despite cruising through the regular season and the playoffs, there always seems to be some doubt with this Celtics team. One of those doubts appears to be their toughness.\n\nVeteran NBA guard Patrick Beverley, who played with the Milwaukee Bucks this season, addressed the issue of Boston's toughness during a radio appearance on the \"Felger & Mazz\" show leading up to the Game 1 showdown with the Mavs.\n\nBeverley is known for his fiery play. A defensive menace, he's sometimes referred to as an agitator. He's comparable to Marcus Smart, the tenacious guard who left Boston after nine seasons. Smart was traded to the Memphis Grizzlies in a three-team deal that brough center Kristaps Porzingis to Boston.\n\nSmart was gritty. He was tough. Some believe when Smart left town, so did Boston's toughness.\n\nThat was brought up during Beverley's radio interview. He was flat-out asked if he thought the Celtics had a reputation for being \"soft.\"\n\n\"Not soft,\" Beverley said. \"Soft is a soft-ass word, so I'm not going to use soft. Do people kind of look at them and be like they haven't been challenged this year? Yes. That comes with everything. You still can't take anything away from them.\n\n\"Have they beaten some banged-up teams? Yes. Is it their fault? No. Have they been the most dominant team in the NBA? Yes. You can't use soft because of their domination throughout the season and postseason.\"\n\nTatum and Brown have both been named All-NBA in their careers and have played together for seven years but haven't been able to win a championship. They got to the NBA Finals in 2022, but they fell to the Golden State Warriors after both Tatum and Brown struggled in the series.\n\nTatum and Brown are one of the best tandems in the NBA. So is Dallas' duo of Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving.\n\nBeverley was asked who he thought was the best player in the series. He danced around the question, saying his idea of the best player are the scrappy guys, like Derrick Jones, Dereck Lively, Jrue Holiday, and Derrick White, who get things done without scoring 25 to 30 points.\n\n\"But if I have to take one (from each team), I'll take Luka Doncic, and I'll take Jaylen Brown,\" he said.\n\n\"You think Jaylen Brown is better than Jayson Tatum?\" host Mike Felger asked Beverley.\n\n\"Right now,\" Beverley said. \"I don't think he's better than him. He was just the Eastern Conference MVP, so you have to give it to him.\"\n\nWhen asked to give his prediction for the series, Beverley shifted quickly and said he'll continue to do so.\n\n\"I like Dallas, but I like Jrue Holiday a lot,\" he said. \"I like Jrue Holiday a lot. Mind you, when I give you this answer, my answer changes every day. Today, it's Boston. Tomorrow, it might be Boston. The next day it might be Dallas, but right now at this moment, it's Boston.\"", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_thomas@heavy.com", "name": "Mike Thomas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Beverley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Beverley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Smart", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Smart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis_Grizzlies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Memphis Grizzlies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Patrick-Beverley-e1717688280785.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 178, "textEnd": 184}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

They hold the record for the most recorded wins of any team in the NBA. The team has a storied history.\n\nThe Celtics compete in the National Basketball Association's Eastern Conference as part of the Atlantic Division.

Brown, president of the Boston Garden-Arena Corporation.\n\nGame 1 of the NBA Finals between the Boston Celtics and Dallas Mavericks will occur on June 6, 2024, the 78th anniversary of the Celtic's founding.\n\nThe Celtics began in the Basketball Association of America (BAA) in the 1946-47 season.

We've also got the impending launch of the new streaming bundle Venu Sports and the stunning growth of the WNBA and women's sports. On the unalloyed good news front (especially for Boston and Dallas folks), tonight marks a key moment in the U.S. sports media calendar - the start of the NBA Finals (with that term now a well-marketed capitalization!).\n\nFor ESPN, the immediate question is whether this NBA Finals will create what the network has branded as \"moments that matter\"? For fans of the NBA, sports and media in general, what is the alchemy that produces such moments? Here's one fan's take on the secret sauce ingredients for NBA Finals, some of which are in place this year.\n\nIconic Teams (Brands to us media types)\n\nThe presence of marquee franchises unequivocally raises the level of attention, drama, and historical significance in NBA Finals. For baseball it's the Yankees, Cubs, Dodgers and Red Sox (umm...not recently) and in basketball it really comes down to the Celtics and Lakers and maybe the Warriors now. We've got one of them this year as the Boston Celtics go for what would be a record 18 championship (a special number for many of us). There is a texture and historical narrative that that surrounds a Celtics or Lakers pursuit of a championship that can't be manufactured. It's the kind of stuff creative producers take to new heights.\n\nStars and Stories\n\nThe NBA has done a better job of marketing its stars than any other U.S. sports league (other than the NFL's Taylor Swift). The modern NBA came into being with the Larry Bird-Magic Johnson rivalry (and ultimate friendship) in the 1980s and has continued through Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Steph Curry and many more. This year features two of the most dynamic duos in the sport - Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving from the Dallas Mavericks and Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown of the Celtics. When you add in the off the court drama in Kyrie's hate-hate relationship with seemingly the entire New England region (it's a long story), you've got elements of some elements of Greek tragedy (Better Help usage is going to skyrocket if the Celtics lose to Kyrie).\n\nBroadcast Personalities\n\nHey folks, it's entertainment, so it matters who's on the mic. Baseball was defined by Vin Scully and Jack Buck (\"I don't believe what I just saw!\") and in the 1980 U.S.-Soviet Union hockey game Al Michaels spontaneously scripted maybe the greatest sports line ever (\"Do you believe in miracles?\"). The NBA has benefitted from a series of well-known voices that have heightened the drama and \"bigness\" of moments for decades, including Brent Musberger at CBS covering Bird and Magic, Bob Costas at NBC in the Jordan years, the unmistakable Marv Albert, and now play-by-play man Mike Breen (with his signature call \"Bang!\"). Breen is still there, but today lacks the magic chemistry with his new partners J.J. Redick and Doris Burke that Albert had with Bill Walton and Breen himself developed with Jeff Van Gundy and Mark Jackson. It's not automatic.\n\nCompetition\n\nThere's not much ESPN can do about this one. Sports after all offers up the ultimate reality TV without a pre-set script. The quality and intensity of the competition between the teams has a lot to do with how fondly and strongly an NBA Finals is remembered. A long series is certainly a boon to the bottom line of the broadcaster and the teams filling arenas and tends to cement more longer-term memories. And sometimes individual moments resonate long beyond the overall games themselves. For New Yorkers, even for those not alive at the time, Marv Albert's reveal that \"Willis Reed is coming out of the tunnel!\" still delivers a chill down the spine. No pre-taped packages will work here - all you've got is hope is serendipity.\n\nSince you asked (I see you out there) - here's my own list of the top five NBA Finals (in chronological order) that have \"mattered\" most since the advent of the modern NBA over 40 years ago. Feel free to disagree.\n\n1984 - Celtics/Lakers\n\nSo many elements at play here. This was the first Bird-Magic NBA Finals, a renewal of the historic Celtics-Lakers rivalry that dominated the 1960s, and it went to seven hair-raising games. You still see Kevin McHale's clothesline take-down of the Lakers' Kurt Rambis show up on plenty of NBA highlight (or lowlight) reels. Although it may be hard to believe, this was also one of the first NBA Finals to be broadcast live nationally. As recently as Bird's first championship in 1981, several of the games were tape-delayed to air after the late local news - they weren't seen as likely to drive sufficient ratings in prime time!\n\n1998 - Chicago Bulls/Utah Jazz\n\nThis was the Bulls' sixth and final championship before Michael Jordan's retirement. It has been immortalized in the ESPN documentary series \"The Last Dance.\" It had big stars and one of those craved-for \"moments\" as Jordan hit the final jumper to win the game and championship by one point with five seconds left. As the late Jack Buck might have said \"I don't believe what I just saw!\".\n\n2002 - Lakers/New Jersey Nets\n\nStay with me on this one. This was a four-game sweep, and no one is really going to remember this Nets team (they don't even play in New Jersey anymore). But it was the first and only \"three-peat\" (three championships in a row) in the NBA since the Bill Russell Celtics in the 1960s. The Lakers featured massive stars in Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant as well as hall of fame coach Phil Jackson. The announcers included Marv Albert and the late great Bill Walton - gold at the mic.\n\n2008 - Celtics/Lakers\n\nI know, enough already with the Celtics and Lakers! But this was the first NBA Finals meetings between these two teams in over 20 years. There were stars galore, with Kobe in LA and Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett, and Ray Allen for the Celtics. At the end was the enduring memory of the championship-starved Garnett screaming out \"Anything is possible!\" which became his signature rallying cry and the title of an acclaimed documentary several years ago.\n\n2016 - Cleveland Cavaliers/Golden State Warriors\n\nIt may be weird that I'm including a Finals where the dynastic Warriors lost, but this was a huge one. The LeBron James-led Cavs won the first professional championship for any Cleveland franchise since Jim Brown and the 1964 Browns. Kyrie Irving (there he is again) hit the famous last shot to win it in seven games. On a personal note, I watched this one live in the middle of the night (and early morning) at the Carlton Hotel in Cannes on the first night of Cannes Lions with a lot of unhappy Silicon Valley folks. Warning to Cannes attendees who are NBA fans - you may in for a couple of very late nights this year!", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [],

Credits: USA TODAY Sports\n\nAhead of Game 1 of the 2024 NBA Finals, Austin Rivers and his friend Pausha Haghighi lashed out at the criticism that Boston Celtics duo, Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum, received from analysts. However, Kendrick Perkins disagreed and claimed that the former Clipper was trying to stir the pot for attention. The war of words commenced on a clip from the Off Guard Podcast, Haghighi argued that Brown and Tatum have been as successful as any duo could be without winning the title.\n\nHe's spot on, considering they've reached the Eastern Conference Finals five times and the NBA Finals twice in seven seasons together. Rivers backed his co-host and added that he found it baffling that despite the duo averaging a combined 76 points and reaching the Conference Finals consistently, analysts criticized them.\n\nHe added that fans demanding Brown be traded for a better player do not understand his importance to his team's chemistry and success. Rivers compared the Celtics duo to Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray and noted that they haven't been as consistent as the Boston stars but there are no calls to trade the guard for a better star.\n\nPerkins vehemently disagreed with Rivers and Haghighi's rant and replied to the podcast clip on Instagram. He highlighted that Brown and Tatum are being held to the same standards that other superstars were before they won their first NBA title. He wrote,\n\n\"Nobody kills them. Stop with bulls**t! They're getting the same energy [Le]Bron [James], Giannis [Antetokounmpo] and All the greats got before they won their first Championship. I see what you're trying to do here tho. I guess that's a Duke thang!\"\n\nPerkins is correct in pointing out that superstars have often received flak for failing to win an NBA title. LeBron James, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and Nikola Jokic also received vitriol for failing to win the championship despite having multiple MVP awards. It took until their maiden title win to silence the critics.\n\nBrown and Tatum are treated like superstars and will continue to receive criticism until they lead the Celtics to a championship. It's a rite of passage that every great NBA player has to go through. The voices are loud, but they'll be near deafening if the duo fails to win the title this season.\n\nSince Brown and Tatum teamed up in 2017, the Celtics have made it to the Eastern Conference Finals five times. They were the higher seed in all but one series and the favorites to win each time. However, they advanced to the finals only twice. They failed to beat the Warriors in their last visit to the championship series, with many citing 'experience' as the reason, but that excuse won't fly against the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nBarring Kyrie Irving, no player on the Mavericks roster has enjoyed as much playoff success as the Celtics have.

On Monday, he'll be the featured speaker at the Middle Tennessee High School Sports Awards honoring the best student athletes from the Volunteer State. It's on brand for the civically minded Williams, whose mom is a NASA engineer.\n\nIt also must be said that Grant Williams is not in the news this week. When the Mavericks and Celtics tip off for Game 1 of the NBA Finals on Thursday night, Williams won't be in either uniform, even though he recently wore both of them.\n\nAmong the storylines big and small of this Finals -- Kyrie Irving's return, Luka Doncic vs. Jayson Tatum, Kristaps Porzingis vs. his old team -- there's also this: It's a battle of two clubs that decided they'd be better off without Williams. One of them is going to win it all.\n\nThe Celtics made this choice last summer when they retooled their roster and let Williams depart in restricted free agency via a sign-and-trade.\n\nThe contract year that many of us had expected never materialized, so it wasn't a difficult decision. Williams' last big moment in a Celtics uniform was a decidedly dubious one, as he jawed with Heat All-Star Jimmy Butler before the latter took over Game 2 of the conference finals to give Miami a commanding lead.\n\nThe Mavericks weren't dissuaded. They signed the burly forward to a four-year, $54 million deal, envisioning him as a tough and experienced addition to their frontcourt alongside MVP candidate Luka Doncic.\n\nIt didn't work out. Williams reportedly showed up out of shape but with his mouth intact, which won't surprise anyone who watched him yap throughout his Celtics career. What was largely endearing here - former teammate Jayson Tatum clearly loved him - proved irritating in Dallas and the Mavericks shipped him to his hometown Hornets for P.J. Washington as part of a midseason roster rebuild that kickstarted their run to the Finals.\n\nThat leaves Williams in an awkward position. Not only is he not playing, but if he wants a ring, then he'll need to root for the team that jettisoned him in February. Given his longer and happier ties to the Celtics, it wouldn't be surprising if he's pulling for former teammates like Tatum, Jaylen Brown, and Al Horford, but he can only earn a ring from the Mavericks.\n\nLet the record show that Williams authored some legitimately great moments in a Celtics uniform, none bigger than his seven 3-pointers in Game 7 to eliminate the Bucks en route to the 2022 NBA Finals. The Celtics lost to the Warriors, but it seemed possible that Williams would carve out a Draymond Green-lite role for himself in Boston as an instigator and big-bodied defender.\n\nWilliams instead played himself right out of head coach Joe Mazzulla's rotation with inconsistent effort. He was benched for the first time last March and took five DNPs in the playoffs. By the time the season ended, he suspected his days in Boston were numbered, which the pre-draft trade for former Mavs big man Kristaps Porzingis effectively confirmed.\n\nSo next week he'll return to Tennessee, where he was a first-team All-American in college, and give back to his community. Williams was many things in Boston - affable, loquacious, occasionally frustrating - but he was never a champion.\n\nHis former teammates - on both sides - will attempt to finish that job without him.", "source": {"uri": "nbcsportsboston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports Boston"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Williams_(basketball)",

Boston began the previous season as clear favorites to win the Eastern Conference and announce themselves as fully back among the top teams in the league following a sustained rebuild in the post-Paul Pierce/Kevin Garnett era.\n\nThe reality had fallen far short of expectations. While the Celtics still amassed a respectable 49-33 record, it was good enough for just fourth in the East. And in the playoffs, Boston failed to even reach the Eastern Conference Finals, losing 4-1 to the Bucks a round earlier.\n\nLooking to move beyond the disappointment, Ainge had hoped to add Davis to a roster that also included Irving. Yet within a few weeks, Irving was in Brooklyn (having signed with the Nets), Davis was in Los Angeles (having been officially acquired by the Lakers), and Horford signed in Philadelphia with the Eastern Conference rival 76ers.\n\nBoston's remaining group retained plenty of ability, but contained an equal amount of unknowns at its core. Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum, the Celtics' No. 3 overall picks in back-to-back drafts, were still developing. The duo had flashed potential during the unexpectedly deep playoff run in 2018 when both Irving and Gordon Hayward were injured, but Brown and Tatum were yet to prove that they could elevate Boston to a championship level as the centerpieces of the roster.\n\nFlashing forward to 2024, with Irving set to meet his old team in the Celtics-Mavericks NBA Finals matchup, it can be easy to forget how difficult Boston's circumstances were just five years ago.\n\nSurviving the departure of Irving (and Horford) in the landscape of the star-dependent NBA was no small feat. Numerous other teams in the league's history have fallen completely out of contention after sustaining the loss of comparable talents.\n\nThe Celtics even managed a better regular season winning percentage the following season (albeit one that was shortened due to the COVID-19 pandemic), and advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals before falling to the Heat in six games.\n\nIn retrospect, the main saviors of Boston in the wake of Irving's departure were the young stars waiting in the wings. Both Brown and Tatum began their true ascensions up the NBA's hierarchy in the 2019-2020 season, and have essentially progressed in each year since. Other than Horford (reacquired in 2021), they are the only remaining members of the much-hyped 2018-2019 roster.\n\nPartial credit belongs to Ainge. Though his gamble in acquiring Irving didn't pan out - and, in fact, left Boston with no compensation when the mercurial guard bolted for Brooklyn -- he also avoided the temptation of dealing either Brown or Tatum in various reported trade rumors (having of course originally drafted them as well).\n\nIn large part, it was also Brad Stevens who ultimately steered Boston back into its current form as Eastern Conference powerhouse.\n\nAssuming the role of president of basketball operations following Ainge's decision to step down in June of 2021, the ex-head coach has by now dispelled the early notions that he would be limited by lack of executive experience.\n\nIn Feb. 2022, Stevens acquired Derrick White from the Spurs for Romeo Langford, Josh Richardson, and two first-round picks. Though he was less heralded at the time, White has become instrumental in so much of what the Celtics have done.\n\nAfter coming up short against the Heat a year ago, Stevens -- with some prodding from Celtics co-owner Wyc Grousbeck -- pulled the trigger on an even more bold deal to trade Marcus Smart, ending up with Kristaps Porzingis. And just days after Jrue Holiday was sent to Portland as part of the Bucks' acquisition of Damian Lillard, Stevens pounced again, bringing in the highly respected veteran guard with another aggressive move (sending Malcolm Brogdon, Robert Williams and two first-rounders in exchange).\n\nThe result is the Celtics have been almost completely reshaped since the Irving era ended with a thud. Boston has built around Brown and Tatum, with Stevens (unlike Ainge) more willing to trade assets and draft picks in order to build a deep and talented roster around his young superstars.\n\nFive years removed from an offseason debacle, it's possibly fitting that just at the moment when Irving has arguably started to truly fulfill his own potential in Dallas, the Celtics appear to have finally reached the level that many predicted would happen with him in 2019.", "source": {"uri": "boston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hayden_bird@boston.com", "name":

While Boston is heavily favored to win this series, does that mean it will fare well in Game 1?\n\nThere are some conflicting historical trends to look at, as well as the season-long records from these teams that could help us make a bet for Thursday's series opener.\n\nOdds via DraftKings Sportsbook.\n\nDating back to 2005, the team that is favored in Game 1 of the NBA Finals has dominated, going 16-3 against the spread.\n\nIronically, Boston is one of the few teams that won and covered as an underdog in Game 1 back in the 2022 NBA Finals against the Golden State Warriors.\n\nThis trend would favor the Celtics, who have been a dominant team at home all season long, going 37-4 straight up in the regular season. Boston has also went 3-0 in Game 1s in the playoffs, covering the spread in two of those matchups.\n\nNow, ready for the curveball?\n\nSince 2020, there are have been seven instances where a team has been favored by six or more points in the NBA Finals, and Boston fits that bill in Game 1 as a 6.5-point favorite.\n\nThose teams are just 1-6 against the spread.\n\nNow, Boston could still win Game 1 and fail to cover, which would be fine in the eyes of C's fans, but bettors may want to be careful laying such a big number in a Finals game.\n\nWhen it comes to playing on the road, there hasn't been a single team better to bet on than the Mavericks.\n\nThey are an NBA-best 34-16 against the spread on the road, but we can break that down even further. As a road underdog, Dallas is 14-11 against the spread, not nearly as dominant of a mark as that 34-16 number.\n\nWhy?\n\nWell, the Mavs also went an NBA-best 20-5 against the spread as road favorites. It's highly unlikely Dallas will be favored in Boston in this series, but it still has been better than most on the road as an underdog.\n\nThe Celtics come into Game 1 with a 26-21-2 against the spread record as home favorites this season, but what stands out is that the average margin of victory in those games is 14.4 points.\n\nBoston has lost two games at home in the playoffs, but both of those came in a Game 2 scenario.\n\nEssentially, all these trends can help us frame a bet, but I wouldn't use them as gospel when it comes to betting on Game 1. There are ways to discount every trend (as you can see with the ones mentioned in this story), so it's important to look at more than that before placing your wager for Thursday's Finals opener.\n\nOdds refresh periodically and are subject to change.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DraftKings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "DraftKings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler_Bulldogs_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Butler Bulldogs men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "label": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4134,h_2325,x_0,y_130/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si/01hzj3cbbekyakn4d1fe.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

A Boston return was long assumed, even after it melted under a maelstrom of Miami Heat 3s in last season's Eastern Conference finals. But flash back to the spring of 2021, and everything seemed so precarious for a franchise that envisioned a near-decade run of contention around Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown.\n\nThose 2020-21 Celtics finished .500 and whimpered out of the first round, overwhelmed by the East's new superteam -- the Brooklyn Nets of James Harden, Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving. Many within the Celtics still whisper about that series -- the sense of helplessness, the fear the East had passed them by.\n\nThe roster around Brown and Tatum was a mess. Kemba Walker's body betrayed him. Young players were not ready. Free agent signings and trades busted. Illnesses and injuries, including Brown's season-ending wrist injury, did the rest.\n\nIn a two-year whir, Boston reconstructed everything around its two stars -- swapping Walker for Al Horford, then striking deals for Derrick White, Jrue Holiday and Kristaps Porzingis. The Celtics rectified mistakes and were aggressive trading assets for talent.\n\nThe Mavs went through an even more accelerated remake after their 2022 Western Conference finals run. The only holdovers are Doncic, Maxi Kleber, Josh Green and Dwight Powell. The Mavs assumed more future risk than Boston in undoing past errors -- including the seismic blunder of letting Jalen Brunson escape -- but no one is much worried about that now after watching the Mavs confound three of the West's top-four seeds.\n\nZoom further out and you gain even more appreciation for all the variables that could have torpedoed this matchup -- of how that history underlines the massive stakes now.\n\nBoston had so many chances to speed up the Tatum/Brown era by trading one of them -- or the picks it ended up using to select both -- for restless superstars: Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis.\n\nThe Celtics used their final Nets pick to acquire Kyrie Irving in 2017, pairing him with Gordon Hayward as splashy offseason acquisitions. Internally, Boston envisioned Irving as the lure to convince Davis to push his way to Boston -- a trade that almost surely would have cost the Celtics either Tatum or Brown.\n\nThat plan teetered five minutes into Hayward's Celtics debut, when he shattered his leg. It was a basketball tragedy; Hayward was never the same. It is also a massive sliding doors moment. If Hayward stays healthy, do Brown and Tatum develop as fast? Does Irving grow unhappy leading the young Celtics? If not, does Boston actually have a chance at Davis?\n\nIrving bolted, leaving Boston shell-shocked. Other chances to go all-in for a superstar emerged, including for Durant. Boston never struck a deal. Over and over, it ended up wagering on continuity -- on Tatum and Brown staying together and opening a long-term championship window. The Celtics have done that. Eventually, you have to leap through the window or some outside force will slam it shut.\n\nThe Mavs wandered in purgatory between their glorious 2011 title and their franchise-changing draft-day swap for Doncic in 2018. Their last pre-Doncic roster was old and incoherent -- the motley you get when you punt the draft and whiff on superstar free agents. Doncic was salvation.\n\nAs Boston recalibrated in the wake of Irving's departure, Dallas did the same with the Doncic-Porzingis fit -- ultimately trading Porzingis for Spencer Dinwiddie and Davis Bertans. A year later, it included Dinwiddie in what turned out to be a heist of Irving from Brooklyn.\n\nIrving and Porzingis now face their former teams -- with much of the nitty-gritty strategy orbiting Porzingis and the big men on both ends.\n\nTHERE IS NO stopping a force as adaptable as Doncic. Boston could start Brown on Doncic, with Holiday on Irving; those have been head coach Joe Mazzulla's preferred matchups in recent games. Brown and Holiday are elite defenders. They can switch the Doncic-Irving two-man game -- a must against Dallas.\n\nThe real thing to watch is who Porzingis guards. His positional matchup is Daniel Gafford, and then Dereck Lively II, but Porzingis will likely be elsewhere -- on P.J. Washington Jr. or Derrick Jones Jr., with Tatum guarding Gafford.\n\nBoston knows Doncic wants to attack Porzingis and Horford; they are the least capable among Boston's top six of defending Doncic on switches. This is the weak point in Boston's otherwise airtight defense: It cannot realistically switch everything against Doncic and Irving.\n\nWhen Dallas does force a switch, Boston will sometimes play Doncic and Irving one-on-one despite the dangers: Beat us with (hopefully) jumpers. On other possessions, it will send traps -- despite what it exposes elsewhere:\n\nJuggling the matchups this way makes it so that if Doncic hunts Boston's centers, he has to do so using Washington and Jones as screeners -- instead of Dallas' lob-catching center duo. With wings on those guys, the Celtics can switch the Doncic-Lively and Doncic-Gafford pick-and-rolls.\n\nThat's only a half answer, at best. Doncic and Irving can target Boston's centers regardless of where they are. Some of this series will come down to Jones and Washington making plays out of those situations -- Jones cutting to the rim, Washington attacking closeouts and hitting the pick-and-pop 3s Boston's preferred dropback defense concedes:\n\nDefending the Mavs' centers with wings could also open up offensive rebounding chances for Lively and Gafford.\n\nThe idea is to complicate Doncic's path to lobs and clutter the Mavs' spacing. When Gafford and Lively aren't screening for Doncic, they're hanging near the basket. If Dallas' screeners on these plays -- Jones, Washington, Green -- roll to the rim, they're rolling right into the Mavs' centers and their defenders.\n\nWith Lively and his defender on the baseline, the Celtics can effectively defend the Doncic pick-and-roll 3-on-3 instead of 2-on-2:\n\nNote Holiday stunting off Jones on the left wing. To the degree they can, the Celtics will try to help most off Dallas' shakiest shooters. That's easier said than done against two master manipulators.\n\nBoston won't always be able to arrange its preferred matchups. The Mavs' centers will often guard Porzingis on defense, meaning Porzingis might be stuck defending them after Dallas stops. On those trips, the Mavs can go into their bread-and-butter pick-and-rolls against more standard defenses.\n\nBut the Celtics will work to get the matchups they want. Here is something like a best-case scenario -- even though Washington makes a contested 3:\n\nPorzingis hangs back. Brown fights through Washington's pick. Doncic prods, but there's nothing; Tatum is on Lively, clogging the paint. Boston switches everything from there. The Mavs do not have time to attack Porzingis again.\n\nThis is the only way of containing a player like Doncic: Have five very good defenders with size and hit him with enough schemes to at least make him think. On good possessions, you'll crowd his pet spaces without leaving the wrong shooters open. The hope is chipping away at the Mavs' expected efficiency bit by bit as the possession unfolds -- a dozen small battles to inch up your odds of winning the 24-second battle. Then you have to do it again 90 or 100 more times.\n\nThere is a mental fatigue facing a singular, relentless on-ball fulcrum like Doncic. Win one possession, and you know he's coming again -- prodding soft spots, creating contact, forcing you to maintain peak alertness every second.\n\nThat possession illustrates the importance of Porzingis. He drops back against Doncic. That is Boston's default scheme. It allows help defenders to stay attached to 3-point shooters, and Boston always wants to win the math battle.\n\nOnly three teams allowed fewer corner 3s than Boston. Dallas led the league in corner 3s. They will meet somewhere in the middle, but where exactly is one of many small things that will flip this series.\n\nBoston is happy to blanket shooters and let ball handlers try and beat them on tough midrange shots. Doncic is not most ball handlers. He will beat you that way. In a short series, he might have to do it only once or twice -- with the Mavs finding other ways to win the remaining games. It's a race to four, not a computer simulation.\n\nDoncic is a floater god. He is the very best at slowing down against dropback defenses, feeling the defender behind him skid off-balance, and then reclining into clean jumpers. He knows the threat of those shots can bait defenses into one fatal half rotation toward him. He has every pass out of thick traffic. He is probably the world's best lob passer. He sees every angle -- every impossible sidearm slingshot to the corners. In the muck of the paint, he turns possessions that look like low-percentage propositions into 2s and 3s. He will make some shots you want him to take, and get some of what you want to take away -- even when you think you've taken it away.\n\nThose lobs and floaters look different against Porzingis. The windows are tighter, angles trickier. The Celtics' playoff opponents have hit 71% at the rim -- a mammoth number that has a lot to do with Porzingis's calf injury. They need that number to come down.\n\nThe Celtics will have to come out of that dropback scheme at times against Doncic and Irving. When and how they do it are two of the juiciest subplots. Do they spring the blitzes early, from a position of strength and when Doncic may not expect it? Or do they wait until Doncic has hurt them -- when he might anticipate a change?\n\nIt's rote to suggest teams blitz Doncic and force everyone else to beat them. Every Dallas opponent has to mix that tactic in. But if Doncic knows it's coming, he will tear it apart. You're not going to blitz over and over and nudge Dallas into contested 3s from Jones, Green and Jaden Hardy. Doncic will snatch the good stuff: dunks and 3s for better shooters.\n\nThe effectiveness of blitzing also depends on the four players around Doncic: Are you blitzing from Lively or Gafford? Lively is a deft playmaker in space, Gafford less so. Does Dallas have more shooting on the floor?\n\nThe Mavs also like to set picks for Doncic and Irving near half court, negating blitzes and dropback schemes.\n\nBoth Mavs stars will hunt Payton Pritchard and Sam Hauser. Doncic can search out White and bully him -- or run the two-man game with Irving when White is on him.\n\nMaxi Kleber looms as a wild card. Sliding Kleber to center puts five shooters on the floor. Kleber can pop for 3s. If Boston switches everything, using Kleber at center clears the lane for Doncic and Irving to isolate. The Mavs may prefer 48 minutes of Gafford and Lively, but Kleber at center is an ace in the hole.\n\nDallas has become a much faster team with Irving. Boston was the league's stingiest transition defense. That is one benefit of shooting so many 3s; most of its defenders are in prime position to retreat. Two or three breakdowns against Dallas could swing a game.\n\nThis should be a low turnover series; Boston and Dallas ranked first and fourth, respectively, in turnover rate on offense, and neither forces many on defense. Any unexpected change in that equation could tilt one game -- which could tilt the championship.\n\nPORZINGIS IS A huge variable on the other side of the ball too. This may be the defining test of Boston's offense with Mazzulla as coach and Tatum as the centerpiece.\n\nBoston has been at its best when it has a small opposing guard to run everything at: Tyler Herro, Darius Garland, Tyrese Haliburton. It gives the Celtics an easy entry point to every possession. Whoever that guy is guarding either screens for one of Boston's stars -- on or off the ball -- or takes a screen from one of them. Switch, and Tatum or Brown goes to work against a mismatch. Double, and you set off Boston's passing and cutting, which usually cascades into open 3s.\n\nThe Mavs don't really offer that kind of player. Irving comes closest, but he guards way above his 6-foot-2 height. He will likely spend a lot of time guarding White, always in the middle of Boston's best two-man actions. The Mavs might be content switching Irving onto Tatum and Brown -- and switching lots of other Boston pairings -- and hoping the Celtics bog down into fading isolation 2s.\n\nIn all three prior rounds, the Mavs focused on choking off the paint. They have not faced opponents with anywhere near the shooting of the fully optimized Celtics. Assuming Porzingis' return shifts Luke Kornet to the fringes, there will be no paint-bound center -- no Ivica Zubac or Rudy Gobert -- in Boston's rotation. The Mavs will have to stick closer to Horford and Porzingis than they did against Chet Holmgren. They have to adapt.\n\nBut Boston has to be better and more focused than ever before to pry open those 3s. Tatum and Brown can gain traction on Irving if they are determined and physical. Boston can confuse switches with side-to-side actions and specific counters -- slipped screens, decoy actions, rapid-fire pindown screens.\n\nThe Celtics will also poke at Doncic. He will likely guard Holiday a lot. Expect more Tatum-Holiday and Brown-Holiday two-man games, with Holiday slipping into space and making plays if the Mavs trap:\n\nDallas can switch instead. Doncic has the size to jostle with Tatum and Brown on switches. He does not have the speed. Tatum and Brown (and White) can blast by Doncic if they go early, right on the catch. Holding the ball -- surveying, dancing -- allows Doncic to brace himself while the help defense slots into place behind him. Go right away and Boston's ball handlers can get to the rim -- or generate kickout 3s. If Tatum or Brown gives the ball up against Doncic, their teammates can pitch it right back -- giving Boston's stars a second chance to attack Doncic before the defense can set itself.\n\nThe Mavs will sometimes unleash traps when Doncic is stuck on Tatum or Brown -- wagering they can chase the ball until the shot clock dwindles. It's a dangerous game:\n\nPorzingis loosens Boston's spacing around all of this. He's a different shooter than Horford, with a higher, quicker release. He spots up further behind the arc.\n\nWith Porzingis, the more traditional pick-and-pop gains new power as an easy fallback for Tatum, Brown and White. Have your bigs hang back to corral Tatum, and Porzingis launches 3s. Send a third defender flying at Porzingis, and you unlock Boston's passing game.\n\nThe secret sauce of Boston's dominance with Porzingis really comes down to this: It can move its centers around on defense, but you can't. Your bigs have to chase Porzingis (and Horford). Where else can you put them against Boston's starters? White is not an option. Do you want to copy the Warriors and dare Brown to jack 3s? That didn't work. Holiday is the only semi-plausible option. A few teams have tried hiding centers on him in short stretches; it has failed.\n\nThe other alternative is switching. Lively is a good switch defender. He'll probably switch more in this series. Gafford is a little out of his depth guarding wings in open space. Downsizing with Kleber at center could be a useful changeup here too. He is ultra-switchable; the Mavs have dabbled with Kleber as Tatum's primary defender.\n\nBut those switches leave smaller players on Porzingis and Horford. Porzingis has destroyed those matchups this season, pivoting and burrowing until he is one extended arm from the basket. Again: diligence. If Porzingis settles for 15-foot jumpers over guards, he might have a game or two when those shots go cold.\n\nAt full strength, the Celtics can now play Horford and Porzingis together again -- effectively extending the minutes of their \"starting six\" in case their other bench players prove unreliable. Boston walloped opponents by 13 points per 100 possessions with its best double big combination on the floor.\n\nThe Mavs can win this. They have the best player, and if Irving sizzles, they could have the best two. In that scenario, they're champs. With Porzingis out or limited, I'd pick the Mavs.\n\nBut assuming Porzingis can give this a real go, Boston should have barely enough answers at both ends. It knows what it is up against -- that it will have to summon a new energy and focus, and reach a higher level than was required in the East. Everything for so many years has been leading to this moment -- this chance.", "source": {"uri": "espn.com.sg", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Who has the edge heading into the NBA Finals?", "body": "After a longer than expected break, the NBA Finals is finally on the verge of tipping off and the 2024 Finals could be the most high-profile finals since the Golden State Warriors run in the late 2010's.\n\nWhy? Because unlike last year's Finals between the Nuggets and Heat, there's a lot more starpower between both the Mavericks and Celtics.\n\nThe storylines are lot juicier, too, with Kyrie Irving and Boston big man Kristaps Porzingis facing their former teams on the biggest stage.\n\nThen there's the battle between Luka Doncic and Jayson Tatum, two of the game's brightest superstars who are entering their primes and trying to stake their claim as the best player in the world. On paper, both teams have reasons to feel confident, but who really has the edge?\n\nBreakdown: Just one of the many high-profile individual battles this series, Doncic and Holiday are two of the best at what they do. Doncic is arguably the most lethal scorer in the game and one of the best playoff performers the NBA has had despite him only being 25 years old. In four playoff runs, Doncic is averaging over 30 points per game and this postseason he's picked apart Minnesota's No. 1-rated defense, the No. 1 seed Oklahoma City Thunder and future Hall of Famers Paul George, Kawhi Leonard and James Harden.\n\nBelieve it or not Doncic's averages this postseason (28.8 points, 9.6 rebounds, 8.8 assists) are slightly below his standards. As crazy as it sounds, that's just how dominant Doncic has been in the postseason. On the flip side Holiday had a case as being the league's top perimeter defender for nearly half a decade with a length run of NBA All-Defense selections. One reason the Celtics are back in the finals is the fact they acquired Holiday from rival Milwaukee this off-season.\n\nHoliday was also a catalyst in the Bucks championship run in 2021. Holiday's numbers (12.7 points, 5.6 rebounds, 4.6 assist) are modest compared to Doncic's, but Holiday's the fourth or fifth option for the Celtics and is primarily there for his defense and intangibles, which he has plenty of. There's really no achetype to slow down Doncic, but Holiday might be the closet to it as he has a similar stature to OKC forward Lu Dort, the only defender that's been able to bother Doncic this postseason.\n\nHoliday has enough of an offensive game to where Doncic will have to be engaged defensively the entire series, but this is still the type of matchup Doncic lives for.\n\nKyrie Irving vs. Derrick White\n\nBreakdown: Irving will have his hands full when he goes up against White, maybe the most underrated player in the NBA. Irving is a superstar talent that can heat up at any moment and is one of the best closers in the NBA when the fourth quarter arrives. Irving has been up and down throughout the playoffs as his scoring average has gone from 25.6 in the regular season to 22.8 in the postseason as defenses have thrown more double teams at him.\n\nWhite saw his numbers take a step up as his offensive usage increased with Porzingis out of the lineup most of the playoffs. White averaged 15.2 points in the regular and is up to 17.8 points while knocking down 40 percent of his 3-pointers. White has been selected All-Defense two straight seasons and will have a slight size advantage over Irving. Boston will try to use White to wear down Irving on defense as well by running him through screens to get him open looks from deep and White is capable of finishing in the paint.\n\nBreakdown: Two superstar forwards vs. two forwards that just arrived in Dallas this past season. This is the matchup where the Finals could be won or lost for Dallas. Tatum and Brown have arguably been the best duo in the NBA since Tatum joined the franchise in 2017. Boston has had deep playoff run after deep playoff thanks to the brilliance of both. Tatum is a top-10 player in the league while Brown is one of the highest paid and a multi-time all-star.\n\nBoth have great size, athleticism and are three-level scoring threats. Tatum joined Doncic as one of the only players in NBA history to lead to their team in points, rebounds and assists in a playoff series. Tatum is averaging 26.0 points, 10.4 rebounds and 5.9 assists. Brown was voted MVP of the Eastern Conference finals and is averaging 25.0 abd 6.2 rebounds this postseason. Both are also upper echelon defenders on the wing and will likely guard Doncic and Irving at some point.\n\nOn the flip side Washington and Jones have fully embraced their roles this postseason. Washington's provided toughness, rebounding and spacing with his consistency knocking down corner 3s. The same can be said for White, who has guarded the opposing team's best perimeter scorers while also being a factor in transition and knocking 39.6 percent of his 3s. Jones will likely start on Brown with Washington getting a crack at Tatum.\n\nIf either is able to slow their matchup down, then it'll make things easier for Dallas.\n\nKristaps Porzingis and Al Horford vs. Daniel Gafford and Dereck Lively II\n\nBreakdown: Lively and Gafford have also been a big reason the Mavericks have advanced this far in the playoffs. The pairing bullied Oklahoma City's smaller frontline and mostly outperformed Minnesota's expensive core of bigs in the Western Conference finals. Gafford is the older veteran that starts the game while Lively is the talented rookie that comes off the bench and has been able to be a sparkplug with his athleticism on both ends of the floor.\n\nBoth have thrived with Irving and Doncic as lob threats while also being quality rim protectors on defense. However, the Celtics frontline will test Dallas in a different way as both Horford and Porzingis do plenty of their damage away from the basket. Horford and Porzingis combine to average over 11 3-point attempts per game and knock roughly 37 percent. Porzingis can also do damage inside, but it's fair to wonder how he'll look after missing the last two rounds of the playoffs with a calf injury.\n\nIf Porzingis is healthy, the edge likely goes to Boston, but if he's rusty then this could be another series for Lively in particular to make an impact.\n\nLively, Maxi Kleber, Josh Green, Jaden Hardy, Tim Hardaway Jr., Dante Exum vs. Horford, Payton Pritchard, Sam Hauser\n\nBreakdown: The Mavericks have the edge with the reserves as Jason Kidd has been able to find valuable minutes from almost every member on the bench. Boston's bench will get a boost with Horford returning to the unit after starting for Porzingis, but Dallas' bench is still younger and more versatile. Hardy has found a groove as a secondary scorer and ballhandler while Green and Exum have provided some sparks on the wing.\n\nHardaway has yet to catch fire this postseason, but averaged 14.4 points per game during the regular season. While Dallas should confident in its reserve, it's important to remember that bench play will only impact the series so much. These are role players and the the trophy will ultimately be decided by which stars shine the brightest between Doncic, Tatum, Brown and Irving.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType":

The Celtics defeated the Timberwolves 100-79. Mandatory Credit: Brace Hemmelgarn-USA TODAY Sports / Brace Hemmelgarn-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Boston Celtics steamrolled through the regular season, registering a 64-18 record. Finishing atop the NBA standings earned them home-court advantage throughout a playoff run that's now four wins from Banner 18.\n\nThey've maintained their machine-like efficiency throughout their postseason journey. However, critics are underwhelmed by Boston's 12-2 dismantling of the teams that tried to stand in its way in the Eastern Conference.\n\nThe Miami Heat were missing Jimmy Butler and Terry Rozier, the Cleveland Cavaliers were without Jarrett Allen, and they lost Donovan Mitchell to a calf strain after Game 3. The Indiana Pacers played the final two tilts without Tyrese Haliburton due to left hamstring soreness.\n\nHowever, good fortune on the health front is an ingredient in every successful championship run, regardless of sport. There's also the fact that the Celtics have played without starting center Kristaps Porzingis since he suffered a soleus strain in his right calf in Game 4 against the Heat.\n\nLuckily for the C's, the former All-Star participated in every drill the team did on Saturday at the Auerbach Center and is ramping up toward a return that could come in Game 1 of the NBA Finals on Thursday.\n\nAs for the Celtics' path to reach this stage, Kevin Garnett, who rejuvenated the franchise and helped lead them to the Larry O'Brien Trophy in 2008, took umbrage with those scoffing at Boston's road to the championship round.\n\n\"Their path is their path,\" said the Basketball Hall of Famer in a recent episode of \"The Ticket & The Truth\" podcast. \"First off, let me say something: it's not on the (expletive) Celtics that guys are getting hurt, not playing, falling out of the lineup, etcetera, etcetera. There's still other professionals that are coming in playing hard as (expletive), and they're still trying to win. And then to close out a game on the road? Man, I don't know what people want. People want all this heartfelt drama and going down to seven games. Nah! That ain't the script here. They're damn near 17-16 games better than anybody in the East. They steamrolled through your team. ... It is what it is.\"\n\nThe 15-time All-Star passionately continued, \"And then, too, you're down on the road 18 (points). They think that you can just hit a button and all (of a) sudden, you're tied. No man, you have to go win on the road. And it's hard as (expletive) to win on the road, and it's even more hard to close out a team. But then the Celtics -- they have all this other (expletive) that they can't control, and that's out of their control. Get the (expletive) out of here with that; this is where we're at with it.\"\n\n2008 NBA Finals MVP Paul Pierce co-signed his co-host's statement, saluting the Celtics for handling business and doing what they had to so they could again compete for the Larry O'Brien Trophy.\n\nFor Jayson Tatum, it's a second chance he's grateful to have as he aims to help author a different ending than when his team came up short against the Golden State Warriors in 2022.\n\nBetween Tatum and Jaylen Brown's growth since their first time in the Finals, the additions of Porzingis and Jrue Holiday, and the group's willingness to sacrifice and prioritize what's best for the collective, regardless of what that calls for from each of them, Boston's better equipped to capture the NBA title than it's been since Pierce and Garnett were in the Celtics' lineup.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This will be the 23 appearance in franchise history for the former, only the third for the latter, but still a big deal for both as only one team will come away with the coveted Larry O'Brien trophy, named after the legendary NBA commissioner who presided over the introduction of the three-point line. Perhaps in the future they will rename it to the Adam Silver trophy, a recognition of his achievements in presiding over the introduction of foul-baiting, flopping, and above all, Ben Simmons.\n\nBut why is this NBA finals trophy such a big deal? Well, buckle up, it's time for a quick history lesson.\n\nLet's start firstly with the teams who didn't make it to the NBA finals. Among them include the Lakers, Warriors, and Suns, three teams who had high expectations coming into the season, owing to the aura of LeBron James, waning dynasty of the Warriors, and the Big Three down in Phoenix. However, as the season progressed, it became clear that aura is not enough to win a title, and that, unbeknownst to Lakers fans, a team has to actually play together and win games to have a shot at making a deep playoff run. Similarly, it seems like the Warriors decided to self-sabotage, with Steph Curry getting injured seven times this season, Klay Thompson taking on a new role as the water boy, and Draymond Green deciding to make the on-court switch to MMA. To top it all off, the Warriors pulled off an all-time choke the play-in against their state rivals the Sacramento Kings, where Klay's four rings didn't stop him from shooting 0-10 or being blown out by 30 points. In contrast, the Phoenix Suns at least made the playoffs, and though Durant was exposed by a man who was starting elementary school as he was starting in the NBA, and Booker was proved unworthy of the NBA 2K23 cover, they can take minimal comfort in the fact that they got swept by the eventual Western Conference Finals runners-up.\n\n\"...a team has to actually play together and win games to have a shot at making a deep playoff run.\"\n\nNoticeably omitted from the discussion above were some other favourites to win the title, in the OKC Thunder, Denver Nuggets and LA Clippers as these were more unfortunate losses. The Thunder started strong as the first seed, met the Pelicans who were a straight sweep, but lost to the Mavs in two times three, almost won, but ended up losing by one. (Shai should make that his next Instagram caption, I hope you see what I did there...). Similarly, the reigning Denver Nuggets did all NBA fans a favour by sending the Lakers to Cancun in the first round, and pushed the Timberwolves to the final game of the series where they decided it was far enough and sulked the game away with 30 seconds left. Finally, the Clippers also started strong, after having the first season in years where both Paul George and Kawhi spent more time in basketball jerseys than Nike tech fleece. Yet it wasn't enough, as they crashed out to the eventual finalists in the Mavericks, with no help from Westbrook's now trademark single figure outing.\n\nAny NBA fan will have noticed by now that all teams mentioned to this point have been in the Western Conference. Any NBA fan will also know that the reason for that is because of the dire lack of competition in the Eastern Conference this season, where the first seeded Celtics were able to go a huge 14 games clear of the second seeded Knicks. Indeed - though unreliable, and unaccredited sources may make libellous claims that I stated Jalen Brunson to be the best guard in the league at a point - there really was no hindrance to the Celtics walking to the NBA finals. The lack of formidable competition in the Eastern Conference has led to the Celtics losing only two games so far in the postseason, whilst Jaylen Brown was able to dispel criticisms of his $300m dollar contact, winning the Eastern Conference Final MVP against a team who could neither prevent him from scoring 119 points against them, nor force him left. This has led to many critics noting how \"favourable\" their finals run has been, having not really been \"battle-tested.\"\n\nIn contrast, the Dallas Mavericks faced three of the formidable teams mentioned above, taking both the Clippers and Thunder to six games, and beating the Timberwolves in five, in a series that was closer than the numbers look, and duly reminding Anthony Edwards to be humble as it appears the insufferable Michael Jordan comparisons had inflated his head and weighed down his shooting hand in the closing games.\n\nSo, who really is the favourite to win it all? Again, critics have their cards on the Boston Celtics, who are 4/9 favourites whilst the Dallas Mavericks are 13/8 underdogs. This can only be expected with such a strong team, over half of which has NBA finals experience, whilst the other half includes a centre who resembles myself in stature, standing at an impressive 7 feet and 2 inches. Further, their achievement this season should not be downplayed, as winning 64 games to attain the first seed by such a large margin cannot be explained away by sheer luck, after all, it is the reason they were consistently ranked first in power rankings and favourites to go all the way as far back as April. Nevertheless, the Mavericks have shown that they are a force to be reckoned with, as Stan Van Gundy (controversially, yet not incorrectly) labelled Kyrie and Luka the \"most talented backcourt of all time,\" they should not be counted out before it has begun.\n\nWith this series being a chance for Tatum to get his first ring at only 19 years old, Brown to get the first of five rings that he promised Taylor Rooks he'd have in six years - six years ago, Luka to earn some respect and substantiate the LeBron comparisons, or Kyrie to get revenge against the team that scorned him and the institution that kept him out of the NBA 75 anniversary team, the stakes have never been higher. One thing is for sure, this series will go down to the wire, and is one not to miss.\n\nImage description: Boston Celtics in a previous Eastern Conference Finals", "source": {"uri":

I can't imagine that anyone who subscribes to LNIB doesn't already subscribe to GMIB, but the first three subscribers to respond as such will get a crack at them nonetheless.\n\nThere's no need for a big preamble here. The Finals begin tomorrow tonight. Here's what I'll be watching out for.\n\nIn the two regular-season games between Boston and Dallas, it was Jaylen Brown who drew the primary assignment on Luka Doncic, for the most part. Jrue Holiday spent a fair amount of time on him as well, but spent most of the games on Kyrie Irving.\n\nIt seems like a fair expectation that Boston will at least start the series that way, but one of the main reasons the Celtics are so good defensively is that they can come into a matchup like this with as many as three credible defenders for Doncic (Brown, Holiday, Jayson Tatum) and four for Irving (those three, plus Derrick White). You'd have to imagine that -- unless the initial plan works so spectacularly that there's no reason to change it -- we will see each and every one of those matchups for at least a stretch of possessions during this series.\n\nOf course, it's unlikely that the first thing Boston tries will work out so well that nothing needs to change. Luka can and has and will beat every single kind of defense you throw at him, whether individually or with his ability to map the entire floor in an instant and fire the exact right pass to the exact right target at the exact right time. He will use the Celtics' coverages against them and make them pay for whatever they try. The bigger question is whether he can break them to the point that they have to abandon their overall philosophy.\n\nBoston sent extra defenders at opposing actions less often than almost any team in the NBA this season. The Celtics had the league's ninth-least aggressive defense, according to the Aggression+ metric Krishna Narsu and I created; and they also had the fifth-least variable defense (Variance+), indicating that they did vary their level of aggressiveness from game to game all that often.\n\nOne of Boston's most aggressive defensive games of the season, though, came against Dallas in the one game these two teams played after the trade deadline. Specifically, it was the Celtics' second-most aggressive game of pick and roll defense all year, behind only an early-season game against the Timberwolves. Boston won that game going away, 138-110. The Mavs had a 112.6 offensive rating, the equivalent of a bottom-seven offense in the league. Luka pretty much tore them up with 37 points on 14 of 25 shooting and 11 assists, but the rest of the team couldn't hit shots: They went 6 of 25 combined from deep, with Irving and P.J. Washington shooting just 4 of 16.\n\nOf course, a lot of things were different about the Mavs in that game. Daniel Gafford and Derrick Jones Jr. were coming off the bench and Tim Hardaway Jr. got more minutes than the two of them combined. Josh Green started. Dante Exum and Maxi Kleber got a total of 35 minutes and Jaden Hardy got 3. How well this strategy would work in Dallas' new alignment is up for debate; but we know the Celtics are at least open to venturing outside their comfort zone to deal with all the problems Luka poses.\n\nAnd of course, that's just pick and roll defense. How to deal with Doncic when he draws White, Kristaps Porzingis, or Al Horford on a switch and into isolation is a whole different challenge. (With White, it's because of the sheer physicality. With Porzingis and Horford, it's the ability to hang with Doncic in space. We saw what he did to poor Rudy Gobert, and what he does to everyone else.) Send a second defender at him there, and it is a near-guarantee that he will make you pay for it. Don't send a second defender, and the same result is likely. There are no good options. There aren't even necessarily less bad ones. It's just a matter of finding something that works for a few possessions at a time until he cracks the code, then cycling to something else and hoping it lasts long enough before you have to change things up again.\n\nAnd even that is just Doncic. But we'll get to Irving more later on,\n\nShare Last Night, In Basketball\n\nI've seen a bunch of people assuming that Washington will guard Tatum. That's what happened the last time these two teams played, which was their only matchup after the trade deadline. But in that game, Jones came off the bench and played just 7 minutes. Three games later, he re-entered the starting lineup, and he has consistently been defending the opposing team's best perimeter player since then. It would be pretty surprising, at least to me, if he didn't get the first crack at guarding Tatum.\n\nJones has been tasked with guarding Paul George, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, and Anthony Edwards so far in these playoffs, and he has not only lived to tell about it, but done quite well in those matchups. SGA got the better of him, but George shot 41% from the field for the series against Dallas and was limited to only 19.5 points per game, while Edwards shot 43% and was held to 24.6 per game after averaging 31 and 28 per contest in his previous two series.\n\nWe've seen Tatum struggle with his shot for a lot of these playoffs. He's down at 44% from the field and just 29% from deep. That's not gonna cut it in this series. Jones has held his matchups to an expected effective field goal percentage of just 46.5% in the playoffs, according to Second Spectrum. That's the sixth-lowest mark among 49 players who have defended at least 500 half-court possessions. He has the length and agility to stick with and bother Tatum, at least in theory.\n\nBut Tatum should have a strength and physicality advantage over him, and that's where the second part of this question comes in. Tatum is at his best when fearlessly attacking the rim. Tatum's drives during the playoffs have been incredibly fruitful: They've generated 1.218 points per possession on plays where either Tatum or a teammate one pass away either shoots, draws a foul, or turns it over. That's third-best among 29 players with 75 or more drives during the postseason. He has the ability to do this pretty much whenever he wants, but too often settles for stepbacks and turnarounds and fadeaways. Again, that cannot happen here. He has to press the issue, get into Jones' chest, and go through him and into the lane.\n\nGetting to the rim is also a bellwether for Boston's offense in general. The Celtics took only 21.2% of their shots within three feet of the basket during the regular season, the league's fifth-lowest share. They converted those shots at an absurdly high clip (74.5%, fourth-best), which is partially a result of the low volume but also just frustrating because those are the easiest shots on the floor and the Celtics don't pursue them often enough.\n\nDallas during the playoffs has consistently closed off the rim for its opponents. Only 22.9% of the shots against Dallas have originated within three feet, and Maverick opponents have made only 64% of those shots. When either Daniel Gafford (45.2%) or Dereck Lively (49.3%) has been within five feet of both the shooter and the basket, according to NBA Advanced Stats, those conversion rates have been even lower.\n\nBoston needs to find a way to either draw those guys away from the rim -- a responsibility likely to fall to one of Kristaps Porzingis (more on him on a minute), Jrue Holiday, or Al Horford, for most of the series -- or else attack them without fear of failure, and try to get one or both of them into foul trouble and force the Mavs to try to protect the basket with somebody else.\n\nLet's see if you can spot the difference between Kyrie's stat lines in the three Western Conference playoff series:\n\nI'll make it easy for you: He was far less aggressive offensively in the series against Oklahoma City than he was against either the Clippers or Minnesota. I don't think it's a coincidence. Against OKC, he was tasked largely with guarding Jalen Williams. Physically, that's a really significant challenge for him. Much more so than guarding either James Harden or Mike Conley were in the other two rounds.\n\nHow the Mavs choose to deploy Kyrie defensively could have a significant impact on what he's able to bring on the other end of the floor. And that affects the matchups pretty much everywhere else. Want to use Gafford or Lively on Porzingis? That means P.J. Washington is probably on Jaylen Brown, and Irving has to spend a ton of time chasing Derrick White all over the place. Want to stash the center on Jrue Holiday? Well, now P.J. is probably on Porzingis and Kyrie has to deal with Jaylen's physicality. Can you put Kyrie on Holiday? Sure, but then who is Luka guarding?\n\nThere are tradeoffs no matter which way the Mavs choose to align. How physically taxed Irving gets by his matchup, and the knock-on effect of that taxing, is not something I have seen many people mention, but seems highly important here.\n\nThen there's the big health question.\n\nPorzingis ... did not seem to be all that confident in his status when talking to reporters on Tuesday. He was saying things like \"we'll see,\" hesitating a lot before declaring that he could run without pain, etc. Maybe that's gamesmanship, but maybe it's not. And if it's not, that seems like a pretty big problem.\n\nKP is Boston's big mismatch problem against good teams -- especially ones that want to shut off the paint like Dallas. His ability to hit from deep, and to get his shot off quickly (especially in comparison to Horford, whose shot takes forever to load), is how the Celtics punish those defenses better than almost any other team can. And when teams switch and try to guard Porzingis with a wing, that doesn't work anymore. It did when he was in Dallas; but these days, he is one of the most effective post- and isolation-mismatch scorers in the league, and he's become a much better passer when facing double teams in those situations as well. Oh, and he's an elite rim protector to boot. So, yeah, his health is a major factor.\n\nGive a gift subscription\n\nWashington, Jones, Green, Kleber, and Hardy have combined to shoot 38.3% from beyond the arc this postseason. During the regular season, that group shot 35.0%. That might not seem like a massive difference, but two or three makes per game that turn into misses can mean everything in a playoff series.\n\nWashington has knocked down multiple three in all but four playoff games after doing so just 33 times in 71 regular-season contests. (And 14 in 29 games with Dallas.) He made five or more six times in the regular season and three times in the playoffs. Jones made three or more threes nine times all year, and has done so three times in the playoffs. Green had a pair of games with three treys and Kleber had a game with five.\n\nObviously, these guys are all capable of making shots like this. They've done it in the games I mentioned. But the rate at which they're hitting and the frequency with which they're having better-than-expected single-game performances is out of line with career norms. That doesn't mean it can't continue. Anything can happen in a small sample. It already has to this point. Now the Mavs just need one or more of those guys to keep it going, both for the series at large and possibly within each individual game.\n\nFinally, quite often when games and series get close, they turn into a game of mismatch-hunting. Both teams have players who are eminently qualified to do said hunting, though Dallas' two (Doncic and Irving, duh) are better suited for that specific task than are Boston's (Tatum, Brown, kind of Porzingis).\n\nThe guys to hunt on the Celtics mostly either come off the bench (Horford, Hauser, maybe Payton Pritchard). The Mavericks' guys are less obvious targets (like Hardy) than they are players who they probably want to avoid getting caught in a specific situation (Gafford on any of the guards, Washington as the lone back-line help, Doncic one on one in space or guarding a screener, etc).", "source": {"uri": "lastnightinbasketball.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "lastnightinbasketball.com"}, "authors":

And who wins Finals MVP?", "body": "Ben Rohrbach: Jayson Tatum. Win, and he is a certified No. 1 for a title team, one of the three or four best players in the NBA and stamped forever as an all-time great. Lose, and he is not built for the biggest stage, somewhere outside the NBA's top five and an all-time also ran. At least until he plays his way back here. Luka Don\u010di\u0107 has built-in excuses as an underdog in his first foray into the Finals. Tatum is no longer afforded excuses.\n\nDan Devine: I was gonna say the NBA, what with the whole \"our media deal is coming up!\" thing, but it sounds like they're doing just fine on that score, thank you very much. So let's go with Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown -- less because they Desperately Need a Ring to Prove They're Good Enough, and more because I bet they sure would like to, at long last, shut everybody the hell up.\n\nVincent Goodwill: Tatum. The Celtics have had a charmed road to get here, very little atrophy and facing a game 5th seed, but a 5th seed. Kinda like the Nuggets last year. Tatum hasn't played up to expectations offensively but that can change here. If not now, when? If not him, then who? A lot is riding on the man who'll sign a $300 million deal this offseason. It's time to step into his destiny.\n\nTom Haberstroh: Boston's star duo. Tatum and Brown have gotten so close, and yet it feels so far. Tatum already seems fed up with the scrutiny. It'll pale in comparison to the ridicule if they fall short of a title again. They're young enough that they could be back, but that's what we said about Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant.\n\nDan Titus: Kyrie Irving. hasn't reached the NBA Finals since 2017. Irving's post-Cavs career has been marred by controversy, but he's on the path to redemption. His leadership and clutch performances helped the Mavs get to this point and what better way to rebuild his reputation than to win another championship. To see him flip the villain narrative in front of a vengeful Boston crowd would be fascinating.\n\nJake Fischer: Boston's ownership group. The Celtics have historically been able to pay top dollar and willing to pay the luxury tax for rosters that compete for championships. And yet, as the NBA's new second apron ramifications come into play, if Boston does not claim the title, will the Celtics have to start thinking about the enormity of their payroll without capturing that elusive 18th banner?\n\nGoodwill: Jrue Holiday. There's one player on the Celtics who knows what it's like to win a championship, to make defining plays in a championship series, his strip of Devin Booker and thunderous lob to Giannis in the swing Game 5 of the 2021 Finals. Now, his mission is to guard Kyrie Irving. It was also years ago, but he put Damian Lillard on punishment in 2018, when he was in NOLA. He connects this team with defense and savvy. Let's see if he replicates a championship showing one more time.\n\nFischer: P.J. Washington. The Mavericks' two-way forward was Dallas' bonafide third banana for much of the team's second-round win over OKC. He was the third player to take the main press conference podium stage at Wednesday's media day. But Washington's outside efficiency cratered during the Western Conference finals. And Dallas will need its fullest offensive arsenal -- that includes Washington keeping pace with Derrick White, Jrue Holiday, Al Horford and others in the corners -- to hang with Boston's scoring attack.\n\nDevine: Jrue Holiday. Maybe a two-time All-Star, six-time All-Defensive selection and NBA champion is a little too decorated to be designated an \"X-factor.\" But he'll bear a ton of defensive responsibility for trying to limit Kyrie Irving, and he might be the closest thing to safe harbor in Boston's top six if Dallas decides to try to junk things up by cross-matching its bigs away from guarding the returning Guy I'm Not Allowed to Mention. If Holiday strokes his jumpers and makes the right reads -- as he did throughout the Eastern playoffs, shooting 40% from deep with a 2.9-to-1 assist-to-turnover ratio -- the Celtics' league-best offense should keep humming. If he starts bricking, though -- as he did at times throughout his three postseasons as a Buck -- Dallas' defense might have something to exploit.\n\nRohrbach: Derrick White. He is lost in the discussion of the best players in the Finals. We talk about Tatum, Brown, Don\u010di\u0107 and Irving, who Jrue Holiday might guard and whether Porzi\u0146\u0123is will be healthy. We forget that White can also defend Irving and exploit the Mavericks' defense. He is averaging an 18-4-5 on 47/41/89 shooting splits in these playoffs, and he might be Boston's fourth or fifth option in this series.\n\nTitus: Dereck Lively II. If the Mavs are going to effectively deter Boston's 3-point barrage, they'll need Lively's versatility. Kleber lacks confidence and, unlike Daniel Gafford, Lively can handle switches and get out to contest on the perimeter. Lively's rebounding, rim protection and finishing are ahead of the curve for a rookie, but his short roll playmaking has been underrated all postseason. The too, so he'll be key to anchoring the Mavs' defense in this series.\n\nHaberstroh: Maxi Kleber. If he can knock done some threes, he might tilt the series. The Mavs desperately need him to be healthy. He can defend the stretch bigs of Boston while also making them pay on the other end. Should the 2022 Kleber arrive in the Finals, life will be so much easier for the Mavs.\n\nFischer: Kyrie Irving's performance in front of Boston's crowd. While he has grown and matured, the Celtics' home crowd isn't expected to hold back any venom for their reviled former point guard. Whether Irving stands up to the noise and delivers another incredible performance of these playoffs, or if he cannot find his rhythm at TD Garden, it will serve plenty of fodder for the instant reaction cycle.\n\nGoodwill: How the Dallas Mavericks went after Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is. He only seems but so confident in talking about how healthy he is, having not played in a month, and there's no mercy in the dojo of the Finals. The Mavericks will test him in switches, attack him with Luka and Kyrie. How he fares, and if he gets stronger through the series could be the tell.\n\nTitus: How great the C's look with Porzi\u0146\u0123is back in the lineup and how Jrue Holiday and Derrick White made it difficult for Luka Don\u010di\u0107 and Kyrie Irving to find a rhythm in Game 1. The media will press the panic button on the Mavs when in reality, it was a feel-out game with more adjustments coming ahead of Game 2.\n\nDevine: Adam Silver's updated timetable for a new round of NBA expansion and the return of the Seattle SuperSonics. Also, how good That Guy I'm Not Sure I'm Allowed to Mention looked after more than five weeks on the shelf, and how tough it's going to be to guard the C's when they can stay five-out all game long.\n\nHaberstroh: Porzi\u0146\u0123is' minutes. The Zinger's calf will be the biggest question mark in the series, and something tells me one game won't provide all the answers. It's not an ideal time to be testing an injured soleus muscle. Boston's margin for error has never been thinner.\n\nRohrbach: Coaching. Either Boston fans will be furious that Joe Mazzulla did not design a defense that prevented Don\u010di\u0107 from torching the Celtics, or Dallas fans will wonder why Jason Kidd could not prevent a deluge from the 3-point line. After a long layoff, one team will not match the other's force, and everyone will be screaming: You had a week to prepare for this series. How could you not be ready? Write it down.\n\nDevine: C'mon, man -- I just wrote, like, a whole thing about this. OK, fine: Celtics in 6, Tatum for MVP, Deuce for The Real MVP, and Luke Kornet for Parade MVP (pending).\n\nRohrbach: Celtics in 6, and Tatum is your Finals MVP. Don\u010di\u0107 is the best player in the series, but Boston has too many weapons, and the Mavericks have one stopper: Derrick Jones Jr., who gives up size and strength to Tatum. Brown captured Eastern Conference finals MVP honors, but it is Tatum's turn. There are too many holes on the perimeter for him to exploit, and the Celtics have just enough options to make Don\u010di\u0107 work.\n\nFischer: Mavericks in 6. From covering both of these teams during different stretches of their playoff runs, Dallas has felt in person like the bigger, stronger and nastier team. The Celtics surely boast the stronger talent. It will prove box-office viewing if the Mavericks' rangy, physical defense can grind this opponent's high-wire offense -- as Dallas did manage vs. OKC and Minnesota. Don\u010di\u0107 is ready to add Finals MVP to his trophy case.\n\nHaberstroh: Mavericks in 7. How do you say Most Valuable Player in Slovenian? Luka Don\u010di\u0107. Because of the East's inferiority and postseason injury luck, Boston hasn't faced a team half as good as this Mavs team. This feels like the 2021 Finals where the team with the best player coming into his prime -- Milwaukee and Giannis Antetokounmpo -- takes down the team with the vastly better regular-season record, the Suns.\n\nTitus: Celtics in 7. The series will go at least six games, with Boston winning its 18th championship on its home court. Luka Don\u010di\u0107 will have his moments, but the Celtics' 3-point shooting plus Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is tip the series in favor of Boston. As such, Jayson Tatum will finally rise to the occasion and win Finals MVP -- capping off one of the Celtics' best seasons in franchise history.\n\nGoodwill: Mavericks in 6. It would be the most compelling finish, sending the Celtics into an offseason of questions. Honestly, I've changed my mind a million times. It could be Celtics in 5, Celtics in 7, finally getting over the hump and living up to their talent. But the most reliable star here is Luka Don\u010di\u0107, who might get a standing ovation from the friendly Celtics crowd before it's over. Sticking with Mavericks in 6, with Don\u010di\u0107 winning Finals MVP.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Boston's Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are the Celtics' most tenured and scrutinized stars and see it as a chance at redemption after falling short in the Finals just two seasons ago and then failing to return last year. Dallas' Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving see it as their first opportunity to make good on a partnership that began late last season after Irving was traded from Brooklyn following a tumultuous run of two-plus seasons with the Nets.\n\nThe NBA Finals were too late for Dallas' Luka Doncic to watch as a kid. Now, he's in them\n\nBOSTON (AP) -- Luka Doncic didn't stay up all night to watch NBA Finals games as a kid. They usually started at something like 3 a.m. in his native Slovenia. He had school to get to a few hours later. He'd wake up and find out who won. Make no mistake, though: Doncic was paying attention. The 25-year-old makes his NBA Finals debut for the Dallas Mavericks when they take on the Boston Celtics in Game 1 of this year's title series on Thursday night. He could become the first player to win a scoring title and a championship in the same season since Shaquille O'Neal in 2000.\n\nPro athletes understand gambling on their games is a non-negotiable no-no. Some learned the hard way\n\nBOSTON (AP) -- Professional athletes get told at the start of every season that if they gamble on their games, the consequences are severe. This spring they've gotten a more personal reminder, with both the NBA and Major League Baseball banning players for life. Padres infielder Tucupita Marcano was permanently banned this week for betting on games he was involved in. The NBA banished Raptors forward Jontay Porter in April. Other players say they should have known better. Marcano was the first active baseball player in a century banned for life for gambling. MLB said he placed hundreds of bets totaling more than $150,000 on baseball in 2022 and 2023.\n\nNBA Finals Notebook: Porzingis a go, Kyrie and LeBron make nice, Hardaway Jr. throws shade at dad\n\nBOSTON (AP) -- Celtics 7-footer Kristaps Porzingis said he will be ready to \"just go out there and hoop\" for Game 1 of the NBA Finals on Thursday night after missing Boston's last 10 games with a strained left calf. Porzingis said he couldn't predict how it will be once he gets into a game for the first time since April 29. An offseason acquisition that helped solidify the Celtics frontcourt, Porzingis averaged 20 points, 7.2 rebounds and almost two blocks per game. But he was again dogged by injuries that limited him to 57 games. He left Game 4 of the first-round series against the Miami Heat and missed all of the next two rounds.\n\nCam Sutton is getting a second chance with the Steelers following domestic violence incident\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) -- Cameron Sutton is getting a second chance in the NFL with the Pittsburgh Steelers. The Steelers have signed the veteran defensive back to a one-year deal. The agreement comes more than two months after he was released by the Detroit Lions for his involvement in an alleged domestic violence incident in Florida. Sutton eventually surrendered to authorities and entered a pretrial diversion program after the charges were reduced from a felony to misdemeanor battery.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nWNBA rescinds second technical foul that was assessed to Angel Reese\n\nThe WNBA announced that it's rescinded the second technical foul on Chicago rookie Angel Reese that occurred with 2:31 left in the loss to the New York Liberty on Tuesday night. Reese was thrown out of the game after receiving two technical fouls following a brief interaction with official Charles Watson. The rookie forward appeared to say something to Watson and then quickly waved her hand. Head official Maj Forsberg said in a pool report that Reese's technical fouls were for \"disrespectfully addressing\" the official and then for \"waving her hand in dismissal.\" Reese finished with 13 points and 10 rebounds.\n\nInside NBC's Olympics bet on pop culture in Paris, with help from Snoop Dogg and Cardi B\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) -- NBC has partnered with several entertainers and non-Olympic athletes like Megan Thee Stallion, Dolly Parton and Peyton Manning to promote the Paris Games this summer. The network wants to build anticipation and entice more viewers after drawing lackluster ratings following the Games in Beijing and Tokyo. NBC wants attract more viewers by bringing Olympic stories to life through the most popular and diverse personalities. Some of the big names involved include Snoop Dogg, Cardi B, Kevin Hart, Lily Collins and Kelly Clarkson.\n\nCole to make at least 2 more minor league starts, on track for possible Yankees' return in June\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Gerrit Cole is likely to make at least two more minor league rehabilitation starts, putting the AL Young Award winner on track for a possible return to the New York Yankees' rotation in mid-to-late June. Cole said he felt fine a day after his first rehab outing, a 45-pitch effort over 3 1/3 scoreless innings for Double-A Somerset on Tuesday night. Manager Aaron Boone says \"at least a couple more\" and adds: \"I don't know how many. Is that two? Is it three?\" Cole and Boone weren't ready to commit to Cole's next outing.\n\nEkblad, Reinhart, Draisaitl and Bennett were drafted together. They'll now play for the Cup together\n\nFORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- This seems so fitting. It was 10 years ago this month when Aaron Ekblad, Sam Reinhart, Leon Draisaitl and Sam Bennett were clearly the top four players entering the 2014 NHL Draft, though nobody knew what the order of their selection was going to be. They all went through the draft process together. Posed for photos together, some in Philadelphia Phillies jerseys -- the draft was in Philly that year -- and some in suits. They even dined together a few times. And now, they're going to the Stanley Cup Final together.\n\nSchauffele now a major champion at Memorial and facing a big stretch of golf\n\nDUBLIN, Ohio (AP) -- Xander Schauffele was able to take a few weeks off after claiming his first major at the PGA Championship. He came to realize he's still the same person and his life hasn't changed. Now he returns to the Memorial to face a tough stretch of golf. The Memorial is a signature event with a top field and big purse. Then it's off to the U.S. Open at Pinehurst No. 2 and then another signature event at the Travelers Championship. Tournament host Jack Nicklaus isn't thrilled with a new date for the Memorial that pushes it right up against a major.", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Springs

They don't hang up any other banners but championship ones. And now I'm a part of it.\"\n\nA blockbuster 2007 trade for Garnett changed the Celtics, who gave up seven players to get a 31-year-old big man.\n\nA trade for Allen in the same year positioned Boston for Finals greatness.\n\nBut after the Celtics hung their 17th --- and, as of now, last -- banner in the rafters, Boston's Big Four gradually split apart.\n\n\"As years have gone on, things have been fractured, and I hate it,\" Rivers told ESPN in 2018. \"I hate seeing it.\n\nMuch of the bitterness centered around Allen, who fell out with Garnett and Rondo.\n\nWhen Pierce's jersey was retired by the Celtics, Garnett and Rondo attended the ceremony but Allen didn't.\n\nAllen's 2018 induction into the Basketball Hall of Fame also became a question mark for the 2008 Celtics.\n\n\"I would love this [to be a] celebration for Ray. Not a lot to say here about it,\" Rivers said. \"Ray won us a title. He really did.\n\n\"I think he should be celebrated. I think he should be celebrated in Boston,\" Rivers said. \"He's responsible for that banner.\n\n\"If I had one wish, I wish I could do a better job of getting that group back together. I can get a lot of them back together; I just can't get the whole group.\n\n\"There really should be because they were so close, and it really hurts me to see what's going on.\"\n\nPierce wore gold chains with the famous Celtics logo around his neck at a playoff game at TD Garden earlier in the playoffs.\n\nThe 2008 Finals MVP, who grew up hating Boston, learned to love all the green.\n\n\"I was an avid basketball fan. And growing up in Los Angeles, Inglewood, down the street from The Forum, I couldn't stand the Celtics,\" Pierce told ESPN in 2019.\n\n\"I hated the Celtics so much. You understand the rivalry. I hated Larry Bird, I hated everything about the Celtics.\"\n\nThere have been positive signs that some old wounds from 2008 have healed.\n\nWhen Garnett's name was featured in trade rumors before the 2013 season, the future Hall of Famer said, \"I bleed green. I die green.\"\n\nBut as years became a full decade, it was clear that Boston's triumph in the 2008 Finals ultimately couldn't hold the Big Four of Pierce, Garnett, Allen and Rondo together.\n\nJayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown and the Celtics will attempt to take down Luka Doncic and the Dallas Mavericks in the 2024 Finals, and win Boston's first trophy in 16 years.\n\nFor many Celtics fans, seeing the Big Four from 2008 happily reunited would be enough of a triumph in the Finals.", "source": {"uri": "talksport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "talkSPORT"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brian_t_smith@talksport.com", "name": "Brian T.

They understood what it took to get over the hump. That was really a special team that didn't make many mistakes, obviously well-coached.\n\n\"They've just been there before. In some of those tough moments, when I go back and look, you can tell that they had been there before. It was a lesson to be learned. I told myself that if I ever got the opportunity again to make it to the Finals, never take it for granted. Obviously, we're here now. Thankful to be here. I'm excited to get ready to play and have fun tomorrow.\"\n\nAnd while some never look back on getting that close to their ultimate dream, only to see someone else live it, Brown revealed on Wednesday that it's a series he's studied several times since seeing Golden State celebrate a championship on the TD Garden parquet.\n\n\"I've watched it a few times now, maybe four or five times,\" shared the three-time All-Star. \"As well as last year's conference finals. I think you can always learn from anything, really.\n\n\"But just being able to watch those moments and learn from them, how to manage your emotions, like, what you would have did differently potentially. I don't think that's bad to look at and acknowledge and be aware of. So I would say a few times at least I've watched the Finals, the whole thing, all the way through.\"\n\nIn the two years since then, Brown has evolved. He's enjoyed an All-NBA campaign and delivered the best season of his career this year as an encore. He's diagnosing defenses quicker to stay a step ahead, made significant strides as a facilitator, is even more lethal in transition, and he's shut down some of the best perimeter players in the league, including Curry.\n\nThose skills were on display in the closing moments of the Eastern Conference Finals when the Marietta, Georgia native swatted an Andrew Nembhard layup to help preserve the Celtics' lead, then engaged four Pacers' defenders before finding Derrick White for the game-winning corner three that propelled Boston to the championship round.\n\nIt's not just the Celtics' stars who have grown. White, like Brown, is enjoying the best campaign of his career. And Brad Stevens has equipped this team with the most talented top six in the Association, acquiring Kristaps Porzingis and Jrue Holiday. Those moves reshaped Boston's core and brought more balance, helping maximize its All-Star tandem.\n\nWhile discussing how he and the Celtics have grown since 2022, Brown expressed, \"You learn and grow from your experiences, from being a 25-year-old to being a 27-year-old is a big difference. Yeah, I'm 27,\" he said while flashing a smile.\n\n\"You learn from those experiences. We got a different team. We got a different coach, too, as well. We had Ime Udoka; now we have Joe Mazzulla. We had Marcus Smart (and) Rob Williams; (now) we have Jrue Holiday (and) Kristaps Porzingis. Different team, different coach, two years later makes a pretty big difference.\"\n\nAs Tatum and Brown try to break through to their first NBA title, they're also dealing with reaching the Eastern Conference Finals five times in their first seven years together, coming within two wins of Banner 18, but not yet breaking through to a championship in a sports-crazed region where that's the standard.\n\n\"You know the answer to that,\" said Tatum when asked if playing for this franchise, given its history, comes with more pressure to deliver championships. \"Of course, right? We only hang NBA championship banners, right? 17 of them.\n\n\"Some of the greatest players to ever play this game wore this uniform. All of us are honored to follow in their footsteps, the way they paved for us to live out our dream. Essentially, yeah, if you want to be one of the greats to put on this uniform, every great before you won a championship. That's what we try to play for every single season. The expectations are obviously different here. It takes special players to be here and to be a part of an environment like that.\"\n\nTatum and Brown, finally playing in their primes together, have a chance to go down as two of the greatest players in franchise history. While there's no telling what the future holds, doing so likely requires them to apply what they've learned and how they've grown since the 2022 NBA Finals to influence a different result this time.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_O'Brien_Championship_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marietta,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marietta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Marietta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Mazzulla", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Mazzulla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ime_Udoka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ime Udoka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Smart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Smart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Stevens", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brad Stevens"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5779,h_3250,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/inside_the_celtics/01hzn02myc8hv82s15tx.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

I think that will add a lot to our legacy as a team, but as of right now, that story is still kind of untold.\"\n\nAnother factor is that the Celtics seek an unprecedented 18th NBA crown, one more than the all-time record they share with the rival Los Angeles Lakers.\n\n\"Some of the greatest players to ever play this game wore this uniform. We're honored to follow in their footsteps. They paved the way for us to live out our dreams,\" said Tatum.\n\n\"If you want to be one of the greats to put on this uniform, every great before you won a championship. It takes special players to be part of an environment like that.\"\n\nOne of those is Jrue Holiday, who won a 2021 NBA title with Milwaukee and was obtained in a trade deal just before the season began.\n\n\"To be a part of history would be cool, the history the Celtics have,\" Holiday said. \"To add to that is part of the reason I was brought here -- and part of the reason I wanted to come.\"\n\n'The will to win'\n\nThe defensive standout sees something special in the Celtics, who led the NBA with 64 wins this season.\n\n\"The pressure JB and JT have to take on is something different,\" Holiday said. \"It's really impressive how they handle themselves.\n\n\"I know sometimes talent doesn't mesh together but this does. You saw it in the regular season. You've seen it in the playoffs. Any given night we sacrifice for each other. we're unselfish and I think that's what makes it go.\"\n\n\"And then it's just the will to win. They've been to the Eastern Conference finals a million times and they have been to the finals so they've been to the top, just didn't execute the way they wanted.\n\n\"Now that we're here, we want to get the job done.\"\n\nTatum appreciates the finals more after losing to Miami in seven games in last year's East finals.\n\n\"Last year we took that for granted and we didn't make it to the finals. Put things in prespective,\" Tatum said.\n\n\"You could see our excitement when we won the conference (this year). That's not the be-all, end-all but it really is tough to get to this moment.\n\n\"I'm staying in the moment. I'm not thinking of what this would mean to my legacy or anything like that.

We're here to share our NBA Finals odds series and make a Jaylen Brown NBA Finals points-per-game prediction and pick while predicting what he will do.\n\nBrown is back in the NBA Finals after failing to capture the Larry O'Brien Championship two seasons ago. Now, he is looking to finish the story after he was on the team that lost in six games to the Golden State Warriors. It's important to note that Brown averaged 23.5 points per game in those games, which happens to be the point spread for this series. Thus, he gets a chance to match it or even do more.\n\nBrown has shown what he is capable of doing in these playoffs. Ultimately, he is very dangerous around the post and in the paint and can definitely take over a game. The Celtics hope he can produce some points to give them a chance at their 18th championship.\n\nHere are the NBA Finals odds, courtesy of FanDuel.\n\nNBA Finals Odds: Jaylen Brown Points Per Game Odds\n\nBrown exploded for 33 points in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Quarterfinals against the Miami Heat. Then, he hit 25 points in Game 5 while shooting 11 for 19 to help the Celtics close out the series. Brown averaged 22.8 points per game in that series, which was less than what the spread would be for this series.\n\nBut he turned it up slightly in the Eastern Conference Semifinals against the Cleveland Cavaliers. Amazingly, he started hot with 32 points in Game 1 while shooting 12 for 18. Brown also finished with 28 points while shooting 13 for 17 in Game 3. Then, he managed 27 points while shooting 9 for 15. The Celtics won the games where he managed 25 or more points. Thus, it illustrated how important he is to the team and what he can contribute. Brown finished with 23.4 points per game in that series.\n\nBut the Western Conference Finals was where Brown truly shined. First, he managed 26 points while shooting 10 for 20. Brown erupted for 40 points while shooting 14 for 27 in Game 2. Then, he had 24 points while shooting 10 for 18 in Game 3 before finishing with 29 points on 11 for 22 shooting in Game 4.\n\nBrown averaged 29.75 points over these four games while helping the Celtics complete a four-game sweep of the Indiana Pacers. Overall, his shooting was on point, and there was little resistance. His ability to hit his shot from anywhere on the court made him a threat, and he was able to capitalize on every opportunity he received. Likewise, he seems to be getting better with every game.\n\nBrown will hit the over because the Celtics are relying on him more than ever as they try and secure their 18th championship. Moreover, there will be more pressure on Jayson Tatum, which may open up some opportunities for Brown.\n\nWhy Jaylen Brown Will Hit the Under\n\nBut Brown has also had some games where he struggled to do anything. Unfortunately, the one slight on him is that he sometimes disappears from games.\n\nBrown had 17 points while shooting 6 for 12 in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Quarterfinals against the Heat. Later, he had 17 points in Game 4 while shooting 7 for 18. The inconsistency he showed in that series illustrated why it's difficult to trust him to hit his marks. Overall, he averaged 22.8 points per game in that series, which was below par.\n\nWhile Brown did do better in the Eastern Conference Semifinals against the Cavs, he also had two games where he went under 20 points. First, he had 19 points while shooting 7 for 17 in a Game 2 loss. Brown also managed just 11 points while shooting 4 for 9 in the Game 5 series clincher.\n\nBrown is a talented player who will definitely put up points. However, this team is also incredibly loaded, and the return of Kristaps Porzingis may threaten his scoring totals.\n\nBrown will hit the under because he is too inconsistent. Then, the return of Porzingis, along with the prescience of other talented players may hinder his scoring.\n\nFinal Jaylen Brown Points Per Game Prediction\n\nHow will Brown do in the second go-round? Remember, the Celtics acquired Porzingis and Jrue Holiday because they knew they needed extra weapons to have a shot at winning the championship. Because of this, those extra weapons may take away some points from Brown. There may be some games where he scores a lot of points. However, he may fall just short of expectations, regardless of how well the Celtics play.\n\nClick here for more betting news and predictions", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rb_hayek@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Rb Hayek", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2022 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Point (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Murder-Mystery_and_Deduction", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Murder-Mystery and Deduction", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Jaylen-Brown-NBA-Finals-points-per-game-prediction-odds.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

This go-around, it's Boston Celtics returning back to the title game for the second time in three seasons, facing up against a red-hot Luka Doncic, Kyrie Irving and the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nIt looks to be an electric, competitive series on the way, and as with any Finals series, many fans have begun to submit their predictions for how things will fare across the coming two weeks. Even a few members of the\u00c2 New England Patriotshave started to get involved in their forecasts of who they think might come out on top.\n\nOf course, you knew Patriots' rookie QB and recent third-overall pick Drake Maye had to get involved in the Finals action.Considering he's amajorhoops fan, as well as\u00c2 a former player back in\u00c2 his high school days, it's no surprise to see him invested in Boston's latest title run.\n\nIt wasn't long ago this offseason we saw Maye sitting courtside during the playoffs in TD Garden to cheer on the Celtics, and heading into these Finals, it seems like his support is only looking to grow larger.\n\nNBCS Boston caught up with Maye during the Patriots' practice earlier this week, where the rookie quarterback kept it simple on his official Finals prediction ahead of Game One. Spoiler alert: he likes the Celtics to win it.\n\n\"Yeah! Celtics, man. Celtics in five. I like it in five! Come on, let's go.\"\n\nAs a newly-ingrained member of New England, it would be treason for Maye to rep anyone but the Celtics in this year's Finals. Luckily, he passed the test with flying colors, and foresees the boys in green taking care of business quickly to hoist the Larry O'Brien.

He's made three All-Star teams and an All-NBA team. If that's not enough, the Celtics have made six Eastern Conference Finals and will start their second NBA Finals berth in the last three years.\n\nBrown has played a hand in their consistent success year in and year out. Yet, certain Celtics alumni feel he doesn't get enough recognition. Ex-Celtic Lamar Stevens had some strong words for his former Celtics teammate. Stevens had the following to say about Brown via his X account.\n\n\"JB gotta be the most over looked superstar in the league...i 100% get why he feel this way,\" Stevens wrote.\n\nStevens wrote that in response to Brown admitting that he feels like he doesn't get enough credit. The two played together for the Celtics during the 2023-24 season before they traded Stevens to the Memphis Grizzlies.\n\nAfter the Celtics traded Stevens to Memphis, the wing broke out in a bigger role. In 19 games, Stevens averaged 11.5 points and 5.1 rebounds while shooting 44.6% from the field.\n\nStevens tweeted this in response to a Celtics video featuring Brown giving his honest thoughts on being underrated. Brown talked about how little appreciation he's felt he's gotten as a player.\n\n\"For various reasons, I feel like I don't get the credit or respect that I have earned, and I'm at the point in my life where, just, I don't give a (expletive). I might never get it, and I'm okay with that,\" Brown said.\n\nHe included that he's ready to show those who believe and those who doubt him.\n\n\"I am who I am, I do what I do, and I believe what I believe in. So, the ones who with me, let's rock and roll, and the ones who aren't can kiss my (expletive) pretty much.\"\n\nBecause he's achieved so much, it's easy to forget that the Celtics' selection of Brown was divisive at the time. Brown did not come into the league unanimously believed to be a star in the making. He flashed his potential in his rookie season, but he didn't show much because the Celtics never asked him to.\n\nAs his role with the Celtics has grown, Brown has thrived with what they've asked of him. He may not get the same shine that Jayson Tatum does, but the Celtics have always shown their faith in him.\n\nESPN Analyst Doris Burke pushed back on the narrative that Tatum was envious of Brown winning the 2024 Eastern Conference MVP award.\n\n\"I've never understood and pushed back as hard as my opportunity would allow on the narratives surrounding this young man,\" Burke said of Tatum in a conference call with select media, including Heavy Sports on Monday, June 3. \"He's 26 years old. He's played, I believe, 102 playoff games with Jaylen Brown. They have achieved an incredible measure of success at 26 and 27 years old.\"\n\nNot only that, but Burke believes Tatum can be happy for his teammate and aspire for greatness.\n\n\"And I do not believe that it's mutually exclusive that he can be thrilled that Jaylen Brown was named the Eastern Conference Finals MVP and still has a level of personal ambition. That's what pushes that young man to greatness.\"\n\nThis narrative was rooted in pure conjecture with no objective facts.

He is an elite playmaker, scorer, rebounder and underrated defender. However, Tatum's jump-shooting struggles have received him significant criticism throughout the season, and the noise only got louder during the playoffs.\n\nDuring a recent interview, ESPN's JJ Redick admitted that the current narratives surrounding Tatum are nothing more than nit-picking. Nevertheless, that's the sort of criticism that comes with being among the 10 best players in the NBA, especially when you're about to appear on the biggest stage in the world.\n\n\"As far as Tatum, again, I think with great players comes nitpicking, and it feels all very nitpicky to me,\" Redick said. \"You know, he's, I think, played really well in the playoffs...His ability to defend; his ability to rebound the basketball. Doris and I agree on this: He's certainly at his best when he puts his head down and gets to the basket and creates havoc that way.\"\n\nTatum is playing a veteran brand of basketball. He's allowing the game to come to him. He makes the right read on every trip down the court. And he never gets flustered when the opposing defense looks to pressure him with blitzes or hard hedges.\n\nNevertheless, Tatum's performances will continue to be scrutinized. Boston is expected to overcome the Dallas Mavericks in the NBA Finals, and Tatum will shoulder a heavy offensive and defensive load. However, if he can add a championship ring to his budding resume, the criticism will quickly vanish.\n\nSubscribe to the \"Celtics Chronicle\" podcast on:\n\nApple Podcasts: https://apple.co/3UAVYRg\n\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/3y0H4Lh\n\nYouTube: https://bit.ly/3QnlPcS\n\nSubstack: https://bit.ly/3WoA0Cf\n\nMore .News\n\nFormer Celtics fan favorite believes Mavericks have the best duo\n\nKyrie Irving discusses 2022 altercation with Boston Celtics fans\n\nReport: Porzingis expected to play in Game 1 of NBA Finals", "source": {"uri": "celticswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Celtics Wire"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substack", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Substack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spotify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://celticswire.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/39/2024/05/23401340.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

He played all 48 minutes, shot 22-for-46 overall and made 17 of 19 free throw attempts in a 126-121 win. Though the Lakers wound up losing the series in seven games, Baylor holds the Finals record for most points in a series with 284.\n\nBaylor is one of just seven players to ever score 50 or more points in a Finals game. Giannis Antetokounmpo is the most recent star to reach that number, doing so in a series-clinching Game 6 win for the Milwaukee Bucks over the Phoenix Suns in 2021.\n\nThe best 3-point shooter in NBA history is also the best 3-point shooter in NBA Finals history.\n\nSteph Curry holds the all-time and single-game records for most 3-point attempts and makes in the NBA Finals. He set the single-game marks in Game 2 of the 2018 Finals, where the Golden State Warriors guard went 9-for-17 from 3-point range in a 122-103 rout over the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nAlong with the nine 3-pointer game, Curry also drained seven 3s in six Finals contests, two of which came in the 2022 Finals against the Celtics.\n\nJust like his team won most of their Finals matchups, Bill Russell edged Wilt Chamberlain for the most rebounds in an NBA Finals game.\n\nRussell has two Finals games with 40 rebounds. The first came in 1960 against the St. Louis Hawks and the second came against the Lakers in Game 7 of the 1962 Finals. By comparison, Chamberlain's highest rebounding total for a Finals game was 38, a number he reached twice.\n\nRussell and Chamberlain have an overwhelming presence in the Finals rebounding records. The two centers combined for 73 of the top 100 single-game rebounding outputs in Finals history: 48 from Russell and 25 from Chamberlain.\n\nIt should come as no surprise that Magic Johnson's name is all over the NBA Finals assists records.\n\nThere have been just six times in Finals history that a player has tallied 19 or more assists in a game, and five of them came from Johnson. His highest total came in Game 3 of the 1984 Finals, where he dished out 21 assists in a 137-104 win over the Celtics.\n\nAlong with the most assists in an NBA Finals game, Johnson also holds the record for most turnovers in a Finals game.\n\nJohnson turned it over 10 times against the Philadelphia 76ers in Game 5 of the 1980 Finals, which came during his rookie season. The Lakers star struggled with his turnovers and shooting, but he still picked up a triple-double in a 108-103 victory.\n\nJohnson also holds the second-highest mark for turnovers in a Finals game. He turned it over nine times in the Sixers' Game 4 clincher over the Lakers in the 1983 Finals.\n\nSeven is a significant NBA Finals number for Robert Horry.\n\nFirst and foremost, Horry won seven championships in his career. The first two came with the Houston Rockets, the middle three came with the Lakers and the last two came with the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nOn top of that, Horry holds an NBA Finals record involving the number seven. He became the first and only player in league history to pick up seven steals in a Finals game, doing so in Game 2 of the 1995 Finals. The Rockets won that game 117-106 en route to a sweep over the Orlando Magic.\n\nThe 2009 Finals did not go Dwight Howard's way, but he still made some history during the series.\n\nThe Magic center set an NBA Finals record with nine blocks in a Game 4 loss to the Lakers. He also added 16 points and 21 rebounds, but Orlando fell 99-91 and lost the series in the following game.\n\nPrior to Howard's nine-block performance, five Hall of Famers shared the Finals record with eight blocks in a game: Tim Duncan, Shaquille O'Neal, Patrick Ewing, Hakeem Olajuwon and Bill Walton.", "source": {"uri": "nbcsandiego.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC 7 San Diego"},

For Boston, it's Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown looking to fulfill the promise of their pairing and finally quiet the never-ending questions about whether the two star wings can win a title together. For Dallas, it's Luka Doncic looking to fully assert himself as one of the league's absolute elite stars, lifting the Mavs to their second championship at 25 years old.\n\nAhead of Game 1, ESPN released a terrific promo video that isolated Doncic and Tatum in two of their biggest moments from the conference finals, highlighting the road taken to get both teams to this point.\n\nFor Doncic, they went with his instant classic game-winner from Game 2 when he danced on Rudy Gobert and put a dagger in the Wolves heart over the DPOY. For Tatum, it was his late overtime three that helped put Game 1 on ice in a stunning fourth quarter and OT comeback against the Pacers that set them on course for a sweep.\n\nAs the Finals arrive, we'll see if Tatum and Doncic get the chance to author more late-game heroics, and which star (or surprising hero) steps up to lead their team to a championship.", "source": {"uri": "uproxx.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UPROXX"}, "authors": [{"uri": "derrick_rossignol@uproxx.com", "name": "Derrick Rossignol", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "aaron_williams@uproxx.com", "name": "Aaron Williams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "uproxx_music@uproxx.com", "name": "Uproxx Music", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "wongo_okon@uproxx.com", "name": "Wongo Okon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "grant_sharples@uproxx.com", "name": "Grant Sharples", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gobert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/finals-promo.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

Both sides come loaded with firepower that could allow them to end their respective franchise's title drought.\n\nEveryone expected the Celtics to make it to the Finals. But not many thought that the Mavs would match up with them. Luka Doncic finally has a team around him that can do damage. As good as Boston is, it won't be an easy task to tamper Doncic and Dallas' high-octane offense.\n\nOklahoma City Thunder forward Jalen Williams said on The Old Man and the Three, hosted by not-coach of the Los Angeles Lakers, JJ Redick, that the Mavs have a tendency to go on \"loud\" runs that can destabilize opponents. Williams saw this firsthand when his squad fell to Dallas in the second round.\n\n\"The biggest thing with them is they go on really loud runs because of the rate they shoot threes,\" he said. \"So when they're up 10, it's really easy to kind of panic and get out of what works for you. I think there were points in our game where we did that and tried to force a couple of things and now 10 is 15, and you're just playing from behind the whole game. So up 10, down 10, you just got to stick with it and whatever your game plan is, just live and die by that.\"\n\nThe Mavs' offensive rating in the fourth quarter of this year's postseason is the second-highest at 121.1. The Miami Heat rank above them but only because they played in so many blowout losses that the final frame didn't matter. This Dallas team always seems to come up with a bucket when it needs to. When games come down to the wire, their execution has been top-notch.\n\nMavericks' high-powered offense powering NBA Finals run\n\nAs Williams said, the Mavs do take a lot of threes. Over 40 percent of their field-goal attempts in this year's playoffs have come from deep, one of just four teams to cross that mark. They have shot 37.2 percent on those threes, tied for the fourth-best mark in these playoffs. When you have talent like Doncic and Kyrie Irving creating those looks and benefiting from the space those shooters create, it's not easy to stop.\n\nWhat makes things interesting is that the Celtics could have a similar impact given how many threes they shoot. They sit atop the leaderboard in three-point-attempt rate for the 2024 playoffs with over 47 percent of their shots coming from downtown. Those shots go in at a 36.8-percent clip. Boston routinely plays five players who can shoot, including former Maverick Kristaps Porzingis, and likewise can explode on offense with an onslaught of triples.\n\nThe Celtics have a lot of tough defenders of various sizes and the shot-creators to hang with the Mavericks' stellar duo. But when the clock strikes winning time, will they be able to come together and make the necessary plays? That will be the ultimate test that determines if they can finish the job.\n\nGame 1 of the 2024 NBA Finals will be on Thursday at 8:30 P.M. EST at TD Garden.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sam_digiovanni@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Sam DiGiovanni", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Jayson-Tatum-Jalen-Williams-Luka-Doncic.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

Boston's Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are the Celtics' most tenured and scrutinized stars and see it as a chance at redemption after falling short in the Finals just two seasons ago and then failing to return last year. Dallas' Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving see it as their first opportunity to make good on a partnership that began late last season after Irving was traded from Brooklyn following a tumultuous run of two-plus seasons with the Nets.\n\nThe NBA Finals were too late for Dallas' Luka Doncic to watch as a kid. Now, he's in them\n\nBOSTON (AP) -- Luka Doncic didn't stay up all night to watch NBA Finals games as a kid. They usually started at something like 3 a.m. in his native Slovenia. He had school to get to a few hours later. He'd wake up and find out who won. Make no mistake, though: Doncic was paying attention. The 25-year-old makes his NBA Finals debut for the Dallas Mavericks when they take on the Boston Celtics in Game 1 of this year's title series on Thursday night. He could become the first player to win a scoring title and a championship in the same season since Shaquille O'Neal in 2000.\n\nPro athletes understand gambling on their games is a non-negotiable no-no. Some learned the hard way\n\nBOSTON (AP) -- Professional athletes get told at the start of every season that if they gamble on their games, the consequences are severe. This spring they've gotten a more personal reminder, with both the NBA and Major League Baseball banning players for life. Padres infielder Tucupita Marcano was permanently banned this week for betting on games he was involved in. The NBA banished Raptors forward Jontay Porter in April. Other players say they should have known better. Marcano was the first active baseball player in a century banned for life for gambling. MLB said he placed hundreds of bets totaling more than $150,000 on baseball in 2022 and 2023.\n\nSkenes, Chapman throw gas at Ohtani and the Dodgers as the Pirates hold on for 10-6 victory\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) -- Paul Skenes struck out eight over five innings, Aroldis Chapman threw the fastest pitch in the majors this season and the Pittsburgh Pirates beat Shohei Ohtani and the Los Angeles Dodgers 10-6. Skenes, a rookie, improved to 3-0 despite giving up Ohtani's 15th home run of the season. Skenes and Chapman combined to throw 28 pitches that reached triple digits. A seventh-inning heater from Chapman to Los Angeles' Teoscar Hernandez reached 104 mph, the fastest pitch in the majors this year. Nick Gonzales tied a career-high with four RBI for Pittsburgh.\n\nCam Sutton is getting a second chance with the Steelers following domestic violence incident\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) -- Cameron Sutton is getting a second chance in the NFL with the Pittsburgh Steelers. The Steelers have signed the veteran defensive back to a one-year deal. The agreement comes more than two months after he was released by the Detroit Lions for his involvement in an alleged domestic violence incident in Florida. Sutton eventually surrendered to authorities and entered a pretrial diversion program after the charges were reduced from a felony to misdemeanor battery.\n\nWNBA rescinds second technical foul that was assessed to Angel Reese\n\nThe WNBA announced that it's rescinded the second technical foul on Chicago rookie Angel Reese that occurred with 2:31 left in the loss to the New York Liberty on Tuesday night. Reese was thrown out of the game after receiving two technical fouls following a brief interaction with official Charles Watson. The rookie forward appeared to say something to Watson and then quickly waved her hand. Head official Maj Forsberg said in a pool report that Reese's technical fouls were for \"disrespectfully addressing\" the official and then for \"waving her hand in dismissal.\" Reese finished with 13 points and 10 rebounds.\n\nInside NBC's Olympics bet on pop culture in Paris, with help from Snoop Dogg and Cardi B\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) -- NBC has partnered with several entertainers and non-Olympic athletes like Megan Thee Stallion, Dolly Parton and Peyton Manning to promote the Paris Games this summer. The network wants to build anticipation and entice more viewers after drawing lackluster ratings following the Games in Beijing and Tokyo. NBC wants attract more viewers by bringing Olympic stories to life through the most popular and diverse personalities. Some of the big names involved include Snoop Dogg, Cardi B, Kevin Hart, Lily Collins and Kelly Clarkson.\n\nNBA Finals Notebook: Porzingis a go, Kyrie and LeBron make nice, Hardaway Jr. throws shade at dad\n\nBOSTON (AP) -- Celtics 7-footer Kristaps Porzingis said he will be ready to \"just go out there and hoop\" for Game 1 of the NBA Finals on Thursday night after missing Boston's last 10 games with a strained left calf. Porzingis said he couldn't predict how it will be once he gets into a game for the first time since April 29. An offseason acquisition that helped solidify the Celtics frontcourt, Porzingis averaged 20 points, 7.2 rebounds and almost two blocks per game. But he was again dogged by injuries that limited him to 57 games. He left Game 4 of the first-round series against the Miami Heat and missed all of the next two rounds.\n\nCole to make at least 2 more minor league starts, on track for possible Yankees' return in June\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Gerrit Cole is likely to make at least two more minor league rehabilitation starts, putting the AL Young Award winner on track for a possible return to the New York Yankees' rotation in mid-to-late June. Cole said he felt fine a day after his first rehab outing, a 45-pitch effort over 3 1/3 scoreless innings for Double-A Somerset on Tuesday night. Manager Aaron Boone says \"at least a couple more\" and adds: \"I don't know how many. Is that two? Is it three?\" Cole and Boone weren't ready to commit to Cole's next outing.\n\nEkblad, Reinhart, Draisaitl and Bennett were drafted together. They'll now play for the Cup together\n\nFORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- This seems so fitting. It was 10 years ago this month when Aaron Ekblad, Sam Reinhart, Leon Draisaitl and Sam Bennett were clearly the top four players entering the 2014 NHL Draft, though nobody knew what the order of their selection was going to be. They all went through the draft process together. Posed for photos together, some in Philadelphia Phillies jerseys -- the draft was in Philly that year -- and some in suits. They even dined together a few times. And now, they're going to the Stanley Cup Final together.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Boston's Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are the Celtics' most tenured and scrutinized stars and see it as a chance at redemption after falling short in the Finals just two seasons ago and then failing to return last year. Dallas' Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving see it as their first opportunity to make good on a partnership that began late last season after Irving was traded from Brooklyn following a tumultuous run of two-plus seasons with the Nets.\n\nPaul Skenes went right after Shohei Ohtani. The result was a brilliant bit of baseball theater\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) -- Pittsburgh Pirates rookie Paul Skenes made a quick impression on Los Angles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani. Skenes struck out Ohtani on three fastballs that reached 100 mph during their first meeting of what became a 10-6 Pittsburgh win. Ohtani exacted revenge later, dinging Skenes for a two-run homer and adding a single. Skenes still improved to 3-0 after striking out eight over five innings. Skenes says there is still plenty to work on through five career starts. Pirates catcher Yasmani Grandal says when Skenes figures everything out he is going to be a \"nightmare\" for opposing hitters.\n\nThe NBA Finals were too late for Dallas' Luka Doncic to watch as a kid. Now, he's in them\n\nBOSTON (AP) -- Luka Doncic didn't stay up all night to watch NBA Finals games as a kid. They usually started at something like 3 a.m. in his native Slovenia. He had school to get to a few hours later. He'd wake up and find out who won. Make no mistake, though: Doncic was paying attention. The 25-year-old makes his NBA Finals debut for the Dallas Mavericks when they take on the Boston Celtics in Game 1 of this year's title series on Thursday night. He could become the first player to win a scoring title and a championship in the same season since Shaquille O'Neal in 2000.\n\nNBA Finals Notebook: Porzingis a go, Kyrie and LeBron make nice, Hardaway Jr. throws shade at dad\n\nBOSTON (AP) -- Celtics 7-footer Kristaps Porzingis said he will be ready to \"just go out there and hoop\" for Game 1 of the NBA Finals on Thursday night after missing Boston's last 10 games with a strained left calf. Porzingis said he couldn't predict how it will be once he gets into a game for the first time since April 29. An offseason acquisition that helped solidify the Celtics frontcourt, Porzingis averaged 20 points, 7.2 rebounds and almost two blocks per game. But he was again dogged by injuries that limited him to 57 games. He left Game 4 of the first-round series against the Miami Heat and missed all of the next two rounds.\n\nNovak Djokovic says his knee surgery went well and he wants to return to action as soon as possible\n\nPARIS (AP) -- Novak Djokovic says surgery on his right knee went well after he was injured during the French Open. He also wrote in a post on social media on Thursday that he hopes to return to competition as soon as possible. Djokovic had an operation in Paris on Wednesday. That was two days after he hurt the knee early in the second set of a five-set victory against Francisco Cerundolo in the fourth round. The 24-time Grand Slam champion withdrew from the clay-court major tournament on Tuesday, so he was unable to play in the quarterfinals. Wimbledon begins on July 1.\n\nJennings' HR helps Oklahoma beat Texas 8-3 and move a win away from 4th straight Women's CWS title\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Tiare Jennings' two-run homer in the first inning sparked Oklahoma to an 8-3 win over Texas that left the Sooners one win from a record fourth straight national title. Jennings had two hits and three RBIs and Kinzie Hansen had two hits, including a two-run homer, for the Sooners in Game 1 of the best-of-three Women's College World Series championship series. Oklahoma had nine hits and three home runs against a Texas squad that threw three one-hit shutouts in three World Series games. The Sooners could clinch on Thursday night. Mia Scott hit a solo homer for Texas.\n\nPro athletes understand gambling on their games is a non-negotiable no-no. Some learned the hard way\n\nBOSTON (AP) -- Professional athletes get told at the start of every season that if they gamble on their games, the consequences are severe. This spring they've gotten a more personal reminder, with both the NBA and Major League Baseball banning players for life. Padres infielder Tucupita Marcano was permanently banned this week for betting on games he was involved in. The NBA banished Raptors forward Jontay Porter in April. Other players say they should have known better. Marcano was the first active baseball player in a century banned for life for gambling. MLB said he placed hundreds of bets totaling more than $150,000 on baseball in 2022 and 2023.\n\nSchauffele now a major champion at Memorial and facing a big stretch of golf\n\nDUBLIN, Ohio (AP) -- Xander Schauffele was able to take a few weeks off after claiming his first major at the PGA Championship. He came to realize he's still the same person and his life hasn't changed. Now he returns to the Memorial to face a tough stretch of golf. The Memorial is a signature event with a top field and big purse. Then it's off to the U.S. Open at Pinehurst No. 2 and then another signature event at the Travelers Championship. Tournament host Jack Nicklaus isn't thrilled with a new date for the Memorial that pushes it right up against a major.\n\nCarlos Rod\u00f3n wins 6th straight start for Yankees, putting miserable first season in New York behind\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Carlos Rod\u00f3n retired his first 16 batters and won a career-best sixth straight start, leading the Yankees over the Minnesota Twins 9-5 that stretched New York's winning streak to seven.Rod\u00f3n is 8-2 with a 3.08 ERA, striking out 71 and walking 20 in 73 innings with a .217 opponents' batting average. After signing a $162 million, eight-year contract, Rod\u00f3n missed the first half of last season with injuries, then went 3-8 with a 6.85 ERA. The lasting image was a confrontation with pitching coach Matt Blake in his last start, when Rod\u00f3n allowed all eight batters he faced to reach base.\n\nCole to make at least 2 more minor league starts, on track for possible Yankees' return in June\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Gerrit Cole is likely to make at least two more minor league rehabilitation starts, putting the AL Young Award winner on track for a possible return to the New York Yankees' rotation in mid-to-late June. Cole said he felt fine a day after his first rehab outing, a 45-pitch effort over 3 1/3 scoreless innings for Double-A Somerset on Tuesday night. Manager Aaron Boone says \"at least a couple more\" and adds: \"I don't know how many. Is that two? Is it three?\" Cole and Boone weren't ready to commit to Cole's next outing.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri":

This includes Miami Heat fans, Indiana Pacers fans, Cleveland Cavaliers fans, and yes, Dallas Mavericks fans. As you know, those did not go Miami, Cleveland, or Indiana's way. The Celtics dispatched the Heat 4-1 in the opening-round series, and then knocked off Cleveland, again in 4-1 fashion.\n\nBoston then booked their spot in the NBA Finals with a sweep of the Pacers.\n\n\"Really? You want Boston? Take it from me: that's a bad idea,\" Brady says in the video. \"The [Heat] culture? History. Cleveland? Done for. ... And Indy? Over with. But us? We're still here. Right now, you're gonna want anyone but Boston.\"\n\nThe video also sneaks in a shot at the New York Knicks, showing a clips of Knicks fans chanting \"We want Boston\" before a quick glimpse of Madison Square Garden, with the former quarterback then quipping \"oh wait, wrong team.\"\n\nYou can see the full video here:\n\nThe video ends with Celtics fans chanting \"Who wants Boston next?\"", "source": {"uri": "sbnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SB Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_schofield@sbnation.com", "name": "Mark Schofield", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Video", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Video", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/Digital_Video", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/Digital Video", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Video/Training", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Video/Training", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Audio_and_Video_Clips", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Audio and Video Clips", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Video/Alternative_Video", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Video/Alternative Video", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WdS76jRtZbBdH2VhWALxnsSeKUs=/271x0:2579x1154/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25480177/Screenshot_2024_06_06_at_9.37.17_AM.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

During their Conference runs, the Mavs eliminated three of the top-four seeds while the Celts unarguably had a relatively easier run. Despite the disparity in competition, the Green Machine, which finished with the best record in the 2023-24 season, will be favored to win it all and the Mavericks will enter as underdogs.\n\nOn their Mind the Game pod, LeBron James and JJ Redick discussed what will define the championship round. LBJ has been to 10 Finals as both a favorite and an underdog, so, he knows the expectations on either side of the aisle.\n\nThe 4x Finals MVP expressed that often favorites have a heavier burden because of the increased expectations compared to the underdogs. He added that the team, whose top talents could withstand opposition runs, is going to lift the Larry O'Brien trophy.\n\nThe All-time leading scorer recalled how in the 2011 Finals, title favorites Miami Heat had some fantastic moments but withered away during key runs by Dallas. As a result, his Heat lost in six games to the Dirk Nowitzki-led squad. He said,\n\n\"The best team with the best players and withstand runs in the finals, in the postseason is going to be the team that wins, we was the favorite when I was in Miami versus Dallas. We had times where we played exceptionally well, but we didn't withstand some of their runs.\"\n\nThus, as the underdogs, Luka Doncic and Co. will look to replicate the heroics of the 2011 Mavericks championship team. Their hands will be full against the top seed but they have shown phenomenal adjustments against higher-ranked squads throughout the playoffs.\n\nThe Boston Celtics unarguably have the deepest two-way squad in the league. They have five top-quality shot-creators who make for the best deep-range shooting team. Getting Kristaps Porzingis back will give them a further boost and help negate the overachieving frontline of the Mavs, especially in the form of 7'1\" rookie Dereck Lively II.\n\nMeanwhile, despite some match-up mismatches, the Doncic-led team will fancy their chances after making the third finals in franchise history.\n\nThe Mavericks were able to shut down multiple elite offenses in the playoffs and their defense has been on par with some of the best efforts in recent playoff history. Kyrie Irving and Doncic have gelled together perfectly, knowing when to defer to each other.\n\nThey are one of the best backcourts in the league which can put Celtics in a mixer. LeBron James has been full of praise for Irving and expressed that he is the wild card for the team.\n\nThus, having such an arrow in their quiver will make the Texan franchise confident about their chances. However, the Celtics will be in the title round for the second time in three years and have the experience to fend off the fiercest runs from Doncic and Irving. Overall, the stage set is for one of the most memorable NBA Finals in history.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shubham_singh@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Shubham Singh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_O'Brien", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Larry O'Brien"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/06/b6616162-untitled-design-2024-06-05t200257.153.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 3, "textEnd": 9}], "sentiment": 0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

The 2024 NBA playoffs, which culminate in an exciting NBA Finals matchup between the Boston Celtics and Dallas Mavericks, proves that the league is entering a new era.\n\nAthlon Sports' Jayden Kraft says this is something to celebrate in a new video essay. With James' Lakers, Curry's Warriors and Durant's Suns all failing to reach the second round of the playoffs, something which hadn't happened since 2005, the league now belongs to the likes of the Celtics' Jayson Tatum, Mavs' Luka Don\u010di\u0107 and Minnesota Timberwolves' Anthony Edwards\n\nThis changing of the guard fits the cyclical nature of the NBA. Michael Jordan took the torch from Larry Bird and Magic Johnson in the late 1980s, leading a Chicago Bulls dynasty in the '90s. The Kobe Bryant- and Shaquille O'Neal-led Los Angeles Lakers put together the next dynasty in the early 2000s, before giving way to James' and Curry's intertwined title eras.\n\nSubscribe to Athlon Sports on YouTube\n\nThe Celtics, with their 17 NBA championships, are no strangers to success, and have a chance to win their first title since 2008 behind the homegrown duo of Tatum, 26, and Jaylen Brown, 27.\n\nOn the other side, the 25-year-old Don\u010di\u0107 is attempting to lead the Mavericks to their first title since 2011, following in the footsteps of both Dallas legend Dirk Nowitzki and Denver Nuggets center Nikola Joki\u0107. The impact of international players continues to grow in this new era of NBA basketball.\n\nGame 1 of the NBA Finals tips off at 8:30 p.m. ET on Thursday night.\n\nRelated: LeBron James' Wife Savannah James Makes Big Announcement", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dan_lyons@postandcourier.com", "name": "Dan Lyons", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Magic Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Bird", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Larry Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_Bryant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kobe Bryant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirk_Nowitzki", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dirk Nowitzki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/d1/3d160b8b-52ef-58cb-b7ea-3e9f5c880b70/6660cec67e6da.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C18&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

Or maybe Phoenix Suns fans really just hate Luka Doncic and the Dallas Mavericks that much, because the Grand Canyon State is rooting more for the Boston Celtics as we approach the 2024 NBA Finals.\n\nThat's according to a BetOnline study based on geotagged X data from last Friday through Tuesday.\n\nOfficial fan hashtags posted in Arizona -- #OneForDallas for the Mavs and #DifferentHere for the Celtics -- favored Boston.\n\nIt made Arizona stand out among a sea of Dallas support in the West and Southwest of the United States. Celtics fans have pockets of rooting support in the Northeast down the East Coast. Boston also curiously got support in the Upper Midwest and in Oregon.\n\nBut the vast majority of states in the middle of the country and westward support Dallas.\n\nThe Mavericks have majority support in 29 states to 21 for the Celtics.\n\nObviously, the Suns' clash with the Mavericks in the 2022 Western Conference Semifinals likely has to do with the Dallas distaste in Phoenix.\n\nThe Devin Booker-Doncic rivalry could be felt between Suns and Mavs fans. In Phoenix, there's probably some complex bitterness toward Doncic because the Suns drafted Deandre Ayton instead of Doncic way back in 2018 -- a big whoopsie looking back.\n\nThe older crowd probably gets triggered by Texas things thanks to run-ins with the Mavs way back in the 2006 postseason, where a six-game conference finals matchup saw the Mavericks advance past a Boris Diaw-, Shawn Marion- and Steve Nash-led Suns team before falling to the Miami Heat in the NBA Finals.\n\nPhoenix won a six-game conference semifinals series over Dallas the year before that in its first Seven Seconds or Less iteration, with a healthy Amar'e Stoudemire, Joe Johnson and Quentin Richardson joining Marion and Nash.\n\nAs for Suns fans' relationship with the Celtics, that 1976 Finals matchup appears long enough in the past.

Nah, that ain't the script here.\"\n\nKevin Garnett has never shied away from speaking his mind, be it on the court or now in his post-playing career.\n\nThe Celtics legend and NBA Hall of Famer is not holding back when it comes to one prevailing narrative hovering over the 2023-24 Boston Celtics.\n\nBoston has taken care of business on the road to a NBA Finals berth for the second time in three seasons, sporting a 12-2 record this postseason, but that hasn't stopped several media pundits and outlets from harping on the breaks that have fallen the Celtics' way during this run.\n\nOver their three series victories over the Heat (46 wins), Cavaliers (48 wins), and Pacers (47 wins), the Celtics did benefit from several key opponents sitting out due to injury, including Jimmy Butler (Heat), Donovan Mitchell (Cavaliers), Jarrett Allen (Cavaliers), and Tyrese Haliburton (Pacers).\n\nOf course, the top-seeded Celtics also dominated the Eastern Conference without the help of Kristaps Porzingis -- who has missed the last 10 games after suffering a calf strain in Game 4 against the Heat.\n\nBut Boston's path this postseason has been a regular talking point over the last week when it comes to the Celtics' viability as an elite championship squad.\n\nSuch discourse doesn't sit right with Garnett, who ripped the narrative during the latest episode of the \"Ticket & The Truth\" podcast alongside fellow Celtics great Paul Pierce.\n\n\"I think people want this big-ass (expletive) drama or something because all of the other series have been like this,\" Garnett said. \"'Oh, when LeBron (James) made it and when Kobe (Bryant) did this and Michael Jordan.' Listen, man. Their path is their path. First off, it's not on the Celtics that guys are getting hurt, not playing, falling out of the lineup, etc. There are still other professionals coming in, playing hard as (expletive) and still trying to win. And to close out a game on the road? Man, I don't know what people want.\"\n\nWhile Boston's run so far hasn't particularly been rife with drama, the Celtics have still gutted their way through several close games and orchestrated multiple comeback wins, especially during a competitive four-game sweep against the Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\n\"People want all this heartfelt drama and going seven games,\" Garnett said. \"Nah, that ain't the script here. Their script -- they're damn near 16 games better than anybody in the East, they steamrolled through your team and it is what it is. And then, too, they're down 18 on the road.\n\n\"They think you can just hit a button and all of a sudden you're tied. No, man. You have to go win on the road and it's hard as (expletive) to go win on the road and it's even more hard to close out a team. But for all this other (expletive) they can't control and that's out of their control -- get the (expletive) out of here with that. This is what it is.\"\n\nGarnett isn't the only one to defend the Celtics and their competition so far this postseason, with Warriors forward Draymond Green pushing back against talk that Boston hasn't been tested last week on his own podcast.\n\n\"[Critics say] they haven't been battle-tested and all of that,\" Green said. \"Whether they get to these NBA Finals and win or lose will not be because they haven't been battle-tested, let me tell you that. You don't get to the NBA Finals and some point throughout the year haven't been battle-tested -- don't happen, won't happen, ain't happening this time.\"", "source": {"uri": "boston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conor_ryan@boston.com", "name": "Conor Ryan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Garnett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Garnett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Butler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Butler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donovan_Mitchell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donovan Mitchell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrett_Allen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jarrett Allen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Profanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Pierce", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul Pierce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draymond_Green", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draymond Green"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/s3___bgmp-arc_arc-feeds_generic-photos_to-arc_LEE_031322celticsmavs14SPTS-665e32fbdd52f-768x432.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

Boston's Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are the Celtics' most tenured and scrutinized stars and see it as a chance at redemption after falling short in the Finals just two seasons ago and then failing to return last year. Dallas' Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving see it as their first opportunity to make good on a partnership that began late last season after Irving was traded from Brooklyn following a tumultuous run of two-plus seasons with the Nets.\n\nPaul Skenes went right after Shohei Ohtani. The result was a brilliant bit of baseball theater\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) -- Pittsburgh Pirates rookie Paul Skenes made a quick impression on Los Angles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani. Skenes struck out Ohtani on three fastballs that reached 100 mph during their first meeting of what became a 10-6 Pittsburgh win. Ohtani exacted revenge later, dinging Skenes for a two-run homer and adding a single. Skenes still improved to 3-0 after striking out eight over five innings. Skenes says there is still plenty to work on through five career starts. Pirates catcher Yasmani Grandal says when Skenes figures everything out he is going to be a \"nightmare\" for opposing hitters.\n\nThe NBA Finals were too late for Dallas' Luka Doncic to watch as a kid. Now, he's in them\n\nBOSTON (AP) -- Luka Doncic didn't stay up all night to watch NBA Finals games as a kid. They usually started at something like 3 a.m. in his native Slovenia. He had school to get to a few hours later. He'd wake up and find out who won. Make no mistake, though: Doncic was paying attention. The 25-year-old makes his NBA Finals debut for the Dallas Mavericks when they take on the Boston Celtics in Game 1 of this year's title series on Thursday night. He could become the first player to win a scoring title and a championship in the same season since Shaquille O'Neal in 2000.\n\nCaitlin Clark, Indiana Fever hope 4-day break can help recharge season after early struggles\n\nINDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Caitlin Clark finally got the break she needed this week. After playing 39 college games, enduring training camp and two preseason games followed by a stretch of 11 WNBA games in 20 days, the two-time national player of the year finally had four days off. It's about time. Clark has spent months doing media rounds, fending off the critics and cheap shots. Some of it is to be expected of a high-profile rookie -- in any league. But in this league, where Clark has quickly emerged as the key figure, it's also has created lots of frustration for the former Iowa star.\n\nOpening arguments starting in class-action lawsuit against NFL by 'Sunday Ticket' subscribers\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) -- Opening arguments were expected to begin Thursday in a class-action lawsuit filed by \"Sunday Ticket\" subscribers claiming the NFL broke antitrust law. The lawsuit was filed in 2015 and has withstood numerous challenges, including a dismissal that was overturned. The suit alleges the NFL broke antitrust laws when it allowed DirecTV to exclusively sell the \"Sunday Ticket\" package of out-of-market Sunday afternoon games airing on CBS and Fox at an inflated price and restricted competition. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, a longtime member of the league's broadcast committee, are expected to testify in the case, which could last up to three weeks.\n\nNBA Finals Notebook: Porzingis a go, Kyrie and LeBron make nice, Hardaway Jr. throws shade at dad\n\nBOSTON (AP) -- Celtics 7-footer Kristaps Porzingis said he will be ready to \"just go out there and hoop\" for Game 1 of the NBA Finals on Thursday night after missing Boston's last 10 games with a strained left calf. Porzingis said he couldn't predict how it will be once he gets into a game for the first time since April 29. An offseason acquisition that helped solidify the Celtics frontcourt, Porzingis averaged 20 points, 7.2 rebounds and almost two blocks per game. But he was again dogged by injuries that limited him to 57 games. He left Game 4 of the first-round series against the Miami Heat and missed all of the next two rounds.\n\nNovak Djokovic says his knee surgery went well and he wants to return to action as soon as possible\n\nPARIS (AP) -- Novak Djokovic says surgery on his right knee went well after he was injured during the French Open. He also wrote in a post on social media on Thursday that he hopes to return to competition as soon as possible. Djokovic had an operation in Paris on Wednesday. That was two days after he hurt the knee early in the second set of a five-set victory against Francisco Cerundolo in the fourth round. The 24-time Grand Slam champion withdrew from the clay-court major tournament on Tuesday, so he was unable to play in the quarterfinals. Wimbledon begins on July 1.\n\nJennings' HR helps Oklahoma beat Texas 8-3 and move a win away from 4th straight Women's CWS title\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Tiare Jennings' two-run homer in the first inning sparked Oklahoma to an 8-3 win over Texas that left the Sooners one win from a record fourth straight national title. Jennings had two hits and three RBIs and Kinzie Hansen had two hits, including a two-run homer, for the Sooners in Game 1 of the best-of-three Women's College World Series championship series. Oklahoma had nine hits and three home runs against a Texas squad that threw three one-hit shutouts in three World Series games. The Sooners could clinch on Thursday night. Mia Scott hit a solo homer for Texas.\n\nPro athletes understand gambling on their games is a non-negotiable no-no. Some learned the hard way\n\nBOSTON (AP) -- Professional athletes get told at the start of every season that if they gamble on their games, the consequences are severe. This spring they've gotten a more personal reminder, with both the NBA and Major League Baseball banning players for life. Padres infielder Tucupita Marcano was permanently banned this week for betting on games he was involved in. The NBA banished Raptors forward Jontay Porter in April. Other players say they should have known better. Marcano was the first active baseball player in a century banned for life for gambling. MLB said he placed hundreds of bets totaling more than $150,000 on baseball in 2022 and 2023.\n\nJannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz will renew their rivalry in the French Open semifinals\n\nPARIS (AP) -- Jannik Sinner is just 22, and Carlos Alcaraz just 21, yet they've already built quite a rivalry heading into their French Open semifinal on Friday. Spain's Alcaraz owns two Grand Slam titles and spent time at No. 1 in the rankings. Italy's Sinner won the Australian Open in January and will ascend to No. 1 next week. This will be their ninth meeting; the series is tied at 4-all. The other men's semifinal in Paris is No. 7 Casper Ruud against No. 4 Alexander Zverev. That's not a bad matchup, either. But it's No. 2 Sinner vs. No. 3 Alcaraz capturing all of the buzz.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri":

In celebration of this, the 25th NBA Finals series since the turn of the century, I took it upon myself to take a look at the previous twenty-four and develop a pseudo-scientific algorithm to rank each and every one of them.\n\nSo, what exactly is this pseudo-scientific algorithm and how does it work? Hey, I'm glad you asked!\n\nI came up with four categories, and in each of the four categories, the NBA Finals series in question will be graded on a 1-10 scale. After all 24 Finals series' were graded, they were ranked from 24 to 1, with the total grade in parentheses next to the matchup. Those four categories are as follows:\n\nStar Power: How many high quality, Hall of Fame caliber players were featured in the series? Were they at the peak of their powers? How did they perform in the NBA Finals?\n\nOverall Competitiveness: How tight was the series? Was it a sweep or did it go to a Game 7? Were the games blowouts, or did they go down to the wire?\n\nHistorical Stakes: Going into the series, what were the stakes beyond the Larry O'Brien Trophy? Was it a legacy-defining Finals for a player or a team?\n\nIconic Games/Moments: When the NBA makes their intro packages for the NBA Finals, how many moments from the series are likely to be included? How many \"Instant Classic\" games were there?\n\nIn addition to those four categories, I also established a tie-breaker category -- Aesthetic Appeal -- which considers Style of Play, Announcers, Crowds, and all of the miscellaneous stuff that makes up an NBA Finals broadcast. And yes, there are plenty of ties, so the tie-breaker category turned out to be essential to the process.\n\n24. 2007 NBA Finals - San Antonio Spurs vs. Cleveland Cavaliers (23)\n\nThe first of three NBA Finals matchups between the San Antonio Spurs and LeBron James is arguably the most forgettable NBA Finals series of the century... unless you're a LeBron James hater who likes to point out the fact that in his first appearance on the big stage, LBJ was swept and averaged only 22 points, 7 rebounds and 7 assists -- while conveniently neglecting to mention the following four facts:\n\nA) The Cavaliers second-leading scorer during the regular season, Larry Hughes, was limited to two games in the Finals due to a torn plantar fascia. He averaged 1 point per game in those two games.\n\nB) After James, the Cavaliers next three leading scorers in the series were Drew Gooden, Daniel Gibson and Sasha Pavlovic.\n\nC) The San Antonio Spurs were the best defensive team in the league and had exactly one player that they needed to keep in check in the NBA Finals in order to win their fourth NBA Title since 1999.\n\nD) LeBron James had just ripped through the Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference Finals, most notably with an audacious 48-point performance in a double-overtime thriller in Detroit in Game 5 of the series.\n\nThere's good reason why this series was the league's least-watched NBA Finals series of the decade. Heading into the Finals, virtually nobody in the media gave Cleveland anything more than a puncher's chance against the Spurs, and here's the cruel irony for Cavs fans: had it been 32 year-old LeBron James instead of 22-year old LeBron James on the floor, it's possible that Cleveland might've actually been able to give the Spurs a competitive series. But in 2007, the Cavs weren't ready and neither was LeBron.\n\nAs for the series itself, the Spurs won this ugly slugfest of a series by an average of only six points per game, but anyone who was there and watched it all unfold knows that it wasn't remotely that close. Sure, the Cavs had chances aplenty to potentially come away with wins in Games 3 and 4 in Cleveland, but the much better team won all four games.\n\n23. 2002 NBA Finals - Los Angeles Lakers vs. New Jersey Nets (24)\n\nIf there was any series this century that felt more like a lock than San Antonio over Cleveland did in 2007, it was Los Angeles over New Jersey in 2002, and that's for very good reason. The Lakers entered the 2002 NBA Finals as the two-time defending champions, looking to give Phil Jackson his third three-peat as a head coach, and they were -750 favorites to do so. The Nets, who entered the season with an over/under win total of just 35.5 games, surprised everyone during Jason Kidd's first season with the franchise, winning an Eastern Conference-best 52 games and making the NBA Finals for the first time in franchise history.\n\nJason Kidd and the Nets deserve their flowers, even if making the NBA Finals out of the Eastern Conference had never been easier than it was in 2002. The Nets finished the regular season as the league's best defense, and Kidd finished 2nd in MVP voting while leading the league in both assists, steals, and triple doubles. But for all intents and purposes, the NBA Finals had already been played by the time the Lakers and Nets began their series in early June.\n\nWhile the Nets were struggling to get past the Boston Celtics, the Lakers were engaged in an all-timer of a series against the Sacramento Kings in the Western Conference Finals. The series itself has been marred for many fans due to conspiracy theories that stated the league had given officials a nudge to ensure that, A) The series would extend to seven games, B) The Lakers would advance to the NBA Finals, or C) Both. But regardless of whether it was LA or Sacramento who represented the Western Conference in the NBA Finals, the Nets were going to be colossal underdogs no matter what.\n\nNew Jersey did about all they could against Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant and the Lakers, but they were going into a gunfight armed with a sharpened steak knife. In three of the four games in the series, the Nets kept things reasonably close, but the two best players in the series donned the purple and gold. Shaq dominated the Nets frontcourt, averaging 36 points and 12 rebounds per game, and Kobe chipped in 27-6-5 in the four Lakers wins.\n\n22. 2003 NBA Finals - San Antonio Spurs vs. New Jersey Nets (24.5)\n\nThe 2003 NBA Finals was a much closer series than anyone will remember, but my God, there was not a worse time for the aesthetic appeal of professional basketball than during the 2003 and 2004 seasons. The average score of the 2003 NBA Finals was 87.8 to 82.0, and I'll be honest, until I did my research on the series, I expected both of those numbers to be lower. Sure, the Nets and Spurs were elite defensively, ranking 1st and 3rd respectively in Defensive Rating during the 2002-03 regular season, but this entire series was a slog that was mercifully saved in Game 6 by an all-time great performance from Tim Duncan, who was at the absolute peak of his powers in 2003.\n\nDuncan had won MVP two years in a row, and after defeating the Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference Semifinals, there was no longer a dispute: Tim Duncan, not Shaquille O'Neal or Kobe Bryant, was the best basketball player in the world, and the Spurs were the conference's best team. But the Nets presented a tricky challenge in the NBA Finals, if only because they could play the Spurs game and potentially beat San Antonio at it.\n\nIn Game 6 in San Antonio, the Nets led by 10 early in the 4th quarter and were seemingly on their way to forcing a Game 7, but the Spurs responded, going on a 19-0 run over the course of a five minute stretch in the final frame. For the game, Duncan finished with 21 points, 20 rebounds, 10 assists and 8 blocks, though some fans believe Duncan was shorted two blocks during the course of the game, robbing him from notching the first and thus far only quadruple-double in NBA Playoff history.\n\n21. 2023 NBA Finals - Denver Nuggets vs. Miami Heat (25)\n\nJust last year, the Denver Nuggets became the first Western Conference team outside of the state's of Texas or California to win the NBA Finals since the Seattle SuperSonics did so in 1979. They did so in mostly undramatic fashion against the 8th-seeded Miami Heat, who had already pulled off three upsets in three consecutive rounds against the top-seeded Milwaukee Bucks, the New York Knicks, and the Boston Celtics, but ran out of magic by the time they ran into Nikola Jokic, Jamal Murray and the Nuggets in the Finals.\n\nThe series itself lacks a truly memorable moment, performance, or game, though Game's 2 and 5 came right down to the wire. But with that said, Nikola Jokic's Finals MVP performance should be celebrated more than it has been. Just because 30 points, 14 rebounds and 7 assists per game never looked so casual -- or just because Denver didn't defend their title this year -- it doesn't mean we shouldn't be applauding Jokic and the Nuggets for their 2023 run to title. Fortunately, the Nuggets celebrated enough for all of us during their victory parade. In fact, I think you could make the case that the Nuggets' Finals hangover this year was just an extension of an actual hangover from the day of the parade.\n\n20. 2004 NBA Finals - Detroit Pistons vs. Los Angeles Lakers (25)\n\nThe 2004 NBA Finals gets the edge over the 2023 NBA Finals in the Aesthetic Appeal category, but not because the series was more entertaining. Denver vs. Miami was a far more entertaining series than Detroit vs. LA if you're looking only at the flow of the game and the level of talent on the floor, but Pistons vs. Lakers just felt more like a Finals series than Nuggets vs. Heat did. I don't know how better to explain it.\n\nMaybe it's because there was the history from a decade and a half earlier, when the LA and Detroit met in the Finals in 1988 and 1989. Maybe it's because we'd seen the this version of the Lakers (minus Karl Malone and Gary Payton) in the Finals three times prior, and Detroit was on their way to a mini-dynasty in the Eastern Conference -- yes, six straight Conference Finals appearances qualifies as a mini-dynasty to me. Or maybe it's because Denver failed to defend their title this year, making last year's Finals run feel a little less significant than it might've felt two months ago.\n\nDetroit came into the series as +500 underdogs, but never resembled as much, as they thoroughly dominated the Lakers in what many members of the media referred to as a \"five game sweep.\" LA's only win, a 99-91 overtime victory in Game 2, has been completely been forgotten and replaced by the memory of Detroit's stifling defense wearing the Lakers down and putting an end to the Shaq/Kobe dynasty. In their four wins, the Pistons held the Lakers to an average of 77.5 points per game -- even worse than the '07 Cavs put up against San Antonio. Yucky!\n\nThis is the title that put \"DETROIT BASKETBALL\" back on the map -- hey NBA, can we stick with starting lineup introductions for the Finals? -- and it's given us countless opportunities for spectacular unintentional comedy each and every time Rasheed Wallace asserts that this Pistons team could beat a more modern (and clearly more talented) NBA Champions.\n\nOh, that's just the 2014 San Antonio Spurs squeezing the life out of the Big Three Heat. Oh dear, that's graphic -- but my God, it's so beautiful. Let's just move on.\n\n18. 2009 NBA Finals - Los Angeles Lakers vs. Orlando Magic (26.5)\n\nThe 2009 NBA Finals were Kobe Bryant's redemption for his heavily criticized shortcomings in both the 2004 Finals (22 points per game 38 percent shooting) and the 2008 Finals (25 points per game on 40 percent shooting), and it gave him the title that solidified his standing within the pantheon of the biggest superstars in league history. The Black Mamba was brilliant in the '09 Finals, averaging 32 points, 6 rebounds and 7 assists against a very game Orlando Magic squad that had already shocked the world in the Eastern Conference Finals when they defeated the 66-win Cleveland Cavaliers in six games, knocking league MVP LeBron James out of the NBA Playoffs and preventing basketball fans from their best opportunity to see a Kobe vs. LeBron Finals series.\n\nBefore we move forward, let me just say this: No, it does not hurt the legacy of Kobe Bryant in any way shape or form that the Lakers beat the Magic in the 2009 NBA Finals and not the Cavaliers or even the Boston Celtics... but my God, can you imagine if we actually got the Kobe vs. LeBron Finals that hoops fans, and seemingly even the league, had been clamoring for ever since the 2008 Summer Olympics? From the time Kobe and LeBron led Team USA past Spain in the Gold Medal Game, it looked like we were on a collision course the following June. And then Dwight Howard, Rashard Lewis and Hedo Turkoglu happened, and all of the sudden, it was the Disney Series (no, not the 2020 Bubble Finals that took place at Disney... I'm talking about the original Disney Series.\n\nEven though this series shows a 4-1 advantage in favor of the Lakers, the Magic had legitimate reason to believe that they could've won this series. Game's 2 and 4 were well within reach -- Magic guard Courtney Lee couldn't convert a late-game sideline out of bounds lob at the rim, sending Game 2 to overtime, and then in Game 4, Derek Fisher caught his opps lackin' late in the game, knocking down a clutch three-pointer to send the game to overtime, leading to a Lakers win.\n\n17. 2018 NBA Finals - Golden State Warriors vs. Cleveland Cavaliers (27)\n\nMy pseudo-scientific algorithm boosts the 2018 NBA Finals, a rather convincing sweep in Golden State's favor, not only because it ranks so highly in the star power category, but also because Game 1 of the series goes down as one of the most iconic games, performances, and Finals gaffes in league history. Allow me to set the scene:\n\nAfter both the Cavaliers and Warriors survived in all-time great Conference Finals series' against the Boston Celtics and Houston Rockets respectively, you couldn't help but feel like the Finals were going to be a little bit of a letdown. This particular Cleveland team was nowhere close to being as good as any of the three previous versions of the Cavaliers who made the Finals, but LeBron James was in the midst of one of the greatest postseason heaters we've ever seen. Almost single-handedly he defeated Indiana, then Toronto and then Boston, and now a familiar foe awaited him in the Finals.\n\nLeBron James came out in Game 1 of the NBA Finals and hit the Warriors with his best punch, putting forth what is perhaps the greatest individual performance I've ever seen in a basketball game: 51 points on 59 percent shooting, 8 rebounds, 8 assists, and one big shot after another as the Warriors kept trying to pull away. Seriously, me writing about it does not do the performance justice. Just take the 4 minutes and 42 seconds needed to watch these highlights, then come back here. Don't worry, I'll be waiting.\n\nOf course, what you don't see in that highlight package was the moment this game is most well-known for.\n\n16. 2001 NBA Finals - Los Angeles Lakers vs. Philadelphia 76ers (27)\n\nMuch like the 2018 Finals, the 2001 NBA Finals are best known for both a Game 1 performance from a player on the losing side of the series, as well as one defining image that will live in NBA lore forever.\n\nThe Sixers stole Game 1 from a Lakers team that had been perfect in the postseason up to the point behind 48 points from Allen Iverson, who rendered Shaq's 44 point, 20 rebound performance in Game 1 forgettable. Of course, Shaq never slowed down, nearly notching a quadruple-double in Game 2 (28 points, 20 rebounds, 9 assists and 8 blocks) and earning his second consecutive Finals MVP Award after averaging 33 points, 16 rebounds, 5 assists and 3 blocks per game against the league's Defensive Player of the Year, Dikembe Mutombo.\n\n15. 2020 NBA Finals - Los Angeles Lakers vs. Miami Heat (27.5)\n\nEveryone wants to delegitimize the 2020 NBA Finals -- and the entirety of the postseason for that matter -- because it was played in the Bubble at Disney Resorts in Orlando, Florida, while conveniently ignoring the fact that multiple players who were in the Bubble and did NOT win the NBA Championship claim that the basketball played there was at the highest-level, and that the path to a title was brutal.\n\nDamian Lillard: \" I feel it would have been hard to win that. People was fresh bruh... I feel like based off of how my body felt, and what I knew our experience was, we would never see a more fresh version of the opposition then we did at that time.\"\n\nBam Adebayo: \"That was the hardest championship to win in my opinion just because you're in there with just literally 15-deep lineup, plus coaches, staff, training staff. Other than that, it's you and your thoughts in one room boxed in. ... It was literally you, your thoughts and your teammates. That's it. I ain't talking to nobody, from the other team. It felt like you were gang-affiliated when you were in the bubble. Lakers got purple, we got on black, the Bucks got green. Nobody was walking by themselves, like it's alpha male.\"\n\nJamal Murray: \"I think that was the highest level of basketball being played, because it was only basketball. And guys were so locked in. You go to the gym, you have shootaround, you eat, you play.\"\n\nAnd this doesn't even acknowledge the fact that the NBA showed the rest of the world how effective testing and isolation could be during the COVID-19 pandemic, setting the stage for the NCAA Tournament to go on without a hitch in 2021. Unfortunately, the legacy of the 2020 NBA Finals seems to ignore all of the good -- COVID protocols, athlete activism, awesome basketball -- and instead focus on two words: \"Asterisk Title.\"\n\nIt's stupid, and if it were any team but the Lakers who won the title being led by any player but LeBron James, the conversation would be totally different. I'm convinced of it. We'd be celebrating what was accomplished inside of the Bubble instead of minimizing it. We would have fonder memories of some of the all-time great games and performances, not just in the NBA Finals -- like the instant classic Game 5 that kept the Heat's NBA Title hopes alive -- but throughout the entire postseason, like Luka Doncic's heroics against the Clippers, the unbelievable Jamal Murray/Donovan Mitchell duel in round 1, the OG Anunoby game-winner against Boston, the Clippers blown 3-1 lead against the Nuggets, Anthony Davis' game-winner against Denver, the renewal of the Boston vs. Miami rivalry, and so much else.\n\n14. 2000 NBA Finals - Los Angeles Lakers vs. Indiana Pacers (27.5)\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers' first NBA Title of the Shaq/Kobe era was not the walkover that most people seem to remember it being. After having to scratch and claw their way back from a double-digit deficit against the Trail Blazers in Game 7 of the Western Conference Finals, the Lakers then had their hands full in the NBA Finals against a very game, and very seasoned Indiana Pacers team -- a group that had made four Eastern Conference Finals appearances between 1994 and 1999 -- being coached by Boston Celtics legend/Hoosier state native Larry Bird, who we know wouldn't be intimidated by the aura of the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nThe series, which the Lakers won 4-2, featured four games that could've swung either way, including Game 4, best known for the late-game heroics of a 21-year-old Kobe Bryant, playing on a bum ankle, who lifted the Lakers in OT on the road in front of a raucous Indiana crowd after Shaquille O'Neal fouled out in OT. With that Game 4 win, the Lakers took a commanding 3-1 lead and eventually closed the series out in a tremendously competitive Game 6, a game which they trailed by five going into the 4th quarter.\n\n13. 2022 NBA Finals - Golden State Warriors vs. Boston Celtics (27.5)\n\nThe last chapter of the Stephen Curry/Klay Thompson/Draymond Green-led Warriors dynasty was written during the 2022 NBA Finals, a series that doubled as Curry's arrival into the tippy-top tier of the NBA Pyramid. Despite their well-established championship pedigree and home court advantage, the Dubs were only slim favorites against a Celtics team that the metrics loved heading into the postseason. Boston was 18-21 after a January 6th loss to the New York Knicks, but rampaged through their final 43 games, going 33-10 down the stretch of the regular season and then winning a pair of seven-game doozies against the Milwaukee Bucks (the defending NBA champs) and the Miami Heat ahead of the Finals.\n\nGolden State presented a different challenge entirely than Brooklyn, Milwaukee or Miami had, but through the first three games, it looked like Boston was in control of the series. They had a 2-1 lead following a commanding 116-100 win in Game 3, but then Stephen Curry stepped up to the plate and played what was for my money the best game of his career. Yes, he's had better stat lines. Yes, there have been games in which Curry hit the final shot as the seconds ticked away late. But against Boston in Game 4, a fiery and demonstrative Stephen Curry broke the Celtics, scoring 43 points on 14-for-26 shooting, including 24 points in the 2nd half. It was as dominant a performance as a \"small guard\" has ever had in the NBA postseason.\n\nThe Warriors held the Celtics off in Game's 5 and 6, in large part due to Curry, who closed things out with a 34-7-7 performance in Game 6, and also Andrew Wiggins, who played the three best and most consequential games of his NBA career in the final three games of the Finals. The Dubs got their fourth ring, and the Celtics, who are back in the NBA Finals this year, got some valuable experience ahead of their matchup versus Dallas.\n\n12. 2005 NBA Finals - San Antonio Spurs vs. Detroit Pistons (27.5)\n\nBy far the lowest-ranked seven game series on this list, the algorithm clearly didn't love the rock fight to end all rock fights. Stylistically, the series can be rough to watch, and despite the fact that the 2005 NBA Finals pitted the two most underappreciated teams of the 2000's against each other, neither team is all that conventionally sexy and four of the seven games were total blowouts.\n\nThis series was saved by Game's 5-7, though Game 5 is the only one of them that is truly memorable. With 18 ties and 12 lead changes, the Spurs and Pistons through one heavy haymaker after another at each other, until it was Big Shot Rob who was left open on the left wing with under 10 seconds to go in overtime.\n\n(WHY ARE YOU DOUBLING OFF OF ROBERT HORRY, RASHEED? HUBIE TRIED TO WARN YOU! YOU ALWAYS LISTEN TO HUBIE!)\n\nTo the Pistons credit, they weren't ready to roll over after dropping Game 5 in dramatic fashion at home. Back in San Antonio for Game 6, Detroit stunned the Spurs in a game that was supposed to be a coronation for the West's best, becoming the first road team in NBA Finals history to force a Game 7. Game 7 was the ugliest one of the bunch, but close throughout. Behind a combined 63 points from Tim Duncan, Manu Ginobili (who was flat out awesome in this series) and Horry, the Spurs held off the Pistons in Game 7 by the final scored of 81-74.\n\n11. 2012 NBA Finals - Miami Heat vs. Oklahoma City Thunder (30)\n\nJust a year removed from a memorable and highly-celebrated collapse in the 2011 NBA Finals against the Dallas Mavericks -- we'll get to that series soon enough -- the Miami Heat came into the 2012 NBA Finals as underdogs against a young and hungry Oklahoma City Thunder team led by Kevin Durant (23 years old), Russell Westbrook (23), and James Harden (22). In this matchup of Big Three's and weather phenomenons, it was the Thunder who struck first (pun intended), winning Game 1 behind a 36-point performance from Kevin Durant. The rest of the way, though, it was the experience of Miami's Big Three that won out.\n\nMiami won Game's 2, 3 and 4 by an average of just 5 points per game, out-executing the Thunder down the stretch in each game, but it was LeBron James who was feeling the Heat late in the 4th quarter of Game 4. Dealing with leg cramps that kept him out of a portion of the 4th quarter, LeBron gutted out a few possessions at a time and managed to knock down the biggest shot of the game -- a straightaway triple to give Miami the lead for good with just under three minutes to go.\n\nWhat was lost in this game, besides the clutch LeBron three, was how relentlessly Russell Westbrook kept coming at the Heat, scoring what was at the time a postseason career high of 43 points. Westbrook is a player with plenty of warts, but in Game 4 against Miami, Russ was the reason why OKC even took Miami to the wire.\n\nThe Heat would close the Thunder out in Game 5, thanks to a LeBron James triple-double (one of his NBA record 11 NBA Finals triple-doubles) and a barrage of Mike Miller three-pointers that blew the game wide open in the 2nd half. It was this championship and this championship alone that validated the Big Three experiment, and this series -- along with LeBron's massacre of the Celtics in Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals -- that started to change the conversation about LeBron James.\n\n10. 2019 NBA Finals - Toronto Raptors vs. Golden State Warriors (30.5)\n\nWhile many NBA fans still look at the 2019 NBA Finals and see a series that was marred by catastrophic injuries to both Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson, a different read on this series is one that tells the story of one of the ballsiest trades in NBA history, and how it paid off for the Toronto Raptors. Let's rewind from June 2019 to July 2018.\n\nAfter a very public falling out with the San Antonio Spurs, a team for which a young Kawhi Leonard collected a ring and an NBA Finals MVP Trophy with back in 2014, it was common knowledge that Leonard was going to be traded... it was just a question of who would bite. The winner of the Kawhi Leonard sweepstakes turned out to be the Toronto Raptors, a team that had plateaued as an Eastern Conference finalist in recent years. The Raptors shipped DeMar DeRozan, Jakob Poeltl, and a 2019 1st round pick in exchange for Leonard and Danny Green, knowing full well that there was no guarantee that Leonard, a free agent at season's end, would decide to stay in Toronto.\n\nFast-forwarding back to June 2019, the Raptors had emerged as the Eastern Conference's representative in the NBA Finals after narrowly escaping against Philadelphia in the 2nd round and then overcoming an 0-2 deficit against Milwaukee in the Conference Finals. Meanwhile, the Warriors had a much easier path to the Finals than they had in year's past, but came into the series with Kevin Durant's status up in the air. Durant would only play 12 minutes in the entire series, all in Game 5, before a calf strain turned into a ruptured achilles tendon. The Warriors overcame the emotional blow of losing Durant and won Game 5 by just a single point behind 57 points from the Splash Brothers.\n\nThen in Game 6, as Klay Thompson was in the middle of a heater and trying to send the series to a 7th game, he came down awkwardly on a dunk attempt, resulting in a torn ACL. The Raptors hung on to win Game 6 in front of a stunned Warriors crowd in what would be the final game played inside of Oracle Arena.\n\nKawhi Leonard would be named Finals MVP and take his seat on the Iron Throne, and then he'd bolt for the Los Angeles Clippers just weeks later. But Masai Ujiri's bet paid off in what was a memorable and competitive NBA Finals series.\n\n9. 2021 NBA Finals - Milwaukee Bucks vs. Phoenix Suns (30.5)\n\nThe entire story of the 2021 NBA Finals can be told by three separate plays, and yes, I'm fully aware that by summarizing a super competitive and really fun six game series with just three plays does a disservice to the series itself, but we're already nearing 5,000 words in this thing, and ultimately, these are the three plays that explain how the Bucks ultimately beat the Suns.\n\nPlay #1: Game 4 - Giannis Antetokounmpo blocks DeAndre Ayton\n\nPlay #2: Game 5 - Giannis Antetokounmpo catches a Jrue Holiday lob\n\nPlay #3: Game 6 - Giannis Antetokounmpo knocks down a free throw to score 50 points in the series clincher\n\nSo, how did the Milwaukee Bucks beat the Phoenix Suns? Because Giannis Antetokounmpo went supernova for three games, that's how.\n\n8. 2008 NBA Finals - Boston Celtics vs. Los Angeles Lakers (31)\n\nYes, this was Lakers vs. Celtics renewed. Yes, this series set the stage for a seven-game classic two years later. Yes, had Kevin Garnett not gotten hurt in the 2008-09 season, maybe we would've had three consecutive Lakers vs. Celtics matchups in the NBA Finals. But I don't care what anybody says. I'll forever remember this series for Paul Pierce pooping his pants and there's nobody out there who can change my mind or make me think about it any differently.\n\nY'all ever seen the movie Us, Jordan Peele's 2019 psychological horror classic? Well, if you haven't, then go do it, but also, here's the bare-bones spoiler-free summary of what you can expect: A family of four goes on a vacation, where they are terrorized by a red-jumpsuit-wearing group of four who look exactly like them. Simple enough, right?\n\nWell, when I think about the 2006 and 2011 NBA Finals, I think of Us, because these two series' are clear doppelg\u00e4ngers of one another, and the algorithm agrees with me. Same score, same teams, same cities, many of the same characters, and in the end, the same result -- the underdog coming out on top. But here's the thing: I think the wrong team won each series.\n\nNow one of my big sticking points as both a basketball fan and writer is that there should never be an asterisk next to a champions name, and I stand by that. There are no undeserving champs. Every team that wins the title needs some amount of luck along the way. I don't necessarily think that the 2006 Heat or 2011 Mavericks got lucky. No, I believe that there was something much more cosmic at work here.\n\nIt's my belief that the basketball gods simply swapped the correct winners of these two NBA Finals series. A classic mix-up, you could say. That means that the correct franchise won, they just didn't win the correct year, but in the end, all things evened out. The Mavericks and Heat were supposed to split these two series.\n\nIs this sentiment rooted in my unabashed LeBron James fandom? Perhaps it does. Naturally, I wish that LeBron didn't have the black mark of the 2011 NBA Finals on his career resume. But honestly, hand to God, most of this stems from truly believing that the 2005-06 Mavericks, who had to overcome the San Antonio Spurs and Phoenix Suns on their way to the Finals, were the best team in the league that season.\n\nI recognize that I'm likely in the minority here. For good reason, folks love the 2011 Mavericks' run to through the postseason -- a legacy-defining run for Dirk Nowitzki. But we shouldn't have even needed Dirk to get validation in 2011. The moment should've been his in 2006.\n\n5. 2017 NBA Finals - Golden State Warriors vs. Cleveland Cavaliers (32)\n\nThe algorithm was quite favorable to the 2017 NBA Finals, in large part because the series earned a perfect 10 in the Star Power category, an 8.5 in Historical Stakes, and an impressive 7.5 in Overall Competitiveness, despite the fact that the Warriors won in five games and were, in hindsight, probably much larger favorites than we realized at the time. But make no mistake, the 2016-17 Cavaliers were no pushover. In fact, the Cavs were the only team that managed to steal a game from the Dubs in their first postseason with Kevin Durant on the roster, and you can make a compelling case that they could've gotten two.\n\nThe only iconic game or shot in this series was in Game 3, after the series had shifted to Cleveland. The Cavs had their chances to take Game 3 and put a little pressure on Golden State for the first time all postseason, but Kevin Durant answered the bell and hit what was certainly the biggest shot of his entire career.\n\nThe Cavs would take Game 4 from the Dubs, keeping Golden State from becoming the first team in league history to sweep the postseason. But that didn't matter, because just about everyone who was there says the same thing: the 2016-17 Warriors potentially the most talented and most unbeatable professional basketball team ever assembled.\n\n4. 2015 NBA Finals - Golden State Warriors vs. Cleveland Cavaliers (32.5)\n\nThe 2015 NBA Finals have been largely forgotten about as time has passed because of how iconic the conclusion of the 2016 NBA Finals was. However, if you want to go game by game, it's fair to say that you can stack the 2015 NBA Finals up against the 2016 NBA Finals, or any series in recent Finals history for that matter.\n\nThe start of the Warriors-Cavaliers rivalry began in 2015, when an unexpected juggernaut in the Bay Area steamrolled to 67 wins in the regular season behind first-year head coach Steve Kerr, and NBA MVP Stephen Curry. Meanwhile, in Cleveland, LeBron came home, teamed with Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love, and after a rocky start to the season, the Cavaliers course-corrected and marched through the Eastern Conference to make the NBA Finals, LeBron's fifth consecutive trip there.\n\nWhat resulted was a six-game masterpiece which at the time became the most-watched Finals series since 1998. It was a back-and-forth battle with five legitimately memorable and competitive games, including the opening two at Oracle Arena, both of which went to overtime. And even if it's legacy will be forever linked to the three subsequent Finals matchups that followed, my God this served as one hell of a prelude.\n\n(Note: Andre Iguodala should NOT have won Finals MVP. And no, LeBron James shouldn't have either. That sucker belonged to Stephen Curry.)\n\n3. 2010 NBA Finals - Los Angeles Lakers vs. Boston Celtics (32.5)\n\nAnother instance where basketball fans were robbed of a Kobe Bryant vs. LeBron James NBA Finals matchup, but how can you go wrong with LA vs. Boston. Two years after the Celtics won their first NBA Title in 22 years at the expense of the Lakers, LA would get their shot at redemption against a Boston team that went 25-24 in their final 49 games of the regular season.\n\nOnce the Finals began, though, you'd have no indication that Boston was barely a .500 team for over half of the season. Armed with a healthy Big Three and an emerging star in point guard Rajon Rondo, the Lakers got all they could handle from a Celtics team that came in as +160 underdogs.\n\nThe Celtics did what they needed to do in LA, stealing home court advantage with a Game 2 win behind a Rondo triple-double and eight Ray Allen three-pointers. The Lakers would regain home court advantage, but head home for Game 6 facing a 3-2 deficit. An 89-67 blowout in Game 6 -- the only blowout of the series -- forced the series to a 7th game, which was an ugly, beautiful mess of a basketball game.\n\nI'm not going to sit here and pretend like I prefer basketball games with final scores in the 70s and 80s, but there's just something that feels right about a low-scoring, gritty, tense Game 7. It's how Game 7's are meant to be played, and often, how they do play out. Game 7 of the 2010 NBA Finals was no different. It was a game chockfull of ugly offense, desperate defense and more drama that Lakers or Celtics fans could handle.\n\nThe game, which Boston led by 13 early in the 3rd quarter, came down to a ballsy three-pointer from Ron Artest, and the relentlessness of both Pau Gasol (18 rebounds) and Kobe Bryant (15 rebounds) on the glass. Two years prior in the NBA Finals, the Celtics pulled down 16 more offensive rebounds than the Lakers in the six-game series. In Game 7 alone, LA out rebounded Boston by 15 on the offensive glass.\n\n2. 2013 NBA Finals - Miami Heat vs. San Antonio Spurs (33.5)\n\nMost hoops fans seem to only remember the 2013 NBA Finals for Game 6 -- and that's admittedly for good reason -- but let me tell you, this series was much more than just an iconic Ray Allen corner three in Game 6. Although there were only three great games in this seven-game series, the stakes heading in couldn't have been much higher.\n\nMiami was playing for a second-consecutive title in the Big Three era. A back-to-back would leave no doubt that this experiment was an undeniable success, and it would put LeBron James into the next stratosphere of superstardom. Additionally, because Miami famously went on a 27-game winning streak during the regular season and finished the year with a 66-16 record, they were playing for \"Best Team of a Generation\" consideration.\n\nSan Antonio, on the other hand, hadn't been to a Finals since 2007. After a few notable postseason failures -- most notably, losing to Memphis as the #1 seed in 2011 -- most people had begun writing off the Spurs as legitimate title contenders. But three things happened that kept San Antonio's championship window open:\n\nA) Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili enjoyed extended primes, while Tim Duncan remained the steady presence at the center of everything for the Spurs.\n\nB) The Spurs traded for Kawhi Leonard, who would soon turn into a superstar and two-time Finals MVP.\n\nC) Gregg Popovich and the Spurs would craft one of the most beautiful offenses imaginable, predicated on constant ball and player movement that proved impossible to stop when the machine was humming properly.\n\nAnyway...\n\nGame 1 was a gritty nail-biter that neither team by more than nine points all game. It came down to a leaning, heavily contested bank shot from Tony Parker that wrapped the game up and allow San Antonio to steal home court advantage in front of a stunned Miami crowd. The teams split the next four games, meaning the Spurs led 3-2 as the series shifted back to Miami for Games 6 and 7.\n\nGame 6 was a classic that is still talked about to this day as one of the all-time greatest Finals games. Ray Allen's corner three to send the game to overtime and keep Miami's championship hopes alive is etched in history as one of the biggest shots in league history. In fact, it's so big that it rendered Tim Duncan's turn-back-the-clock performance and everything LeBron James did in Game 6 forgettable, which is a crime, because LeBron played arguably the best quarter of his NBA career in the 4th quarter of Game 6 to even give Ray Allen a chance at connecting on a corner three-pointer.\n\n(Also, shout out Chris Bosh for securing the rebound to make Allen's three possible)\n\nAnd then there was Game 7, which like Game 1, was a back-and-forth boxing match that was fought in a metaphorical phone booth. The Spurs biggest lead of the game was 7, early in the 1st quarter, and Miami's too was seven points, which was their final margin of victory. The game was sealed by a LeBron James mid-range jumper over Kawhi Leonard, a fitting conclusion for a series that many analysts believed hinged on LeBron's ability to knock down shots from the outside.\n\n1. 2016 NBA Finals - Cleveland Cavaliers vs. Golden State Warriors (36.5)\n\nThere are some NBA Finals series that will forever stand the test of time. Finals that, just at the mention of a year, you know exactly who played, what happened, and maybe most importantly, what was at stake. 1969. 1977. 1984. 1998. The 2016 NBA Finals are the most recent addition to that list. It's impossible to overstate what was on the line in the 2016 NBA Finals. It was far more than just the Larry O'Brien Trophy, the prize that every team in the league enters every season hoping to earn.\n\nBasketball immortality hung in the balance for both the Cleveland Cavaliers and Golden State Warriors, especially once the Warriors had taken their now notoriously unsafe 3-1 lead. At that point, what would transpire would either be the coronation of the 2015-16 Warriors as one of the greatest, if not the greatest team in NBA history, or the arrival of LeBron James in territory that only Michael Jordan occupied... not to mention the end of a five-decade-long title draught in Cleveland.\n\nThis series had everything that the algorithm looks for and more, coming to an emotional and dramatic climax in the final minutes of Game 7, a tight, white-knuckle barn-burner that came down to the final few possessions after Cleveland had fought off defeat in Games 5 and 6. By now, you surely know all of the beats:\n\nI can't sit here and tell you that this selection comes without bias. I'd be a stone-cold liar if I tried to say as much. But I can rest comfortably because the algorithm rightfully agrees that the 2016 NBA Finals stands above the rest as the greatest and most iconic of the century.", "source": {"uri":

Boston's Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are the Celtics' most tenured and scrutinized stars and see it as a chance at redemption after falling short in the Finals just two seasons ago and then failing to return last year. Dallas' Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving see it as their first opportunity to make good on a partnership that began late last season after Irving was traded from Brooklyn following a tumultuous run of two-plus seasons with the Nets.\n\nPaul Skenes went right after Shohei Ohtani. The result was a brilliant bit of baseball theater\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) -- Pittsburgh Pirates rookie Paul Skenes made a quick impression on Los Angles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani. Skenes struck out Ohtani on three fastballs that reached 100 mph during their first meeting of what became a 10-6 Pittsburgh win. Ohtani exacted revenge later, dinging Skenes for a two-run homer and adding a single. Skenes still improved to 3-0 after striking out eight over five innings. Skenes says there is still plenty to work on through five career starts. Pirates catcher Yasmani Grandal says when Skenes figures everything out he is going to be a \"nightmare\" for opposing hitters.\n\nThe NBA Finals were too late for Dallas' Luka Doncic to watch as a kid. Now, he's in them\n\nBOSTON (AP) -- Luka Doncic didn't stay up all night to watch NBA Finals games as a kid. They usually started at something like 3 a.m. in his native Slovenia. He had school to get to a few hours later. He'd wake up and find out who won. Make no mistake, though: Doncic was paying attention. The 25-year-old makes his NBA Finals debut for the Dallas Mavericks when they take on the Boston Celtics in Game 1 of this year's title series on Thursday night. He could become the first player to win a scoring title and a championship in the same season since Shaquille O'Neal in 2000.\n\nNBA Finals Notebook: Porzingis a go, Kyrie and LeBron make nice, Hardaway Jr. throws shade at dad\n\nBOSTON (AP) -- Celtics 7-footer Kristaps Porzingis said he will be ready to \"just go out there and hoop\" for Game 1 of the NBA Finals on Thursday night after missing Boston's last 10 games with a strained left calf. Porzingis said he couldn't predict how it will be once he gets into a game for the first time since April 29. An offseason acquisition that helped solidify the Celtics frontcourt, Porzingis averaged 20 points, 7.2 rebounds and almost two blocks per game. But he was again dogged by injuries that limited him to 57 games. He left Game 4 of the first-round series against the Miami Heat and missed all of the next two rounds.\n\nJennings' HR helps Oklahoma beat Texas 8-3 and move a win away from 4th straight Women's CWS title\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Tiare Jennings' two-run homer in the first inning sparked Oklahoma to an 8-3 win over Texas that left the Sooners one win from a record fourth straight national title. Jennings had two hits and three RBIs and Kinzie Hansen had two hits, including a two-run homer, for the Sooners in Game 1 of the best-of-three Women's College World Series championship series. Oklahoma had nine hits and three home runs against a Texas squad that threw three one-hit shutouts in three World Series games. The Sooners could clinch on Thursday night. Mia Scott hit a solo homer for Texas.\n\nPro athletes understand gambling on their games is a non-negotiable no-no. Some learned the hard way\n\nBOSTON (AP) -- Professional athletes get told at the start of every season that if they gamble on their games, the consequences are severe. This spring they've gotten a more personal reminder, with both the NBA and Major League Baseball banning players for life. Padres infielder Tucupita Marcano was permanently banned this week for betting on games he was involved in. The NBA banished Raptors forward Jontay Porter in April. Other players say they should have known better. Marcano was the first active baseball player in a century banned for life for gambling. MLB said he placed hundreds of bets totaling more than $150,000 on baseball in 2022 and 2023.\n\nSchauffele now a major champion at Memorial and facing a big stretch of golf\n\nDUBLIN, Ohio (AP) -- Xander Schauffele was able to take a few weeks off after claiming his first major at the PGA Championship. He came to realize he's still the same person and his life hasn't changed. Now he returns to the Memorial to face a tough stretch of golf. The Memorial is a signature event with a top field and big purse. Then it's off to the U.S. Open at Pinehurst No. 2 and then another signature event at the Travelers Championship. Tournament host Jack Nicklaus isn't thrilled with a new date for the Memorial that pushes it right up against a major.\n\nCole to make at least 2 more minor league starts, on track for possible Yankees' return in June\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Gerrit Cole is likely to make at least two more minor league rehabilitation starts, putting the AL Young Award winner on track for a possible return to the New York Yankees' rotation in mid-to-late June. Cole said he felt fine a day after his first rehab outing, a 45-pitch effort over 3 1/3 scoreless innings for Double-A Somerset on Tuesday night. Manager Aaron Boone says \"at least a couple more\" and adds: \"I don't know how many. Is that two? Is it three?\" Cole and Boone weren't ready to commit to Cole's next outing.\n\nWNBA rescinds second technical foul that was assessed to Angel Reese\n\nThe WNBA announced that it's rescinded the second technical foul on Chicago rookie Angel Reese that occurred with 2:31 left in the loss to the New York Liberty on Tuesday night. Reese was thrown out of the game after receiving two technical fouls following a brief interaction with official Charles Watson. The rookie forward appeared to say something to Watson and then quickly waved her hand. Head official Maj Forsberg said in a pool report that Reese's technical fouls were for \"disrespectfully addressing\" the official and then for \"waving her hand in dismissal.\" Reese finished with 13 points and 10 rebounds.\n\nCam Sutton is getting a second chance with the Steelers following domestic violence incident\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) -- Cameron Sutton is getting a second chance in the NFL with the Pittsburgh Steelers. The Steelers have signed the veteran defensive back to a one-year deal. The agreement comes more than two months after he was released by the Detroit Lions for his involvement in an alleged domestic violence incident in Florida. Sutton eventually surrendered to authorities and entered a pretrial diversion program after the charges were reduced from a felony to misdemeanor battery.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com",

He approached his NBA Finals media day session with a bright smile, seemingly prepared for another shot at the biggest stage and fully comprehending the narrative that he's been less than stellar during this postseason run.\n\nYes, Tatum has been the most criticized All-NBA First Team player who had led his team to the Finals, despite the team's success, despite averaging 26 points, 10.4 rebounds, and 5.9 assists on 44 percent shooting, despite defending at the highest level of his career.\n\nThe pressure is on Tatum to prove he will be the best player during these Finals with the presence of the great Luka Doncic. There are considerable doubts about his ability to carry a team as megastars do.\n\nTatum doesn't seem concerned about his personal status, as long as the Celtics flourish, but that doesn't mean he ignores the naysayers or he has to calm annoyed family members who read or watch their Jayson being dressed down.\n\n\"I think more so than me, right, it's my mom, my grandma, my family and friends,\" he said Wednesday at TD Garden. \"They're more bothered by it than me. I understand, like, if Deuce was to make it to the NBA, people were talking about him every single day, as a parent, I wouldn't be able to separate the superstar from the child. My mom took it a little tougher than maybe I did.\n\n\"But for me, I don't take it personal, right? Just a long break without NBA basketball (the past week), so they had to overanalyze every little thing, have something to talk about. Did it get old? Yeah. But, you know, it's the Finals. They wouldn't talk about me if I wasn't good, so ... Try to take some positives out of it and change the channel.\"\n\nScrutiny may have aided in the bonding of Tatum and Jaylen Brown. Both have been heavily criticized in recent years because they are no longer pups. They are established stars and that comes with expectations. The NBA public is tired of the Celtics ramping up for titles every year but falling short, and Tatum and Brown have withstood the brunt of the blame.\n\nBrown tried in vain quoting a proverb when asks how he digests the criticism. That proverb says: \"The child who is not embraced by the village will burn it down to feel its warmth.\"\n\n\"I think it's fair to say that it does affect you being embraced versus being scrutinized,\" Brown said. \"One of my favorite quotes is, like, 'The child who isn't embraced by the village...', something like that, you will, what is it? Y'all know this quote, right? You will feel like the warmth. The child that doesn't feel the warmth of the village will burn it down, something like that.\"\n\nBrown managed a smile during his failed attempt to capture the quote accurately.\n\n\"Yeah, whatever,\" he said. \"Neither here nor there. But, you know, referencing that, you get to a point where it's, like, you get scrutinized enough for a large part of your career, it becomes normal. Then it just rolls off you. For me, at least, I can say. I don't know if Jayson feels the same way. It's kind of been that my whole career in a sense. Just being booed when you were drafted to saying you were overpaid, saying you were overpaid again. It's been that (way) the whole journey for me. It just becomes another headline.\"\n\nExperience they hope will make a difference in these Finals and help change the narrative about falling short of greatness. Tatum was battered for his shortcomings against the Warriors in '22, getting shut down by Andrew Wiggins, who held him to a woeful 36.7 percent shooting in the series.\n\nBrown heard a chorus of jeers after his eight-turnover Game 7 last year against the Heat. Neither has forgotten those condemnations, and views these Finals as the latest opportunity to prove themselves as elite players and champions.\n\n\"Biggest lesson? I give a lot of credit to that team, the Warriors,\" Tatum said. \"I think we understood what it took to get there. They understood what it took to get over the hump. That was really a special team that didn't make many mistakes, obviously well-coached. They've just been there before. In some of those tough moments, when I go back and look, you can tell that they had been there before. It was a lesson to be learned. I told myself that if I ever got the opportunity again to make it to the Finals, never take it for granted. Obviously, we're here now. Thankful to be here. I'm excited to get ready to play and have fun.\"\n\nBrown said he's grateful to return to the Finals. He said he's watched the complete '22 Finals a handful of times. That series still burns in his soul. These players have a chance to atone, to learn from their past mistakes and change their narrative, quiet the critics and cement their reputation as all-time Celtics.\n\n\"I think this is a special group. I really do,\" Brown said. \"The core group of it has been here for a few years now. We've been able to go through the experiences of having success but not having success at the same time. I think to solidify the ultimate goal is to get over the hump and win.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_shot_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jump shot (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wiggins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Wiggins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/bsF-8wSdS6f_Brr4f70QzN04e9c=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/PUWWCOFZCHZU6747VDO6BVQQ7E.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

While that includes Jayson Tatum, it's tough to ignore how much scrutiny he has faced throughout the Boston Celtics' 2024 playoff run.\n\nTatum's postseason play has been picked apart despite Boston losing just two games and the five-time All-Star averaging 26.0 points, 10.4 rebounds, and 5.9 assists. He has overcome his inefficient shooting nights with elite rebounding, outstanding playmaking, and rock-solid defense.\n\nRipping his performance is one thing, but the discourse became absurd when ESPN's Get Up! questioned whether Tatum was happy to see teammate Jaylen Brown earn the Eastern Conference Finals MVP honor. They debated the topic despite Tatum's all-smiles reaction to Brown hoisting the Larry Bird Trophy.\n\nDuring NBA Finals Media Day on Wednesday, Gary Washburn of The Boston Globe told Tatum he's been \"the most scrutinized player\" in the postseason.\n\n\"You think so?\" Tatum answered with a smirk.\n\nWashburn went on to ask Tatum how he has dealt with the scrutiny.\n\n\"I think moreso than me, it's like, my mom, my grandma, my family and friends. They're more bothered by it than me,\" Tatum said. \"And I understand. Like, if Deuce was to make it to the NBA and people were talking about him every single day, as a parent I wouldn't be able to separate the superstar from the child. So, my mom took it a little tougher than maybe I did.\n\n\"But for me, I don't take it personal.

They wouldn't talk about me if I wasn't good. So, try to take some positives out of it and change the channel.''\n\nIt's a level-headed take from Tatum, who can expect the criticism to persist for as long as it takes for Boston to bring home Banner 18. Even then, his detractors will find ways to poke holes in his accomplishments for as long as he remains one of the faces of the league.\n\nTatum and the C's will look to ignore the noise and take care of business against the Dallas Mavericks when the Finals begin Thursday night at TD Garden.

Boston's Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are the Celtics' most tenured and scrutinized stars and see it as a chance at redemption after falling short in the Finals just two seasons ago and then failing to return last year. Dallas' Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving see it as their first opportunity to make good on a partnership that began late last season after Irving was traded from Brooklyn following a tumultuous run of two-plus seasons with the Nets.\n\nPaul Skenes went right after Shohei Ohtani. The result was a brilliant bit of baseball theater\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) -- Pittsburgh Pirates rookie Paul Skenes made a quick impression on Los Angles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani. Skenes struck out Ohtani on three fastballs that reached 100 mph during their first meeting of what became a 10-6 Pittsburgh win. Ohtani exacted revenge later, dinging Skenes for a two-run homer and adding a single. Skenes still improved to 3-0 after striking out eight over five innings. Skenes says there is still plenty to work on through five career starts. Pirates catcher Yasmani Grandal says when Skenes figures everything out he is going to be a \"nightmare\" for opposing hitters.\n\nThe NBA Finals were too late for Dallas' Luka Doncic to watch as a kid. Now, he's in them\n\nBOSTON (AP) -- Luka Doncic didn't stay up all night to watch NBA Finals games as a kid. They usually started at something like 3 a.m. in his native Slovenia. He had school to get to a few hours later. He'd wake up and find out who won. Make no mistake, though: Doncic was paying attention. The 25-year-old makes his NBA Finals debut for the Dallas Mavericks when they take on the Boston Celtics in Game 1 of this year's title series on Thursday night. He could become the first player to win a scoring title and a championship in the same season since Shaquille O'Neal in 2000.\n\nNBA Finals Notebook: Porzingis a go, Kyrie and LeBron make nice, Hardaway Jr. throws shade at dad\n\nBOSTON (AP) -- Celtics 7-footer Kristaps Porzingis said he will be ready to \"just go out there and hoop\" for Game 1 of the NBA Finals on Thursday night after missing Boston's last 10 games with a strained left calf. Porzingis said he couldn't predict how it will be once he gets into a game for the first time since April 29. An offseason acquisition that helped solidify the Celtics frontcourt, Porzingis averaged 20 points, 7.2 rebounds and almost two blocks per game. But he was again dogged by injuries that limited him to 57 games. He left Game 4 of the first-round series against the Miami Heat and missed all of the next two rounds.\n\nNovak Djokovic says his knee surgery went well and he wants to return to action as soon as possible\n\nPARIS (AP) -- Novak Djokovic says surgery on his right knee went well after he was injured during the French Open. He also wrote in a post on social media on Thursday that he hopes to return to competition as soon as possible. Djokovic had an operation in Paris on Wednesday. That was two days after he hurt the knee early in the second set of a five-set victory against Francisco Cerundolo in the fourth round. The 24-time Grand Slam champion withdrew from the clay-court major tournament on Tuesday, so he was unable to play in the quarterfinals. Wimbledon begins on July 1.\n\nJennings' HR helps Oklahoma beat Texas 8-3 and move a win away from 4th straight Women's CWS title\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Tiare Jennings' two-run homer in the first inning sparked Oklahoma to an 8-3 win over Texas that left the Sooners one win from a record fourth straight national title. Jennings had two hits and three RBIs and Kinzie Hansen had two hits, including a two-run homer, for the Sooners in Game 1 of the best-of-three Women's College World Series championship series. Oklahoma had nine hits and three home runs against a Texas squad that threw three one-hit shutouts in three World Series games. The Sooners could clinch on Thursday night. Mia Scott hit a solo homer for Texas.\n\nPro athletes understand gambling on their games is a non-negotiable no-no. Some learned the hard way\n\nBOSTON (AP) -- Professional athletes get told at the start of every season that if they gamble on their games, the consequences are severe. This spring they've gotten a more personal reminder, with both the NBA and Major League Baseball banning players for life. Padres infielder Tucupita Marcano was permanently banned this week for betting on games he was involved in. The NBA banished Raptors forward Jontay Porter in April. Other players say they should have known better. Marcano was the first active baseball player in a century banned for life for gambling. MLB said he placed hundreds of bets totaling more than $150,000 on baseball in 2022 and 2023.\n\nJannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz will renew their rivalry in the French Open semifinals\n\nPARIS (AP) -- Jannik Sinner is just 22, and Carlos Alcaraz just 21, yet they've already built quite a rivalry heading into their French Open semifinal on Friday. Spain's Alcaraz owns two Grand Slam titles and spent time at No. 1 in the rankings. Italy's Sinner won the Australian Open in January and will ascend to No. 1 next week. This will be their ninth meeting; the series is tied at 4-all. The other men's semifinal in Paris is No. 7 Casper Ruud against No. 4 Alexander Zverev. That's not a bad matchup, either. But it's No. 2 Sinner vs. No. 3 Alcaraz capturing all of the buzz.\n\nSchauffele now a major champion at Memorial and facing a big stretch of golf\n\nDUBLIN, Ohio (AP) -- Xander Schauffele was able to take a few weeks off after claiming his first major at the PGA Championship. He came to realize he's still the same person and his life hasn't changed. Now he returns to the Memorial to face a tough stretch of golf. The Memorial is a signature event with a top field and big purse. Then it's off to the U.S. Open at Pinehurst No. 2 and then another signature event at the Travelers Championship. Tournament host Jack Nicklaus isn't thrilled with a new date for the Memorial that pushes it right up against a major.\n\nCarlos Rod\u00f3n wins 6th straight start for Yankees, putting miserable first season in New York behind\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Carlos Rod\u00f3n retired his first 16 batters and won a career-best sixth straight start, leading the Yankees over the Minnesota Twins 9-5 that stretched New York's winning streak to seven.Rod\u00f3n is 8-2 with a 3.08 ERA, striking out 71 and walking 20 in 73 innings with a .217 opponents' batting average. After signing a $162 million, eight-year contract, Rod\u00f3n missed the first half of last season with injuries, then went 3-8 with a 6.85 ERA. The lasting image was a confrontation with pitching coach Matt Blake in his last start, when Rod\u00f3n allowed all eight batters he faced to reach base.", "source": {"uri": "yakimaherald.com",

James broke down the Celtics' strengths, focusing on their offensive versatility, defensive challenges, and overall team composition.\n\n\"You know, that's going to be a big time challenge and obviously, personnel wise, you see who's on the floor, but at the end of the day, if Porzingis is active, then nine times out of ten, they're going to have five shooters on the floor.\"\n\n\"So you can't, you know how, you know, in the OKC series, Dallas was allowed to hide Gafford at times and lively and put them on Josh Giddey, you know, and kind of keep them roaming, you know, not afraid of his pick and pops, not afraid of him being spaced in the corner.\"\n\n\"So that will be the biggest question mark, JJ, on who guards Porzingis. So I think what helps in Dallas case um if that is the case having Maxi Kleber back. So I think that helps a lot. I know he's been out for a while since round one versus the Clippers, but it does allow them to now start switching a lot.\"\n\n\"You know, and I know that's always challenging against Boston because they have so many great ISO players, but I do think there's times in certain matchups where Maxi can't switch out on some of the, you know, Boston guards and contain them.\"\n\n\"There's not one person you can roam off of that Boston puts out on the floor. They are well equipped.\" (1:00)\n\nLeBron highlighted that one of the Celtics' most significant advantages is their ability to deploy five shooters on the floor simultaneously, especially if Kristaps Porzingis is active.\n\nThis creates a formidable challenge for opponents who cannot afford to leave any player unguarded. The Celtics' shooting prowess forces defenses to stay honest, eliminating opportunities to \"hide\" weaker defenders or big men who struggle with perimeter defense.\n\nJames pointed out that during their series against the Oklahoma City Thunder, the Dallas Mavericks could place Daniel Gafford or Dereck Lively on less threatening shooters like Josh Giddey, allowing them to roam and provide help defense. However, this strategy won't work against Boston due to their lethal shooting across the board.\n\nAnother crucial aspect James mentioned is the Celtics' ability to exploit defensive mismatches. With versatile big men like Porzingis, Boston can run effective pick-and-pop actions, putting opposing big men in difficult positions. Defenders like Gafford and Lively will face tough decisions on whether to help driving guards or contest Porzingis' outside shots. This dilemma can open up the floor for the Celtics' dynamic perimeter players to attack.\n\nLeBron also emphasized the importance of the Mavericks having Maxi Kleber back in the lineup. Kleber's return provides Dallas with more defensive flexibility, allowing them to switch more effectively on pick-and-roll situations and contain Boston's elite isolation players.\n\nHowever, even with Kleber, the Celtics' offensive firepower and spacing present unique challenges that the Mavericks haven't encountered in their previous playoff matchups.\n\nMoreover, James stressed that the Celtics' offensive scheme, characterized by high-volume three-point shooting, adds another layer of difficulty for defenders. Boston's capability to make 25 or more three-pointers in a game forces defenses to stretch thin, creating more driving lanes and open shots. This relentless shooting pressure can be mentally and physically exhausting for any defense.\n\nLastly, LeBron noted the defensive matchups, particularly highlighting players like P.J. Washington and Derrick Jones Jr., who can effectively guard Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. While acknowledging their defensive capabilities, he reiterated that the Celtics' offensive system and spacing make them a different beast compared to the teams Dallas has faced so far.\n\nLeBron James articulated that the Boston Celtics are a formidable opponent due to their versatile offense, excellent spacing, and shooting depth.

In the recently released third episode of All In Celtics, Brown had a message for those who continue to not give him his due credit and respect.\n\n\"For various reasons, I feel like I don't get the credit or respect that I have earned, and I'm at the point of my life where I just don't -- I don't give a f***, you know? I might never get it, and I'm okay with that,\" Brown said. \"I am who I am, I do what I do and I believe in what I believe in. So the ones who with me, let's rock and roll, and the ones who aren't, can kiss my a**.\"\n\nView the original article to see embedded media.\n\nThat is certainly the right mindset to have. It's not hard to see why Brown thinks he doesn't get the credit and respect he deserves. Despite playing a pivotal role in the Celtics finishing with a league-best 64-18 record this season, the 27-year-old didn't make any of the All-NBA teams.\n\nBrown averaged 23.0 points, 5.5 rebounds, 3.6 assists, 1.2 steals, and 0.5 blocks per game this season, and shot 49.9% from the field, but it wasn't deemed enough. It certainly bothered him and Brown stated that players half as talented as him get praised and anointed.\n\nTo his credit, the three-time All-Star didn't let that disappointment negatively affect his game. Brown shone in the Eastern Conference Finals against the Indiana Pacers, as he averaged 29.8 points, 5.0 rebounds, 3.0 assists, 2.0 steals, and 0.8 blocks per game.\n\nBrown's play was a big reason the Celtics swept the Pacers and for once he got some credit too, winning Eastern Conference Finals MVP. It was quite the change from a year ago when he had been heavily criticized for his poor play against the Miami Heat on the same stage.\n\nBrown gained some redemption with his performances this year, but the job isn't done just yet. He would know better than most that all this praise that he has gotten will go away if he doesn't deliver in the NBA Finals against the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nJaylen Brown Says These Celtics Are Different From Their Previous Iterations\n\nSince Brown arrived in Boston as the third pick of the 2016 NBA Draft, the Celtics have been one of the dominant forces in the Eastern Conference, but have never been able to get over the line and win it all. Despite their success this season, doubts remain regarding this team due to their past, but Brown explained why the Celtics are a different team in the 2023-24 season.\n\n\"We feel like we're a different team than we were last year and the year before that,\" said Brown via Bobby Krivitsky of Sports Illustrated. \"I know everybody wants to continue to kind of pigeonhole us to what's happened in the past, but we've had a different team every single year.\"\n\n\"Different coaches,\" Brown continued. We've had like three coaches in the last five years, and still, people want to just make it seem like it's the same, it's the same, it's the same. Time has gone by, experience has been gained, and I think we are ready to put our best foot forward.\"\n\nNot only have the coaches changed and the players gained more experience, but some key additions have been made too. Jrue Holiday and Kristaps Porzingis were acquired in the hopes that they would help the Celtics get over the line. Will they? Well, time will tell.\n\nRelated: Jaylen Brown Goes Off On The Haters, Says He's Embraced Being The Villain\n\nThank you for being a valued reader of Fadeaway World.

Boston's Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are the Celtics' most tenured and scrutinized stars and see it as a chance at redemption after falling short in the Finals just two seasons ago and then failing to return last year. Dallas' Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving see it as their first opportunity to make good on a partnership that began late last season after Irving was traded from Brooklyn following a tumultuous run of two-plus seasons with the Nets.\n\nPaul Skenes went right after Shohei Ohtani. The result was a brilliant bit of baseball theater\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) -- Pittsburgh Pirates rookie Paul Skenes made a quick impression on Los Angles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani. Skenes struck out Ohtani on three fastballs that reached 100 mph during their first meeting of what became a 10-6 Pittsburgh win. Ohtani exacted revenge later, dinging Skenes for a two-run homer and adding a single. Skenes still improved to 3-0 after striking out eight over five innings. Skenes says there is still plenty to work on through five career starts. Pirates catcher Yasmani Grandal says when Skenes figures everything out he is going to be a \"nightmare\" for opposing hitters.\n\nThe NBA Finals were too late for Dallas' Luka Doncic to watch as a kid. Now, he's in them\n\nBOSTON (AP) -- Luka Doncic didn't stay up all night to watch NBA Finals games as a kid. They usually started at something like 3 a.m. in his native Slovenia. He had school to get to a few hours later. He'd wake up and find out who won. Make no mistake, though: Doncic was paying attention. The 25-year-old makes his NBA Finals debut for the Dallas Mavericks when they take on the Boston Celtics in Game 1 of this year's title series on Thursday night. He could become the first player to win a scoring title and a championship in the same season since Shaquille O'Neal in 2000.\n\nNBA Finals Notebook: Porzingis a go, Kyrie and LeBron make nice, Hardaway Jr. throws shade at dad\n\nBOSTON (AP) -- Celtics 7-footer Kristaps Porzingis said he will be ready to \"just go out there and hoop\" for Game 1 of the NBA Finals on Thursday night after missing Boston's last 10 games with a strained left calf. Porzingis said he couldn't predict how it will be once he gets into a game for the first time since April 29. An offseason acquisition that helped solidify the Celtics frontcourt, Porzingis averaged 20 points, 7.2 rebounds and almost two blocks per game. But he was again dogged by injuries that limited him to 57 games. He left Game 4 of the first-round series against the Miami Heat and missed all of the next two rounds.\n\nJennings' HR helps Oklahoma beat Texas 8-3 and move a win away from 4th straight Women's CWS title\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Tiare Jennings' two-run homer in the first inning sparked Oklahoma to an 8-3 win over Texas that left the Sooners one win from a record fourth straight national title. Jennings had two hits and three RBIs and Kinzie Hansen had two hits, including a two-run homer, for the Sooners in Game 1 of the best-of-three Women's College World Series championship series. Oklahoma had nine hits and three home runs against a Texas squad that threw three one-hit shutouts in three World Series games. The Sooners could clinch on Thursday night. Mia Scott hit a solo homer for Texas.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nPro athletes understand gambling on their games is a non-negotiable no-no. Some learned the hard way\n\nBOSTON (AP) -- Professional athletes get told at the start of every season that if they gamble on their games, the consequences are severe. This spring they've gotten a more personal reminder, with both the NBA and Major League Baseball banning players for life. Padres infielder Tucupita Marcano was permanently banned this week for betting on games he was involved in. The NBA banished Raptors forward Jontay Porter in April. Other players say they should have known better. Marcano was the first active baseball player in a century banned for life for gambling. MLB said he placed hundreds of bets totaling more than $150,000 on baseball in 2022 and 2023.\n\nSchauffele now a major champion at Memorial and facing a big stretch of golf\n\nDUBLIN, Ohio (AP) -- Xander Schauffele was able to take a few weeks off after claiming his first major at the PGA Championship. He came to realize he's still the same person and his life hasn't changed. Now he returns to the Memorial to face a tough stretch of golf. The Memorial is a signature event with a top field and big purse. Then it's off to the U.S. Open at Pinehurst No. 2 and then another signature event at the Travelers Championship. Tournament host Jack Nicklaus isn't thrilled with a new date for the Memorial that pushes it right up against a major.\n\nCarlos Rod\u00f3n wins 6th straight start for Yankees, putting miserable first season in New York behind\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Carlos Rod\u00f3n retired his first 16 batters and won a career-best sixth straight start, leading the Yankees over the Minnesota Twins 9-5 that stretched New York's winning streak to seven.Rod\u00f3n is 8-2 with a 3.08 ERA, striking out 71 and walking 20 in 73 innings with a .217 opponents' batting average. After signing a $162 million, eight-year contract, Rod\u00f3n missed the first half of last season with injuries, then went 3-8 with a 6.85 ERA. The lasting image was a confrontation with pitching coach Matt Blake in his last start, when Rod\u00f3n allowed all eight batters he faced to reach base.\n\nCole to make at least 2 more minor league starts, on track for possible Yankees' return in June\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Gerrit Cole is likely to make at least two more minor league rehabilitation starts, putting the AL Young Award winner on track for a possible return to the New York Yankees' rotation in mid-to-late June. Cole said he felt fine a day after his first rehab outing, a 45-pitch effort over 3 1/3 scoreless innings for Double-A Somerset on Tuesday night. Manager Aaron Boone says \"at least a couple more\" and adds: \"I don't know how many. Is that two? Is it three?\" Cole and Boone weren't ready to commit to Cole's next outing.\n\nWNBA rescinds second technical foul that was assessed to Angel Reese\n\nThe WNBA announced that it's rescinded the second technical foul on Chicago rookie Angel Reese that occurred with 2:31 left in the loss to the New York Liberty on Tuesday night. Reese was thrown out of the game after receiving two technical fouls following a brief interaction with official Charles Watson. The rookie forward appeared to say something to Watson and then quickly waved her hand. Head official Maj Forsberg said in a pool report that Reese's technical fouls were for \"disrespectfully addressing\" the official and then for \"waving her hand in dismissal.\" Reese finished with 13 points and 10 rebounds.", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Springs Gazette"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@gazette.com", "name": "Associated Press",

I say it's no shocker to see the Boston Celtics playing for an NBA title as they went 68-14 this season. The Celtics entered the playoffs the number one seed from the Eastern Conference.\n\nThe Dallas Mavericks, now I doubt many thought they would be representing the Western Conference. The Mavericks entered the playoffs as a five seed. The Dallas team went 50-32 this season. The Celtics won 18 more regular season games than Dallas. The boys in Vegas have installed the Celtics as 2-1 favorites over the Mavericks.\n\nI ask, can the Mavericks upset the mighty boys from Boston? I say, absolutely they have a shot at the upset. The two superstar guards in Luka Doncic and Kyrie \"the earth is flat\" Irving are playing tremendous basketball in these playoffs. The upset can only happen if these two players keep up the tremendous play on the court.\n\nThe Boston Celtics were in the NBA Finals in 2022 but lost to the Golden State Warriors in six games. I think the experience of that loss will propel the Celtics in this series against Dallas.\n\nThe Fat Guy will take the Boston Celtics in seven games to win. I will say, I will not be shocked if the Dallas team pulls off the upset. I can tell you, yes, I am rooting for Dallas to defeat Boston.\n\nThe Stanley Cup Finals will begin on Saturday night in Florida. The Eastern Conference champions are the Florida Panthers. The Western Conference champions are the Edmonton Oilers. I absolutely love this Stanley Cup matchup of these two teams. The Florida Panthers lost last year in the Stanley Cup Finals to Vegas, so they will look to redeem themselves. The Florida franchise has never hoisted Lord Stanley in their team history. The Panthers are a tough physical hockey team with scoring power and solid goaltending. The goaltender is Sergei Bobrovsky, and he is one tough customer between the pipes.\n\nThe Edmonton Oilers top line of Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl offensively will pose problems for Florida. I am repeating myself from the last two weeks, but watching Connor McDavid is totally worth the watch. I am so happy he finally made it to the Stanley Cup Finals!\n\nThe Fat Guy loved the Panthers when the playoffs started, and I am not bailing ship now! The goaltender for Florida is the difference, and Florida wins in six games! Yes, the Stanley Cup will need some sunscreen in 2024!\n\nThe Detroit Tigers made a major move in sending Spencer Torkelson down to Triple-A Toledo. The season has been a total disaster for \"Tork\" as he was hitting a paltry .179 against fastballs thrown to him. The last two weeks Spencer was 0-19 during one stretch and then went 0-16 in another stretch. I mean, Spencer left the Tigers no choice but to try to fix his swing at Toledo. I hope it works, as the number one overall pick needs to be vital to the Tigers in the big picture.\n\nThe Tigers called up Justyn-Henry Malloy, the Tigers number six prospect. The position Malloy plays is outfield so the Tigers tried Gio Urshela and Mark Canha at first base in Boston. The right handed hitting Malloy is a patient hitter and has a good eye at the plate. I would rank his power as average. The Tigers acquired Malloy from the Atlanta Braves in the Joe Jimenez trade in 2022. I guess we shall see if Malloy is MLB ready!", "source": {"uri": "burtonview.mihomepaper.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Burton View"}, "authors": [{"uri": "https@burtonview.mihomepaper.com", "name": "https", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_McDavid", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Connor McDavid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton_Oilers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton Oilers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Bobrovsky", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sergei Bobrovsky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Tigers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Tigers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Triple-A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toledo,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toledo, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toledo, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Gaming", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Gaming", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://burtonview.mihomepaper.com/wp-content/uploads/images/2024-06-06/43p1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

But raising Banner 18 won't be easy.\n\nThat said, the Celtics will enter this series as heavy favorites after an NBA-best 64-18 regular-season record and a 12-2 record this postseason. Big man Kristaps Porzingis is expected to play in Game 1 after missing the team's previous 10 playoff games and should give Boston an immediate boost on both ends of the floor.\n\nSo, how will this series play out? We asked our partners at Strat-O-Matic -- who accurately predicted the Celtics' regular-season record down to the exact game -- to simulate the 2024 NBA Finals, with detailed box scores and recaps for every game.\n\nHere are the full game-by-game results of the simulation, followed by detailed player stats for the series:\n\nGame 1: Celtics 135, Mavs 127\n\nPorzingis comes out firing in his first game action since April 29, hitting a pair of 3-pointers early in the first quarter to help Boston open up a double-digit lead.\n\nThe Celtics expand their lead to as many as 17 points, but the Mavs surge back behind a barrage of buckets from Doncic and Irving and take the lead early in the fourth quarter on a Derrick Jones Jr. 3-pointer.\n\nBoston delivers with the game on the line, however, scoring the final 14 points of the contest -- including a dagger Porzingis 3-pointer with 40 seconds remaining -- to clinch a Game 1 win.\n\nPorzingis finishes with 21 points while Tatum and Brown combine for 61 points (36 and 25, respectively) to survive brilliant performances from both Doncic (38 points, 15 rebounds and five assists) and Irving (31 points and eight assists).\n\nGame 2: Celtics 128, Mavs 124\n\nCeltics fans get some early-playoff Game 2 flashbacks in this one, as the Mavs race out to a 10-point lead midway through the second quarter. But Jrue Holiday helps settle the C's down with eight straight points near the end of the first half, and Derrick White's 3-pointer helps Boston enter the break with a two-point lead.\n\nThe Celtics hold a two-point lead with under five minutes remaining when Tatum converts layups on consecutive possessions to put his team up by six. Dallas gets no closer than five until the closing seconds, as Boston earns another crunch-time victory to take a 2-0 series lead.\n\nTatum (34 points) and Holiday (24 points) pace the Celtics, while Doncic (35) and Irving (31) again are a two-man show for Dallas.\n\nGame 3: Mavs 115, Celtics 108\n\nThe Celtics hold their own early in Game 3 as the series swings to Dallas, taking a six-point lead into halftime. But the Mavs respond with a 38-point third quarter and add 30 more in the fourth, ripping off a 19-7 run down the stretch that balloons their lead to as many as 13 points with four minutes remaining.\n\nBoston has no answer for Doncic -- who goes off for a series-high 43 points, nine rebounds and 10 assists -- while Irving chips in 24. Brown is the Celtics' high scorer at 27 points and Porzingis adds 22, but Tatum is limited to 21 points on just 14 shots.\n\nGame 4: Celtics 118, Mavs 103\n\nThe Mavs surge to a 12-point first-quarter lead and appear poised to tie the series at 2-2 heading back to Boston. But the Celtics deliver a strong response, limiting Dallas to just 13 points in the second quarter and taking a double-digit lead of their own in the third quarter.\n\nThe Jays do their thing -- 26 points from Brown and 24 from Tatum -- and Derrick White steps up with 20 points on four made 3-pointers, but it's Boston's defense that wins this game. Doncic makes just 10 of 25 shots for a series-low 26 points and commits three turnovers as the Celtics take a decisive 3-1 series lead with the chance to secure Banner 18 in Boston.\n\nThe Mavs keep it close for two quarters before the Celtics send TD Garden into a frenzy with a 14-0 run late in the third that gives them a 94-77 lead. Boston's defense once again leads the charge, limiting Dallas to just 38 second-half points while forcing a total of 20 Mavs turnovers.\n\nOn the offensive end, Brown delivers 31 points on 60 percent shooting (12 of 20), while Tatum (27), White (23) and Porzingis (21) all top 20 points in a fitting end to a dominant season for the Celtics.\n\nTwo years after watching the Golden State Warriors celebrate the 2022 championship on their own floor, the C's get sweet redemption and kick off a Garden Party by securing their NBA-record 18th title in franchise history.\n\nCheck out the simulation's

Two of the greatest quarterbacks in the modern era, Tom Brady and Patrick Mahomes, helped get the respective fan bases fired up for Game 1.\n\nMahomes, who grew up outside Dallas, narrated a hype video for the Mavericks. In the video, the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback highlights what has been a magical run for Dallas. The Mavs may not have been the most feared team in the field at the start of the playoffs, but they have been plenty fearsome en route to the Finals.\n\n\"Nobody expected the Mavs,\" Mahomes says. \"Nobody wanted the Mavs. But nobody can deny that you've earned it.\"\n\nThe Celtics used Brady to send a very clear message to their past opponents, as well as their current one -- you may think you want Boston, but be careful what you wish for.\n\nThe video shows various fan bases chanting, \"We want Boston,\" before ultimately getting eliminated by the Celtics. It even takes a shot at Knicks fans, who got a little ahead of themselves.\n\n\"Us, we're still here,\" Brady says. \"Right now, you're gonna want anyone but Boston.\"\n\nIt's already been a heavyweight fight between hype video narrators, and it will surely be a heavyweight fight on the court when Boston hosts Dallas for Game 1 tonight.

He is well on his way, even if his Mavericks lose. His five All-NBA first-team selections at the age of 25 are matched only by Tim Duncan and Kevin Durant, two of the 20 greatest players ever.\n\nWin a title, and we will probably call him The Best Player Alive, even better than Nikola Joki\u0107, since the victory would mark one ofthe biggest betting upsets in the history of the Finals. He will have to be incredible for Dallas to win, and we enter the series expecting him to average a 30-point triple-double.\n\nHis historical place in the game will be harder to peg, because he is still so young. The list of those who made the All-NBA first team on an NBA champion as its best player before the age of 26 includes only Duncan, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bill Russell, George Mikan and Joe Fulks.\n\nImagine walking into the legacy conversation on that ground floor. This would be Luka Don\u010di\u0107.\n\nSeriously, when Dirk Nowitzki won his championship for the Mavericks in 2011, cementing himself as the greatest player in franchise history, he was a 32-year-old, four-time All-NBA first-team selection. Don\u010di\u0107 will have stacked a similar r\u00e9sum\u00e9 -- save for Nowitzki's MVP and a career's worth of counting statistics -- a few months after his 25th birthday. Nowitzki is one of the 25 best players the game has ever seen, and Don\u010di\u0107 will have seven more seasons to add more hardware to his trophy room before he turns 32.\n\nI am not saying he will leave the NBA Finals as one of the 10 greatest players ever, but he has a chance -- with his first ring and a Finals MVP -- to come out the other side on pace to match (or surpass) anyone.\n\nJayson Tatum, Celtics\n\nI am not sure anyone would be willing to stamp Tatum as The Best Player Alive, even if he were to nab Finals MVP in a championship victory, but he will be top five -- and maybe closer to one than he is five.\n\nHe will also be a certified No. 1 on a title team, a list not as long as you would think for a 77-year-old league. Even the group of players who won one title as a No. 1 includes Nowitzki, Kevin Garnett, Dwyane Wade, Julius Erving, Bill Walton, Rick Barry, Bob Pettit and Dolph Schayes -- members of the NBA 75. If Tatum takes home a Larry O'Brien trophy, and he is not on the league's next list in 2047, something has gone terribly wrong.\n\nThe question will be how high he could climb. It is tough to crack the NBA's pantheon when you have never won a league MVP, but it is possible. Take Jerry West, for example, widely considered one of the 20 greatest players ever. At age 26, same as Tatum is now, he was a four-time All-NBA first-team selection with nearly 10,000 career points who lost all three of his Finals appearances. If Tatum loses, he would be a three-time All-NBA first-team honoree with more than 10,000 points who failed twice in the Finals.\n\nIf he wins and hoists the Finals MVP, he will have matched West's career achievements in that regard -- with a decade's runway to eclipse them. The pantheon is possible, especially since Tatum's Celtics are poised to contend for the foreseeable future. The road back here is easier in Boston than it is in Dallas, unless these Finals reveal a gap between Tatum and Don\u010di\u0107 that is wider than our current view of them.\n\nThe danger for Tatum is losing and never getting a third shot. The list of two-time Finals losers and zero-time champions includes Karl Malone and Clyde Drexler -- still great but in an entirely different context. Their legacies are marked more by that losing than they are by their Hall of Fame careers, even if they lost to Michael Jordan. This is why Tatum has more riding on these Finals than anyone. Win, and you stay apace with all-timers -- with one up on Don\u010di\u0107; lose, and you risk being a meme in Don\u010di\u0107's documentary.\n\nWho is the best of the second-best players on an NBA team? Prior to the season, Anthony Davis, Devin Booker, Damian Lillard, Paul George, Bam Adebayo and Jamal Murray all would have been considered. Whoever wins this series -- Brown or Irving -- will have a better claim than any of those other names.\n\nA quick glance at the best wingmen in NBA history turns up Scottie Pippen, Kevin McHale, James Worthy and Klay Thompson, among others. I am not sure either Brown or Irving cracks that list, even if they win, simply because those other guys won three or more titles. Participating in a dynasty is its own legacy act.\n\nBut Irving could become the rarest of Robins, sidekicking both LeBron James and Don\u010di\u0107 to titles. It is hard to think of someone who has been so clearly the second-best player within two entirely different championship cores. Bob Dandridge, Jamaal Wilkes, Dennis Johnson and Dennis Rodman came closest.\n\nWhat do all of those players have in common? They are Hall of Famers. Pencil Irving in. He is an eight-time All-Star with a ring. Nobody who can make those claims has been left out. Only 25 players in NBA history have made eight All-Star appearances and won multiple titles. Irving has a chance to join them. James, Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant are the only other active players to do it. And the only others to accomplish that this century: Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh, Duncan, Bryant, Ray Allen and Shaquille O'Neal.\n\nIs Brown a Hall of Famer if he wins? Not yet. He has earned three All-Star nods. With a ring, though, his career to this point would most closely resemble that of Joe Dumars. He won another title, and if Brown gets there, then we can start the debate about where he belongs among the best wingmen historically.\n\nAm I crazy to think that both Horford and Holiday are Hall of Famers if the Celtics win the title?\n\nFive All-Star appearances and a championship would give Horford a legacy that has never been left out of the Hall of Fame. It took awhile, but Chauncey Billups earned his induction this season. He was the last holdout. Horford is essentially the guard version of Kyle Lowry, and I think Lowry gets into the Hall of Fame. Kevin Love will be an interesting test case if his eligibility comes due before Horford gets in line.\n\nHorford may also get his No. 42 retired in Boston if he gets his ring. That is generally a prerequisite to joining the 24 other numbers in the TD Garden rafters. Horford has appeared in more than 100 playoff games for Boston, including five conference finals, and this will mark his second Finals appearance. What a story it would be for Horford to shepherd Tatum and Brown from their rookie seasons, and for them to help the 38-year-old hoist his legacy two more levels -- as a Hall of Famer and an all-time Celtics great.\n\nHoliday will not have his number retired for helping the Celtics win in his first season in Boston, but he will have been an integral member of two different championship franchises in a span of four seasons.\n\nHe is only a two-time All-Star -- his appearances coming 10 years apart -- but he is indisputably one of this generation's best defenders. Of the 16 players who have made six All-Defensive teams, as Holiday has, and won two championships, as Holiday could, 15 of them are in the Hall of Fame. Michael Cooper and Bruce Bowen are the only ones to never make an All-Star team. Cooper got in this year; Bowen is out.\n\nThe NBA began tracking deadline trades in 1987. Since then, six players have been traded in the same year they averaged 20 minutes for a title team, per The Ringer's Zach Kram: P.J. Tucker, Milwaukee Bucks (2021); Marc Gasol, Toronto Raptors (2019); Nazr Mohammed, San Antonio Spurs (2005); Rasheed Wallace, Detroit Pistons (2004); Clyde Drexler, Houston Rockets (1995); and Mark Aguirre, Pistons (1989).\n\nGafford and Washington would make Nos. 7 and 8. Might a title make Dallas' February moves the greatest trade deadline in history? Nobody has ever scored two starters at the midway point and turned them into champions in a matter of months. Take a bow, Nico Harrison, Executive of the Midseason.\n\nStevens coached Butler University to back-to-back NCAA championship games, losing both, before becoming coach of the Celtics at the age of 36 in 2014. He led Boston to conference finals appearances in 2017, 2018 and 2020, failing to reach the Finals each time. Since stepping down and moving into the front office, replacing Danny Ainge in 2021, Stevens has stewarded two NBA Finalists in three seasons.\n\nHe could become the first coach-turned-executive to win a championship since Pat Riley.\n\nStevens' 2022 Finals team was mostly built by Ainge, save for the reacquisition of Horford and a midseason trade for Derrick White. This year's team, though, has Stevens' stamp all over it. Tatum and Brown are still holdovers, but trading Marcus Smart for Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is and adding Holiday remade the foundation of this team in a way that elevated Boston from perennial contender to 64-win juggernaut.\n\nStevens also hired a 34-year-old Mazzulla to replace the exiled Ime Udoka. Stevens stuck with Mazzulla last season, when a loss to the eighth-seeded Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference finals put him on the hot seat. Now, Mazzulla can become the youngest head coach to win a title since Bill Russell in 1969.\n\nDereck Lively II, Dallas Mavericks\n\nThe list of rookies to average 20 minutes per game during the playoffs for a championship team is 13 players long: Manu Gin\u00f3bili, Sam Cassell, Marc Iavaroni, Magic Johnson, Johnny Davis, Jamaal Wilkes, John Havlicek, Satch Sanders, Bill Russell, Tommy Heinsohn, Tom Gola, Red Kerr and Clyde Lovellette.\n\nLively could become the first rookie to accomplish that feat since Gin\u00f3bili in 2003. He would also be the youngest to ever do it, eclipsing Johnson -- the 1980 Finals MVP at age 20 -- by roughly five months.\n\nFathers and sons\n\nTim Hardaway Sr. played 13 NBA seasons, making five All-NBA teams and five All-Star appearances, but he never won a ring, coming closest with the Miami Heat in the 1997 Eastern Conference finals. Tim Hardaway Jr. is a reserve for the Mavericks who could help deliver the championship that his father never won.\n\nCeltics bigs Horford and Luke Kornet also have fathers who played in the NBA as teammates on the 1989-90 Milwaukee Bucks. Neither of their elders sniffed a title. Bragging rights for sons are on the line.\n\nDerrick Jones Jr., Dallas Mavericks\n\nJones was on the fringes of the Chicago Bulls' rotation last season. He was available this past summer to any team as a free agent from July 1 to Aug. 18. He signed with the Mavericks -- over the Celtics -- for the veteran minimum, filling their 15th and final roster spot. And he has started every playoff game in Dallas.\n\nHis is one of the more remarkable career turnarounds in recent memory. Two years ago, Gary Payton II also went from a fringe NBA player to a vital piece of a title in the span of a season. He immediately turned his success with the Golden State Warriors into a three-year, $26 million contract. Jones is set to be a free agent at season's end. He has already earned himself a raise. Might it be bigger with a ring?\n\nJason Kidd, Dallas Mavericks (coach)\n\nFourteen people have won NBA titles as both players and head coaches: Rick Carlisle, Larry Costello, Billy Cunningham, Tommy Heinsohn, Red Holzman, Phil Jackson, Buddy Jeannette, K.C. Jones, Steve Kerr, Tyronn Lue, Pat Riley, Bill Russell, George Senesky and Bill Sharman. Kidd would be the seventh Hall of Fame player to win on the court and bench, joining Cunningham, Heinsohn, Jeannette, Jones, Russell and Sharman. Not bad for someone who was also on the hot seat last season in his third head coaching job.\n\nKristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is, Boston Celtics\n\nThis might not be a Willis Reed moment, but I am not sure we have talked enough about Porzi\u0146\u0123is' return from a soleus strain. He is expected to start Game 1 for the Celtics after a 37-day layoff. He last played on April 29, when he came up lame with a non-contact injury to his right calf. He sounded cagey on Tuesday in response to questions about his health. Is he 100%? \"We'll see.\" Is he pain free? (Long pause) \"Yes?\"\n\nIt is kind of wild to think that the Celtics stormed through the Eastern Conference playoffs in 14 games without arguably their third-best player, albeit against teams that experienced their own injury issues. Boston has another gear, and Porzi\u0146\u0123is could be it. His could be one of the great comeback stories in history, as wild as that sounds. I am hard-pressed to think of others that led to a championship, outside of Willis, whose 27 minutes in Game 7 of the 1970 NBA Finals have taken on mythological proportions.", "source": {"uri":

Jayson Tatum has the opportunity to reverse all narratives surrounding his career with a championship win. Kyrie Irving can solidify himself as one of the greatest \"Robins\" in NBA history with a second title win. GIVEMESPORT VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\nThe 2024 NBA Finals between the Boston Celtics and Dallas Mavericks is sure to be one of the more exciting championship series in recent memory, complete with compelling storylines, great basketball, and several future Hall of Fame players.\n\nAmong the best narratives surrounding this matchup include Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is playing his former team after an unsuccessful tenure in Dallas, Kyrie Irving doing the same against Boston, and Jayson Tatum silencing his doubters with his first ring.\n\nHowever, the most intriguing storyline to follow is the many future legends participating in this series, and what a championship could do for their legacies. By my count, there are eight players and two coaches who would desperately love to win this title because of how much it would change the perception surrounding their career.\n\nHere are the top five players who could benefit most from the 2024 NBA Finals.\n\n1 Luka Don\u010di\u0107 Already an all-time great player, Don\u010di\u0107 could elevate his legacy a win\n\nFor basketball fans, these playoffs have been a reintroduction to the showstopping greatness of Luka Don\u010di\u0107 after spending a year outside the NBA spotlight because of missing the postseason entirely in 2023. For a player as special as Don\u010di\u0107, it was stunning to see his team fail to that degree, but he returned with a vengeance.\n\nWatching Don\u010di\u0107 dominate the playoff stage for the fourth straight time and average nearly a 30-point triple-double to take down three 51-plus win teams to lift Dallas into the NBA Finals has reminded everyone that he is already an all-time legendary player. Don\u010di\u0107 has checked three of the major boxes that the game's greatest players must: otherworldly statistical dominance, production in big games, and poise under pressure in the clutch.\n\nLuka Don\u010di\u0107's Legendary Production\n\nCareer PPG\n\nCareer APG\n\nPlayoff PPG\n\nPlayoff APG\n\n40-point Playoff Games\n\n28.7 (3rd All-Time)\n\n8.3 (13th All-Time)\n\n31.1 (2nd All-Time)\n\n8.8 (4th All-Time)\n\n8 (12th All-Time)\n\nThe last feat he must accomplish is to capture his first championship at the young age of 25. His potential is limitless, as he should have many, many more chances to win titles, but securing this one against a dominant Celtics squad will boost him into a new category that few active players have reached.\n\nIf Don\u010di\u0107 wants to go down as one of the five to ten greatest players to ever lace them up, he would do well to win this series. These opportunities don't always come around again, regardless of how special a player is.\n\n2 Jayson Tatum With a title under his belt, Tatum reverses all the narratives\n\nTatum has been one of the most criticized players in the league since he entered the NBA in 2017, despite being an excellent player from the very first time he stepped on the floor. He is the league's most durable superstar, has never missed a playoff game, has won more postseason games than anyone, and has handled his business the right way every step of the way.\n\nIt is unclear why Tatum has been so heavily scrutinized, especially with his dependability through his age-26 season. It likely has to do with a few factors: his inability to get the Celtics over the hump despite so many deep playoff runs, general disdain towards Boston sports teams, or the frustrating inconsistencies in his game at times.\n\nWith all that said, if Tatum delivers a championship to Boston by beating the Mavericks, he can completely flip the sentiment regarding his career. Not only that, but he suddenly becomes one of the greatest active players at just 26 years old, with a resume that only legends have reached through seven seasons.\n\nJayson Tatum's Impressive Resume\n\nJayson Tatum\n\nPlayoff GP\n\nPlayoff Wins\n\nPlayoff Series Wins\n\nPlayoff PPG\n\nStat\n\n108\n\n64\n\n13\n\n24.1\n\nNBA Rank (Since 2017-18)\n\n1st\n\n1st\n\n1st\n\n16th\n\nFurthermore, if Tatum can battle Don\u010di\u0107 to a draw or even outplay him on the way to a Boston victory, he also will start conversations about his place as a top-three player in the league. For a player as often-maligned as Tatum has been recently, he would benefit greatly from winning the 2024 championship.\n\n3 Kyrie Irving With his second title, Irving cements himself as one of the greatest \"Robins\"\n\nIrving is best-known for his one-of-a-kind skill, an artistry of basketball that no one else has ever, or will ever come close to replicating. His combination of handles, finishing at the rim, and creative shotmaking will inspire players for generations to come, and Irving's place in basketball history is cemented regardless of how his career finishes.\n\nHowever, an underrated piece of these Finals is Irving's return to contributing to winning basketball at the highest level after a seven-year hiatus filled with injuries, off-court drama, and disappointing playoff exits. Watching Irving's magnificence on display as he helps a future legend in Don\u010di\u0107 reach the pinnacle is reminiscent of his days as a Cleveland Cavalier competing for titles with LeBron James.\n\nThe Perfect Wingman\n\nYears\n\nPPG\n\nAPG\n\nTS%\n\nResult\n\n2015-2017\n\n22.4\n\n5.3\n\n57.1%\n\nWon 2016 Finals, Lost 2015/2017 Finals\n\n2023-24\n\n25.6\n\n5.2\n\n60.8%\n\n?\n\n*List gives statistics from Kyrie's years next to James and Don\u010di\u0107\n\nThis playoff run serves as a reminder of Kyrie's excellence as a number two option next to a superior player, which isn't a role every star can thrive in. Irving's transcendent offensive skill as an on-ball scoring threat is well-utilized, not only to give Don\u010di\u0107 or James a rest, but also as an off-ball player, where he sneakily excels.\n\nIrving is one of the best spot-up shooters and closeout attackers in basketball, and he is uniquely willing to defer to a better player despite his incredible talent. His selflessness has been lauded throughout this playoff run, but winning this championship puts him into a different tier of Robins in NBA history and completes one of the coolest turnarounds for a player that the NBA has seen.\n\n4 Jaylen Brown After facing heavy scrutiny in 2023, the ECF MVP has improved his game significantly\n\nWhen the Miami Heat shockingly upset the Celtics in the 2023 Eastern Conference Finals, Jaylen Brown received much of the blame for the loss after he had a terrible series. Jokes were made constantly about his weak left-hand, and he wasn't able to contribute as a second option nearly well enough for Boston to beat an inferior team.\n\nAfter Brown signed a $304M supermax extension in the off-season, analysts questioned Boston's ability to win a championship with a player like Brown making $60M a year. He seemingly took these insults to heart, and came back a completely different player in 2024. His left hand even became an area of strength in his scoring game.\n\nBrown has improved in nearly every facet of the game this season and has carried it into the playoff run. He's realized his defensive potential, is driving to the rim with more ferocity than ever before, and is protecting the ball with better decision-making than he has in the past.\n\nJaylen Brown's Playoff Turnaround\n\nYear\n\nPPG\n\nTS%\n\nTOV\n\nRPG\n\n2023\n\n22.7\n\n57.0%\n\n3.3\n\n5.6\n\n2024\n\n25.0\n\n61.0%\n\n2.6\n\n6.1\n\nAll of these improvements allowed Brown to be arguably the best Celtic in their run through the East, culminating in an Eastern Conference Finals MVP award. If he can play well as a top scoring option for Boston and helps them secure their first championship together, suddenly people will wonder whether Brown is a top ten to fifteen player in the league. It also will make him a lock for the Hall of Fame.\n\n5 Jrue Holiday Holiday can lock in his Hall of Fame spot as one of the best role players ever\n\nJrue Holiday may already be a Hall of Famer because of his 2021 championship with the Milwaukee Bucks on top of an underrated 15-year career that still has juice left. Helping the Celtics win the 2024 Finals will make him a guarantee to join basketball royalty when he calls it a career.\n\nFurthermore, Holiday can once again prove he is one of the best plug-and-play role players in NBA history by fitting seamlessly into this stacked Boston roster. He has been great in four different places, playing a different role in each situation and having success at each stop. As a Philadelphia 76er, New Orleans Pelican, and Milwaukee Buck, he was asked to handle more of an offensive burden as a primary ball-handler, and he acquitted himself very well.\n\nIn Boston, he has been deployed as an off-ball player that weaponizes his defensive gifts to anchor an elite Celtics defense. Holiday has shown his ability to shut down any star in the league, from shifty, quick ballhandlers to massive big men like Joel Embiid. Jrue has proven that he is arguably the best and most versatile defender in the entire league, even as he ages into his mid-thirties.\n\nAccepting His Role\n\nTeam\n\nSeasons\n\nPPG\n\nTS%\n\nAPG\n\n76ers\n\n4\n\n13.4\n\n50.8%\n\n5.8\n\nPelicans\n\n7\n\n17.6\n\n54.2%\n\n6.8\n\nBucks\n\n3\n\n18.5\n\n59.0%\n\n6.8\n\nCeltics\n\n1\n\n12.5\n\n59.7%\n\n4.8\n\nIf Boston beats Dallas, Holiday's career legacy will get a huge boost.\n\nHonorable Mentions: Al Horford (Likely Hall of Famer with a win), Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is, and Derrick White\n\nRelated

Miami and Denver are the ninth and 19th most populous metropolitan areas.\n\nThis year's series is 6% higher than the previous record of $3,899 seen in 2019, the last NBA Finals before the COVID-19 pandemic. That year, the average price for the series featuring the Toronto Raptors and the Golden State Warriors was $3,899.\n\nLike this year, that series featured several of the NBA's biggest stars, including Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, and Kawhi Leonard.\n\nThe NBA Finals ranks high on sports fans' top sporting events\n\nThe NBA Finals is one of the top events on North American sports fans' bucket lists.\n\nA survey conducted in May by Casino.org, an online guide to casinos and gambling, asked 3,000 sports fans which sporting events they would most like to see in person. The NBA Finals ranked third, behind the NFL's Super Bowl and Major League Baseball's World Series.\n\nIf you do want to go to a game in this year's NBA Finals, it is better to go earlier. As the best-of-seven series progresses, tickets for this year's series quickly get more expensive.\n\nThe average ticket price for Game 1 in Boston is $2,875, and the cheapest ticket is $900. The average price for a potential Game 7 in Boston is $5,503, and the minimum price just to get into the arena is $1,987.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider Nederland"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cork_gaines@businessinsider.nl", "name": "Cork Gaines", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TicketIQ", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TicketIQ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draymond_Green", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draymond Green"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawhi_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kawhi Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Raptors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Raptors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Tickets", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Tickets", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Tickets_For_Shows", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Tickets For Shows", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/6660b1251cd3b17790438de4?format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

Boston's Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are the Celtics' most tenured and scrutinized stars and see it as a chance at redemption after falling short in the Finals just two seasons ago and then failing to return last year. Dallas' Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving see it as their first opportunity to make good on a partnership that began late last season after Irving was traded from Brooklyn following a tumultuous run of two-plus seasons with the Nets.\n\nThe NBA Finals were too late for Dallas' Luka Doncic to watch as a kid. Now, he's in them\n\nBOSTON (AP) -- Luka Doncic didn't stay up all night to watch NBA Finals games as a kid. They usually started at something like 3 a.m. in his native Slovenia. He had school to get to a few hours later. He'd wake up and find out who won. Make no mistake, though: Doncic was paying attention. The 25-year-old makes his NBA Finals debut for the Dallas Mavericks when they take on the Boston Celtics in Game 1 of this year's title series on Thursday night. He could become the first player to win a scoring title and a championship in the same season since Shaquille O'Neal in 2000.\n\nPro athletes understand gambling on their games is a non-negotiable no-no. Some learned the hard way\n\nBOSTON (AP) -- Professional athletes get told at the start of every season that if they gamble on their games, the consequences are severe. This spring they've gotten a more personal reminder, with both the NBA and Major League Baseball banning players for life. Padres infielder Tucupita Marcano was permanently banned this week for betting on games he was involved in. The NBA banished Raptors forward Jontay Porter in April. Other players say they should have known better. Marcano was the first active baseball player in a century banned for life for gambling. MLB said he placed hundreds of bets totaling more than $150,000 on baseball in 2022 and 2023.\n\nJennings' HR helps Oklahoma beat Texas 8-3 and move a win away from 4th straight Women's CWS title\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Tiare Jennings' two-run homer in the first inning sparked Oklahoma to an 8-3 win over Texas that left the Sooners one win from a record fourth straight national title. Jennings had two hits and three RBIs and Kinzie Hansen had two hits, including a two-run homer, for the Sooners in Game 1 of the best-of-three Women's College World Series championship series. Oklahoma had nine hits and three home runs against a Texas squad that threw three one-hit shutouts in three World Series games. The Sooners could clinch on Thursday night. Mia Scott hit a solo homer for Texas.\n\nSkenes, Chapman throw gas at Ohtani and the Dodgers as the Pirates hold on for 10-6 victory\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) -- Paul Skenes struck out eight over five innings, Aroldis Chapman threw the fastest pitch in the majors this season and the Pittsburgh Pirates beat Shohei Ohtani and the Los Angeles Dodgers 10-6. Skenes, a rookie, improved to 3-0 despite giving up Ohtani's 15th home run of the season. Skenes and Chapman combined to throw 28 pitches that reached triple digits. A seventh-inning heater from Chapman to Los Angeles' Teoscar Hernandez reached 104 mph, the fastest pitch in the majors this year. Nick Gonzales tied a career-high with four RBI for Pittsburgh.\n\nCam Sutton is getting a second chance with the Steelers following domestic violence incident\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) -- Cameron Sutton is getting a second chance in the NFL with the Pittsburgh Steelers. The Steelers have signed the veteran defensive back to a one-year deal. The agreement comes more than two months after he was released by the Detroit Lions for his involvement in an alleged domestic violence incident in Florida. Sutton eventually surrendered to authorities and entered a pretrial diversion program after the charges were reduced from a felony to misdemeanor battery.\n\nWNBA rescinds second technical foul that was assessed to Angel Reese\n\nThe WNBA announced that it's rescinded the second technical foul on Chicago rookie Angel Reese that occurred with 2:31 left in the loss to the New York Liberty on Tuesday night. Reese was thrown out of the game after receiving two technical fouls following a brief interaction with official Charles Watson. The rookie forward appeared to say something to Watson and then quickly waved her hand. Head official Maj Forsberg said in a pool report that Reese's technical fouls were for \"disrespectfully addressing\" the official and then for \"waving her hand in dismissal.\" Reese finished with 13 points and 10 rebounds.\n\nSchauffele now a major champion at Memorial and facing a big stretch of golf\n\nDUBLIN, Ohio (AP) -- Xander Schauffele was able to take a few weeks off after claiming his first major at the PGA Championship. He came to realize he's still the same person and his life hasn't changed. Now he returns to the Memorial to face a tough stretch of golf. The Memorial is a signature event with a top field and big purse. Then it's off to the U.S. Open at Pinehurst No. 2 and then another signature event at the Travelers Championship. Tournament host Jack Nicklaus isn't thrilled with a new date for the Memorial that pushes it right up against a major.\n\nNBA Finals Notebook: Porzingis a go, Kyrie and LeBron make nice, Hardaway Jr. throws shade at dad\n\nBOSTON (AP) -- Celtics 7-footer Kristaps Porzingis said he will be ready to \"just go out there and hoop\" for Game 1 of the NBA Finals on Thursday night after missing Boston's last 10 games with a strained left calf. Porzingis said he couldn't predict how it will be once he gets into a game for the first time since April 29. An offseason acquisition that helped solidify the Celtics frontcourt, Porzingis averaged 20 points, 7.2 rebounds and almost two blocks per game. But he was again dogged by injuries that limited him to 57 games. He left Game 4 of the first-round series against the Miami Heat and missed all of the next two rounds.\n\nCole to make at least 2 more minor league starts, on track for possible Yankees' return in June\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Gerrit Cole is likely to make at least two more minor league rehabilitation starts, putting the AL Young Award winner on track for a possible return to the New York Yankees' rotation in mid-to-late June. Cole said he felt fine a day after his first rehab outing, a 45-pitch effort over 3 1/3 scoreless innings for Double-A Somerset on Tuesday night. Manager Aaron Boone says \"at least a couple more\" and adds: \"I don't know how many. Is that two? Is it three?\" Cole and Boone weren't ready to commit to Cole's next outing.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri":

One player, most likely from the winning team, will be named the NBA Finals MVP, but who has won the most prestigious award in the past?\n\nWinning the NBA Finals MVP is simply gravy for anyone's career. After all, doing so has usually meant that one's team has emerged victorious, achieving the pinnacle of team success. And for members of the Dallas Mavericks and Boston Celtics organizations, it's hard to envision anyone caring too much about who lifts the Finals MVP trophy in the end, as long as one of theirs gets to do so.\n\nJayson Tatum and Luka Doncic, to no one's surprise, are the two frontrunners to take home the coveted accolade this year. Nikola Jokic had an incredibly dominant playoff run last year and won the award.\n\nIn the end, whoever gets to hoist the Bill Russell NBA Finals MVP award this year will join an exclusive list of legends who have reserved their best performances for when the lights are at their brightest.\n\nListed below are all the winners of the coveted Finals MVP award, spanning all the way from Jokic's breakthrough in 2023 to Jerry West's heartbreak in 1969.\n\n2023: Nikola Jokic, Denver Nuggets\n\nNikola Jokic had a historic run in the 2023 playoffs en route to brining the Nuggets their first championship. He was awarded the Bill Russell NBA Finals MVP award after averaging 30.2 points, 14 rebounds, and 7.2 assists per game. As a part of the performance, Jokic became the first player to ever lead the postseason in total points, rebounds, and assists. He truly did it all for Denver and was more than worthy of brining home the most prestigious award in basketball.\n\n2022: Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors\n\nStephen Curry's detractors held the fact that he hadn't won an NBA Finals MVP yet against him. But in 2022, Curry finally squashed that noise. He had an amazing series, and it was in Game 4 when he put up arguably the greatest performance of his career when he snatched the Boston Celtics' hearts.\n\n2021: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks\n\nA game-saving block in Game 4 against Deandre Ayton. A game-sealing dunk in Game 5 off the biggest steal of Jrue Holiday's career. And then a 50-point performance in Game 6 to complete the Bucks' comeback from 2-0 down. Giannis Antetokounmpo had one of the most memorable three-game stretches in NBA Finals history, forever cementing his legacy as one of the best to ever touch a basketball.\n\n2020: LeBron James, Los Angeles Lakers\n\nFans may call winning it all in 2020 a Mickey Mouse ring for the Lakers, but make no mistake about it: LeBron James' mental fortitude and resiliency amidst tough global circumstances makes winning a championship in 2020 one of the most difficult feats he's pulled off in his career.\n\n2019: Kawhi Leonard, Toronto Raptors\n\nKawhi Leonard, when healthy, is one of the greatest playoff performers in NBA history. And in 2019, he stayed healthy for an entire playoff run, helping the Raptors get over the hump that's been in front of them for the past five years.\n\n2018: Kevin Durant, Golden State Warriors\n\nKevin Durant was the game-changing presence that made the Warriors such an unstoppable force, and his second Finals MVP is a testament to that.\n\n2017: Kevin Durant, Golden State Warriors\n\nFit concerns, what fit concerns? Kevin Durant fit in like a glove in his first season with the Warriors, helping them cruise to a 16-1 postseason to avenge their loss against the Cleveland Cavaliers during the 2016 NBA Finals.\n\n2016: LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers\n\nLeBron James led the Cavs to the greatest 3-1 comeback in NBA history. Enough said.\n\n2015: Andre Iguodala, Golden State Warriors\n\nPutting Andre Iguodala in the starting lineup proved to be a game-changing decision for the Warriors, but in the end, Stephen Curry's sustained excellence makes him the more deserving 2015 NBA Finals MVP winner, narrative be damned.\n\n2014: Kawhi Leonard, San Antonio Spurs\n\nThe beginning of Kawhi Leonard's ascent into superstardom, it's rare for anyone in the NBA to instill some sense of dread in LeBron James' eyes. But Leonard did.\n\nPlagued by ringless jokes since the mid-2000s, LeBron James finally broke through in 2012. He may not have led the Heat to eight championships like he insinuated he would, but winning two ain't that bad.\n\n2011: Dirk Nowitzki, Dallas Mavericks\n\nThe culmination of one of the greatest playoff runs of all time, Dirk Nowitzki finally shed the choker label for good after leading the Mavs to a championship win over the heavily-favored Heat.\n\nWinning two NBA Finals MVPs as the Lakers' undisputed best player put Kobe Bryant in even more rarefied air, proving that he wasn't just carried to a ring by his old frenemy Shaq.\n\n2008: Paul Pierce, Boston Celtics\n\nWinning the 2008 Finals MVP is a culmination of all of Paul Pierce's patience as he stayed with the Celtics amid their rebuild in the early 2000s.\n\n2007: Tony Parker, San Antonio Spurs\n\nIt was time for a new NBA Finals MVP for the Spurs, I suppose, as voters decided to award Tony Parker instead of Tim Duncan, who was his usual excellent two-way self.\n\n2006: Dwyane Wade, Miami Heat\n\nDwyane Wade can only laugh at those who call him a free-throw merchant after he led the Heat to a spirited comeback over the Mavs from 2-0 down.\n\nThe best player of perhaps the most unlikely championship team of all time, Chauncey Billups cemented his legacy as Mr. Big Shot with his vast array of clutch displays in 2004.\n\nOnly Michael Jordan won three straight Finals MVPs other than Shaquille O'Neal. Of course, it's a testament to their teams' brilliance, but their teams certainly would not have been as brilliant as they were if it weren't for their services.\n\n1999: Tim Duncan, San Antonio Spurs\n\nThe Spurs lucked into Tim Duncan by being terrible during the season in which he was the prize of the NBA Draft. Less than two years after drafting Duncan, the Spurs already reaped the benefits of their opportunistic tanking.\n\nSome may argue that the league's vast expansion had diluted the talent pool of the league so much, making it easy for Michael Jordan to win another three-peat after he had already retired back in 1993. Still: winning a championship, much less three, is insanely difficult, and yet Jordan made it look easy.\n\nSure, Michael Jordan wasn't in the league. But Hakeem Olajuwon could not care less, as he finally broke through after a decade in the NBA.\n\nMichael Jordan was already blossoming into one of the greatest players in NBA history in the late 1980s. But he kept on running into the Bad Boys Pistons. But in 1991, Jordan finally got over the hump, and once he did, there was no stopping arguably the greatest to ever play the game.\n\nIf Michael Jordan has the Pistons to thank for facilitating his growth into the monster he became in the 1990s, the Pistons will have the Lakers and Celtics to thank -- culminating in two Finals MVPs that celebrate the greatness of the Bad Boys Pistons' backcourt.\n\nThe first and only time that a player from the losing team has won Finals MVP, Jerry West put up quite the fight during the Lakers' seven-game series defeat against the Boston Celtics. He averaged 37.9 points and 7.4 assists, which is simply incredible given the quality of the opposition.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"},

The Celtics were 6.5-point favorites in Game 1.\n\nThe Mavericks began the season at 25-1 to win the title and saw their odds drift to as long as 50-1 at some sportsbooks in January. Dallas was an underdog in 42 games during the regular season, the most of any team to reach the Finals in the last 24 years, according to ESPN Stats and Information. The Mavericks upgraded their roster at the trade deadline and have put together an impressive playoff run.\n\nThe Celtics, on the other hand, have been the consensus betting favorites to win the title all season.

They were favored by at least seven points in each of their games during the Eastern Conference playoffs.\n\nESPN BET reported Thursday that 89% of the bets on the series were on Dallas.

He's a great bet with this number set at just 6.5 for Thursday.\n\nBrown, the Eastern Conference Finals MVP, has played some of his best postseason basketball this season, averaging 25.0 points per game while shooting 54.3 percent from the field and 36.8 percent from 3-point range.\n\nBrown has been much more efficient than Jayson Tatum, and he finds himself with a points prop that is four points lower than his co-star in Game 1.\n\nI love the OVER here for Brown, who has cleared 22.5 points in nine of his 14 playoff games, including all four of his matchups in the Eastern Conference Finals against the Indiana Pacers.\n\nWhile the return of Porzingis could eat into Brown's usage, I don't expect KP to return to his normal role in his first game back from a calf injury. He has even admitted that he's not sure where exactly his conditioning is.\n\nBrown has cleared 40 minutes in three of his last five games, and he's taken at least 17 shots in 11 of 14 games this postseason. That usage is enough to take him to score 23 or more points on Thursday.\n\nOdds refresh periodically and are subject to change.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Gaming", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Gaming", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4726,h_2658,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si/01hzmtzx67n4jbevdzfk.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

Mandatory Credit: Peter Casey-USA TODAY Sports / Peter Casey-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe NBA Finals Playoff Basketball has finally arrived. It took awhile to get here. The regular season tends to be so long and drawn out. Sometimes, the feeling worldwide is that the NBA should strongly consider shortening the amount of games played throughout the regular season. Doing so would avoid injury and make each game even more meaningful. It also would limit the amount of injuries. That would be beneficial as former Wizard Kristaps Porzingis may not be 100% healthy for the NBA Finals.\n\nWith the NBA regular season being so long and the postseason being so rough and tough on one's body, it is important to have plenty of depth on your team if you want to go all the way and hoist the Larry O'Brien trophy when it's all said and done. There's a saying that says \"May the best team win.\" Within the NBA Finals, the starting lineup could come into play there. Who has the best starting five? Who has the best players on the court within their starting five? Here is my list ranking the best players in this series.\n\nFormer Wizard Kristaps Porzingis ranks fifth in this ranking while former Wizard Daniel Gafford ranks eighth. It will be an interesting matchup as the two former teammates from their days with the Washington Wizards will be matching up in the NBA Finals. All the days of practicing together will now pay off in the NBA Finals as one of them will walk away with a championship. Which one will it be?

On a sidewalk bench in the Lower Greenville neighborhood, at a dive bar near the campus of Southern Methodist University, outside a trendy cocktail joint in the Deep Ellum district that has \"Star Wars\" posters in French plastered on its walls, people are feeling good. Their predictions reflect this: Mavs in seven. Mavs in six.\n\nA few people even predict Dallas will sweep Boston, which led the league with 64 wins during the regular season.\n\n\"I'm really confident,\" said Reggie Douglas, a 35-year-old Mavericks fan who works in logistics. Asked what he thinks of Boston, Douglas offered up Tom Brady and a vague sense of out-of-control and nasty fans.\n\n\"I've heard some bad things, although I haven't been there myself,\" he said. \"Just ruthless fans.\"\n\nHe was adamant this Mavericks team is \"battle-tested,\" a recurrent rhetorical point in watering holes throughout Dallas. To reach the Finals, the Mavericks had to dispatch the Los Angeles Clippers, a team some fans here say has troubled Dallas in the past; the West's top seed, the Oklahoma City Thunder; and the Minnesota Timberwolves, who were themselves fresh off eliminating the defending champs, the Denver Nuggets, with reigning MVP Nikola Jokic.\n\nThe Celtics, they argue, had a much easier path to the Finals, defeating the Miami Heat, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Indiana Pacers, all of whom were depleted by injuries to key players.\n\n\"They had the Finals almost given to them,\" said Seth Russell, a 36-year-old security guard, barback, and bouncer. \"They went through a field of puppies and flowers, and the Mavs went through the gauntlet of hell.\"\n\nBut he was quick to point out a common ground between Texas and Massachusetts: an unabashed parochialism.\n\n\"When I went to Europe, they were like 'Oh you're American' and I'm like 'No, I'm from Texas,' \" Russell said as he nursed a watermelon cider at City Tavern, a sports bar on Elm Street downtown.\n\nThe bar's owner, Adam Lewis, offered a unique perspective on the impending matchup.\n\nLewis's family has had Mavericks' season tickets since 1988, but his favorite player of all time is Celtics legend Larry Bird. To him, Boston isn't \"Whitey\" Bulger or the Wahlbergs, but the smell of the old Boston Garden. He attended a game there when he was a kid, he said, and the place smelled \"like a locker room that hadn't been cleaned in four years.\" That's the thing he remembers most.\n\nThe walls of the bar reflect his allegiances. There is a game-worn jersey signed by retired Mavs star Dirk Nowitzki. A signed Doncic jersey. But in another room, there is a photo of Bird and his chief rival during his playing days, Lakers great Magic Johnson. And a framed Bird jersey, a gift from Lewis's father in the 1990s. Lewis plans to fly to Boston for Game 2 with his brother and some friends.\n\n\"It's going to be a real hard fight,\" he said.\n\nOverall, Mavericks fans were amiable, happy to chat with a Bostonian about the impending series. Any trash talk came with a smile and a laugh. The mood was playful, not barbed. Sports-wise, it's not Philadelphia or New York. The rivalry between New England and North Texas is basically nonexistent.\n\nSeveral people on barstools downtown were keen to mention how much they love \"The Town,\" the 2010 Charlestown heist flick directed by and starring son of Cambridge Ben Affleck.\n\nMuch more strangely, three different people, in three different locations throughout Dallas, want to discuss \"Celtic Pride,\" a comedy flop from the 1990s about a pair of hare-brained Celtics fans that boasts a dismal 12 percent approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. That's where their stream-of-consciousness goes when someone mentions \"Boston.\" So much for John Winthrop's \"City upon a Hill.\"\n\nThere is other weirdness. There are not one but two establishments in Dallas that share a name with the assassin of Massachusetts' favorite prince, John F. Kennedy, who was slain here in 1963. Elsewhere, there is a combo Dunkin'-Buffalo Wild Wings, which locals seem to think is either an abomination or a stroke of genius. One resident wants to know: would that be sacrilege in Boston? Some things are unknowable, they are told.\n\nAnd while the city is buoyant over the Mavs' playoff run, fans say the NFL's Dallas Cowboys will forever be the number one team in town. It is, after all, Texas, where football is king, and this is the home of \"America's Team.\"\n\nStill, ahead of the NBA finals there is a palpable energy throughout Dallas. Some locals revel in the Mavericks-Celtics subplots. They point out that Kyrie Irving, a talented but mercurial guard, used to play for the Celtics and is now considered a heel by many Boston fans. Some advise Celtics fans not to boo him because that will only motivate him and a motivated Irving, they said, is difficult to stop.\n\nIrving is not alone in facing his old team. Many local fans point out that Kristaps Porzingis, Boston's big man, played for the Mavericks from 2019 to 2022, with some describing his time in Dallas as frustrating. Daniel Al-Qassem, a 36-year-old general manager of a local bar, said he met Porzingis during his time in Dallas and described him as \"a super sweet guy.\" Al-Qassem holds no animosity toward him.\n\n\"It just didn't work out,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking near a couple of pool tables at the bar Milo Butterfingers, Al-Qassem warned that Dereck Lively II, a rookie big man for the Mavs, could play a significant role in the series.\n\n\"The Celtics are a really evenly matched team with us,\" he said.\n\nAs a Radiohead song drifted through the bar, he concluded the interview with a bit of diplomacy. \"May the best team win.\"\n\nRyan Opelt, meanwhile, is a bit of an outlier. Despite living in North Texas since 1997, the 33-year-old supports Boston teams. That's because his father, Tim, pitched for the Pawtucket Red Sox back in the day, he said. The key to the series, he said, is simple.\n\n\"Boston can't lose Game 1 or Game 2 at home,\" Opelt said.\n\nElsewhere, Gabe Sanchez, a 37-year-old bar owner, is another sporting nonconformist around here. Born and raised in Los Angeles, he's a Lakers fan who has called Dallas home for the last 16 years. At his bar, Black Swan in Deep Ellum, he relished heckling a man in a Red Sox hat, repeatedly yelling out \"Wade Boggs,\" the allegedly beer-swilling, chicken-eating, Hall-of-Fame Sox third baseman.\n\n\"I'm the only one here who respects the Celtics,\" Sanchez said on a smoke break. \"Because I hate them.\"\n\nAccording to Sanchez, the Celtics should win the series.", "source": {"uri":

Luka Don\u010di\u0107 & Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is debut for Mavericks & Celtics in 2024 Finals. GIVEMESPORT praises iconic first-game NBA Finals performances from stars Allen Iverson, Tim Duncan, Kevin Durant, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Larry Bird. GIVEMESPORT VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\nThe 2024 NBA Finals are nearly underway, with the Dallas Mavericks and Boston Celtics set to face off for the best hardware available in basketball. In the late 2010s, a showdown between the Golden State Warriors and the Cleveland Cavaliers was a foregone conclusion before the season even began.\n\nHowever, the NBA is in a different parity stage, which has led to no team repeating as champion since 2019. Ahead of the 2024 NBA Finals, a few players are set to debut on basketball's biggest stage.\n\nMavericks superstar Luka Don\u010di\u0107 has dominated throughout Dallas' epic postseason run but will be receiving his first taste of NBA Finals basketball. Celtics big man Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is will also make his Finals debut and return to action after being sidelined since Game 4 of Boston's first-round series against the Miami Heat.\n\nMany players reach the NBA Finals and cannot maintain their success under the bright lights. However, a select number immediately dominates in their first experience with the eyes of the world on them. These are GIVEMESPORT's top five individual performances of players in their first NBA Finals game.\n\n1 Allen Iverson - Philadelphia 76ers 2001 NBA Finals against Los Angeles Lakers\n\nArguably the most iconic Game 1 performance in NBA Finals history, Allen Iverson did the unthinkable in 2001. Iverson led the Philadelphia 76ers to the Finals for the first time since 1983, setting up a showdown against the dominant Los Angeles Lakers. The Lakers entered the series with an impressive 12-0 record in the NBA Playoffs and cemented themselves in each series as one of the greatest teams ever assembled.\n\nIn a true tale of David against Goliath, Iverson mustered one of the greatest single-handed performances the basketball world has ever witnessed.\n\nAllen Iverson 2001 NBA Finals Game 1 Stats vs. Los Angeles Lakers\n\nCategory\n\nStats\n\nPTS\n\n48\n\nREB\n\n5\n\nAST\n\n6\n\nSTL\n\n5\n\nNET RATING\n\n+6\n\nThe Sixers went into the belly of the beast at Staples Center and walked out with an emphatic 107-101 victory. The Lakers were unable to figure out an answer for Iverson as he finished with 48 points, ranking as the most points in an NBA Finals debut game all-time and third behind Jerry West (53 points in Game 1 of the 1969 Finals) and LeBron James (51 points in Game 1 of the 2018 Finals) for most points in a Game 1 in Finals history.\n\nIverson was going head-to-head against the most dominant player in the NBA at the time, Shaquille O'Neal. The Big Diesel did exactly what he was known for en route to 44 points and 20 rebounds but was overshadowed by the incredible shot-making of Iverson.\n\nThe possession before the crossover, Iverson converted on a huge three-pointer to give the Sixers a 101-99 lead with just over a minute left in overtime. The legendary crossover and mid-range shot gave the Sixers a five-point lead with under 50 seconds left, which they would hold onto, leading them to a massive Game 1 win.\n\nOf course, the Lakers went on to win the next four games, and the 2001 NBA championship, but Iverson's performance in his first Finals game during his only appearance is etched into NBA history.\n\n2 Tim Duncan - San Antonio Spurs 1999 NBA Finals against New York Knicks\n\nTim Duncan has been the catalyst for many discussions among NBA fans on social media, but the legendary big man is considered a top-three player in his position for good reason. In his sophomore season in the NBA, Duncan led the San Antonio Spurs to their first championship in franchise history.\n\nThere hasn't been a player that has contributed to immediate success in the fashion of Tim Duncan. He finished fifth in the Most Valuable Player award voting and third in his second season. Spearheading the Spurs alongside David Robinson, he led the team to an NBA Finals matchup against the New York Knicks.\n\nThe Knicks were on a historic run, becoming the first eighth-seeded team in NBA history to make it to the NBA Finals. However, Duncan was far too great for any member of the Knicks to come close to containing him.\n\nTim Duncan 1999 NBA Finals Game 1 Stats vs. New York Knicks\n\nCategory\n\nStats\n\nPTS\n\n33\n\nREB\n\n16\n\nBLK\n\n2\n\nFG%\n\n61.9\n\nNET RATING\n\n+12\n\nWithout Patrick Ewing, the Knicks had no other option that could come close to slowing down Duncan. He obliterated New York through his amazing face-up game in the mid-range area. Knicks big man, Chris Dudley, was no match for the superstar forward, who officially started the Spurs' eventual dynasty with this performance and victory.\n\nThe Spurs went on to win by a score of 89-77, as Duncan would score just under half of the entire team's points. Duncan would eventually be named the 1999 NBA Finals MVP as the Spurs closed out the Knicks in five games.\n\n3 Kevin Durant - Oklahoma City Thunder 2012 NBA Finals against Miami Heat\n\nBefore Kevin Durant made the controversial move to join the Golden State Warriors in 2016, resulting in back-to-back championships the following seasons, he was one of the catalysts of one of the most successful young teams in NBA history.\n\nIn just the third season of the Oklahoma City Thunder's young core being together, they clinched a spot in the 2012 NBA Finals against the star-studded Miami Heat. The Thunder's average age was 25 years old and were led by the 23-year-old Durant, who dominated in his first NBA Finals game.\n\nKevin Durant 2012 NBA Finals Game 1 Stats vs. Miami Heat\n\nCategory\n\nStats\n\nPTS\n\n36\n\nREB\n\n8\n\nAST\n\n4\n\nFG%\n\n60.0\n\nNET RATING\n\n+15\n\nThe Thunder were matched against a battle-tested Heat team that was bouncing back from a disastrous first season together, losing to the Dallas Mavericks in the NBA Finals in 2011. LeBron James was the reigning MVP of the league and played some of the best quality basketball at both ends of the court in his entire career. However, Durant was the star of this game.\n\nDurant was the scoring leader of the 2011-12 season and showed exactly why in Game 1. He got to any spot he wanted on the court, and there was nothing that the opposition could do to disrupt his rhythm. He killed the Heat with an array of jump shots and ruthless drives to the rim. Durant was undoubtedly a star in the NBA, but this performance assured his status as a superstar.\n\nThat would end up being the only game that the Thunder would win in that series, as they would lose in five games. Sixth Man of the Year winner, James Harden, would leave the team the following season and Oklahoma City would never reach the Finals again with Durant, solidifying that tenure as one of the biggest what-ifs in NBA history.\n\n4 Kareem Abdul-Jabbar - Milwaukee Bucks 1971 NBA Finals Against Baltimore Bullets\n\nThe NBA's former all-time leading scorer, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, is widely known as one of the greatest players to ever touch a basketball. One of the most highly decorated collegiate athletes, with three national championships with the UCLA Bruins, captured his first NBA championship in 1971 with the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nAbdul-Jabbar created the most unstoppable move in basketball history known as the 'skyhook,' which he utilized in the Bucks' run to the 1971 NBA Finals against the Baltimore Bullets (now known as the Washington Wizards). In his second season in the NBA, Abdul-Jabbar was named MVP and proved why with his performance in Game 1.\n\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar 1971 NBA Finals Game 1 Stats vs. Baltimore Bullets\n\nCategory\n\nStats\n\nMIN\n\n33\n\nPTS\n\n31\n\nREB\n\n17\n\nFG%\n\n81.3\n\nAbdul-Jabbar is widely considered the best center in NBA history and this postseason run was the start of his dominance as the best in the association. Matched up against another Hall of Fame big man in Wes Unseld, Abdul-Jabbar showcased that the discrepancy in skill between his contemporaries and himself is quite large.\n\nMilwaukee convincingly took care of the Bullets, sweeping Baltimore in four games. This would mark the first championship Abdul-Jabbar would win in his career and the only one during his tenure with the Bucks. He would eventually go on to win four more as a member of the Lakers alongside Magic Johnson.\n\n5 Larry Bird - Boston Celtics 1981 NBA Finals against Houston Rockets\n\nA member of the duo responsible for the NBA's escape from collapse during the 1980s, Larry Bird made his way onto the scene and immediately was one of the best players in the history of the league. In the second season of his career, he took the storied franchise of the Boston Celtics to the 1981 NBA Finals and further stamped his name among the greats.\n\nThe Celtics dominated the NBA during the era of Bill Russell and Bob Cousy but found themselves in a dry spell before the addition of Bird. A legend in college basketball with insurmountable hype, Bird led Boston to the 1981 NBA Finals and put forth one of the greatest performances in Finals history in his first taste of action against the Houston Rockets.\n\nLarry Bird 1981 NBA Finals Game 1 Stats vs. Houston Rockets\n\nCategory\n\nStats\n\nPTS\n\n18\n\nREB\n\n21\n\nAST\n\n9\n\nSTL\n\n1\n\nFG%\n\n52.9\n\nLarry Bird nearly finished with a triple-double in his first NBA Finals game, finishing just one assist shy of the incredible milestone. Looking back on his career, Bird is recognized as one of the greatest players of all time. However, this NBA Finals run separated him from his contemporaries and his performance in Game 1 set that tone.\n\nBird had one of the most iconic plays of his career during this game. During the fourth quarter, Bird took a mid-range shot that was off the mark but was able to grab the offensive rebound with his right hand and then lay it up with his left hand, all in one motion. Legendary Celtics head coach Red Auerbach called it the greatest play he'd ever seen.\n\nBoston would pull out the Game 1 victory and carry the momentum to win the series in six games, propelling them to become 1981 NBA champions. Bird would capture his first championship and eventually win two more rings, all in the 80s.\n\nRelated 10 NBA Players Who Would Dominate in Any Era The NBA has changed a lot over its history, and

It was all about beating the Lakers and beating Earvin,\" Bird said. \"That's all that mattered.\"\n\nJohnson's Lakers won it all against Philadelphia in 1982, then fell to Moses Malone, Julius Erving and the 76ers in the Finals a year later.\n\nIn 1984, the NBA's first big stage was set.\n\nJohnson's Lakers vs Bird's Celtics for a shining trophy.\n\nGame 4 saw Bird grab 21 rebounds while the Celtics evened the series at 2-2 with a tough 129-125 road victory at The Forum.\n\nWith the NBA receiving a lift from a growing Lakers vs Celtics rivalry and the Finals down to a best-of-three scenario, a winner-take-all Game 7 became a real possibility.\n\nAnd that's where things got crazy.\n\n\"Stern told a fan that the NBA needed a seven-game series, that the league needed the money,\" Bird said. \"When the commissioner makes a statement like that to a fan, you know it's going to be tough.\"\n\nThe eventual Hall of Famer, 12-time All-Star and three-time NBA MVP doubled down on his theory that Game 6 was rigged to force a TV-friendly Game 7.\n\n\"When Stern makes a statement like that, things are going to happen,\" Bird said. \"You just don't make statements like that and expect anything out of it.

Getty Images\n\nThe Boston Celtics started the NBA's superteam boom in the summer of 2007 when they united Ray Allen and Kevin Garnett with Paul Pierce to create a 66-win champion overnight. In the process, they established a rough blueprint of what we considered to be a superteam moving forward.\n\nAt least one superstar needed to be acquired through external means. In Boston's case, there were two. The depth needed to be comprised mostly of unproven players on rookie contracts (in their case, Rajon Rondo, Kendrick Perkins, Glen Davis, Leon Powe and Tony Allen) and veterans who took pay cuts to join them (James Posey and Eddie House). They were usually able to snag a higher-end veteran or two through the buyout market (Sam Cassell and P.J. Brown), and were off to the races from there.\n\nThe next batch of superteams more or less followed this formula. The Miami Heat paired Dwyane Wade with LeBron James and Chris Bosh and slowly accumulated surrounding veterans in the ensuing years. The Golden State Warriors upped the ante in 2016 by using a once-in-a-lifetime cap spike to get to four stars. Meanwhile, less successful three-star (remember Carmelo Anthony and Paul George joining Russell Westbrook?) and two-star (the ill-fated James Harden-Chris Paul duo, for example) variants became increasingly common.\n\nAs time passed, these superteams became decidedly less super. Think of the teams from the 2023-24 season that fit that model. The Phoenix Suns were swept out of the first round in their first season with Kevin Durant, Bradley Beal and Devin Booker together. The Los Angeles Clippers only stole two games against the eventual Western Conference champion Dallas Mavericks. Granted, you could argue that on some level, both of those teams lost to opponents who check a few \"superteam\" boxes of their own. Both Minnesota (Rudy Gobert) and Dallas (Kyrie Irving) added All-Stars externally to their existing cores.\n\nBut neither of those teams really resembled the 2008 Celtics or their immediate successors. The Mavericks and Timberwolves are far deeper. Their balance sheets are more, well, balanced. Their cores were built methodically over time and added to opportunistically, as opposed to the Celtics, who were slapped together on the fly. The Clippers and Suns tried it the 2008 Celtics way. Look where it got them. The lesson here is that being super means something different in 2024 than it did in 2008.\n\nNo team was more super this season than the Boston Celtics. They weren't just the best team of the 2023-24 regular season. They have thus far been one of the best teams in any season. Their net rating of +11.7 is the third-best of all time, trailing only the Chicago Bulls in 1996 and 1997. Their +10.4 playoff net rating is the eighth best in league history thus far. They are one of only nine teams in the past 40 years to reach the Finals with 20 or fewer total losses. This is certainly a superteam's resume, but of course, if that were the only criteria, this wouldn't be such a modern phenomenon.\n\nThe term, as we've covered, refers more to roster construction than success. By those metrics, it depends how far you want to stretch the terms we've set. Boston only had two 2024 All-Stars. Not a great start. Both of those All-Stars, Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, have spent their entire careers with the Celtics. Again, this isn't usually how we'd define a superteam.\n\nThe Celtics had chances to go all in for a third enormous name. Beal, for instance, is a longtime friend of Tatum's, as both grew up in the St. Louis area. The Celtics were mentioned as a possible destination for Durant in the summer of 2022. Go back far enough and the Celtics were linked to just about every big name on the trade market. When Danny Ainge was building his version of the Celtics, he wanted to pair Anthony Davis with Irving. Paul George and Jimmy Butler were discussed at various points.\n\nBut Brad Stevens has taken a different approach. The consensus explanation for Boston's dominance this season has been its top-end depth. The Celtics don't have three great players. They have six very good ones. Three of them, Jrue Holiday, Kristaps Porzingis and Al Horford, made All-Star Teams playing for someone other than the Celtics. A fourth, Derrick White, was acquired before his prime and may yet get there wearing green and white.\n\nThe Celtics did go the external addition route, they just chose to do it with multiple players rather than a single big swing. Their depth is mostly comprised of younger players on cheap contracts like Sam Hauser and Payton Pritchard. Horford likely could heave earned more had he chosen to reach free agency after the 2022-23 season, but he extended early at a team-friendly rate to ensure he could stick with a winner. The Celtics didn't add a major piece through the buyout market, but the new CBA didn't allow them to. They did nab Xavier Tillman as injury insurance for Porzingis, and sure enough, he played some playoff minutes in the first three rounds with Porzingis sidelined.\n\nThis path might not sound quite as glitzy as the one taken by their 2008 counterparts, but as the Clippers and Suns proved, glamour does not not necessarily equal super. In the new financial world the NBA exists in, \"glamour\" and \"super\" might be fundamentally incompatible.\n\nAny team would love to have three superstars. The problem is paying them. The new CBA that kicked in this season added a number of restrictions that made putting a functional team around three, aging superstars significantly harder. Starting this season, teams above the first luxury tax apron couldn't sign most buyout players. Salary-matching rules in trades became stricter. Second-apron teams lost access to the taxpayer mid-level exception. These rules get even tighter in July. Second-apron teams won't be able to aggregate salary in trades. They have no wiggle room on tradable salary, and will now need to send out at least as much as they bring in.\n\nYou can survive these restrictions for a time if you drafted your own stars. Having high-end producers on rookie deals is a godsend in this environment, but even having them on the lower-end, 25% max as the Celtics do with Tatum and Brown, means quite a bit. Compare that to, say, Phoenix, which added two older stars on the highest possible 35% max while also paying their homegrown star, Booker, his own 35% max because he's a bit older and reached the supermax criteria, and you begin to see why the Celtics could afford to actually surround their best players properly while the Suns relied mostly on minimums.\n\nThe bill will come due on Tatum and Brown eventually. Brown has already signed a supermax extension that hasn't kicked in yet. Tatum became eligible for one by earning All-NBA honors this season. But Boston built while they were reasonably cheap and before the CBA harshly limited their maneuverability. They added players who were expensive, but not prohibitively so, and they timed the moves brilliantly.\n\nThey landed White in the first year of a below-market rookie extension he signed with the Spurs. They got Horford on a bloated contract he signed, ironically, when he left the Celtics in 2019, but didn't go on another shopping spree until after his expensive contract expired and was replaced by the cheaper extension. Boston landed Porzingis for very little asset value -- they gained two first-round picks when trading Marcus Smart for him! -- because he was an impending free agent, and they used that to their advantage. Rather than testing the open market, Boston took advantage of his higher 2022-23 salary ($36 million or so through a player option) to convince him to take a bit less in the next two years, $60 million in total. They pulled a similar trick with Holiday, though he needed four years of security to take a short-term pay cut.\n\nAll told, Boston will pay the quartet of Holiday, Porzingis, White and Horford roughly $88 million next season. That's a lot... but Phoenix is paying Durant and Beal over $101 million combined. Are there scenarios in which you'd rather pay $101 million for two megastars than $88 million for four very good players? Sure. If both of those 35% max players are obvious All-NBA talents that can reliably stay healthy and have diverse and compatible skill sets. That obviously wasn't the case with Durant and Beal. Both dealt with injuries. Beal declined. Their skill sets were too similar (especially with Booker sharing it). If you can unite peak LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh, you should probably do it. Obviously, opportunities to check all of those boxes are going to be rare, especially today.\n\nBut landing sub-superstar-level players on reasonable contracts? That's a more attainable goal, and in this new world, probably a worthier one if you have one or two true max players in place first. That caveat will likely always matter no matter the CBA changes. The 2004 Pistons aside, it's hard to imagine any team ever winning a championship without at least one First-Team All-NBA-caliber player on the roster. But one or two of them might just be better than three when the realities of modern roster-building are accounted for.\n\nBoth finalists are proof of that. The Mavericks are here as much because of P.J. Washington and Daniel Gafford as they are Kyrie Irving. There will always be an attraction to the idea of blindly mashing famous players together and hoping to figure the rest out later. Teams like that have won a lot of championships. But 2024 basketball is built for the 2024 Celtics, not their 2008 counterparts. The NBA is too deep, too injury-prone and too restricting to expect three players alone to win a championship unless those players are a degree of exceptional that almost never comes along. The more realistic future of the superteam will be on display in the Finals.

Mandatory Credit: Trevor Ruszkowski-USA TODAY Sports / Trevor Ruszkowski-USA TODAY Sports\n\nIt's been a long break since the conference finals wrapped up, but the 2024 NBA Finals between the Boston Celtics and Dallas Mavericks is here at last. Game 1 will tip off on Thursday, June 6 at 8:30 p.m. ET.\n\nIt is a heavily anticipated matchup with legacies on the line. Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown will vie for their first ring against Luka Doncic doing the same, and Kyrie Irving, on the hunt for his second championship many years and teams after the first. There is some \"unstoppable force meets immovable object\" energy here, too. The Mavs have been on a heater since transforming their roster at the trade deadline and took down two of the NBA's very best teams en route to the Finals. The Celtics have been amazing all season long, putting up a 64-18 regular season record before going 12-2 running through the East playoff bracket.\n\nIt will be a fascinating series and, fans hope, a competitive one. Some will be lucky enough to see it for themselves by way of purchasing tickets to an NBA Finals game. Like any finale of a major American sport, it will not be cheap.\n\nWhat's the ticket price range for the 2024 NBA Finals? Here's the breakdown for each game (ticket prices as of Wednesday, June 5).\n\nGame 1 is on Thursday night and will be held at TD Garden in Boston, MA. as the Celtics earned home court advantage throughout the postseason by way of owning the league's best record. The hometown fans are, as expected, very excited to watch their team compete for the championship. So it is going to be an absolutely packed house, and one that will run a pretty penny per ticket.\n\nPer the Ticketmaster sales page, the most expensive ticket to see the Celtics play the Mavericks in Game 1 is a cool $27,000. That's right -- nearly thirty grand. The ticket is in Row A of the VIP11 section, which is a courtside seat near the baseline across from the Mavs' bench. The ticket must be bought with its seat partner so this is a package that will cost $54,000 before fees, which in this case are an extra $12,000. So if you want the absolute best seat available, it's roughly a $66,000 investment.\n\nIn the interest of fairness, those two are particularly exorbitant. There are two similarly-priced sets of seats available -- two seats on the baseline under the basket are $25,000 each, and a pair right next to the Celtics' bench on the floor are $17,000 each. But otherwise, most of the good seats (i.e. lower bowl) do not pass the $10,000 mark and instead hover between $6,000 and $10,000.\n\nAll the above prices are largely unattainable for the vast majority of the population barring an unwise loan and/or second mortgage. But it is possible to get in the door for less than an arm and a leg. The cheapest ticket available is in section 305, row 15 (three rows from the wall of TD Garden), which is listed for $620 before fees. Still very expensive, but it doesn't hit the four-digit mark.\n\nThere are actually many tickets available at that general price point. The 300 level of TD Garden has over a dozen listings for tickets ranging from $620 to $700.\n\nGame 2 is scheduled to tip off on Sunday, June 9 at 8 p.m. ET, and will once again be held at TD Garden in Boston.\n\nTickets for Game 2 aren't quite as insanely pricey as Game 1. The most expensive ticket available for purchase for Sunday's contest is worth $15,432 and is located in the row directly behind the broadcast table. How much is being on television worth to you? If the answer is over 15 grand, then you have a great opportunity here.\n\nIn an interesting contrast, the cheapest available tickets for Game 2 are pricier than Game 1. A ticket to sit in the 300-level with your back against the wall starts at $729 and rises pretty rapidly to over $800.\n\nGame 3 of this year's Finals will be in Dallas at American Airlines Center and is scheduled for Wednesday, June 12 at 8:30 p.m. ET. It'll be the first Finals game for the Mavericks since Dirk Nowitzki's epic 2011-12 run that culminated in the organization's first and only championship. Safe to say the place will be loud and packed to the brim.\n\nIt should not surprise you, reader, to learn that the supply and demand for Finals tickets is the same south of the Mason-Dixon Line. The most expensive ticket to purchase for the Mavs' first home game of the Finals is going for $12,650 in section 107 -- right at mid-court, but not courtside. The best view in the house.\n\nInterestingly, it is even more expensive to just get in the door for the first Dallas game. The cheapest ticket available is in section 302 and going for $770. There are only five other tickets available for fewer than $800.\n\nGame 4 is scheduled for Friday, June 14 at 8:30 p.m. ET. If things go extremely well for one side it could be a closeout game. But with how good both teams are, it seems more likely it'll be a pivotal but not potentially season-ending contest.\n\nThe market does not care if you agree with the above sentiments. The tickets are still going to be pricey. In fact, even more so than Game 3. Perhaps in anticipation of a Mavericks or Celtics sweep, the most expensive ticket for Game 4 is on the baseline right next to the Dallas bench, going for a cool $24,000. That is by far the most expensive seat in the arena; most of the high-end tickets are in that same $12,000 range as Game 3.\n\nContinuing on the above trend, Game 4 brings the highest price of admission yet. The cheapest ticket available clocks in at a cool $893 per seat in section 319 at the terrace level. Bring your binoculars.\n\nTicket prices for Games 5-7 are more likely to fluctuate based on what happens in the series, seeing as there is a non-zero chance those games do not even happen. So we'll keep it at four. For now. Enjoy the basketball and more power to you if you are willing and able to pull the trigger on these ticket prices.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainbridge_Fieldhouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gainbridge Fieldhouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trade (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_advantage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home advantage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Airlines Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirk_Nowitzki", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dirk Nowitzki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Tickets", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Tickets", "wgt": 47}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Tickets_For_Shows", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Tickets For Shows", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_6000,h_3375,x_0,y_109/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si/01hzftnzx04drncmc2z1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 479, "textEnd": 485}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "textStart": 1497, "textEnd": 1503}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-09", "textStart": 3403, "textEnd": 3409}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-12", "textStart": 4130, "textEnd": 4137}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-14", "textStart": 4951, "textEnd": 4958}], "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

Washington 4+ rebounds.\n\nWashington is 17-for-17 recording four or more rebounds this postseason.\n\nHe finished with five or more in all five games of the Western Conference Final.\n\nWashington should see big minutes again tonight and record at least four rebounds in Game 1.\n\nFinally, I'll add Washington 10+ points as the final leg of the Same Game Parlay.\n\nWashington is 15-for-17 registering at least 10 points so far this postseason.\n\nHe went 5-for-5 hitting 10+ points in the Western Conference Final.\n\nThe Celtics will be busy chasing Doncic and Kyrie Irving, which should

Credits: USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Dallas Mavericks made quick work of the Minnesota Timberwolves to book their spot in this year's NBA Finals against the Boston Celtics. Both finalists handed out severe beatings to their respective Conference Finals opponents. While the Boston Celtics swept the Pacers, the Mavericks handed the Timberwolves a gentleman's sweep.\n\nAfter witnessing three sweeps this season, NBA fans wonder if a team can get swept, even after they make it to the finals. The answer is Yes. And while it's rare, it has happened on certain occasions, as nine teams have been swept in the NBA Finals, since the league's establishment in 1946.\n\nThe 1959 NBA Finals, then known as the 1959 NBA World Championship Series, represented the beginning of the Celtics-Lakers rivalry. The Celtics swept the Minneapolis side, winning four back-to-back games. Spearheaded by generational talents Bob Cousy and Bill Russell, they proved too much for Elgin Baylor and the Lakers, registering the league's first Finals sweep.\n\nLed by the NBA great, Kareem Abdul Jabbar, the Milwaukee Bucks captured their franchise's first championship in 1971, closing out the series in style. They swept their opponents, the Baltimore Bullets, in a best-of-seven series.\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, a young Rick Barry took his underdog Warriors team to the Finals, even beating out the heavily favored, Washington Bullets, to capture the franchise's third NBA championship.\n\nThe 76ers got their revenge for their 1982 Finals defeat by sweeping the Lakers in the subsequent finals, with Moses Malone leading the way for the Philadelphia side. He even won the Finals MVP title on the occasion.\n\nThe Bad Boy Pistons begin their three-year reign over the NBA by sweeping their previous year's finals opponents, the Lakers. The injury-ridden squad could not put up a fight as a physically superior Detroit team made handy work of Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul Jabbar.\n\nThe series saw a young, up-and-coming Shaquille O'Neal go up against NBA star, Hakeem Olajuwon, with the matchup being called the second coming of Bill Russell vs. Wilt Chamberlain. However, it didn't live up to its hype. The Rockets made quick work of the Magic, sending them back to Orlando in just four games.\n\nKobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal capped off their three-peat by making quick work of the Eastern Conference Champions, the New Jersey Nets. O'Neal was named Finals MVP for the third time, with it also being the last championship of the Kobe-Shaq era as O'Neal soon departed for Miami.\n\nThe San Antonio Spurs won their second championship with Gregg Popovich as they swept LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers. Tony Parker was named Finals MVP, the first player of European nationality to win the award.\n\nFor a second time in league history, LeBron James got swept after the Kevin Durant-led Golden State Warriors proved too much for the injury-ridden Cavaliers. Additionally, James no longer had the services of All-Star guard, Kyrie Irving, making the matchup a one-sided affair through and through.\n\nSo, the Golden State Warriors have dished out the most sweeps in league history, pulling it off on two different occasions. On the flip side, the Lakers have been the only franchise that has taken the most punishment, getting swept by different franchises on three occasions. Hopefully, this year's Finals will be a long-drawn battle as the Celtics and Mavericks go head-to-head for the greatest prize in world basketball.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType":

See all of the ladies who will be rooting for their partners (and rumored beaus) as the Dallas Mavericks take on the Boston Celtics.\n\nTip-off time is upon us! The NBA Finals commence on June 5, and the Boston Celtics and Dallas Mavericks are expected to have quite a competitive face-off. We'll be tuning in not only to see who takes home the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy in the best-of-seven matchup, but also to see if the wives and girlfriends of some of our favorite players representing in the Finals will be courtside. In past years, we've watched queens like Savannah James and Ayesha Curry root for their men at this time of year, and these are the first ladies (the Black ones that is), of a few of the players who will be fighting for a title.\n\nWilkerson is the wife of Dallas Mavericks star and NBA champ (previously with the Cleveland Cavaliers) Kyrie Irving. The pair reportedly have been together since 2018 and share two boys. Irving also has a daughter from a previous relationship.\n\nBeauty Alisah Washington is the wife of P.J. Washington of the Dallas Mavericks. She is also an influencer and entrepreneur in her own right. She wed P.J. in October of 2023 and they share a son together. He also has a son from a previous relationship with influencer Brittany Renner.\n\nWhen he was playing for the Chicago Bulls in early 2023, Derrick Jones Jr. used a team trip to Paris as the perfect opportunity to pop the question to longtime love Shakara. The couple share two children. \"We met during my predraft in Cleveland. I was with my agent and out one night and we met; just like that,\" he told NBA.com. \"We've been together seven years. She knew it was coming eventually, but she didn't know it was coming that night and out here. I felt like it was the perfect timing.\" They wed in October of 2023. Jones now plays for the Mavericks and we're sure Shakara and the family will be cheering him on throughout the Finals.\n\nFinally, a Boston Celtic! Xavier Tillman is married to wife Tamia, with whom he shares three children. The couple wed in 2019 and they're hoping for a championship with the Celtics after Xavier moved on from the Memphis Grizzlies early this year. \"Happy anniversary to my best friend, my safe space, my biggest supporter, the loml!\" Tamia wrote on their fifth anniversary in May. \"Couldn't imagine growing old or doing life w/ anyone else.\"\n\nCatching a glimpse of Celtics star Jayson Tatum with British R&B singer Ella Mai is a rare sight, but the two have been a rumored item since 2020, and were first spotted out publicly in 2022. There are even some fresh rumors that the two welcomed a baby together recently. Nothing has been confirmed though. So the chances of seeing Mai courtside are slim, but we dig this alleged coupling either way.\n\nWe don't know if the beautiful content creator and the multifaceted and incredibly talented Celtics star Jaylen Brown are still a thing, but she was at his birthday party last fall, and he caught hell online in February for forgetting to help her walk across some ice in heels. Whatever their status, if you see her in the stands during the upcoming games, you know why!\n\nThis foxy lady is the wife of Dallas Mavericks power forward and NBA champion Markieff Morris. She was with him in the Bubble with their daughter when the Lakers won the Championships in 2020 and shared what that experience was like for her. And he's also been open about their ups and downs, including at NBA press conferences. \"Yeah, I mean I broke up with my wife a couple of times and we're still married. S-t works,\" he said when speaking on past teammate Kevin Durant previously seeking a trade from the Brooklyn Nets. \"Sometimes you need space to figure some things out.\"", "source": {"uri": "essence.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Essence"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_O'Brien_Championship_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoff_format", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playoff format"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayesha_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ayesha Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savannah,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Savannah, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Savannah, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_Musketeers_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xavier Musketeers men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamia", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tamia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_Jones_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derrick Jones Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ella_Mai", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ella Mai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markieff_Morris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Markieff Morris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis_Grizzlies", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Memphis Grizzlies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Nets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn Nets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm_and_blues", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rhythm and blues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1538675583-scaled.jpg?width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "textStart": 220, "textEnd": 226}], "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

With their last game played on the 28th May, the team have enjoyed a nine-day layoff period.\n\nHowever, I don't subscribe to the theory that smooth sailing to the finals is something that harbours champions.\n\nDallas on the other hand has eliminated three legitimate title contenders en route to the big dance. This trek to the finals through the uber-competitive West has tested their roster and proven that they are a championship-calibre team.\n\nSeven out of the last ten NBA champions have been from the West which highlights the steeling effect of such a fierce and demanding conference.\n\nYou can add to that background that this has been one of the most competitive seasons it has seen in recent years, which saw the reigning champions exit the playoffs in the second round.\n\nLeading into the postseason I did not think Dallas would be here in the NBA finals but like all great teams they have shown their character and ability to perform when the pressure is on.\n\nSo much so that I can see them beating a powerhouse Boston team before the seventh game.\n\nFor a team to win a title, all of the pieces need to come together in sync. In Denver's case, they built it over multiple years, Golden State they drafted their gilded stars and built around them, and for the Mavs, they saw the potential in a young Slovenian guard and patiently waited.\n\nThe Mavs accepted that their budding MVP would not bring championships immediately, but they were all in on this investment. Combined with future Hall of Famer Kyrie Irving, they form the most skilful backcourt in the NBA.\n\nThe final touch was applied courtesy of some front office mid-season magnificence.\n\nThe addition of Daniel Gafford and PJ Washington were the final pieces of the puzzle. No one saw this trade to be the one to win the Mavericks a championship, but few are questioning it now.\n\nThe importance of role players has been highlighted during these playoffs but these two have consistently shown their value ever since that February trade.\n\nFor the past few years, many have watched Luka and known what he was destined for. It was not a question of if he would be the face of the league, it was when.\n\nThat time is now.\n\nHaving averaged 32.4 points, 9.6 rebounds and 8.4 assists in the Western Conference finals, he was the clear MVP of that series and that should be just a taste of what is to come.\n\nDoncic will need his counterpart Irving to be in career-best form when returning to Boston. Whilst Luka is the face of this franchise, Irving's performance holds the key to the Mavs' chances of winning.\n\nKyrie's two-year Boston tenure is something their fans will not have forgotten.\n\nHis comment on this period is \"I wasn't my best self\". Best is certainly something he will need to be for the Mavs to win this series.\n\nHe was just 23 when he won the championship with the Cleveland Cavaliers, now he is 32 and a much more mature player - his leadership and experience will be crucial to the Mavs adding to their ring collection.\n\nWaiting to spoil the party are the Celtics and there are three things they bring that concern me. One is the elite defence of Derrick White and Jrue Holiday.\n\nHaving two defenders of that calibre on one team is almost unfair. They have the potential to seriously disrupt the elite Dallas offence.\n\nThe second is the Celtics perimeter shooting. They averaged 42.5 three-pointers attempted per game in the regular season at a conversion rate of 38.8%.\n\nFor anyone who has watched some of their games this year, you know what happens when the shots start falling. All of a sudden there is a considerable margin in the score and they head off on a 12 - 0 run.\n\nThe final concern is Jayson Tatum, whose brilliance this year was justly rewarded with a fifth All-Star appearance and third consecutive All-NBA first team.\n\nIf we were judging this contest solely off the regular season Boston (64-18) would easily take out Dallas (50-32) and be walking away champions.\n\nThe two times they met this year resulted in Boston victories with the most recent game being a 138 - 110 blowout.\n\nTake note that this fixture was on March 2, therefore after the PJ Washington trade.\n\nCeltics fans will be licking their lips knowing their regular season dominance seemed pre-ordained, they are a team that has looked it from the get-go.\n\nFor two teams who are so well-rounded and stacked with stars, it can be extremely difficult to pick them apart and confidently say who will be the 2024 NBA champion. There is really only one thing that separates the two.\n\nWell, one man I should say.\n\nWhen you think of the 2011 Mavs premiership there is a name that singularly comes to mind. Dirk Nowitzki. This time around Dallas will again be relying on a European superstar to get them another banner.\n\nThe Mavericks' long-haul investment in European basketballers has well and truly paid off. When you look back and think of the 2024 NBA final series all you will recall is Luka Doncic and how he led Dallas to their second-ever title.", "source": {"uri": "theroar.com.au", "dataType": "news",

Sometimes, it's good for people to understand it. You have to normalize some of this stuff because it's always gonna be there regardless of the situation you're in.\"\n\nDiscussion surrounding the potential 2024 NBA Finals MVP is no different.\n\nSo, let's start the conversation with five likely contenders. For the fourth consecutive season, we'll witness a first-timer walk away with the Bill Russell Finals MVP trophy.\n\nHere are five candidates listed alphabetically in our 2024 Race to the NBA Finals MVP Ladder heading into Game 1:\n\nOne half of arguably the NBA's most talented scoring duo, Brown averaged nearly 30 points on 51.7% shooting with 2 steals per game on the way to earning Eastern Conference Finals MVP. The 27-year-old is averaging career playoff highs in scoring and shooting percentage (54.1%) and will likely split time with Jrue Holiday in guarding Luka Doncic.\n\nRaucous crowds and hostile environments serve as a tinder box in stoking Doncic's competitive fire. So, fans at Boston's TD Garden should bark at the 25-year-old at their own risk. The Western Conference Finals MVP posted 32.4 ppg, 8.2 apg and 9.6 rpg while shooting 43.4% in the conference finals against the regular season's No.1-rated defense.\n\nHoliday, the first player to average at least 18 points, seven rebounds and five assists with 50-40-100 shooting splits in a conference finals series, could be one of Boston's X-factors in this series (along with Derrick White). Holiday won't shut down Doncic. Nobody has done that yet. But Holiday's championship experience should prove beneficial.\n\nYou'll hear plenty about his return to Boston, but it's clear Irving has gotten past those days. \"Last time in Boston [in the playoffs] everyone saw me flip off the birds and kind of lose my s -- a little bit,\" he said. \"That wasn't a great reflection of who I am.\" Now at peace, Irving brings a sense of calm into what should be a chaotic scene at TD Garden.\n\nDallas carries the reputation for performing in clutch time throughout the 2024 playoffs.

Listen, man. Their path is their path. First off, it's not on the Celtics that guys are getting hurt, not playing, falling out of the lineup, etc. There are still other professionals coming in, playing hard as (expletive) and still trying to win. And to close out a game on the road? Man, I don't know what people want.\"\n\nWhile Boston's run so far hasn't particularly been rife with drama, the Celtics have still gutted their way through several close games and orchestrated multiple comeback wins, especially during a competitive four-game sweep against the Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\n\"People want all this heartfelt drama and going seven games,\" Garnett said. \"Nah, that ain't the script here. Their script -- they're damn near 16 games better than anybody in the East, they steamrolled through your team and it is what it is. And then, too, they're down 18 on the road.\n\n\"They think you can just hit a button and all of a sudden you're tied. No, man. You have to go win on the road and it's hard as (expletive) to go win on the road and it's even more hard to close out a team. But for all this other (expletive) they can't control and that's out of their control -- get the (expletive) out of here with that. This is what it is.\"\n\nGarnett isn't the only one to defend the Celtics and their competition so far this postseason, with Warriors forward Draymond Green pushing back against talk that Boston hasn't been tested last week on his own podcast.\n\nADVERTISEMENT:\n\n\"[Critics say] they haven't been battle-tested and all of that,\" Green said. \"Whether they get to these NBA Finals and win or lose will not be because they haven't been battle-tested, let me tell you that. You don't get to the NBA Finals and some point throughout the year haven't been battle-tested -- don't happen, won't happen, ain't happening this time.\"", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Profanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Butler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Butler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donovan_Mitchell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donovan Mitchell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrett_Allen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jarrett Allen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Pierce", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul Pierce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draymond_Green", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draymond Green"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Gaming", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Gaming", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/6AS33CzQQ4iZ0gs3NxWeDzmK5KA=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/7CFBJQFUI5POSRW4LIYUBXV7ZI.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

But ticket prices are expected to go back up after Game 1.\n\nThe 2024 NBA Finals between the Celtics and Mavericks are a hot ticket, with many fans set to spend thousands of dollars just to get into the arena for a chance to catch the action.\n\nBut on the day of Game 1, ticket prices for the first few games of the series have become a bit more affordable -- at least to the point where fans won't need to spend four figures in order to watch Thursday's opener.\n\nAs of Thursday morning, the cheapest ticket for Game 1 is $602 before fees on Ace Ticket. Game 2 is a little bit more expensive, but still short of the $1,000 as the cheapest ticket is $697 on Ace Ticket.\n\nThat's a notable drop from what ticket prices were to get into TD Garden for the NBA Finals after the Mavericks won the Western Conference finals last Thursday. The average ticket price on the resale market for each game in the 2024 NBA Finals was $4,150 on Friday, making it the priciest ticket in NBA Finals history, according to TicketIQ. That changed by the beginning of the week. The average ticket price for Game 1 had dropped down to $1,745 on SeatGeek by Tuesday.\n\nAs many have complained about the wait for the Finals (Thursday's Game 1 will mark 10 days since the Celtics won Game 4 of the Eastern Conference finals), that might have actually played a factor in ticket prices dropping a bit entering the series.\n\nAce Ticket CEO Jim Holzman credited the long wait for the interest in tickets taking a bit of a hit, but he expects prices to soar back up again once the series gets underway.\n\n\"People are going to realize, 'I need to get a seat,'\" Holzman told Boston.com. \"These events can be once-in-a-lifetime events. You never know when they're gonna happen again.\n\n\"A lot of people buy one ticket,\" Holzman added on why he expects ticket prices to climb back up following Thursday's Game 1. \"It's a bucket list item for many people. There's only four games guaranteed and two [in Boston].\"\n\nEven as ticket prices have dropped a bit for Game 1, they're still pretty expensive relative to recent NBA Finals. The average ticket for Game 1 on SeatGeek is a 37% increase from last year's Game 1 between the Heat and Nuggets in Denver, SeatGeek shared with Boston.com. On VividSeats, the average get-in price for games in this year's NBA Finals was set at $1,520. Not only is that a 38% increase from the average ticket price from last year's Finals ($1,100), but it's also a 28% increase from the average get-in price for games in the 2022 NBA Finals ($1,183), when the Celtics took on the Warriors.\n\nHolzman remarked that there's been a similar interest in this year's NBA Finals locally compared to 2022 for Ace Ticket. But the interest has also been significant outside of Boston.\n\n\"The interest was incredibly high to begin with, with national interest [being large],\" Holzman said. \"Not just Dallas fans, but fans nationally as well. Celebrities and big names want to come to these games from all over the country.\"\n\nThe data backs up Holzman's statement. Vivid Seats projects that the average fan is traveling over 600 miles to attend games in this year's NBA Finals.\n\nEven though get-in prices for Games 3 and 4 are more expensive than Games 1 and 2 in Boston, you can expect to see a decent chunk of Celtics fans in Dallas next week. VividSeats projects that Celtics fans will account for 20% of American Airlines Center's capacity for Game 3 and 27% of the fans in the arena for Game 4, according to its fan forecast.\n\nBeyond the first four games of the series, there are Celtics fans eyeing Game 5 on June 17 as the game that they're waiting to attend.\n\n\"There's been a lot of interest in Game 5 already because of the past series,\" Holzman said, citing that the Celtics have won each of their first three series in five games or fewer. \"It's really hard. There's a couple things with Game 5. If the Celtics win Game 1 and 2, some people might think there isn't a Game 5.\"\n\nGame 5 could be the first opportunity that the Celtics could have to win the NBA Finals on their floor in 16 years when they defeated the Lakers in Game 6 of the 2008 NBA Finals. As of Thursday, the get-in price for Game 5 is set at $928 before processing fees on Ace Ticket.\n\nBut if the Celtics have a chance to clinch the title, expect that number to go up by a lot.\n\n\"The [get-in price] for Game 5 would probably go between $1,400 and $1,500,\" Holzman said if the Celtics have a chance to win the NBA Finals that night.\n\nAnd if there is a Game 7, Holzman expects the get-in price to be at least $1,700, which he said was a similar price to Game 7 of the Bruins' Stanley Cup Final series against the Blues in 2019.", "source": {"uri": "boston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conor_roche@boston.com", "name": "Conor Roche", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Airlines Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Blues", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Blues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivid_Seats", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vivid Seats"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Tickets", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Tickets", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ALYAAY3WME27WBY5P75TOOX5DI-6661b957078fa-768x432.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-17", "textStart": 3673, "textEnd": 3680}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

Subscribe here to get it delivered to your inbox every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Have feedback for the Layup Lines Crew? Leave your questions, comments and concerns through this brief reader survey. Now, here's Prince J. Grimes.\n\nJust one more day.\n\nThe NBA has been away for six days since the last game was played, but the finals begin tomorrow and there are so many interesting storylines to sort through.\n\nKyrie Irving's return to Boston is at the top of that list, but something else I'll be following closely that isn't getting nearly as much attention is the battle for MVP.\n\nIn most cases, the finals MVP award goes to the best player on the winning team, because that player usually has the biggest impact on the outcome of the series. Not always, but usually.\n\nThe last time the best player on the winning team didn't win the award was Andre Iguodala in 2015. And believe it or not, that was almost 10 years ago now.\n\nIt's for that reason we don't typically think about the award much going into a series. The only reason we cared so much the last time Boston was in the finals was because we knew it would likely be the last time Steph Curry would have a chance to win it. And he did.\n\nThis time around, though, there's a new plot twist. BetMGM odds once again favor each team's presumed best player, with Jayson Tatum listed as the overall favorite at -120 and Luka Doncic next at +200. But there's reason to doubt Tatum will actually win the award even if Boston does take the series (as they're favored to do at -225).\n\nRelated: Our brilliant staff predictions for 2024 NBA Finals winner and MVP\n\nThe Celtics are built in such a way that Tatum might not necessarily have to do as much as your typical No. 1 option in order for them to win. We saw that play out in the Eastern Conference Finals, when Jaylen Brown was named MVP over Tatum.\n\nIn addition to those two, the Celtics also have former all-stars Jrue Holiday and Kristaps Porzingis in their lineup. As well as borderline all-star Derrick White, who might just be the X-factor in this series.\n\nWhen Boston is humming, any one of those players can have a big game. Which is precisely why Tatum wasn't a bigger regular season MVP candidate in a year the Celtics won 64 games.\n\nSo, why is any of this a big deal?\n\nIt shouldn't be. Except we know what these things mean to the best players. Awards can be a sort of validation for the work they put in to get to this point. Tatum himself admitted as much at the All-Star break. It would be interesting to see how he handles things if say Brown wins another award over him -- on top of owning the richest contract in league history (Tatum is in line to eclipse that deal this summer).\n\nWould the two feel like their work together is complete and want to test their abilities apart from each other? Or would they put their egos aside to run it back at least another year?\n\nWho knows? But that's why the finals MVP discussion will be so fascinating. Of course, the Celtics need to worry about winning first. And this could all be a moot point if Tatum actually does win it. But if the award goes elsewhere, the \"best player\" talk will be endless and probably exhausting. And depending on how the series goes, it might be valid.\n\nRelated: 3 reasons the Celtics will (and won't) win the NBA Finals\n\nJontay Porter's alleged co-conspirator arrested\n\nIt would be unfair for me to call the people Jontay Porter was working with in an NBA betting scheme amateurs.\n\nI don't know those people from anywhere. Never heard of them, not familiar with their sports betting history, nor do I even know what they do for a living. The only things I know about them is what was reported Tuesday when one of the alleged co-conspirators was arrested and charged in the scheme that got Porter banned from the league.\n\nHowever, from those reports, I think I have enough information to say those people were amateurs.\n\nFor starters, they couldn't have been too bright to think no one would notice large amounts of money being bet on a fringe player like Porter to begin with. But beyond that, according to the criminal complaint, the group apparently went about their plotting in a group chat on the Telegram Messenger app?!\n\nAnd, AND, the guy who was arrested Monday got caught at JFK Airport apparently trying to board on a one-way ticket to Australia. Which is laughable considering Porter was first busted in April. What took the guy so long to realize he might be in trouble?\n\nYeah, I think it's safe to say this wasn't the most buttoned up operation Porter chose to associate himself with. You can read all about it here.\n\nOne to Watch\n\n(All odds via BetMGM)\n\nLas Vegas Aces (-450) at Dallas Wings (+8.5; +340), 8 p.m. ET\n\nThis is a tough matchup for Dallas because though the Wings can get up and down the floor and score with the Aces, I'm not sure they defend well enough to beat a Las Vegas team coming off four days of rest. And while the Aces certainly have room to improve themselves on the defensive end, their biggest weakness has been against the three -- which isn't where Dallas has excelled. Vegas also has the rebounding chops to neutralize Dallas' usual advantage on the offensive boards.\n\nAll that said, the Wings are 5-2 ATS this season and they're finally home after five straight games on the road. So I expect them to put up a fight against a team they're familiar with from last year's playoff semifinals. I think the Aces win, but I'll take the points with Dallas.\n\nPrince's Pick: Wings +8.5\n\nShootaround\n\n-- Fans had jokes for the hilarious Steph Curry casting choice in FX's Clipped\n\n-- The Jazz are getting rid of those terrible black and yellow jerseys and fans are thrilled\n\n-- The latest Ringer mock draft has Devin Carter with a reported promise\n\n-- Lonzo Ball classily offers to pay for Angel Reese's fine after weak ejection\n\nThat's all the Layup Lines for today.

I wish we would have won,\" Tatum said Wednesday. \"But I'm a firm believer that everything happens for a reason. There's a lesson to be learned in every situation.\n\n\"I do feel a lot different this time. I'm excited for the opportunity for us to get the job done. I told myself if I ever got the opportunity again to make it to the finals, never take it for granted. We're here now and I'm excited to get ready to play and have fun.\"\n\nBrown said he has watched the 2022 finals several times to learn how to better manage his emotions and to make better decisions on the court.\n\n\"You learn and grow from your experiences,\" Brown said. \"Two years later makes a pretty big difference.\n\n\"This is a special group. The core group has been here for a few years now. We've been able to go through experiences, having success but not having success at the same time.\n\n\"The ultimate goal is to get over the hump and win. I think that will add a lot to our legacy as a team, but as of right now, that story is still kind of untold.\"\n\nAnother factor is that the Celtics seek an unprecedented 18th NBA crown, one more than the all-time record they share with the rival Los Angeles Lakers.\n\n\"Some of the greatest players to ever play this game wore this uniform. We're honored to follow in their footsteps. They paved the way for us to live out our dreams,\" said Tatum.\n\n\"If you want to be one of the greats to put on this uniform, every great before you won a championship. It takes special players to be part of an environment like that.\"\n\nOne of those is Jrue Holiday, who won a 2021 NBA title with Milwaukee and was obtained in a trade deal just before the season began.\n\n\"To be a part of history would be cool, the history the Celtics have,\" Holiday said. \"To add to that is part of the reason I was brought here -- and part of the reason I wanted to come.\"\n\nThe defensive standout sees something special in the Celtics, who led the NBA with 64 wins this season.\n\n\"The pressure JB and JT have to take on is something different,\" Holiday said. \"It's really impressive how they handle themselves.\n\n\"I know sometimes talent doesn't mesh together but this does. You saw it in the regular season. You've seen it in the playoffs. Any given night we sacrifice for each other. we're unselfish and I think that's what makes it go.\"\n\n\"And then it's just the will to win. They've been to the Eastern Conference finals a million times and they have been to the finals so they've been to the top, just didn't execute the way they wanted.\n\n\"Now that we're here, we want to get the job done.\"\n\nTatum appreciates the finals more after losing to Miami in seven games in last year's East finals.\n\n\"Last year we took that for granted and we didn't make it to the finals.

They've just been there before. In some of those tough moments, when I go back and look, you can tell that they had been there before.\"\n\nJaylen Brown said he studied that series too.\n\n\"I've watched it a few times now, maybe four or five times, as well as last year's conference finals. I think you can always learn from anything really,\" he said. \"But just being able to watch those moments and learn from them, how to manage your emotions, like, what you would have did differently potentially. I don't think that's bad to look at and acknowledge and be aware of.\"\n\nAl Horford had to wait 15 seasons to play in his first NBA Finals, but just two for his second. He thought the Celtics would better understand the pacing of the entire experience.\n\n\"I feel like the first time we went through it, I feel like it was a bit overwhelming, just a lot going on,\" he said. \"This time around, I feel like we all understand it a little better. I'm very appreciative to be in this position.\"\n\nTatum said he was ready to apply what he learned in Game 1.\n\n\"I hate that I had to go through it. I wish we would have won. But I'm a firm believer in everything happens for a reason,\" he said. \"There's a lesson to be learned in every situation. I do. I do feel a lot different this time, this go-around, two years later. I'm excited for the opportunity for us to get the job done.\n\n\"It was a lesson to be learned.

Christian Braun returned to Kansas. Justin Holiday spent some time in Glenwood Springs and attended the United States Women's National Team's soccer match at Dick's Sporting Goods Park last week, while the Celtics and Mavericks won their respective conference finals.\n\nHere are three things that went right for Boston and Dallas that Denver lacked this year:\n\nConsistent top two\n\nJayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown have scored in double figures in all 14 of Boston's playoff games. Luka Doncic has scored at least 18 points in all 17 of Dallas's playoff games, while Kyrie Irving has scored in double figures in all but two of those games.\n\nNikola Jokic scored 16 or more points in all 12 of Denver's postseason games. Jamal Murray nearly reached double figures in each of the Nuggets' playoff games, but the exception, his eight-point performance on 18 shots in Game 2 of the Minnesota series, proved to be pivotal, as did his 10-point out on 18 shots in Game 6 against the Timberwolves. Murray's highs were loud - there were the two game-winning shots against the Lakers and a couple of clutch 30-point performances in Game 5 against the Lakers and Game 7 against Minnesota, but Denver struggled without the security of a consistent second scoring option, something that was pivotal in last year's championship run.\n\nIn-Season Moves\n\nSign Up for Pikes Peak 5 Game analysis and insights from The Gazette sports staff including columns by Woody Paige and Paul Klee.\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Featured Local Savings\n\nThe Mavericks made the bigger moves, bringing PJ Washington and Daniel Gafford to Dallas in different trades just before the deadline. Boston made the smaller move in February, but the trade to acquire Xavier Tillman from Memphis provided another option inside after Kristaps Porzingis missed most of Boston's last two series with a soleus strain.\n\nDenver's front office opted to sit still at the deadline. There weren't any glaring issues to address or obvious trades to be made at the time, but the Nuggets could've used another contributor when a few rotation players appeared to wear down over the final weeks of the regular season and throughout the playoffs. Hindsight's 20-20, but Denver would've been in a better to go back-to-back with a small move to add a depth option at point guard or centers.\n\nMultiple Bigs\n\nEven with Kristaps Porzingis sidelined for much of the second round and conference finals, Boston was able to play two centers between Al Horford, Luke Kornet and Tillman. Dallas has played Daniel Gafford and Dereck Lively II in every playoff game except Game 4 of the conference finals that Lively missed with a neck strain. Mavericks coach Jason Kidd expanded his rotation to briefly include Dwight Powell as a back-up big with Lively out.\n\nThe Nuggets never had the same faith in their bench options. In the close games, Aaron Gordon was both the starting power forward and backup center, something that added to his already heavy workload. Finding a more reliable reserve center remains one of franchise's top priorities this offseason.\n\nPrediction: Celtics win in 5\n\nBoston has the advantage in Finals experience and a couple of All-Defensive guards to throw at Kyrie Irving, while Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum can be the primary defenders on Luka Doncic. It won't be easy, but if Boston can slow down one of Dallas's top-two scorers, the Mavericks will quickly find trouble. The Celtics have significantly more paths to victory. If Kristaps Porzingis proves to be healthy to start the series, it won't take Boston long to become the first NBA franchise to win 18 championships.", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType":

(He's) a great player and (I'm) just a big fan.\"\n\nGleason and Messina noted that the 6-foot-4 quarterback didn't look quite as big standing with the 6-foot-8 Tatum, but Maye said he wasn't surprised by his size -- his older brother Luke played basketball for the Tar Heels and his first start was against Tatum's Blue Devils.\n\n\"It was a tough night for the Heels,\" Maye recalled.\n\nThe Celtics will begin the final quest for Banner No. 18 when they host the Dallas Mavericks in Game 1 of the NBA Finals on Thursday night.", "source": {"uri": "nesn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NESN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gayle_troiani@nesn.com", "name": "Gayle Troiani", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_Maye", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drake Maye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBCSN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBCSN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina_Tar_Heels_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Messina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Messina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Blue_Devils", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Duke Blue Devils"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://nesn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/06/Jayson-Tatum-4.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

I say it's no shocker to see the Boston Celtics playing for an NBA title as they went 68-14 this season. The Celtics entered the playoffs the number one seed from the Eastern Conference. The Dallas Mavericks, now I doubt many thought they would be representing the Western Conference. The Mavericks entered the playoffs as a five seed. The Dallas team went 50-32 this season. The Celtics won 18 more regular season games than Dallas. The boys in Vegas have installed the Celtics as 2-1 favorites over the Mavericks.\n\nI ask, can the Mavericks upset the mighty boys from Boston? I say, absolutely they have a shot at the upset. The two superstar guards in Luka Doncic and Kyrie \"the earth is flat\" Irving are playing tremendous basketball in these playoffs. The upset can only happen if these two players keep up the tremendous play on the court.\n\nThe Boston Celtics were in the NBA Finals in 2022 but lost to the Golden State Warriors in six games. I think the experience of that loss will propel the Celtics in this series against Dallas.\n\nThe Fat Guy will take the Boston Celtics in seven games to win. I will say, I will not be shocked if the Dallas team pulls off the upset. I can tell you, yes, I am rooting for Dallas to defeat Boston.\n\nThe Stanley Cup Finals will begin on Saturday night in Florida. The Eastern Conference champions are the Florida Panthers. The Western Conference champions are the Edmonton Oilers. I absolutely love this Stanley Cup matchup of these two teams.\n\nThe Florida Panthers lost last year in the Stanley Cup Finals to Vegas, so they will look to redeem themselves. The Florida franchise has never hoisted Lord Stanley in their team history. The Panthers are a tough physical hockey team with scoring power and solid goaltending. The goaltender is Sergei Bobrovsky, and he is one tough customer between the pipes.\n\nThe Edmonton Oilers top line of Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl offensively will pose problems for Florida. I am repeating myself from the last two weeks, but watching Connor McDavid is totally worth the watch. I am so happy he finally made it to the Stanley Cup Finals!\n\nThe Fat Guy loved the Panthers when the playoffs started, and I am not bailing ship now! The goaltender for Florida is the difference, and Florida wins in six games! Yes, the Stanley Cup will need some sunscreen in 2024!\n\nThe Detroit Tigers made a major move in sending Spencer Torkelson down to Triple-A Toledo. The season has been a total disaster for \"Tork\" as he was hitting a paltry .179 against fastballs thrown to him. The last two weeks Spencer was 0-19 during one stretch and then went 0-16 in another stretch. I mean, Spencer left the Tigers no choice but to try to fix his swing at Toledo. I hope it works, as the number one overall pick needs to be vital to the Tigers in the big picture.\n\nThe Tigers called up Justyn- Henry Malloy, the Tigers number six prospect. The position Malloy plays is outfield so the Tigers tried Gio Urshela and Mark Canha at first base in Boston. The right handed hitting Malloy is a patient hitter and has a good eye at the plate. I would rank his power as average. The Tigers acquired Malloy from the Atlanta Braves in the Joe Jimenez trade in 2022. I guess we shall see if Malloy is MLB ready!\n\nJeff Day, aka Fat Guy, is a Michigan native and life-long sports enthusiast, who could read a baseball box score by the age of four.

It's the details, the execution, the ability to take your mindset and your body to the next level.\"\n\nMazulla may be the youngest coach to reach the NBA Finals at 35 since Celtics legend Bill Russell did the same in 1969 but he is full of wisdom, gleaning on the lessons from their previous Finals loss.\n\n\"The biggest thing we took as we were going through that series against the Warriors, the things we kept coming back to were the things we kept talking about the entire year -- the margins, details, fundamentals, the way you go about executing at a high level,\" Mazulla said.\n\nThe Celtics appeared on track to raise Banner 18 in 2022, which would have broken the deadlock with rival Los Angeles Lakers. But they squandered a 2-1 series lead as the more experienced Warriors executed better late in the series.\n\nIt has only been two years, but a lot has changed since then.\n\n\"We got a different team,\" said Jaylen Brown, who narrowly edged Jayson Tatum for the Eastern Conference Finals Most Valuable Player award. \"We got a different coach, too, as well. We had Ime Udoka; now we have Joe Mazzulla. We had Marcus Smart, Rob Williams; we had Jrue Holiday, Kristaps Porzingis. Different team, different coach two years later make a pretty big difference.\"\n\nBut Mazulla was there in 2022 so he is no longer a stranger to the pressure of the NBA Finals.\n\n\"Yeah, I mean, unless they change the light bulbs in the arenas, they won't be any brighter than they were in the last series,\" Mazulla said. \"It's just sticking to the details, the things that matter, the truth. The truth of the matter is if you don't box out, if you don't sprint back in transition, if you don't pass the ball in a two-on-one, if you don't take away the other team's tendencies, if you don't know who you're guarding, don't recognize the spacing, if you don't talk, if you don't play hard, you're not going to win. Focusing on the most simple things and the truth, the truth of the matter is you have to do those things. You have to do them at a high level. Obviously, the stakes are higher, that just means that the details are more important.\"\n\nBut unlike in 2022, Mazulla is no longer in the shadows of Udoka. He is finally coming into his own after his interim tag last season was removed, giving him the power to assemble his coaching staff.\n\nThe addition of Charles Lee, previously with the Milwaukee Bucks championship team and headed to Charlotte as its new head coach, and Sam Cassell have helped Mazulla transform the Celtics offense into a 3-point juggernaut.\n\nThey led the league in 3-pointers made (16.5 in the regular season and 14.6 in the playoffs). But they were relatively unchallenged in their 12-2 postseason run to the NBA Finals.\n\nTheir defense, more than their offense, will be the key in this series against the Dallas Mavericks, who are powered by one of the best backcourts in NBA history in Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving. Dallas' two superstars are averaging a combined 51.0 points in their first playoff run together.\n\n\"Luka and Kyrie are the 2nd starting backcourt since 1970-71 to enter the NBA Finals averaging a combined 50+ PPG in the postseason, joining Clyde Drexler and Terry Porter in 1992!\" NBA tweeted on X.\n\nThe Celtics, whose defensive schemes are not blitz-heavy, will need to play as a string on defense.\n\n\"The toughest team will win,\" Mazulla said. \"The team that makes the most plays will win. The team that can execute the details at a high level will win. It's no different.\"\n\n--", "source": {"uri": "philstar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Philstar.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alder_almo@philstar.com", "name": "Alder Almo", "type": "author",

He's averaging 28.8 points, 9.4 rebounds and 8.2 assists in the playoffs -- much of it with nagging injuries to his knee and ankle.\n\nDoncic's scoring line is set at a very makeable 31.5 points -- a number he crossed in four of five games against Minnesota in the West Final. That was against the NBA's top defense. While the Boston Celtics are no slouches, a Top-3 unit on the season, they've yet to meet the force anywhere near Doncic's caliber through their postseason run.\n\nIn two regular-season games vs. the C's, both Dallas losses, Doncic cruised past the total, ringing up a 33-point triple-double on Jan. 22, then dropping a 37-point triple-double on March 1.\n\nJayson Tatum's shooting has been mediocre for much of the playoffs, but he could be peaking at the right time. Tatum averaged 30.3 points, 10.3 rebounds, and 6.3 assists in the East Final sweep of Indiana. He shot 46.3% from the field, the best mark so far in any series, while finally raising his 3-point shooting above 30% in a series.\n\nBut, whether he's shooting well or poorly, he has consistently been Boston's best rebounder, and with a line of 9.5, it's worth adding to your ticket.\n\nTatum has pulled down 10 boards in 11 of 14 playoff games, a big plus to his arsenal, especially as his shot has eluded him at times. He had 19 total rebounds in two games vs. Dallas in the regular season.\n\nLet's finish with Kyrie Irving, who seems to have found his 3-point shooting stroke after a so-so set against the Thunder. Though he shot 42.3% in the series, he failed to connect on three or more triples in Games 2-5.\n\nAgainst the Timberwolves, though? He drilled at least three from beyond the arc in three of the final four games.\n\nAs the Mavs' veteran leader, he's the 3-point silencer his fresh-faced Finals teammates need in Game 1.\n\nLearn how to bet a same-game parlay with these helpful tips and strategies.", "source": {"uri": "covers.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Covers.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Murder-Mystery_and_Deduction", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Murder-Mystery and Deduction", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://img.covers.com/cms/covers/e3a689b6-646d-4dce-842f-38fbd5ef3beb.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-22", "textStart": 1080, "textEnd": 1087}, {"amb": false, "date": "-03-01", "textStart": 1131, "textEnd": 1138}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 116, "relevance": 1}

He's become one of the most interesting points of conversation and the series hasn't even started yet.\n\nFolks are wondering whether Williams, a former Boston Celtic and Dallas Maverick, could get a championship ring out of the NBA Finals this year with his two former teams playing one another.\n\nThe questions were also fueled by a quote reportedly circulated by Williams stating that he wouldn't turn down a championship ring from either team if he was, indeed, offered one.\n\nBut would he actually get one? That's the question. And there is an answer to it. But, first, let's make a quick point of clarification.\n\nThat Grant Williams quote on the NBA Finals isn't real\n\nThe internet has been circulating a quote that Williams allegedly said he wouldn't turn down a championship ring.\n\nAs it turns out, though, that quote isn't real -- it's from the Ballsack Sports parody account. Not only was Williams not asked about this, but he never actually said this either.\n\nThis is just a case of the internet taking the wrong thing and running with it. Again.\n\nWhat a shame.\n\nWow. Ok. But still -- could Williams get a championship ring?\n\nI'm not sure if Williams would actually get a ring, but it's certainly possible that he could. At least, if the Mavericks win, anyway.\n\nRemember, while Williams was a staple in the Celtics' rotation for years, he didn't actually play for the Celtics this season. He was sent to Dallas in a 3-team trade last summer as part of a deal netting Boston some second-round picks. So he wasn't part of Boston's roster this season and wouldn't be able to get a championship ring from a successful NBA Finals run.\n\nBut Williams did play for Dallas this year. He was a Maverick until Dallas traded him to Charlotte during the NBA's trade deadline. That's technically long enough that the team could offer him a championship ring should the Mavericks win it all.\n\nThat's a big if, though. The Mavericks would have to decide whether to offer Williams a ring. But if he was to get a ring this year, Dallas is the only place it could come from.\n\nThe Lakers are reportedly targeting Dan Hurley as coach and fans were stunned at the turn of events Who are the referees calling the 2024 NBA Finals between the Mavericks and Celtics? 3 shrewd decisions that helped the Mavericks make the 2024 NBA Finals", "source": {"uri": "ftw.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "For The Win"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_d_sykes@ftw.usatoday.com", "name": "Mike D.

Is LeBron James' son dating P Diddy's daughter? Here are the facts\n\nThe NBA Finals are set to tip off, with the Boston Celtics taking on the Dallas Mavericks in both teams' bid to go all the way to glory, win the ring and benefit from the financial incentives. This year, NBA playoff teams will share a pool of $33.7 million, with payouts determined by each team's progress. The rewards range from $452,708 per team-about $30,000 per player based on a 15-player roster-to potentially $12.1 million ($804,000 per player) for the NBA champions.\n\nTeams earn more money with each round they advance, and the NBA also considers regular season standings in the playoff pool distribution, offering an additional bonus to the team with the best record.\n\nFor example, the Boston Celtics, who finished the season as the No. 1 seed with a 64-18 record, will see their players earn $804,000 each if they win the championship.\n\nMeanwhile, teams seeded seventh or eighth do not receive bonuses for their regular season performance. Players on these teams could earn $698,000 if they achieve an unlikely run to the title. The lowest-seeded team to win the NBA Finals was the 1995 Houston Rockets, who were a sixth seed.\n\nNo additional financial rewards are given for the play-in tournament games beyond regular season salaries, typically paid over 12 months.\n\nThe NBA's playoff pool has increased by 25 percent from last year due to the new collective bargaining agreement effective for the 2023/24 season.\n\nPlayoff bonuses have increased between 12 and 17 percent for each round, except for the NBA champion's payout, which has surged 79 percent to $8.55 million from $4.78 million.", "source": {"uri": "marca.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MARCA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_play-in_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA play-in tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Rockets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston Rockets"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/59e3e59d886697b97a891a97dc7e2a1e/resize/1200/f/webp/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2024/06/06/17176759733317.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 112, "relevance": 1}

Expect more on this story from our college basketball and NBA teams throughout the day.\n\nAnd as for that other big NBA story ...\n\n\ud83c\udfc0 Good morning to everyone, but especially to ...\n\nTHE BOSTON CELTICS AND THE DALLAS MAVERICKS\n\nWelcome to the NBA Finals, friends. It's been a long time since we had the NBA on our screens, but the Celtics facing the Mavericks figures to be very much worth the wait.\n\nWe've seen a historic postseason from Luka Doncic already, and in his bold predictions, Brad Botkin says even more history is on the way.\n\nBotkin: \"1. Luka averages 35 points per game -- Only nine players have averaged at least 35 points for a single Finals: Michael Jordan (twice), Shaquille O'Neal (twice), Rick Barry, Elgin Baylor, LeBron James, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Jerry West, Allen Iverson and Kevin Durant. ... Doncic has averaged north of 35 PPG for a single playoff series just once in his career (35.7 vs. the Clippers in 2021). It's a huge number. But Dallas is going to have to score big in this series, and any idea that Boston is uniquely equipped to defend Luka largely went out the window with what he did to Minnesota ...\"\n\nDoncic, of course, isn't Dallas' only star who can score big. Considering Jrue Holiday's hilarious (and honest) one-word answer about defending Kyrie Irving, Boston has plenty of respect for Dallas' \"other\" star, too.\n\nThe Mavericks are every bit a championship-level team. But there's a reason the Celtics are considerable favorites. They went an NBA-best 64-18 in the regular season, had the best offensive rating in NBA history and had the fifth-best average margin of victory in NBA history. They are a superteam, Sam Quinn writes, and they represent the future of superteams as well.\n\nQuinn: \"The Celtics don't have three great players. They have six very good ones. Three of them, Holiday, Kristaps Porzingis and Al Horford, made All-Star teams playing for someone other than the Celtics. A fourth, Derrick White, was acquired before his prime and may yet get there wearing green and white. ... Jaylen Brown has already signed a supermax extension that hasn't kicked in yet. Jayson Tatum became eligible for one by earning All-NBA honors this season. But Boston built while they were reasonably cheap and before the CBA harshly limited their maneuverability. They added players who were expensive, but not prohibitively so, and they timed the moves brilliantly.\"\n\nHere's more:\n\nGame 1 previewThere's no bad blood between Doncic and Porzingis.What other teams can learn from Boston and Dallas.ICYMI: Expert picks \ud83d\ude0a Honorable mentions It's Coco Gauff vs. Iga Swiatek and Mirra Andreeva vs. Jasmine Paolini in the French Open women's semifinals.

Juan Soto. Shohei Ohtani. Mookie Betts. Guys atop the MVP conversation. But there are plenty of tough calls. In the AL, one of those is shortstop.\n\nSnyder: \"Gunnar Henderson, Orioles. The veteran, established stars are Corey Seager, Carlos Correa and Bo Bichette. This is a two-man position right now, though, between up-and-coming superstars Bobby Witt Jr. and Henderson. Neither has gotten anywhere close to oversaturated in terms of public attention and neither has even been an All-Star yet. Thus, I'm going to go with one on each ballot and send apologies to Anthony Volpe.\"\n\nMatt also has under-the-radar picks for every position -- man, Matt really does it all! -- and let's give some love to the NL Central leaders.\n\nSnyder: \"Second baseman -- Brice Turang, Brewers. Luis Arraez got a ton of run for his batting average last season and it's bound to happen again. Ketel Marte is an established star and played in the World Series last year, so I'll knock those two off. I'd entertain a vote for either if there wasn't a viable alternative, but Turang is hitting .291 with a .356 OBP and 21 stolen bases for a first-place team.

His eight league assists are also a career high. But just as importantly as those stats, for the first time in his career, Pulisic showed an ability to regularly get on the pitch, and stay there. He played 36 out of 38 league games for Milan, a career best, and only the second time he's ever cracked the 30 game barrier ... When other nations that the USMNT will face have multiple top 100 players, it shows that despite America rising up the FIFA rankings, America is still playing catch-up when it comes to their talent level.\"\n\nIf we had done this exercise a few years ago, Neymar would have been a top-10 player. I was shocked to see him all the way down at 89th. Jonathan Johnson explains.\n\nJohnson: \" ... does not even have a goal to his name with Al Hilal yet ... A brilliant player on his day but not consistent nor motivated enough over the final meaningful years of his career means that this feels like things ending in ignominy unless Neymar can summon huge inner strength and belief to get back to something close to his best one final time.\"\n\nWe're unveiling 80-61 this morning on the CBS Sports Golazo Network.\n\n\u26bd Examining Emma Hayes' strong start with USWNT\n\nExactly nine months ago, the USWNT finished its worst World Cup ever. Maybe the veterans were too old. Maybe the youngsters were too young. Whatever the case the U.S. needed a new voice with the world clearly catching up.\n\nEmma Hayes is that new voice. After an incredible run with Chelsea, Hayes made her USWNT managerial debut in a 4-0 win over South Korea on Saturday, and she followed that up with a 3-0 win in the rematch Tuesday.\n\nThere was lots to be encouraged by. Crystal Dunn, normally a defender, played in attack and scored. Lily Yohannes, all of 16 years old, scored. And Hayes got valuable time with the team ahead of naming the Olympic roster.\n\nShe's impressed so far, but she'll also face huge expectations, Sandra Herrera writes.\n\nHerrera: \"With Hayes, she's already checking off items on USWNT fans' wishlists. Integrate new players with less experience and play them? Done and still happening. Formational changes? Done and were shifted in the game. Rotate players? Used every substitution available and only two players weren't utilized this window. ... Ready or not, Hayes is here to help push U.S. Soccer into the global game in ways it's not used to and that's a good thing.\" \ud83d\udcfa What we're watching Thursday\n\n\u26be Cubs at Reds, 7:10

Now, he looks to be significantly better as Boston attempts to win their 18th championship, But White also hopes to improve after averaging only 9.8 points, 2.2 assists, and 1.5 rebounds per game in the series loss against Golden State. Consequently, he will need to do much better or else he will not hit the over.\n\nThings will also be complicated with the return of Kristaps Porzingis. Additionally, Jaylen Brown may score a bunch of points, and you cannot forget about Jayson Tatum. Because of that, it may make things difficult for White to hit his stats. Let's examine what he has done over the course of the postseason and how much he can score.\n\nHere are the NBA Finals odds, courtesy of FanDuel.\n\nNBA Finals Odds: Derrick White Points Per Game Odds\n\nWhen the Celtics started the postseason, they were the heavy favorites against the Miami Heat in the first round. However, many believed it would be Tatum or Brown leading the way against Miami. But White took over the series from the onset. First, he scored 20 points in Game 1 while shooting 6 for 10. White also had 16 points in Game 3 while shooting 7 for 14. Later, he exploded for 38 points in Game 4 by going 15 for 26. White then helped the Celtics close the series with 25 points while shooting 8 for 13. Amazingly, he was all over the court in that series, and the Heat could not stop him, as he averaged 22.4 points per game.\n\nThe Celtics came into the Eastern Conference Semifinals with the Cleveland Cavaliers with high expectations. Ultimately, White kept his momentum going as he scored 25 points while shooting 9 for 15. While White did not go over 14 for the next three games, he did finish with 18 points in the Game 5 win over the Cavs. Overall, he finished with 14 points per game in the series.\n\nWhite was solid in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals, scoring 15 points while shooting 5 for 13. Then, he scored 23 points while shooting 8 for 15. Because of that performance, White finished with 16.75 points per game in the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nWhen you compile all three of these series, White has averaged 17.8 points per game in the playoffs. Significantly, he has been the reliable third option for the Celtics behind Brown and Tatum. The Celtics acquired Jrue Holiday in the offseason to add another weapon. Yet, White has remained reliable and someone who can score at will when the Celtics needed him to.\n\nWhite will hit the over because he ie a force all over the court and incredibly consistent. Plus, he is the third-best scorer on the team.\n\nWhy Derrick White Will Hit the Under\n\nBut it's also important to remember that White has also had some bad games. Moreover, Porzingis being back may complicate things. White hit the under just once against the Heat when he scored 13 points in Game 2. However, there were other instances where he just struggled.\n\nWhite basically disappeared in the series against the Cavaliers. Unfortunately, he managed just 10 points in Game 2 while shooting 3 for 11, including 1 for 8 from the triples. White also scored 12 points in Game 3 while shooting 4 for 13, including 3 for 8 from beyond the arc. Somehow, the worst performance came in Game 4 when he scored five points in Game 4 while shooting just 1 for 6. White finished with 14 points per game in the series.\n\nWhile White did well over the first two games of the Eastern Conference Finals, he also had one bad game. Unfortunately, he barely missed the spread in Game 3 as he scored 13 points while shooting 3 for 11, including 2 for 8 from beyond the arc.\n\nThe common thread in all these games where he struggled was his inability to hit the three-point shot. Significantly, when he was on fire, he hit the mark easily. But when he could not hit the shot, he usually faltered.\n\nWhite will hit the under because the Mavericks are excellent at defending the three-point shot. Likewise, it may make things difficult for him to make any headway.\n\nFinal Derrick White Points Per Game Prediction\n\nWhite has hit the over in two of three series. Yet, Porzingis's return complicates things. The Mavericks will also be significantly better than any other team they have faced. Overall, the Heat, Cavaliers, and Pacers did not pose any significant threat on defense. But the Mavs have already overcome some offensive juggernauts as they beat the Oklahoma City Thunder and Minnesota Timberwolves. Therefore, look for the Mavs to contain White. We could see him averaging between 11-13 points, which would likely fall short.\n\nClick here for more betting news and predictions", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rb_hayek@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Rb Hayek", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2022 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Murder-Mystery_and_Deduction", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Murder-Mystery and Deduction", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Derrick-White-NBA-Finals-points-per-game-prediction-odds.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 110, "relevance": 1}

Boston's Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are the Celtics' most tenured and scrutinized stars and see it as a chance at redemption after falling short in the Finals just two seasons ago and then failing to return last year. Dallas' Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving see it as their first opportunity to make good on a partnership that began late last season after Irving was traded from Brooklyn following a tumultuous run of two-plus seasons with the Nets.\n\nThe NBA Finals were too late for Dallas' Luka Doncic to watch as a kid. Now, he's in them\n\nBOSTON (AP) -- Luka Doncic didn't stay up all night to watch NBA Finals games as a kid. They usually started at something like 3 a.m. in his native Slovenia. He had school to get to a few hours later. He'd wake up and find out who won. Make no mistake, though: Doncic was paying attention. The 25-year-old makes his NBA Finals debut for the Dallas Mavericks when they take on the Boston Celtics in Game 1 of this year's title series on Thursday night. He could become the first player to win a scoring title and a championship in the same season since Shaquille O'Neal in 2000.\n\nAthletics' Joey Estes pitching perfect game through six innings against Mariners\n\nOAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Oakland Athletics pitcher Joey Estes has a perfect game through six innings against the Seattle Mariners on Wednesday night. Estes has thrown 70 pitches and has struck out five. The 22-year-old right-hander is 1-1 with a 6.10 ERA in five starts this season. There have been 24 perfect games in major league history. The last one was at the Coliseum, when the Yankees' Domingo German shut down the A's on June 28, 2023. Estes, making his seventh career start, notched his first career win less than a month ago against the Mariners on the road. He was pitching in Triple-A as recently as May 4 after making two starts in the majors last year. Estes made his major league debut last September, also against Seattle.\n\nPro athletes understand gambling on their games is a non-negotiable no-no. Some learned the hard way\n\nBOSTON (AP) -- Professional athletes get told at the start of every season that if they gamble on their games, the consequences are severe. This spring they've gotten a more personal reminder, with both the NBA and Major League Baseball banning players for life. Padres infielder Tucupita Marcano was permanently banned this week for betting on games he was involved in. The NBA banished Raptors forward Jontay Porter in April. Other players say they should have known better. Marcano was the first active baseball player in a century banned for life for gambling. MLB said he placed hundreds of bets totaling more than $150,000 on baseball in 2022 and 2023.\n\nSkenes, Chapman throw gas at Ohtani and the Dodgers as the Pirates hold on for 10-6 victory\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) -- Paul Skenes struck out eight over five innings, Aroldis Chapman threw the fastest pitch in the majors this season and the Pittsburgh Pirates beat Shohei Ohtani and the Los Angeles Dodgers 10-6. Skenes, a rookie, improved to 3-0 despite giving up Ohtani's 15th home run of the season. Skenes and Chapman combined to throw 28 pitches that reached triple digits. A seventh-inning heater from Chapman to Los Angeles' Teoscar Hernandez reached 104 mph, the fastest pitch in the majors this year. Nick Gonzales tied a career-high with four RBI for Pittsburgh.\n\nCam Sutton is getting a second chance with the Steelers following domestic violence incident\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) -- Cameron Sutton is getting a second chance in the NFL with the Pittsburgh Steelers. The Steelers have signed the veteran defensive back to a one-year deal. The agreement comes more than two months after he was released by the Detroit Lions for his involvement in an alleged domestic violence incident in Florida. Sutton eventually surrendered to authorities and entered a pretrial diversion program after the charges were reduced from a felony to misdemeanor battery.\n\nWNBA rescinds second technical foul that was assessed to Angel Reese\n\nThe WNBA announced that it's rescinded the second technical foul on Chicago rookie Angel Reese that occurred with 2:31 left in the loss to the New York Liberty on Tuesday night. Reese was thrown out of the game after receiving two technical fouls following a brief interaction with official Charles Watson. The rookie forward appeared to say something to Watson and then quickly waved her hand. Head official Maj Forsberg said in a pool report that Reese's technical fouls were for \"disrespectfully addressing\" the official and then for \"waving her hand in dismissal.\" Reese finished with 13 points and 10 rebounds.\n\nInside NBC's Olympics bet on pop culture in Paris, with help from Snoop Dogg and Cardi B\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) -- NBC has partnered with several entertainers and non-Olympic athletes like Megan Thee Stallion, Dolly Parton and Peyton Manning to promote the Paris Games this summer. The network wants to build anticipation and entice more viewers after drawing lackluster ratings following the Games in Beijing and Tokyo. NBC wants attract more viewers by bringing Olympic stories to life through the most popular and diverse personalities. Some of the big names involved include Snoop Dogg, Cardi B, Kevin Hart, Lily Collins and Kelly Clarkson.\n\nNBA Finals Notebook: Porzingis a go, Kyrie and LeBron make nice, Hardaway Jr. throws shade at dad\n\nBOSTON (AP) -- Celtics 7-footer Kristaps Porzingis said he will be ready to \"just go out there and hoop\" for Game 1 of the NBA Finals on Thursday night after missing Boston's last 10 games with a strained left calf. Porzingis said he couldn't predict how it will be once he gets into a game for the first time since April 29. An offseason acquisition that helped solidify the Celtics frontcourt, Porzingis averaged 20 points, 7.2 rebounds and almost two blocks per game. But he was again dogged by injuries that limited him to 57 games. He left Game 4 of the first-round series against the Miami Heat and missed all of the next two rounds.\n\nCole to make at least 2 more minor league starts, on track for possible Yankees' return in June\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Gerrit Cole is likely to make at least two more minor league rehabilitation starts, putting the AL Young Award winner on track for a possible return to the New York Yankees' rotation in mid-to-late June. Cole said he felt fine a day after his first rehab outing, a 45-pitch effort over 3 1/3 scoreless innings for Double-A Somerset on Tuesday night. Manager Aaron Boone says \"at least a couple more\" and adds: \"I don't know how many. Is that two? Is it three?\" Cole and Boone weren't ready to commit to Cole's next outing.", "source": {"uri": "yakimaherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yakima Herald-Republic"}, "authors": [{"uri":

So, I was one of them. Just playing in the Finals.\"\n\nAnd he has the benefit of a coach who has been on this flight path before. After the Mavs final practice session before their Boston flight, Jason Kidd referenced his own NBA finals victory with the Mavs in 2011, playing alongside Dirk Nowitzki.\n\n\"Oh, a lot harder. A lot harder to coach,\" Kidd said of the difference between having the ball in his hands or the chess match he gets to orchestrate now. \"Oh it's fun, but it's harder. I gotta wear glasses now because you watch so much video.\"\n\n\"As a player I didn't have glasses. As a coach it is fun. It is a lot harder but you have to enjoy it because you're never guaranteed to be back here. We felt that we could do it again,\" Kidd said of the 2011 NBA Finals victory. \"But we never made it back.\"\n\nThe Mavs are bound for the NBA Finals after an unprecedented year: a mid-year change of ownership, a mid-year roster overhaul that brought them center Daniel Gafford and forward P.J. Washington. But when asked about the relatively few months they had to develop team chemistry, Doncic said he believes they've been together long enough to bring the NBA Finals trophy back to Dallas.\n\n\"I don't think people understand how hard it is to win games in this league, especially in this playoffs,\" he said when asked how he makes his 30+ point games look so easy. \"So, I think we earned to be here. We deserved it.\"\n\n\"You can say it's been really hard,\" he said of the Mavs trip through the NBA playoffs. \"But we deserve this and our chemistry is great and we stick together.\"\n\nSticking together for an NBA dream that officially takes flight today.", "source": {"uri": "wfaa.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WFAA-TV Channel 8"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kidd", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jason Kidd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American English"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spanish language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirk_Nowitzki", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dirk Nowitzki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Gafford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Gafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://media.wfaa.com/assets/WFAA/images/c1379405-11e9-47bd-84dc-820bd63b5189/20240604T202920/c1379405-11e9-47bd-84dc-820bd63b5189_1140x641.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 108, "relevance": 1}

It is the premier stage in men's basketball, a cornucopia of drama, flair, and awe-inspiring play from some of the greatest athletes on the planet. The Finals are a fixture in June expressly because of its cultural capital and capacity to take our breath away when we least expect it.\n\nAs the 2024 NBA Finals get underway later this week, we thought it'd be fair to look back upon the encyclopedic history of the league's championship round. Over the years, we've seen so many incredible entries to Finals lore. From two tentpole stars putting the NBA on the map in the 1980s and an icon stamping his way through the 1990s to the \"Chosen One\" living up to the hype in the best possible way against one of the greatest teams ever assembled, there is no real shortage of classic Finals battle.\n\nHere is For The Win's ranking of the greatest NBA Finals series of all time (so far).\n\n14 2005: San Antonio Spurs defeat Detroit Pistons in 7 games\n\nA series defined by double-digit blowouts to start turned into an instant classic by Game 5. In a back-and-forth affair, Robert Horry, a.k.a. \"Big Shot Bob,\" nailed the ice-cold, game-winning three in overtime.\n\nFrom there, the Spurs outlasted reigning champion Detroit to earn the third title of the Tim Duncan era in Game 7.\n\n13 2011: Dallas Mavericks defeat Miami Heat in 6 games\n\nBehold! Dirk Nowitzki's legacy series!\n\nIn what would turn out to be his last NBA Finals, the prolific sharpshooting German avenged a heartbreaking loss to the Heat half a decade earlier by taking down the NBA's first true \"superteam.\" Despite Miami having LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh, Dallas' continuity, led by Nowitzki, was enough for the Mavericks to pull off the (somewhat) shocking upset and win the first title in franchise history.\n\nThis series' profile is helped by the fact that only one game finished with a final double-digit deficit, along with an iconic Mavericks comeback in Game 2:\n\n12 1994: Houston Rockets defeat New York Knicks in 7 games\n\nThe first Finals in a little while without Michael Jordan featured two of the best big men of their generation: Hakeem Olajuwon and Patrick Ewing. What a treat it was. A machine-like Olajuwon comfortably won Finals MVP after leading Houston on a comeback from 3-2, but Ewing's efforts (especially 30 blocks in seven games!) were almost just as remarkable.\n\n11 1977: Portland Trail Blazers defeat Philadelphia 76ers in 6 games\n\nBill Walton's crowning achievement as a player was all about how dynamic he was through adversity. The big man averaged nearly 20 points and 20 rebounds a game against Philadelphia and chipped in over five assists per outing thanks to his sublime playmaking chops. Julius Erving never stood a chance as Portland became the second NBA team ever to overcome a 2-0 series deficit and win the Finals.\n\n10 1997: Chicago Bulls defeat Utah Jazz in 6 games\n\nThe first of two epic Finals tilts between the Bulls and Jazz was, unsurprisingly, a Michael Jordan showcase. League MVP Karl Malone was ultimately eclipsed by Jordan's sheer brilliance in the Bulls' triumph, who added a game-winning buzzer-beater and the \"Flu Game\" to his iconic playoff catalog during the series.\n\n9 1980: Los Angeles Lakers defeat Philadelphia 76ers in 6 games\n\nThen-rookie Magic Johnson cemented his place as the new face of the NBA with this championship triumph. Even though the legendary Julius Erving played for the other team, it was Johnson who was the best player in the series. The point guard averaged nearly a 20-point triple-double in six games. Johnson's heroics in a clinching Game 6 -- where he started at center for an injured Kareem Abdul-Jabbar -- remains one of the more famous moments in league history.\n\n8 1988: Los Angeles Lakers defeat Detroit Pistons in 7 games\n\nPat Riley promised a repeat the summer prior and his Lakers delivered ... by the skin of their teeth. A see-saw series was defined by James Worthy's scoring touch and the uncanny resolve of Isiah Thomas, who scored 43 points in a gutsy Game 6 (including 25 in the third quarter) to keep Detroit's season alive despite badly twisting his ankle. The Lakers just barely outlasted the Pistons in Game 7, putting a bow on their run in the 1980s with a fifth championship in nine seasons.\n\n7 1970: New York Knicks defeat Los Angeles Lakers in 7 games\n\nOver five decades later, the Knicks' first championship remains the most important moment in franchise history. Not only did the Knicks manage to upend the stacked Lakers (Jerry West, Wilt Chamberlain, and Elgin Baylor on one team!), but they also did it on the strength of Willis Reed's resolve. Reed tore a thigh muscle in Game 5 and somehow returned in Game 7. Though Reed was clearly a shell of himself (he made and took just two shots), his presence galvanized the Knicks enough to pull off the win.\n\nHis entrance to Game 7 alone should still give you chills:\n\n6 1969: Boston Celtics defeat Los Angeles Lakers in 7 games\n\nThe Lakers and Celtics met in the Finals six times during the 1960s. The finale to this era of the Boston-Los Angeles rivalry was easily the most notable. Why? Because, for once, the Lakers entered the series as massive favorites thanks to the presence of Jerry West, Elgin Baylor, and Wilt Chamberlain. Meanwhile, the Celtics finished in fourth place in their own division and few even saw them returning to the Finals. Boston ultimately upset Los Angeles on the road in Game 7, and West remains the only player ever to win Finals MVP despite being part of the losing team.\n\n5 1993: Chicago Bulls defeat Phoenix Suns in 6 games\n\nFew series put one of Michael Jordan's NBA relationships under the microscope quite like this series. After close friend Charles Barkley won the league MVP with Phoenix, Jordan took it upon himself to show up the player he thought unnecessarily captured the award over him. What ensued was a classic shootout between two generational stars. Jordan was ultimately that much better than Barkley, averaging over 41 points per game in a Bulls' series victory that felt it like teetered in the balance every night against a formidable Suns squad.\n\nIt's fitting that John Paxson, of all people, capped the win in Game 6:\n\n4 1984: Boston Celtics defeat Los Angeles Lakers in 7 games\n\nAfter a few years of simmering hype, Magic Johnson's Lakers finally faced Larry Bird's Celtics in the Finals in 1984. And hoo boy, was it an emotional doozy. Boston won two classic overtime games in the early stages of the series before overcoming Los Angeles in an absolutely epic Game 7. What a terrific first episode in the most important NBA rivalry of the modern era.\n\n3 2013: Miami Heat defeat San Antonio Spurs in 7 games\n\nThe 2013 Finals featured a clash of team-building philosophies. The Heat were a superteam built around the greatest free agency haul in NBA history with LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh. The Spurs were the emblem of consistent homegrown dominance, having successfully retooled a core around an aging Tim Duncan with the rise of a young Kawhi Leonard.\n\nWhile San Antonio proved overwhelming at times, a key Bosh rebound led to Ray Allen saving the Heat's season in Game 6. Miami eventually outlasted San Antonio in this all-out war of attrition that won't soon be forgotten.\n\n2 1998: Chicago Bulls defeat Utah Jazz in 6 games\n\nThe arguable GOAT had one last trick in his bag. In a series that the Jazz really should've won considering a number of factors -- Bulls' fatigue, a disastrous Scottie Pippen back injury -- Jordan did everything in his power to lift Chicago up off the mat. His final sequence in Game 6, featuring a driving layup, a steal off Karl Malone in the post, and the game-winning shot, is arguably the finest of his illustrious career.\n\nIt was a perfect way to cap off a run of six titles in eight seasons.\n\n1 2016: Cleveland Cavaliers defeat Golden State Warriors in 7 games\n\nTo date, this is the only 3-1 comeback in Finals history. Considering the caliber of the competition, it might be the greatest comeback in American sports history. Period. The 2016 Warriors broke the regular season record for wins with 73. They were an unmitigated juggernaut with superstars and depth galore. Yet, Draymond Green's Game 5 suspension managed to flip this series on its head. Led by a sublime LeBron James and timely shotmaking from Kyrie Irving, the Cavaliers stormed back from the 3-1 deficit, eventually overcoming the Warriors on the road in a marvelous Game 7.\n\nOh, yeah, this was also the Cavaliers' first title ever. Ho hum:\n\nAnyone who believes James is the NBA's GOAT will likely forever point to this series and this comeback, first and foremost.", "source": {"uri": "ftw.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news",

Boston's Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are the Celtics' most tenured and scrutinized stars and see it as a chance at redemption after falling short in the Finals just two seasons ago and then failing to return last year. Dallas' Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving see it as their first opportunity to make good on a partnership that began late last season after Irving was traded from Brooklyn following a tumultuous run of two-plus seasons with the Nets.\n\nThe NBA Finals were too late for Dallas' Luka Doncic to watch as a kid. Now, he's in them\n\nBOSTON (AP) -- Luka Doncic didn't stay up all night to watch NBA Finals games as a kid. They usually started at something like 3 a.m. in his native Slovenia. He had school to get to a few hours later. He'd wake up and find out who won. Make no mistake, though: Doncic was paying attention. The 25-year-old makes his NBA Finals debut for the Dallas Mavericks when they take on the Boston Celtics in Game 1 of this year's title series on Thursday night. He could become the first player to win a scoring title and a championship in the same season since Shaquille O'Neal in 2000.\n\nPro athletes understand gambling on their games is a non-negotiable no-no. Some learned the hard way\n\nBOSTON (AP) -- Professional athletes get told at the start of every season that if they gamble on their games, the consequences are severe. This spring they've gotten a more personal reminder, with both the NBA and Major League Baseball banning players for life. Padres infielder Tucupita Marcano was permanently banned this week for betting on games he was involved in. The NBA banished Raptors forward Jontay Porter in April. Other players say they should have known better. Marcano was the first active baseball player in a century banned for life for gambling. MLB said he placed hundreds of bets totaling more than $150,000 on baseball in 2022 and 2023.\n\nCam Sutton is getting a second chance with the Steelers following domestic violence incident\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) -- Cameron Sutton is getting a second chance in the NFL with the Pittsburgh Steelers. The Steelers have signed the veteran defensive back to a one-year deal. The agreement comes more than two months after he was released by the Detroit Lions for his involvement in an alleged domestic violence incident in Florida. Sutton eventually surrendered to authorities and entered a pretrial diversion program after the charges were reduced from a felony to misdemeanor battery.\n\nWNBA rescinds second technical foul that was assessed to Angel Reese\n\nThe WNBA announced that it's rescinded the second technical foul on Chicago rookie Angel Reese that occurred with 2:31 left in the loss to the New York Liberty on Tuesday night. Reese was thrown out of the game after receiving two technical fouls following a brief interaction with official Charles Watson. The rookie forward appeared to say something to Watson and then quickly waved her hand. Head official Maj Forsberg said in a pool report that Reese's technical fouls were for \"disrespectfully addressing\" the official and then for \"waving her hand in dismissal.\" Reese finished with 13 points and 10 rebounds.\n\nInside NBC's Olympics bet on pop culture in Paris, with help from Snoop Dogg and Cardi B\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) -- NBC has partnered with several entertainers and non-Olympic athletes like Megan Thee Stallion, Dolly Parton and Peyton Manning to promote the Paris Games this summer. The network wants to build anticipation and entice more viewers after drawing lackluster ratings following the Games in Beijing and Tokyo. NBC wants attract more viewers by bringing Olympic stories to life through the most popular and diverse personalities. Some of the big names involved include Snoop Dogg, Cardi B, Kevin Hart, Lily Collins and Kelly Clarkson.\n\nCole to make at least 2 more minor league starts, on track for possible Yankees' return in June\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Gerrit Cole is likely to make at least two more minor league rehabilitation starts, putting the AL Young Award winner on track for a possible return to the New York Yankees' rotation in mid-to-late June. Cole said he felt fine a day after his first rehab outing, a 45-pitch effort over 3 1/3 scoreless innings for Double-A Somerset on Tuesday night. Manager Aaron Boone says \"at least a couple more\" and adds: \"I don't know how many. Is that two? Is it three?\" Cole and Boone weren't ready to commit to Cole's next outing.\n\nEkblad, Reinhart, Draisaitl and Bennett were drafted together. They'll now play for the Cup together\n\nFORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- This seems so fitting. It was 10 years ago this month when Aaron Ekblad, Sam Reinhart, Leon Draisaitl and Sam Bennett were clearly the top four players entering the 2014 NHL Draft, though nobody knew what the order of their selection was going to be. They all went through the draft process together. Posed for photos together, some in Philadelphia Phillies jerseys -- the draft was in Philly that year -- and some in suits. They even dined together a few times. And now, they're going to the Stanley Cup Final together.\n\nSchauffele now a major champion at Memorial and facing a big stretch of golf\n\nDUBLIN, Ohio (AP) -- Xander Schauffele was able to take a few weeks off after claiming his first major at the PGA Championship. He came to realize he's still the same person and his life hasn't changed. Now he returns to the Memorial to face a tough stretch of golf. The Memorial is a signature event with a top field and big purse. Then it's off to the U.S. Open at Pinehurst No. 2 and then another signature event at the Travelers Championship. Tournament host Jack Nicklaus isn't thrilled with a new date for the Memorial that pushes it right up against a major.\n\nAnalysis: Novak Djokovic's bad knee follows Rafael Nadal's injuries and Roger Federer's retirement\n\nPARIS (AP) -- It would be foolish to count Novak Djokovic out of any match, no matter how dire the circumstances or how big the deficit. He's shown that, over and over again, as recently as his last two wins at the French Open. It also would be a mistake to write off Djokovic after a torn meniscus in his right knee forced him to withdraw from the clay-court tournament where he was the defending champion and was supposed to play in the quarterfinals on Wednesday. And it would not make much sense at all to begin pondering whether this could presage the real and true end of the Big Three era.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news",

In this NBA edition, David Aldridge and Marcus Thompson II discuss the NBA Finals and whether the Dallas Mavericks star duo can pull off the upset that many have started to expect.\n\nAldridge: So, we're here to discuss whether these finals will provide a referendum on whether Luka Don\u010di\u0107 will be crowned the best player in the world if the Dallas Mavericks beat the Boston Celtics. And, sure, I get the supposed value in this kind of \"debate,\" even if I protest my participation in it. These finals will be intriguing.\n\nThompson: Fine, I'll say it. If Luka wins the championship this year HE IS THE GREATEST PLAYER OF ALL TIME. Yes, I am yelling.\n\nForget legacies. Dallas-Boston is full of storylines. Any of Luka, Kyrie Irving, Jayson Tatum or Jaylen Brown could be the finals MVP. Conceivably, so could Jrue Holiday or Derrick White or, if he dominates the paint, Dereck Lively II. This is one of the most fascinating championship series in recent memory. I can't wait to see what the adjustments are to whatever happens Thursday in Game 1.\n\nDo we see Kyrie guarding Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is at some point? Or Jrue on Lively? How does Boston get Luka in screen-and-roll actions defensively, and how does Dallas do the same to KP? Who goes zone first, and for how long? If Boston wins, does Joe Mazzulla finally get some love in Beantown? If Dallas wins, does Mark Cuban say \"psyche\" and try to undo the deal he made with the Adelson family? Boston's been the best team in the league all season; Dallas has been the hottest team in the league since March. I'm excited about this one.\n\nThompson: Oh, we're doing the adult conversation thing. My bad.\n\nAldridge: I am just loath to assign lasting value to any one series, even a championship series. There's this whole referendum structure in Boston (partly because it's Boston, and the standard every season is championship or bust) about how vital it is for Tatum and Brown to break through and finally win a chip with the Celtics being so good in the last few seasons. But even though this is Boston's second finals in three seasons, the team that lost 4-2 to Golden State is completely different from this one, even though Tatum and Brown were the main cogs in that machine, too.\n\nTo say that Tatum and Brown need to win it this year to somehow validate their status as superstars feels forced to me. I'm old enough to remember when smart people in our business wrote that Michael Jordan, seven years into his Hall of Fame career, didn't make his teammates better because he hadn't yet won a ring.\n\nThompson: But in the scope of legacy, and adhering to the modern discourse of GOAT herding, this is a big series for Tatum. Not because it's a referendum on his greatness. But because he'd be flirting with joining the list of greats who never won it all. He's been to five conference finals. This is his second trip to the big dance. He's spent his preadolescent basketball years on the NBA's biggest stages. Usually, the best breakthrough eventually. He's gone toe to toe with some absolute legends -- LeBron James, Jimmy Butler, Stephen Curry -- and there is no shame in losing to them. Based on his talent and his experience, he is worthy of being a champion. But when you get this many cracks, with this many versions of teams, you start running the risk of missing your moment. And it's not getting easier with this new generation of talent.\n\nI remember as a teenager how my beloved Jordan would get crushed for not winning it all. I think people who weren't around didn't understand how much of a thing it was until the Bulls finally won in 1991. This will become a thing if Tatum doesn't win. It will be all about how he can't win the big one. Tatum has been groomed to be a king. It's time for him to grab his crown. Because if Don\u010di\u0107 doesn't take it now, doesn't it feel inevitable he will soon?\n\nAldridge: Hmm ... maybe? The modern NBA is littered with \"we're inevitable\" teams: the Cavs of the early 1990s, the Chris Webber/Vlade Divac Kings, Dwight Howard's Magic, OKC in 2011 and on and on. Injuries (Derrick Rose's knee; Penny Hardaway's back; John Wall's Achilles) take rising franchises out in a nanosecond. Coaches lose their locker room; superstars lose their patience. And, the West remains a minefield.\n\nAssuming a return to form for Ja Morant, Memphis will be back in the saddle next season to challenge the Mavs, Wolves, Thunder and Suns. A potential conference-shifting trade is always in the air. We had no idea at this time last season that Damian Lillard would wind up in Milwaukee rather than Miami. And the best player on Earth is still in Denver, and he's gonna have a horse-sized chip on his shoulder again next season.\n\nThompson: I agree Nikola Joki\u0107 is still the best in the league. This idea of the best player being this fluid, shifting phenomenon is a bit ridiculous, especially considering the wealth of factors that decide these championships. Now as much as ever, the collection of best players are all capable of winning based on health, quality of supporting cast and even matchups. I am not ready to say Joki\u0107 has relinquished the throne after one postseason ouster. I know a lot of people will be ready to anoint Luka if Dallas wins, and I see it.\n\nBut whoever wins this year will be the sixth superstar in as many years to win it all: Kawhi Leonard, LeBron James, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Steph Curry, Joki\u0107 and either Luka or Tatum. And a seventh could win it in 2025. It's impossible in this landscape to say winning the championship makes a player the BEST IN THE LEAGUE. But if that doesn't, then what does? Are we nearing the end of ringzzzzz culture?\n\nAldridge: Don't get me wrong -- there is a stake in who wins every year. I mean, this is why we have an 82-game regular season and two months of playoffs, right - to find out who wins? These are among the most competitive people on the planet. I just don't think it should be the only measure of greatness.\n\nI'm old now. But Charles Barkley was a great basketball player. John Stockton was great. Reggie Miller was great. Webber was great. And James Harden, Russell Westbrook and Paul George have had great careers that are not yet over. But none of them has won a single NBA title. Because it's f -- ing hard to get one. Either Luka or Tatum will not get one this year. But, damn, they're both still great players.\n\nThompson: That to me is the interesting part about this current era where there is no dynasty to gobble up all the championships. Unlike the Barkleys, Stocktons and Millers of the world, who just happened to come along when the GOAT was doing his thing, there is a real chance for this next generation to grab a chip and the instant credibility that comes with it. And, hopefully, this forces us to rethink these conversations, or at least think about how we measure greatness. If it's not just about championships -- because none of them may end up with a bounty of rings like Kobe, LeBron and Steph -- then it becomes a virtual Royal Rumble of future legends.\n\nIt's akin to the '70s, before Magic and Bird changed the league. It was a roll of the dice who would win. You had Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's Bucks and Willis Reed's Knicks and Jerry West finally breaking through with Wilt Chamberlain. Rick Barry's Warriors won a title. So did Bill Walton's Blazers. Even your Bullets won a chip with Elvin Hayes and Wes Unseld and Bob Dandridge. It was a free-for-all. And you know what we had to do before anointing someone as the GOAT? Wait. Watch how it all played out. Let careers run their course.\n\nI'm saying we like I was there. I was not. So maybe they were debating about what knocking off Alvan Adams and Paul Westphal's Suns in the finals did for Dave Cowen's legacy -- redeeming himself from losing to the Knicks in his MVP year the season before. Or maybe he was considered a fraud because Jo Jo White won the finals MVP. You know how the media can be.\n\nAldridge: It's funny to me that people are now saying they love this post-Warriors era with no dominant team. In that most democratic era you mentioned, in the '70s, nooooobody watched! The finals games were on tape delay, at 11:30 p.m. in the East! It took Magic and Bird coming in to save the league.\n\nThompson: And now we watch them delayed on League Pass. Time is a flat circle.\n\nAldridge: Anyway, we gotta pick a winner for Boston-Dallas. I'm going with the Celtics in six games, and here's why:\n\nThe Mavs have become an elite defense since the trade deadline; they're No. 1 in defensive rating since early March. But they've become great at defending the very thing that is the least important thing for the Celtics offense: paint points. The Cs lead, and by a lot, in percentage of their postseason shots that are 3s (47.4 percent), just as they led that category during the regular season. (It should be noted: Dallas was second in the league in that category in the regular season and the playoffs.)\n\nBoston is better at hunting and making 3s than anybody in recent memory, and that includes Harden's Rockets and the Splash Brothers' Warriors. Even those teams had someone against whom you could play drop coverage (Clint Capela/Andrew Bogut/Kevon Looney).\n\nWho do you slough off of when you play Boston? Yeah, Brown is usually the first name on everyone's lips, but he's shooting 37 from beyond the arc so far this postseason. Holiday is shooting almost 40 percent from deep; White is shooting better than 40. OK, Al Horford is only a 34 percent 3-point shooter in the playoffs ... but, just in time, here comes Porzi\u0146\u0123is, who hit almost 38 percent of his 3s in the regular season, back on the floor, after suffering a calf injury in the first round against Miami.\n\nDaniel Gafford and Lively are true warriors at the rim, but KP doesn't live there. He sets up at the elbows, is 7 foot 3 and can still get off his shot, even over the 7-1 Lively or the 6-10 Gafford. And if he drifts out to the line, even Lively and/or Gafford can't recover that much.\n\nTatum is shooting just 29 percent behind the arc in the playoffs. Also, Boston is 14-2 so far in the playoffs. At any rate, do you want to build a defense designed to beat the Celtics four times in seven games on the strategy of conceding uncontested looks from deep to Tatum?\n\nAnd, entering the finals, Boston has a net rating of 11.6. Right now, that is tied, with the 2016-17 Dubs, for the third-best single-season net rating in NBA history, per StatMuse. Eight of the previous 10 teams with the biggest single-season net ratings won the title.\n\nSo, while I think the Mavs can take a couple of games in this series on the strength of their significant Luka/Kyrie-centric firepower, I just don't think Dallas can turn off Boston's water from deep often enough to win this thing.\n\nThompson: Boston is 61-9 this season when they make at least 15 3s, which they've done in 72.9 percent of their games. That includes all seven playoff games the Celtics have won when making 15 or more from deep -- and won those games by an average of 16.9 points. In their two losses this postseason, they made 12 and eight 3-pointers. When the Celtics are making 3s, they've been unbeatable. And 15 isn't some crazy number for them to hit. If they do, they very likely will win that game comfortably.\n\nSo either Dallas just cooks the Celtics, which I just don't see happening more than a game (Boston is good for allowing one), or this is going to come down to the Mavericks keeping the game close enough for Luka and Kyrie to work some magic. It's quite the ace in the hole, but I just love Boston's defensive versatility. The postseason is about matchups and the Celtics seem to have the bodies and types to throw at Dallas' stars.\n\nHoliday and White are excellent point-of-attack defenders who are not deterred by buckets. They navigate screens well and are incredibly smart defenders who can adjust on the fly. Then you have Tatum and Brown, the ideal long and athletic wings. Then you have a 7-2 rim protector in Porzi\u0146\u0123is. And even without him, they've got Horford, who can still play some defense.\n\nBoston in close games can turn it up defensively. Their defensive rating in the clutch this postseason is 85.4 per 100 possessions. That's wild. Second was Oklahoma City at 102.2. Boston did that against inferior offenses even when fully stocked, but the Celtics have a switch where they can suffocate. During the regular season, their clutch defensive rating was 105, tied for sixth. Dallas has been tremendous defensively, too. But not so much in the clutch: 116.9 in nine postseason clutch games. You don't have to be lights out when you can score every time down. But Boston is just as explosive offensively in a different way.\n\nI trust the Celtics slightly more to get the big stops. Celtics in six. It's their time. The greatness of Luka and Kyrie and the sheer terror they provoke keeps me from picking Boston in five.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"},

The league has released the roster of officials for the championship series, with only a few days remaining until the start of this season's playoffs. The list includes several well-known personalities, like Tony Brothers and veteran Scott Foster.\n\nThe list also includes other officials with whom the public is familiar, such as Bill Kennedy and Marc Davis. The NBA PR account posted the whole list of officials on social media, but no list detailing which officials will officiate which games were provided.\n\nAdditionally, the release stated that Ben Taylor and Tyler Ford will be available to serve as backup NBA Finals referees if necessary. It's also crucial to remember that no assignments have been provided game by game.\n\nConsidering that, the officials for Game 1 will likely be announced early on Thursday before play begins at 5:30 Pacific Time (8:30 Eastern).\n\nNBA Finals 2024 Is All Set to Begin on June 7\n\nNow that the NBA Finals referee roster has been revealed let's examine the entire finals schedule. As previously stated, Game 1 will begin on Thursday at 5:30 PM Pacific Time (8:30 PM Eastern) at Boston's TD Garden. Teams will get two days off between games one and two of the finals, compared to just one day off during the early rounds of the playoffs for recovery.\n\nOn Sunday, June 9, the Mavericks and Celtics will play Game 2 in Boston's TD Garden. The game starts at 5:00 PM Pacific Time (8:00 PM Eastern), which is a little early.\n\nTherefore, Game 3 of the series will be played at the American Airlines Center in Dallas on Wednesday, June 12, at 5:30 PM Pacific Time (8:30 PM Eastern). After a one-day break, NBA Finals Game 4 will be played on Friday, June 14, with a tip-off time of 5:30 PM Pacific (8:30 PM Eastern).\n\nShould a Game 5 be necessary, the series will return to Boston for a Game 5 on June 17 at 5:30 PM Pacific (8:30 PM Eastern). Similarly, the series will return to Dallas for a Game 6 on June 20 at 5:30 PM Pacific/8:30 PM Eastern. Lastly, Boston will host the series decider on June 23 at 5:00 PM Pacific (8:00 PM Eastern) if the series requires seven games.\n\nAlso Read: Kristaps Porzingis Injury Update: Will the Boston Celtics Have Their Forward for NBA Finals Game 1?", "source": {"uri": "totalprosports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Total Pro Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jatin_gupta@totalprosports.com", "name": "Jatin Gupta", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Brothers", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tony Brothers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Kennedy_(referee)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bill Kennedy (referee)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ford Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Airlines Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 24}], "image": "https://www.totalprosports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MixCollage-05-Jun-2024-10-38-AM-4196.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-07", "textStart": 1038, "textEnd": 1044}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-09", "textStart": 1426, "textEnd": 1432}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-12", "textStart": 1688, "textEnd": 1695}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-14", "textStart": 1807, "textEnd": 1814}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-17", "textStart": 1954, "textEnd": 1961}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 2060, "textEnd": 2067}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-23", "textStart": 2151, "textEnd": 2158}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 107, "relevance": 1}

Still, off nights happen from time to time.\n\nWhen teams are mere wins away from basketball immortality, the moment can get the best of them, resulting in a lopsided decision. While it hasn't happened often, a few games in the Finals have had historically ugly outcomes.\n\nWhat is the biggest blowout in the history of the NBA Finals? While a handful of teams have been run out of the gym, one blowout from 1998 stands out among the rest.\n\nHere is a list of the most lopsided games in NBA Finals history.\n\nMORE: NBA Finals Preview: Will Luka Doncic or Jayson Tatum win first championship in 2024?\n\nThe largest margin of victory in an NBA Finals game is 42. In Game 3 of the 1998 NBA Finals, Michael Jordan and the Bulls put forth a historically dominant display, holding the Jazz to 54 points. Chicago would win the series in six games.\n\nThere have only been 17 NBA Finals games decided by 30-plus points. Here are the five biggest blowouts.\n\nUtah's loss is interesting in that it led for the majority of the first quarter before Chicago dominated the final 38 minutes of game time. The Jazz were held to just 23 points in the second half and shot 30.0 percent from the field for the game.\n\nJordan led all scorers with 24 points, and Toni Kukoc chipped in 16. Add 10 points apiece from Scottie Pippen and Scott Burell, and the quartet outscored the Jazz.\n\nKarl Malone was Utah's only double-figure scorer with 22 points on 8-for-11 shooting.

The trash talk quality is strong. Luka Doncic's passionate outburst after his game-winning 3 in Game 2 of the Western Conference finals is yet another example of players' mouths matching their performances.\n\nHere is some of the best trash talk from the NBA postseason so far.\n\nDoncic is no stranger to trash talk in the biggest moments, most notably when he took a shot at Phoenix Suns guard Devin Booker before rallying the Dallas Mavericks to a series win over the Suns in 2022. This season, Doncic led the Mavericks to a Finals appearance with some fireworks along the way.\n\nIn Game 2 of the Western Conference finals, the Mavs trailed late and turned to Doncic to deliver the game winner on the road. Their star guard delivered, shaking off Gobert to set up a go-ahead 3-pointer.\n\nAfter the shot, Doncic had plenty of words for Gobert. He disputed the efforts of potential lip-readers to determine their contents, saying he was speaking in his native Slovenian -- but regardless of what was said, Gobert heard them.\n\nTempers flared in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference finals between Boston Celtics guard Jaylen Brown and Myles Turner of the Indiana Pacers. The two exchanged shoves after a Turner foul on Celtics guard Derrick White.\n\nBoston would go on to pull out the 105-102 victory to complete Boston's sweep of the Pacers. After the game, the Eastern Conference finals MVP downplayed the incident -- theorizing that Turner wanted to assert himself with his family watching. The irony of the \"good kid\" quip? Turner, 28, is seven months older than Brown.\n\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves were in torrid form in the early playoff rounds, advancing to the Western Conference finals for the first time since the 2003-04 season. At the center of it all was Edwards, who made a statement when he averaged 31 points per game in Minnesota's opening-round sweep of the Suns.\n\nEdwards did more than just excel on the court. The Wolves' young star provided a lightning rod of energy for his team, most notably through his passionate trash talk. Be it some words for Suns forward Kevin Durant after a big bucket, hitting the DX celebration against the Suns in Game 3, or his goodbye wave to the Denver Nuggets crowd following a Game 7 win in the semifinals, Edwards brought plenty of competitive fire to Minnesota's playoff run.\n\nThe New York Knicks and Indiana Pacers delivered another classic series to go with a number of memorable clashes in the past. The Pacers eventually came out on top, powered by a historic shooting performance at Madison Square Garden in the series' decisive game. Haliburton scored a team-high 26 points in the win.\n\nAfter the game, he made sure to remind Knicks fans of an iconic moment in the rivalry's prior playoff history. Haliburton arrived at the postgame news conference donning a sweatshirt featuring Pacers legend Reggie Miller and the iconic \"choke\" gesture he made after scoring eight points in 8.9 seconds to rally Indiana to a Game 5 win at the Garden in 1994.\n\nA staple of Pacers-Knicks playoff feuds, Miller is no stranger to the lights of Madison Square Garden. And New York fans are plenty familiar with the star-guard-turned-broadcaster as well.\n\nUnsurprisingly, it was something of an awkward reunion when Miller put on the headset at the Garden to call the most recent edition of the rivalry. The Knicks would take Games 1 and 2 at home, and made sure Miller knew all about it following the final whistle at Game 2's conclusion. And the New York faithful got some help in getting their message across from the team's do-it-all guard, Josh Hart.\n\nMavericks forward PJ Washington had a busy Game 3. He brought the Dallas home crowd to its feet by staring down the LA Clippers' bench after a skirmish at the center of the court, and was ejected later on after exchanging shoves with Russell Westbrook.\n\nNeedless to say, Paul George remembered that pose in the ensuing Game 4, recreating the arms-crossed stance after cashing a 3 over Washington. George and the Clippers would stave off a furious Mavericks comeback to win the game, but Washington & Co. would have the last laugh with a six-game series victory.\n\nTwo first-round series this postseason were rematches of last year's conference finals, with the Los Angeles Lakers squaring off against the Nuggets and the Miami Heat looking to once again take down the Celtics.\n\nAfter the Celtics cruised to a Game 1 victory, the Heat responded with a Game 2 upset win in Boston. Butler -- out for the series because of injury -- took to Instagram to reference a quote from the Celtics' Brown in last year's series after Boston staved off a sweep in Game 4.\n\nThe Celtics would take the 2023 conference finals to a decisive seventh game before a 19-point Miami win sealed their fate. The 2024 Heat weren't able to replicate that success, however, as Boston won each of the next three games to take the series in five.", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Miami and Denver are the ninth and 19th most populous metropolitan areas.\n\nThis year's series is 6% higher than the previous record of $3,899 seen in 2019, the last NBA Finals before the COVID-19 pandemic. That year, the average price for the series featuring the Toronto Raptors and the Golden State Warriors was $3,899.\n\nLike this year, that series featured several of the NBA's biggest stars, including Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, and Kawhi Leonard.\n\nThe NBA Finals is one of the top events on North American sports fans' bucket lists.\n\nA survey conducted in May by Casino.org, an online guide to casinos and gambling, asked 3,000 sports fans which sporting events they would most like to see in person. The NBA Finals ranked third, behind the NFL's Super Bowl and Major League Baseball's World Series.\n\nIf you do want to go to a game in this year's NBA Finals, it is better to go earlier.

Plus Nine Other NBA Finals Questions Burning a Hole in Our Brains", "body": "Nobody would have predicted Mavericks-Celtics, but now that we're here, let's examine some of the big questions surrounding this very intriguing series.\n\nAt most, there's only seven games left in the NBA season. But rather than the scarcity breeding clarity, we arrive at the end of the road with lots of questions that still need answering. To be sure, this is one of the most compelling NBA Finals in recent memory -- the Celtics skated through the season as the league's consensus best team, while the Mavericks flirted with the play-in tournament, and yet it doesn't look like a total mismatch! But several narratives still need tying up.\n\nBefore the ball is tipped on Thursday night, we've identified five pressing questions for each team, centered around a simple concept: What happens if they win?\n\nDo we finally have to take Jayson Tatum seriously?\n\nEveryone can agree that Tatum is very good. No one can agree on just how good he is, though. Depending on who you ask, he's one of the five best players in the NBA, a brilliant scorer who needs to be paired with a true alpha, or an overrated fraud that had the easiest path to the Finals ever.\n\nThe easiest way to cultivate agreement is to win -- it wasn't that long ago that people doubted LeBron's bona fides, after all -- and Tatum is still somehow just 26 years old. Winning tends to beget more winning, so a Larry O'Brien could not only get the haters to zip it, but also put him on course to collect a few more before he hits his thirties.

It served as a glaring reminder of what's at stake in the Finals and helped the games stand out from other playoff matchups.\n\nWhy exactly did the decals go away? And does the NBA do anything special with its courts in the Finals anymore?\n\nHere's what to know ahead of the 2024 NBA Finals between the Boston Celtics and Dallas Mavericks.\n\nThe NBA created individual logos for the Finals each year starting in 1986. The original template was in place for 10 years before the league updated the design in 1996. There have been several interactions since, and the NBA brought back a version of the iconic, scripted Finals font in 2022.\n\nAs for decals, the 1989 Finals between the Detroit Pistons and Los Angeles Lakers was the first to feature an on-court decals displaying that year's Finals logo. The NBA kept that practice in place through 2004 before making a major switch.\n\nThe 2005 NBA Finals between the San Antonio Spurs and Detroit Pistons were the first to feature giant Larry O'Brien Trophy decals at halfcourt.\n\nThe league brought the decals back for the next four Finals, but they were last used in 2009 when the Lakers defeated the Orlando Magic.\n\nThe NBA returned to smaller on-court decals of the Finals logo from 2010 to 2014.\n\nCourt changes have mostly disappeared since. The Cavaliers incorporated the trophy with two on-court decals during the 2017 NBA Finals. The 2020 NBA Finals also had a special halfcourt logo in the Orlando bubble when the Lakers beat the Miami Heat.\n\nThere were no decals of any kind during the 2015, 2016, 2018, 2019, 2021, 2022 and 2023 NBA Finals, except for those superimposed for TV viewers.\n\nPlayer safety was the biggest factor when it came to removing on-court decals.\n\nThe NBA followed in the footsteps of the NCAA, which decided to remove decals and stickers from its courts in 2012 and mandated that all courts be \"of a consistent surface.\"\n\n\"There were a lot of considerations taken into account in making this decision, including player safety,\" an NBA spokesman told The Cauldron in 2014. \"We decided to remove the playoffs logo from the court for a variety of reasons, including cleaning up the playing surface.\"\n\nThe league brought halfcourt trophy logos back in 2023-24, but it wasn't for the NBA Finals.\n\nThe inaugural NBA In-Season Tournament featured unique courts for all 30 teams. The courts all had various colors, a colorful stripe down the middle from baseline to baseline and a decal of the NBA Cup at halfcourt.\n\nThe league also had a special blue-and-red court for the In-Season Tournament semifinals and championship game, all of which were held in Las Vegas.\n\nThe league did not, however, change its stance on courts for the NBA Finals, which tip-off Thursday night at TD Garden in Boston.", "source": {"uri": "nbcchicago.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Chicago"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_O'Brien_Championship_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Pistons", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Pistons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_Magic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orlando Magic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_Spurs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Antonio Spurs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_NBA_Bubble", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2020 NBA Bubble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Courts", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://media.nbcchicago.com/2024/05/web-240530-2008-nba-finals-game-2.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 104, "relevance": 1}

Tonight, we have Game 1 of the NBA Finals! We have a star-studded matchup between the Boston Celtics and Dallas Mavericks. The lineup construction is a little bit different than your typical DFS slate as these include a 1.5x multiplier Captain's spot on DK that carries elevated salaries for each player, and MVP (2x), STAR (1.5x), and PRO (1.2x) spots on FanDuel, where player's salaries are the same regardless of roster spot.\n\nThe key to being successful in NBA DFS comes down to making adjustments during the day as injury information becomes available. But it's always really important to have a game plan and to have the best players and spots circled first before making those adjustments. To keep up with all the latest developments and get access to updated projections, grab an NBA season pass and also gain access to our RotoBaller Premium Discord, where @chiefjustice6 is talking about the slate up until lineups lock!\n\nLuka Doncic and Jayson Tatum will be your top guys to grab on this slate; however, getting both could be difficult and there is quite a lack of value on this slate tonight. Choosing one and building around them is more than likely going to be the route I take in my lineups. Luka had incredible games against the Celtics during the regular season. Although they lost both games, he finished with 60+ FP in both. Tatum did well, too, and is $1,500 cheaper on FD. I highly recommend building a couple of lineups as it could go either way.\n\nJaylen Brown has been playing solid during the playoffs. In their two regular-season matchups, Brown finished with 43 and 49 FP. He is a good option if you want to get different in the captain spot and save a little bit of salary space on DraftKings.\n\nDerrick Jones Jr. has shown flashes of really good games during the playoffs and he is about as cheap as I would go on this slate. Josh Green gets minutes but doesn't do anything with them and Maxi Kleber is irrelevant unless Daniel Gafford or Dereck Lively II get injured. At 8K on FanDuel, though, Jones is worth a shot to get another star in the lineup.\n\nKristaps Porzingis is back, which hurts Al Horford's usage, but there is a chance Porzingis doesn't get full minutes, which could result in Horford still getting some decent scoring up. He should average around 25 minutes with Kristaps back. If we can get 20+ from him, I will take it with the lack of value on this slate.\n\nLively looked great in his return to the court in Game 4 against the Timberwolves, finishing with 31 fantasy points in 24 minutes. He has looked great during the playoffs and I expect that to continue going into the NBA Finals.\n\nIf Kristaps Porzingis does play, I can only imagine in his first game back that he will be limited in some way. That being said, I'm going to be fading him for Game 1 and getting an idea of how the Celtics use him right off the bat.

With their rich history, the Boston Celtics have had plenty of what-ifs over the years, but among the most recent ones to think about is what if they had traded for Myles Turner back in 2020?\n\nFor context, back in 2020, the Celtics were at a standoff with the Indiana Pacers. Gordon Hayward had opted out of his contract in the hopes of getting his next big payday and was interested in playing for his hometown team in Indiana. A feeling that was mutual between the two sides.\n\nDespite the two sides charing interest in each other, the Pacers did not have the cap space to add Hayward straight-up and needed to do a sign-and-trade with the Celtics to get him on the team. However, the Celtics were reluctant to give him up, knowing both his value and that the Pacers were among their best competition in the East at the time.\n\nThe best asset the Pacers were willing to give up was Myles Turner, which, in the Celtics' opinion, was not enough. The Boston Globe's Gary Washburn gave the full details of what each side wanted.\n\n(In 2024, that's a layup for the Pacers. Back in 2020, that was absurd.)\n\nThe Pacers' leverage was the Celtics couldn't risk losing Hayward for nothing. The Celtics' leverage was that the Pacers had to give up someone who made good money to get Hayward. Boston also preferred to keep Hayward on the team, which factored into their reluctance to part with him.\n\nIn the end, Hayward was sick of waiting and signed with the Hornets instead. The Pacers didn't get their guy, and the Celtics wound up with a $28 million trade exception. The rest is history from there.\n\nWhat's done is done, and that's that. While it never happened, trading for Turner would have caused a butterfly effect that may have made all the difference between the Celtics making two of the last three NBA Finals and being mired in questions.

The Celtics made quick work of those foes, dropping only two games in the first three rounds combined.\n\nKevin Garnett, however, has no time for that narrative. The Boston legend sounded off on the talking point on the latest episode of the \"Ticket & The Truth\" podcast.\n\n\"I think people want this big-ass (expletive) drama or something because all of the other series have been like this,\" Garnett said. \"'Oh, when LeBron (James) made it and when Kobe (Bryant) did this and Michael Jordan.' Listen, man. Their path is their path. First off, it's not on the Celtics that guys are getting hurt, not playing, falling out of the lineup, etc. There are still other professionals coming in, playing hard as (expletive) and still trying to win. And to close out a game on the road? Man, I don't know what people want.\n\n\"People want all this heartfelt drama and going seven games. Nah, that ain't the script here. Their script -- they're damn near 16 games better than anybody in the East, they steamrolled through your team and it is what it is. And then, too, they're down 18 on the road. They think you can just hit a button and all of a sudden you're tied. No, man. You have to go win on the road and it's hard as (expletive) to go win on the road and it's even more hard to close out a team. But for all this other (expletive) they can't control and that's out of their control -- get the (expletive) out of here with that. This is what it is.\"\n\nGarnett's final point probably was the most pertinent. The Celtics played the hand they were dealt in the Eastern Conference playoffs and by and large looked like the league's best team. What more could you ask of Boston?\n\nTrying to poke holes in success comes with the territory of being a great team. The Celtics' haters will continue to do so as long as they can, but there won't be much left to say if an 18th championship banner is raised to the TD Garden rafters.", "source": {"uri": "nesn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NESN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adam_london@nesn.com", "name": "Adam London", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Garnett", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Garnett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Profanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kobe"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kobe"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://nesn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/06/Jayson-Tatum-T.J.-McConnell.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623033", "eventUri": "eng-9623033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 96, "relevance": 1}

One of the players he interviewed was Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum, who Lively and the Mavs will try to take down in Game 1 of the NBA Finals on Thursday (8:30 ET, ABC).\n\nLively was part of the NBA Player Correspondent Program, which gives players the opportunity to attend events such as All-Star Weekend, NBA Finals and NBA Draft, among others, to serve as media correspondents.\n\nOther notable past participants of the program include:\n\nNBA.com caught up with SVP of entertainment and player marketing, Michael Levine, who helps spearhead the program.\n\nEditor's Note: The following conversation has been condensed and edited.\n\nNBA.com: Since you helped create the NBA Player Correspondent Program, you're the perfect person to drop some knowledge on what it's all about. What do you hope the correspondents learn from participating in the program?\n\nLevine: The reality is that we want to work with our players in unique ways in which they can be perceived positively. We are giving them access to this type of platform, not only from a content standpoint, but from being on the NBA's biggest stage. This is where they aspire to be one day.\n\nThis program really gives players an opportunity to do four things. One, is to build their social profile. We want to keep the momentum from their season going, and get them back in the spotlight.\n\nTwo, we also want them to understand the business of the NBA, and specifically the NBA Entertainment side. So, they're seeing how we cover the Finals from a broadcasting perspective, photos perspective, original content, etc. I think when they go back to their markets, they then have a greater awareness of how things work. They leave with a better sense of how the NBA operates.\n\nThree, is relationship building. So getting to know the people, the league office, our broadcast partners, our global partners, will help all of us build this game. This knowledge then leads to a more trusting and cooperative relationship.\n\nLastly, seeing the NBA Finals, this is where they hope to be. So all those things went into play as we were developing it. And the program has just gotten bigger and bigger over the years.\n\nOff the top of your head, do you remember who was the first person in the program?\n\nIt was CJ McCollum in June of 2015. He actually did it that year and in 2016. In 2015, he stayed for two media days. He interviewed Tristan Thompson, Matthew Dellavedova, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green. The program has changed over the years, but that was the first media day. CJ majored in Journalism at Lehigh so getting into this space was an ideal opportunity for him.\n\nSome impressive names have come through the program since then. Vince Carter, Gary Payton, Donovan Mitchell, Myles Turner to name a few.\n\nWe've had veterans that were looking to get on air experience towards the end of their career, as they were exploring a potential post career in broadcasting. So, it was an opportunity for them to sort of get their feet wet. Channing Frye, Vince Carter, Caron Butler ... these are all guys that wanted to try to get into broadcasting. And we wanted to give them the stage and the opportunity as well.\n\nThere are five budding players for the first four games of the Finals. Game 1: Jabari Smith, Jr.; Game 2: The Thompson Twins; Game 3: Keyonte George; Game 4: Brandin Podziemski. What type of training will they get ahead of time?\n\nWe have calls and try to engage with them prior to being on site, to explain what they're going to be doing and cultivate a level of comfort. When they arrive on site, we have experts from our social media team that work directly with them as well.\n\nI wouldn't say there is a lot of training per se, because we want their personality to simply just come out and be showcased through this. While we do write up some questions, we also give them the opportunity to ask their own. We have even had several players pop into press conferences. So from a training perspective, there's not much [but] a little bit of guidance.\n\nHow does a player get chosen for the program?\n\nThere's not an exact science to it. The reality is that we look at players that have expressed an interest in working more closely with us off the court and who have achieved success on the court. That on court success is essential. So if you look at some of the players that we've worked with, they have had accolades on the court, which can in turn allow them some free time to devote to other opportunities off of it.\n\nDo you have a moment from the program that stands out to you?\n\nJaren Jackson Jr. was quite unique.

LeBron James has played a career-high 71 games in his age-39 season. Jayson Tatum's old-school approach and appearance in 73.3 regular season games reflect his elite durability. GIVEMESPORT VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\nThe tagline for the 2024 NBA Playoffs might go something like, \"durability wins championships\". A historic number of superstars have gone down with injuries during these playoffs (if they were even available to begin with), altering the entire landscape of the NBA title race in the process.\n\nThough it's human nature to pessimistically focus on the \"what if\" potential of injury-riddled superstars like Joel Embiid, Kawhi Leonard, or Zion Williamson, the media doesn't seem to do enough championing superstars who do stay healthy.\n\nWith this in mind, here's a look at the most durable superstars in the NBA, including some honorable mentions.\n\nNikola Joki\u0107 The best player in the world is almost always on the court\n\nThe best player in the world is also the most durable. Nikola Joki\u0107 has played in 75 regular season games per season over his nine-year career in the NBA, winning an NBA championship and three NBA MVPs in the process.\n\nJoki\u0107 has also never missed a playoff game for the Denver Nuggets, who looked very poised to repeat as champions this season before running into a Minnesota Timberwolves defensive roster constructed literally for the sole purpose of neutralizing Joki\u0107.\n\nJoki\u0107's durability is even more impressive considering his size, as he's just short of 7-feet and around 285 pounds. Players the size of Joki\u0107 are normally prone to constant injuries, forcing them to miss significant time every season and be heavily load-managed (Embiid is a recent example).\n\nNikola Joki\u0107 - MVP Seasons Comparison\n\nCategory\n\n2020-21\n\n2021-22\n\n2023-24\n\nPTS\n\n26.4\n\n27.1\n\n26.4\n\nREB\n\n10.8\n\n13.8\n\n12.4\n\nAST\n\n8.3\n\n7.9\n\n9.0\n\nFG%\n\n56.6\n\n58.3\n\n58.3\n\n3PT%\n\n38.8\n\n33.7\n\n35.9\n\nJoki\u0107 has never required load management. He has appeared in less than 70 games only once in his career (69 games played in 2022-23), and he's appeared in 79-plus games on three separate occasions, including this past season.\n\nWith LeBron James presumably headed toward retirement in the next couple of years, Joki\u0107 and Tatum become the current models for superstar durability in the NBA.\n\nLeBron James James has largely missed injuries throughout his decades-long NBA career\n\nWho else could challenge for the top spot on this list but LeBron James, one of the most durable NBA players of all time? James' 1,492 total regular season games played (sixth all-time) is impressive enough, as are his 287 total playoff games played (first all-time), but most pertinent for this list is James' 71 regular season games played per season over a 21-year career.\n\nJames combines the \"man in the arena\" mentality exhibited by Jayson Tatum with the kind of supreme physicality shared by Anthony Edwards and Jaylen Brown. Essentially, James is a model of durability, both mentally and physically.\n\nNotably, James' durability has fallen below his career norm since he joined the Los Angeles Lakers, most certainly as a result of his age.\n\nLeBron James: Regular Season Games Played\n\nSeason\n\nGames Played\n\n2018-19\n\n55\n\n2019-20\n\n67\n\n2020-21\n\n45\n\n2021-22\n\n56\n\n2022-23\n\n55\n\n2023-24\n\n71\n\nJames' diminishing regular season appearances has as much to do with a shift in strategy as anything else, as James has prioritized having his body ready for the playoffs above all else. While such a strategy might disqualify another NBA player from appearing on this list (not to mention in the second position), James gets a pass due to being in his late 30s and having already proven throughout a lengthy career that he is durable when he needs to be.\n\nJames playing 71 games in his age-39 season (this past year) speaks directly to his continuing availability as one of the most durable players in the NBA.\n\nJayson Tatum Tatum is yet to miss the playoffs in his NBA career\n\nJayson Tatum famously doesn't believe in load management, and his availability certainly reflects this mindset. Tatum has appeared in 73.3 regular season games per season over his seven-year career with the Boston Celtics.\n\nOf the five players on this list, Tatum probably has the body that is least protected against injury, but his mentality more than makes up for it. He struggled with a debilitating wrist injury throughout the Celtics' 2022 title run but never missed a game (and later elected to forego offseason surgery).\n\nJayson Tatum - Regular Season vs Playoffs Comparison (Career)\n\nCategory\n\nRegular Season\n\nPlayoffs\n\nPTS\n\n23.1\n\n24.1\n\nREB\n\n7.2\n\n7.9\n\nAST\n\n3.5\n\n4.8\n\nFG%\n\n46.0\n\n44.3\n\n3PT%\n\n37.5\n\n34.9\n\nSimply put, Tatum loves playing basketball, and he takes an old-school approach to wanting to show up every night and give fans a special experience who have never seen him play. Tatum's elite durability, in tandem with Jaylen Brown's, is a huge reason why Brad Stevens and the Celtics franchise have invested all of their chips into this dynamic duo.\n\nGiven all of their athleticism, skill, and accolades, durability is criminally under-discussed when Tatum and Brown arise in NBA discussions. Celtics fans are truly lucky to have a superstar in Tatum who approaches every regular season opportunity with equal humility.\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo Despite missing the postseason in 2024, Giannis has always been reliable\n\nFor years, Giannis Antetokounmpo's consistent availability during the regular season has been the driving force behind the Milwaukee Bucks continually securing top playoff seeding.\n\nOver his eleven-year career, Giannis has appeared in 72 regular season games per season for Milwaukee, including a three-year stretch between 2014 and 2017 in which Giannis logged 81, 80, and 80 games played in consecutive seasons. In addition to this run, Giannis has appeared in 70-plus games four other times.\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo - 2023-24 Stats\n\nPTS\n\n30.4\n\nREB\n\n11.5\n\nAST\n\n6.5\n\nFG%\n\n61.1\n\n3PT%\n\n27.4\n\nGiannis' season-ending calf injury at the end of the 2023-34 campaign was all the more shocking, considering his historic durability. After four years before this season of not reaching the 70-game mark (63, 61, 67, and 63 games played, respectively), Giannis returned to elite availability in 2023-24 by appearing in 73 games.\n\nKnown as one of the hardest-playing NBA superstars, Giannis' durability is particularly remarkable. He has added a surprising amount of muscle to his 6-foot-11 frame since entering the league, which has contributed to his ability to bring it night after night throughout the grueling NBA schedule. It will be fascinating to see if Giannis can maintain elite availability late into his career the way that the players at the top of this have done, especially since history shows that such a feat is unlikely to happen.\n\nAnthony Edwards Edwards has emerged as a reliable superstar\n\nAnthony Edwards' limited time spent in the NBA (four seasons) is the only reason he is not higher on this list, since his elite durability has not been proven over as long a stretch as the four players above him.\n\nSo far, however, Edwards is tracking to be as durable as they come. In his four seasons in the league so far, Edwards has totaled regular season game appearances of 72, 72, 79, and 79, averaging 34.4 minutes per game along the way.\n\nAnthony Edwards - Offensive Progression\n\nCategory\n\n2020-21\n\n2021-22\n\n2022-23\n\n2023-24\n\nPTS\n\n19.3\n\n21.3\n\n24.6\n\n25.9\n\nFG%\n\n41.7\n\n44.1\n\n45.9\n\n46.1\n\nUSG%\n\n27.0\n\n26.4\n\n29.9\n\n32.3\n\nEdwards' durability doesn't come as a surprise to anyone aware of his competitive nature, not to mention his elite physique. Like Jaylen Brown, Edwards possesses the sort of body just as appropriate for heavyweight boxing or NFL football as it is advantageous in the NBA.\n\nEdwards' durability and attitude towards showing up every night is another point of comparison between Edwards and Michael Jordan, who, although many are unaware, played in all 82 games in nine of his NBA seasons, including Jordan's last season at age 39 playing for the Washington Wizards.\n\nRelated Keon Ellis' Rise Could Lead to Several Trades in the Off-Season The rising guard carved out a spot for himself in Sacramento's rotation throughout

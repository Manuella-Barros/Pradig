Virat, also dressed casually in a T-shirt, can be seen holding Akaay in his arms. The couple is spotted at a flower shop, with their daughter Vamika not appearing in the footage. Fans were thrilled to catch a glimpse of Akaay, with many leaving heart emojis under the video.\n\nVirat took a break from cricket post the T20 World Cup victory and flew to London immediately after arriving in India following a brief delay in Barbados due to a hurricane. This marked the first public sighting of Akaay, their second child, seven months after his birth. Known for their private life, Virat and Anushka surprised fans by sharing a rare glimpse of their youngest family member.\n\nWhile Bollywood glittered at Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant's wedding celebrations, a video emerged of Virat and Anushka attending a kirtan in London. In a video that went viral on Reddit, the couple was captured participating in a Krishna Das Kirtan, applauding and engaging with the devotional music as American vocalist Krishna Das performed, warmly acknowledging the audience with folded hands.\n\nAnushka turned 36 on May 1 and has been out of the public eye since giving birth to her son Akaay in February. She made her first appearance after Akaay's birth at an IPL match in May. While she has supported Virat at some matches, she wasn't seen at the stands during India's recent WT20 final victory. Anushka and Virat also did not attend the Ambani festivities in Mumbai.\n\nFans suspect Virat and Anushka may move to London permanently for a quieter life, especially since they've been seen there often.

Although the star player is anticipated to return later this season, Kohli has been granted a much-needed break from competitive cricket after a demanding season in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024 and the ICC T20 World Cup in the Caribbean.\n\nA cricket fan page on X, the former name of Twitter, posted a video showing supporters spotting Kohli and wife Anushka visiting a London florist. Along with his kid Akaay and wife Anushka, Kohli went for a stroll.\n\nAs the video became the talk of the town on social media, the internet managed to detect Vamika beside Akaay, who was making his first appearance on Virat's lap.\n\nVirat and Anushka recently went to Union Chapel to see Krishna Das' kirtan. On Instagram Stories, Anushka shared a photo of Krishna Das live on stage. On February 15, the power couple welcomed Akaay, their second kid.

I mentioned to Rohit during our batting practice today that you never know what will happen when you step out and try to score a run. God is magnificent. I give thanks with my head bowed.

For the unversed, Krishna Das, originally named Jeffrey Kagel, is a disciple of Neem Karoli Baba and so are Anushka and Virat.\n\nVirat Kohli and Anushka Sharma got married on December 11, 2017. They have two children-daughter Vamika and son Akaay. Anushka has been missing from the big screen since her 2018 film Zero.

The rumours of them moving to London for good gained prominence after Virat flew to the country right after the victory parade in Mumbai to be with his family. Since then, many people on social media, mainly a group on Reddit, have started speculating again about whether Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma are planning to leave India and move to the UK after Virat retires from cricket.\n\nIn a post on Reddit, one user wrote, \"Yes. I got the hint back when he made that \" I will be gone for a while\" statement. He also started following a london play school/residential area type of a thing on Instagram very recently . They've at least temporarily moved their base to the UK, he'll obviously have to travel during the matches and be in india for ipl. But after he's done with cricket, they'll permanently live there (sic.)\"\n\nAnother fan penned, \"They can't live a normal life here. London is a good city.. It's pretty and good education is available. I remember once virat and anushka(2-3 years ago) were riding a scooty and everyone was following them . Then Virat's hotel room video. People are crazy after them. Their kids photo will be leaked one day Or the other (which they don't want). They can't have their privacy here. He's going to retire in 3-4 years and anushka has already taken a halt in her career. He already said he will disappear for a while. Which isn't possible in India.

The India batter on Thursday (18th July) was spotted cradling his son Akaay, alongside his wife, Bollywood actress Anushka Sharma and their daughter Vamika.\n\nVirat Kohli along with his family was captured at the flower shop. This was his first appearance with his son. In a clip that has gone viral on the internet, the batter came to be seen holding Akaay, with wife Anushka and daughter Vamika by his side, near a flower shop.\n\nVirat Kohli was last seen in action during the T20 World Cup 2024. By the kind of standards that he has set, he didn't have a great tournament. He failed to get going in the entire tournament but played a match-winning innings in the final against South Africa, ending up with 76 runs.\n\nFollowing the win in the T20 World Cup 2024, Virat Kohli called time on his career in the shortest format of the game. He finished with 4188 at an average of 48.69 and a strike rate of 137.04 in his career. He played 125 matches and ended his career as India's second-highest run-scorer in the format.\n\nIndia team's next assignment is against the Sri Lanka National Cricket Team. The Men in Blue will be playing three ODIs and three T20Is on their tour to the island nation. There were a lot of rumors that Virat Kohli will be missing the 50-over games as he has been granted rest by the BCCI.\n\nHowever, Virat Kohli has made himself available and will be playing the series against the Sri Lanka National Cricket Team. The ODI series will be a great preparation for them for the upcoming Champions Trophy 2025.", "source": {"uri": "cricketaddictor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketAddictor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wankhede_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wankhede Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting order (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbados", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Champions_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ICC Champions Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20 International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_Control_for_Cricket_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Board of Control for Cricket in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_overs_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Limited overs cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "One Day International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static.cricketaddictor.com/images/2024/Kohliakaay.webp?q=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9743427", "eventUri": "eng-9743427", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-18", "textStart": 245, "textEnd": 254, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

Following a rigorous season in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024 and the ICC T20 World Cup in the Caribbean, Kohli is currently on a well-deserved break from competitive cricket. Despite this respite, the cricket star is expected to return to action later in the season.\n\nIn a viral video shared by a cricket fan page on X (formerly known as Twitter), Virat Kohli and his wife, Anushka Sharma, were seen by fans at a florist in London.The couple was out for a walk with their son Akaay, who made his first public appearance on Virat's lap.

After concluding his illustrious T20I career with India's triumph in the World Cup last month, Kohli showcased a return to top form. His stellar innings of 76 runs off 59 balls played a pivotal role in Rohit Sharma's Team India securing a resounding victory over South Africa in the T20 World Cup 2024 final held in Barbados.\n\n\"This was my final T20 World Cup, and we achieved exactly what we aimed for,\" said Kohli after being named Player of the Match in the final.

Kohli is enjoying a much-needed break from cricket following a draining Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024 followed by the ICC T20 World Cup in the Americas.\n\nA video posted on X (formerly Twitter) is going viral on social media that shows Kohli and Anushka visiting a florist in London along with their two kids.

The celebrity couple welcomed their second child, Akaay, on February 15 this year which forced Kohli to miss the Test series against England.\n\nAfter getting a much-needed rest from competitive cricket, Kohli is expected to skip the upcoming ODI series against Sri Lanka. The 35-year-old icon retired from T20I cricket following a Man of the Match performance in the T20 World Cup final against South Africa.\n\nKohli's 76 off 59 balls helped Team India edge the Proteas by 7 runs in a thriller to break a 13-year-long World Cup title jinx and end an 11-year-long ICC trophy drought.

The heartwarming images and videos show Kohli cradling his baby boy in his arms as they strolled through the streets of the British capital.\n\nKohli was recently spotted in the United Kingdom, enjoying some much-needed time off from cricket with his family. In a heartwarming video that has gone viral on social media, Kohli was seen holding his son Akaay in his arms while shopping for flowers with his wife, actress Anushka Sharma.\n\nThis rare family outing in London marks the first public appearance of Akaay, Kohli and Anushka's son, on his father's lap. The video has captured the attention of fans and media alike, with many expressing their delight at seeing the doting father-son duo.\n\nThis is the first publicly available footage of Kohli and his second child, Akaay, who was born on February 15, 2024. Kohli and his wife, Bollywood actress Anushka, have been fiercely protective of their children's privacy, rarely sharing photos or videos of them on social media.\n\nHowever, the couple's efforts to shield their kids from the public eye were momentarily thwarted as fans and paparazzi managed to capture these candid moments of Kohli doting on his son. The images quickly went viral on social media, with fans gushing over the cricketer's paternal side.\n\nKohli's presence in the UK has also fueled speculation about his potential participation in the upcoming ODI series against Sri Lanka. While the Indian cricket team is gearing up for the white-ball series, which is set to begin on July 27, Kohli was initially expected to miss the ODI matches.\n\nHowever, a recent development, according to reports in The Indian Express, suggests that Kohli has confirmed his availability for the ODI series against Sri Lanka, beginning on August 2, at the request of the new head coach, Gautam Gambhir. This news has come as a pleasant surprise for fans who were eagerly anticipating Kohli's return to the international stage.\n\nKohli's decision to skip the ODI series against Sri Lanka was in line with the Indian team's strategy of managing the workload of senior players and providing opportunities to younger talents in the shortest format.\n\nThe 35-year-old cricketer recently announced his retirement from T20Is after guiding India to victory in the T20 World Cup 2024. Kohli's impressive performance in the T20 World Cup final, where he scored 76 runs off 59 balls to help India outclass South Africa, earned him the Player of the Match award.\n\nHis decision to retire from T20Is was followed by similar announcements from former T20 captain Rohit Sharma and all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja, paving the way for the next generation of cricketers to shine in the format.", "source": {"uri": "crickettimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketTimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "One Day International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_cricket_team_in_Bangladesh_in_2017\u201318", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lankan cricket team in Bangladesh in 2017\u201318"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anushka_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anushka Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_of_the_match", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Player of the match"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautam_Gambhir", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gautam Gambhir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20 International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravindra_Jadeja", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ravindra Jadeja"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-rounder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-rounder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Indian_Express", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Indian Express"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_overs_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Limited overs cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://crickettimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Virat-Kohli-holding-his-son-Akaay-and-roaming-on-the-streets-of-London.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9743427", "eventUri": "eng-9743427", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-27", "textStart": 1685, "textEnd": 1692}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-02", "textStart": 1926, "textEnd": 1934}, {"amb": false, "date": "2015-02-", "textStart": 982, "textEnd": 993}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

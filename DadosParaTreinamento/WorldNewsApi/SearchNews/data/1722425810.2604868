The board says that \u201csomeone more capable\u201d should be found by the Democrats to defeat Mr. Trump in November. \u201cIt is the best chance to protect the soul of the nation \u2014 the cause that drew Mr. Biden to run for the presidency in 2019 \u2014 from the malign warping of Mr. Trump. And it is the best service that Mr. Biden can provide to a country that he has nobly served for so long,\u201d the board concluded. They further stressed that a second Trump term would be \u201ca significant jeopardy to that democracy\u201d as \u201chis supporters have described, publicly, a 2025 agenda that would give him the power to carry out the most extreme of his promises and threats.. unrestrained by the checks on power built into the American political system.\u201d They also clarified that the editorial board is \u201ca group of opinion journalists whose views are informed by expertise, research, debate and certain longstanding values\u201d which is \u201cseparate from the newsroom.\u201d The editorial is behind a paywall and available only to paid subscribers.", "summary": "<p>\u00a0The unprecedented column comes the day after the president's CNN debate performance against Donald Trump</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/ny-times-editorial-board-calls-on-biden-to-exit-2024-presidential-race/\">NY Times Editorial Board Calls on Biden to Exit 2024 Presidential Race</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com\">TheWrap</a>.</p>", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/ny-times-editorial-board-calls-on-biden-to-exit-2024-presidential-race/", "image": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/biden-new-york-times-op-ed-resign.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 00:18:36", "author": "Sharon Knolle", "authors": ["Sharon Knolle"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.018}

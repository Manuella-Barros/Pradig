Sen. Joel-Onowakpo made the call while speaking with journalists at the Thanksgiving Service of the Delta State Governor, His Excellency, Rt Hon. Sheriff Oborevwori, to mark his one-year anniversary in office. The event was held at Winners Chapel, Ibusa Road, Asaba, Delta State. He said Oborevwori extending invitation to all the senators from Delta State irrespective of their political leaning was the smartest and wisest thing that he has done. He added that it would be timid and disrespectful of him to have turned down such an invitation even though they are from a different political divide. \"First, let me correct one thing: I am a Senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. I am not a senator for only APC members in my Senatorial District but a senator for both APC, PDP and all other parties. I am to represent all and bring the dividend of democracy to our people. \"Note also, the governor of Delta State is the Governor to everyone in Delta State and I do not think he is governor to only those who are PDP members. Moreover, I am a Senator today because Delta State exists, I am also a critical stakeholder in Delta State. For emphasis sake, I represent 1/3 of the State and my other two colleagues from Delta State represent 2/3 of the State. \"Having said the above, I want to say that, His Excellency extending an invitation to all the senators from Delta State irrespective of their political leaning is the smartest and wisest thing that he has done. And I think it will be very timid and very disrespectful of me to turn such an invitation. \"The question I need to ask myself if I even think of turning down the invitation is: what do I intend to achieve? And very honestly, I will have no answer to such a question other than telling myself not to attend because the governor is a PDP governor. Which to me is pure nonsensical!\" He said. He further said, \"As an APC member, I should imitate my APC supreme leader in person of, His Excellency, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, GCFR the president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria who is so broad minded in not only relating with members of the opposition but even appointing His Excellency Nyesom wike as a minister of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, because he recognized the fact that he is the president of everyone in Nigeria.\" According to him, \"I want to say that, HE Sheriff Oborevwori should be commended for being broad minded like our President. \"I want to encourage him to continue to be broad minded and also be inclusive. I am waiting for the day he will appoint credible members of the opposition party to his cabinet. I also want to say that, I am not aware of the president giving a directive to the MDA (Ministry, Department and Agency) of government to pass all Federal government intervention programs through only APC members rather all intervention programs are routed through the various State governor's irrespective of their political affiliation. And this is the way to go. \"Finally, I want to encourage everyone to move away from primitive politics where the opposition is considered to be an enemy and as such must be punished. This country needs a cross fertilization of ideas to have rapid development. We are elected into office to represent our people whether you are APC, PDP or any other party. We can be in different parties but with one common goal - the empowerment of our people and the development of our environment. We must not lose sight of this.\"", "summary": "<img width=\"1080\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG-20240526-WA0127.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" srcset=\"https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG-20240526-WA0127.jpg 1080w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG-20240526-WA0127-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG-20240526-WA0127-1024x683.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px\" /><p>The member representing Delta South Senatorial District in the National Assembly, Senator Joel-Onowakpo Thomas, has called on politicians to shun primitive politics where the opposition is considered to be an enemy, charging them to emulate the disposition of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu who has appointed members of the opposition parties into his cabinet.

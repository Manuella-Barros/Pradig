But what if I\u2019m already too negative?", "text": "Prince Bhojwani never thought of himself as a negative person, until three trips to the hospital in one month forced him to reconsider. Before May 2018, he was a healthy but chronically worried start-up founder who regularly did 20-mile (32-kilometre) bike rides. When he suddenly became barely able to walk, with blurry vision and spiking blood pressure, emergency room doctors suspected a stroke, but couldn't pinpoint the cause of his illness. A close friend, however \u2014 \u201cone of the most optimistic people I know,\u201d he said \u2014 pointed out Bhojwani often lacked faith that things would work out, and suggested that had pushed him to burn out. \u201cI started looking at the world very differently, literally the next day,\u201d said Bhojwani, who lives in New York City. He started meditating and taking a moment every morning to feel grateful to be alive. He also found purpose by co-founding a nonprofit, Asana Voices, a South Asian advocacy organization. In the years since, he hasn\u2019t had any similar health crises, despite working longer hours. He credits his newfound positive outlook. \u201cAfter there was a life-changing event, it kind of forced me to become optimistic,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t even imagine living life the way I did back then.\u201d Optimism in itself is hardly a cure-all, but numerous studies over the decades have demonstrated a link between a positive outlook and good health outcomes. A longer, healthier life? Experts say a standard for measuring someone\u2019s relative optimism has long been the 10-question Life Orientation Test-Revised, published in 1994. (Sample question: On a scale of one to five, respondents are asked how strongly they agree with the statement, \u201cIn uncertain times, I usually expect the best\u201d?) Generally, optimism is defined as the \"expectation that good things will happen, or believing the future will be favorable because we can control important outcomes,\u201d said Hayami Koga, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Harvard Center for Population and Development Studies.

In another study, published in May in JAMA Psychiatry, she and other researchers said optimists generally maintained better physical functioning as they aged. They looked at 5,930 postmenopausal women over a six-year period. \u201cWe know that more optimistic people are more likely to live a healthier life, with healthier habits, eating healthier, having more exercise,\u201d Koga said. Can I learn to be an optimist? Some people are born more optimistic but it can definitely be learned, too, said Sue Varma, clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at New York University and author of \u201cPractical Optimism: The Art, Science, and Practice of Exceptional Well-Being.\u201d Optimism training, she said, can improve life satisfaction and lessen anxiety. \u201cEven if you were not born with this natural disposition to anticipate favorable outcomes and see the glass as half full, there are skills that you can learn,\u201d Varma said. Begin by noticing how you deal with uncertainty, she said. Do you tend to worry? Assume the worst? Try to reframe the thought in an objective manner. \u201cIs there a silver lining? Is this a problem to be solved or a truth to be accepted?\u201d said Varma, noting that her book builds upon the work of Martin Seligman, one of the fathers of positive psychology. Try to envision the best possible outcome and a step-by-step path to get there. Varma asks her clients to describe the path in detail until the problem is resolved, and encourages them to bask in their success. \u201cThen you are already approaching your day and your life as if things have worked out,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you tend to be more proactive, more positive, more resilient, more buoyant in the face of obstacles.\u201d Finding a sense of purpose also can help. Volunteering would be beneficial, but for those who can't find the time, Varma suggested trying to remake your role at work to align better with your interests. That could be as simple as a very social person organizing outings with co-workers.

Even with these and other interventions, it\u2019s not easy to change your mindset, Varma noted. But practice helps. \u201cIt\u2019s a toolset, it\u2019s a mindset,\u201d she said. \u201cI have to practice it every day in my mind.\u201d", "summary": "Optimism in itself is hardly a cure-all, but numerous studies over the decades have demonstrated a link between a positive outlook and good health outcomes.", "url": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/optimism-is-just-what-the-doctor-ordered-but-what-if-i-m-already-too-negative-1.6919001", "image": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/content/dam/ctvnews/en/images/2024/6/8/prince-bhojwani-1-6919002-1717848165654.png", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 12:02:54", "author": "Albert Stumm,The Associated Press", "authors": ["Albert Stumm", "The Associated Press"], "language": "en", "source_country": "CA", "sentiment": 0.018}

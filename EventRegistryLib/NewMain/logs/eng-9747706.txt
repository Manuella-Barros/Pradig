Brody Miller of The Athletic shared this picture from the course of Shane Lowry and Matt Fitzpatrick walking by and checking on Scottie Scheffler's sick caddie:\n\nAfter the round, Scottie Scheffler was asked about his caddie Ted Scott and what the state of things were. Scottie acknowledged knowing Ted Scott was sick prior to the round and said he was up all night battling illness but they weren't sure if it was a stomach bug or food poisoning.\n\nSpeaking with media after the round, Scheffler said \"well, could have been food poisoning, could be some sort of stomach bug. But he seemed to feel better as the day went on. The doc here took good care of him. But he did not sleep very much last night apparently. We didn't know if he was going to be able to go this morning, but he fought it out.

He's a steady presence on the bag of world #1 golfer Scottie Scheffler and is easily making more money than any other caddie on the tour as Scottie has set earnings records this year with the Open Championship purse + FedEx Cup Playoffs still in play and caddies standardly receive a bonus of somewhere between 5-10% of a player's on-course winnings.\n\nHopefully, Ted Scott can get some fluids and feel like a new man when he wakes up for Scottie Scheffler's Saturday round at Royal Troon.", "source": {"uri": "brobible.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BroBible"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cass_anderson@brobible.com", "name": "Cass Anderson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ted Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stroke play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Fitzpatrick", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matt Fitzpatrick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FedEx_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FedEx Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/scottie-scheffler-caddie-ted-scott.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747706", "eventUri": "eng-9747706", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

But he seemed to feel better as the day went on. The doc here took good care of him. But he did not sleep very much last night apparently. We didn't know if he was going to be able to go this morning, but he fought it out\".\n\nThroughout the round, Scott was seen lying down on the tee boxes, including the fifth and 10th, with cameras catching the veteran caddie in some discomfort. Despite this, he managed to walk round the South Ayrshire course and, by the end of it, received the praise, sort of, from his boss, Scheffler.\n\n\"You saw him laying down probably quite a bit out there, which was pretty funny. But it's just one of those deals, you're used to him being in one position, standing there by the bag, and then all of a sudden on the ninth today he was literally sitting on the 10th tee for like 10 minutes while we were putting out over there. I didn't even see him, which was a bit unusual. He's a fighter. He did a good job today and battled through it\".\n\nAppointed in 2021, both Scheffler and Scott have formed a formidable relationship that has amassed 12 PGA Tour victories, including two Majors. In 2024 alone, Scott has picked up around $2.6 million from Scheffler's wins and, at The Open, that will likely increase as the American goes in search of a third Major scalp.", "source": {"uri": "golfmonthly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Golf Monthly Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_cradock@golfmonthly.com", "name": "Matt Cradock", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ted Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusta_National_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Augusta National Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foodborne_illness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foodborne illness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_equipment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf equipment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_World_Golf_Ranking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Official World Golf Ranking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Ayrshire", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Ayrshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Ayrshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7ShHWEDC9yFnsLYQuRjx2H-1200-80.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747706", "eventUri": "eng-9747706", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

He has yet to record a hole-in-one, but he did secure an M.A. in Sports Journalism from St. Bonaventure University.\n\nTed Scott struggled all day on Friday, laboring around Royal Troon with a nasty stomach bug. He had to lie down multiple times throughout the day, proof that this illness had gotten the best of him.\n\nBut on a challenging day like Friday, every player in the field -- even top-ranked Scottie Scheffler -- needed their right-hand man to help figure out wind direction, wind speed, putting reads, and plenty more. With the blowing as hard as 30 miles per hour at times, Royal Troon quickly turned into Royal Trouble. Players dropped down The Open Championship leaderboard faster than the blink of an eye. And yet, Scheffler carded a 1-under 70 for the second straight day as he sits five behind Shane Lowry through 36 holes.\n\n\"I think the golf course was more challenging today than yesterday,\" Scheffler said.\n\n\"I'm not sure what the scores say, but it definitely felt to be a bit more challenging.\"\n\nNot only did Scheffler feel the wind more, but he also felt for his trusted confidante.\n\n\"He had a bit of food poisoning last night -- well, it could have been food poisoning, could be some sort of stomach bug -- but he seemed to feel better as the day went on. The doctor here took good care of him. But he did not sleep very much last night.\" Scheffler said of Scott.\n\n\"We didn't know if he was going to be able to go this morning, but he fought it out. You saw him lying down probably quite a bit out there, which was pretty funny. But it's just one of those deals; you're used to him being in one position, standing there by the bag, and then all of a sudden, on No. 9 today, he was literally sitting on the 10th tee for like 10 minutes while we were putting out over there. I didn't even see him, which was a bit unusual.\"\n\nScott continued to fight despite his uneasiness. Scheffler added that he did a \"great job,\" which is a testament to Scott's pedigree and talent.\n\nBut Scheffler has more talent than any other player in the world, even though his putter has sometimes let him down. It certainly did on Thursday, as he burned numerous edges. Yet Friday was much different, as Scheffler ranked ninth among the field in strokes gained putting. The World No. 1 rolled the rock beautifully, which should intimidate the rest of the field.\n\n\"I feel like I holed a good amount of putts today. I'd be interested to see what the statistics are because I felt like I holed a good amount of putts. I hit a lot of good ones, some up around the cup. It can be really challenging with how windy it is out there to hole a bunch of putts,\" Scheffler said.\n\nSo I'd be interested to see what the stats say after today because yesterday was one of those days where it felt like nothing could fall. I think I was down maybe half a shot, which I would have imagined when I walked off the course would have been worse than that. So today, being able to hole a few, especially some important ones on the back nine, for par always feels good, keeping the momentum.\"\n\nScheffler holed plenty of putts on the back nine, starting with a 9-footer for par on the 10th hole. He then rolled in a 35-footer for birdie on the par-3 14th and then made a 15-foot putt to save par on the 17th, the other par-3 on the back nine.\n\nHe, unfortunately, closed with a bogey after finding a pot bunker off the tee to drop back to 2-under. Scheffler sits in a tie for fourth with Dean Burmester and Billy Horschel, but with more weather looming, anything can happen. Nobody should doubt Scheffler, especially considering his putter is getting hot, and Scott's health is improving.", "source": {"uri": "sbnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SB Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jack_milko@sbnation.com", "name": "Jack Milko", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Bonaventure_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Bonaventure University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hole_in_one", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hole in one"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Horschel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Billy Horschel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hazard (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_World_Golf_Ranking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Official World Golf Ranking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stroke play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Burmester", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dean Burmester"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NVxuXj20AmKohy5L3BrqzkavPZM=/0x0:3189x1595/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25538039/2162677508.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747706", "eventUri": "eng-9747706", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

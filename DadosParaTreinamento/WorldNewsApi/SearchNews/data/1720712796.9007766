Anushka Sharma&#x27;s Reaction Goes Viral - Watch", "text": "Indian cricket team batter Virat Kohli once again failed to perform as he was dismissed for just 4 during the T20 World Cup 2024 match against Pakistan on Sunday. Kohli scored just 1 against Ireland in the first Group A match and against Pakistan, he played an extremely loose shot to gift his wicket to Naseem Shah. During the second over of the match, a delivery from Naseem was well wide off the off stump but Kohli decided to chase it and his ill-timed shot went straight into Usman Khan's hands. Virat was visibly upset with his shot selection as he walked back to the pavilion and the cameras also caught the disappointment on his wife Anushka Sharma's face who was present at the venue.

The conditions suit us, we have four fast bowlers. We will try to use it to our best. Past is past, we are looking forward to today's match, we are ready and will give our 100%. Always a big game, our confidence is always high for India vs Pak. Azam Khan is resting,\" Babar said at the toss.

We need to assess how conditions play and come up with an idea of what a good score is. Those games have helped us assess conditions here. We've spoken about what we need to do as a batting unit to get a good score and then we've got the bowling unit to defend. Every game is important in a World Cup, you can't just show up. Anything can happen.

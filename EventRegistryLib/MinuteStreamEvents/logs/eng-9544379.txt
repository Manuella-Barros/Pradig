Reyes entered the season as the primary utility man on Alex Cora's roster but struggled on both sides of the ball and lost his job when the Red Sox traded for Zack Short last week.\n\nReyes, who played 21 games (14 starts) for the Red Sox at all four infield positions, ranked in the second percentile in range/outs above average at -4, according to Statcast. He made four errors in 78 \u2153 innings filling in for Rafael Devers at third base while also seeing 39 innings at second base and about a dozen each at first base and shortstop.

Reyes will join Enmanuel Valdez and Bobby Dalbec, who were both optioned to Triple-A at the end of last week. For now, the Red Sox are starting Devers, Trevor Story, Vaughn Grissom and a platoon of Garrett Cooper and Dominic Smith at first base. Short is the utility backup while Romy Gonzalez rehabs from a wrist injury that has kept him sidelined since April 10.\n\nReyes joined the Red Sox in a minor trade with the Athletics last May and was surprisingly productive for the Red Sox throughout the rest of the season, hitting .287 with a .716 OPS and some big hits in clutch situations in August. He became something of a cult hero among Red Sox fans on Twitter/X after hitting a walk-off grand slam to beat the Royals on Aug. 7.\n\nIn other news, the Red Sox also were able to keep veteran righty Vladimir Gutierrez, who cleared waivers and was sent back to the WooSox as a non-40-man player after also being designated for assignment.

Boston designated him for assignment last week. Also sticking with the organization following a DFA is utilityman Pablo Reyes, reports Chris Cotillo of MassLive.com. Like Gutierrez, he went unclaimed on waivers and has been assigned outright to Worcester. Either player could've rejected the assignment in favor of free agency, but they'll stick with the organization and no longer require 40-man spots.\n\nNow 28 years old, Gutierrez was a high-profile signing out of Cuba back in 2016, when the Reds gave him a $4.75MM bonus and paid a 100% tax on top of that sum. He was one of Cincinnati's top pitching prospects for a few years but wound up giving them just 150 2/3 innings of 5.44 ERA ball while posting strikeout and walk rates of 17.3% and 10.4%, respectively -- both worse than the league average.\n\nDespite those struggles, Gutierrez would surely have received a longer look with the Reds if not for injuries. A torn ulnar collateral ligament in 2022 led to Tommy John surgery. Gutierrez returned to the mound to toss a handful of minor league innings last September but didn't get back to the big leagues. He was removed from Cincinnati's 40-man roster and became a free agent following the season. After a few showcases for big league scouts, he signed a minor league deal with the Marlins. He's since bounced from Miami, to Milwaukee, to Boston via waivers and will now stay put in Worcester for the time being.\n\nThe 30-year-old Reyes has been with the Sox since 2023 but hasn't been able to follow up on a solid .287/.339/.377 slash he posted in 185 plate appearances last season. He hit just .183/.234/.217 in his first 64 trips to the plate this season while fanning at a 29.7% clip that's nearly triple his 11.4% mark from the prior season.\n\nReyes has appeared in six straight big league seasons, but last year's 185 plate appearances were the most he's accrued in a single season. Overall, he's taken 572 turns at the plate in the majors and produced a .248/.309/.349 batting line between the Pirates, Brewers and BoSox. The versatile Reyes has appeared at every position on the diamond except for catcher. His career numbers at third base are particularly solid, though he made a few costly errors there earlier this season.", "source": {"uri": "mlbtraderumors.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MLB Trade

Boston also optioned right-hander Naoyuki Uwasawa to Triple-A Worcester. The moves clear active roster spots for Romy Gonzalez and Nick Pivetta, each of whom will return from the injured list before tomorrow's game in Atlanta.\n\nShort is out of minor league options, so the Sox didn't have the ability to send him to Worcester without taking him off the 40-man roster. That out-of-options status contributed to him landing in Boston in the first place. The Mets designated Short for assignment two weeks ago. Boston acquired him for cash on May 1.\n\nThe 28-year-old appeared twice for the Sox, going hitless with four strikeouts in seven at-bats. He has only tallied 19 plate appearances all season between New York and Boston. The majority of Short's big league playing time came with the Tigers a year ago. In 253 trips to the plate, he hit .204/.292/.339 with an elevated 26.1% strikeout rate. Short drew a decent number of walks but didn't make much of an impact when he put the ball in play.\n\nTeams have nevertheless been intrigued by his ability to handle multiple spots on the infield. He has nearly 600 innings of career shortstop work and more than 200 frames at both second and third base. His defensive grades are mixed. Statcast has given him average marks for his second and third base work while rating him as a below-average shortstop. Defensive Runs Saved has been more favorable, crediting him with average shortstop defense and well above-average work at the keystone.\n\nThe Sox will trade Short or place him on waivers within the next few days. He has yet to clear waivers despite being designated for assignment by each of Detroit, New York and now Boston since the end of last season.\n\nPivetta will take the ball tomorrow, his first MLB start in a little more than a month. The right-hander suffered a flexor strain, but the Sox expressed confidence it was a mild issue that wouldn't necessitate a long-term absence. He'll rejoin a rotation that has been arguably the best in the majors in 2024. Pivetta, an impending free agent, was brilliant in his first two starts.

It was a roller coaster of a time for Short who spoke about what was an emotional day of both major loss and gain for him and his family.\n\nBut Short, who was brought onto the big-league roster as an early season place holder and backup infielder until the Mets got some reinforcements back, was later designated for assignment on April 26 after going 1-for-9 in 10 games played. He was later traded to the Boston Red Sox on May 1.\n\nShort was called up to the Red Sox quickly thereafter on May 2, but only appeared in two games and did not record a hit in just six at-bats. Six days later, Short was once again designated for assignment before being traded for a second time already this season, this time to the Braves. The deal came to fruition on Thursday, May 9, not long after the Braves dealt another former Met in Guillorme.\n\nShort, 28, is a career journeymen, who holds a .169 average and .561 OPS in 191 big-league games. Time will tell if he can become a contributor or receive ample playing time on a high-powered Braves team.\n\nAs for Guillorme, he has produced in the past, so it is possible that he can find his footing in Los Angeles if he is given a fair shot.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "pat_ragazzo@si.com", "name": "Pat Ragazzo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Guillorme", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luis Guillorme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_player", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Utility player"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Angels", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Angels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_for_assignment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Designated for assignment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_training", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spring training"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Games_played", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Games played"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Part-Time_Employment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Part-Time Employment", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo_Golf", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo Golf", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Short_Mat_Bowls", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Short Mat Bowls", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Short_Stories", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Short Stories", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4217,h_2372,x_0,y_28/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/inside_the_mets/01hxfky9nyk875gqsc8g.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544379", "eventUri": "eng-9544379", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-26", "textStart": 892, "textEnd": 900}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-01", "textStart": 986, "textEnd": 991}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-02", "textStart": 1051, "textEnd": 1056}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 1321, "textEnd": 1326}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

Boston had designated him for assignment earlier this week. Atlanta opened up a roster spot earlier today by trading Luis Guillorme to the Angels.\n\nShort, 29 this month, is a utility player with a distinctly patient approach at the plate. He has 469 career plate appearances, walking in 11.5% of those but also striking out at a 29.4% clip. He has only swung at 20.9% of pitches outside the zone. Among hitters with at least 450 plate appearances since the start of 2021, only seven batters have chased less. And one of those is Brett Gardner, who hasn't played since 2021.\n\nDespite the keen eye, Short hasn't been able to produce much at the big league level. He currently has a career batting line of .169/.262/.299. The results have been a bit better at Triple-A, as he has slashed .226/.361/.397 there since the start of 2021. His 16.2% walk rate at that level helped him produce a 106 wRC+, though he was also punched out at a 26.6% clip.\n\nIn addition to an intriguing approach at the plate, Short also provides defensive versatility. At the major league level, he's played the three infield positions to the left of first base, as well as center and right field. He's also spent a bit of time in left field in the minors.\n\nShort exhausted his final option year with the Tigers in 2023 and is now out of options. That has led to him bouncing around the league since the end of last season. The Mets claimed him from the Tigers in November but then designated him for assignment at the end of April when J.D. Martinez was ready for his team debut. He was traded to the Red Sox for cash but only lasted on that roster for a week before being designated for assignment again.\n\nIt's entirely possible that he ends up in DFA limbo again on account of his out-of-options status, but he'll join Atlanta's roster for now. The club has a lineup full of stars but Short will take over Guillorme's previous role as a versatile bench piece alongside Luke Williams. If Short lasts on the roster all year, he can be retained for future seasons since he has less than two years of major league service time.", "source": {"uri": "mlbtraderumors.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MLB Trade Rumors"}, "authors": [{"uri": "darragh_mcdonald@mlbtraderumors.com", "name": "Darragh McDonald", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Plate appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Guillorme", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luis Guillorme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_player", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Utility player"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_for_assignment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Designated for assignment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Gardner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brett Gardner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Triple-A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Left fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Martinez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

Pivetta has been on the IL since April 9 due to a flexor strain in his pitching elbow but will return from a six-week absence to start for Boston opposite old friend Chris Sale.\n\nIndications are that Japanese rookie right-hander Naoyuki Uwasawa, who was exchanging goodbyes with coaches in the visitors clubhouse at Truist Park after Tuesday's loss, will be optioned back to Triple-A Worcester to make room on the active roster for Pivetta. Uwasawa pitched just twice (four innings) since being called up from Triple-A Worcester on April 28, logging two innings on back-to-back days Thursday and Friday. The 30-year-old NPB veteran threw two perfect frames Thursday against the Giants but ran into trouble Friday, allowing two hits, two walks and a run against the Twins. The Sox were using him as a long reliever.\n\nIn something of a surprise, it also looks like the Red Sox may be making a move on the position player side of things, too. Utility man Romy Gonzalez, who has been sidelined since April 11 with a left wrist sprain, was in the clubhouse after the game and is a candidate to be activated before Wednesday's game as a bench option. Gonzalez played three rehab games at Triple-A Worcester from Friday to Sunday but did not appear for the WooSox on Tuesday in Buffalo. It's unlikely he's joining the Red Sox for the final day of their road trip to not be activated.\n\nThe two candidates to be sent off the roster to accommodate Gonzalez's return are infielders David Hamilton and Zack Short. Hamilton has started just one of Boston's last 10 games and is barely used as a reserve. He can be optioned to Triple-A Worcester while remaining on the 40-man roster. Short joined the Sox via trade on May 1 and is 0-for-7 with four strikeouts in two games (May 2 and May 5). He's out of minor league options so the Red Sox would have to designate him for assignment to clear a roster spot.", "source": {"uri": "masslive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MassLive"},

One computer click at a time", "body": "BOSTON -- The busiest person in the Boston Red Sox organization these days isn't necessarily the manager, the pitching coach or the head of baseball operations. Sometimes, it's a guy named Mike Regan who, yes, had a few minutes to talk last week, but did so literally while cradling his laptop in his arms like a baby. Regan's title is director of major-league operations, and he describes his job as essentially making a bunch of spoken words actually mean something in the real world.\n\n\"You can't talk things into fruition,\" Regan said.\n\nThere's been a lot of Red Sox fruition happening lately. Since last Saturday, they've made 26 official transactions in 12 days. On Wednesday, they activated starter Nick Pivetta from the injured list, did the same with utility man Romy Gonzalez, optioned pitcher Naoyuki Uwasawa back to Triple A, and designated infielder Zack Short for assignment. The Red Sox had traded for Short barely a week ago, but multiple injuries have sparked a flurry of additions and demotions as chief baseball officer Craig Breslow works the phones and manager Alex Cora announces the daily lineups.\n\nRegan and his cohorts, meanwhile, are responsible for making those decisions actually mean something.\n\n\"There are things that have to happen in order to kind of memorialize all of the conversation,\" Regan said.\n\nFor example, Breslow agreed last week to acquire Short from the Mets. A day later, Cora put Short in the lineup at second base. But in between, someone had to officially move Short from the Mets to the Red Sox, then make room for him on the active roster and actually activate him. In that case, it was second-year Red Sox assistant for major-league operations Anna Clemson who did the computer work. Clemson, Regan and assistant director Alex Gimenez are the Red Sox officials responsible for handling eBIS, the electronic Baseball Information System, which Major League Baseball uses to track and record every roster move from the major leagues through the minors.\n\nHave you ever made a video game trade or signed a fantasy league player and wondered how much different the real thing must be?\n\nTurns out that aside from all the zeros after the dollar signs, the technical machinations are pretty similar. The eBIS database includes every affiliated player in the game, and the Mets trade -- at least, in the digital world -- was as simple as moving Short's name from the Mets to the Red Sox. Putting him on the active roster meant clicking on Enmanuel Valdez, changing Valdez's status from major-league roster to optional Triple-A assignment, then moving Short to the open spot on the Red Sox's active roster.\n\n\"Those are the buttons that get pushed,\" Regan said. \"Sometimes there's questions that come up afterward when MLB wants clarity on something, and we answer those, but yeah, it's handled exactly as you said, or not too far off.\"\n\nThe Red Sox didn't announce last Wednesday's lineup until 33 minutes before game time because they were waiting to ensure new first baseman Dominic Smith, who'd been signed that afternoon, would be available (the daily lineups are submitted through eBIS, so Cora literally could not put Smith in the official lineup until the database recognized him as a member of the team). On Friday, they activated Vaughn Grissom from the injured list and played him immediately at second base. Pivetta was on the mound and Gonzalez at first base on Wednesday, within hours of being officially returned from rehab assignments. It's common, Regan said, to give the league a heads-up whenever a roster move is in the works (the league ultimately has to approve each transaction).\n\nIf a move is going to happen late, it's customary to let the opposing team know it's coming. In the case of a trade, either team can enter the transaction into the system, and officials communicate to decide which will do the honors.\n\nSo, what would have happened last week if someone clicked the wrong name and instead of Dominic Smith tried to put Josh Smith or Pavin Smith or Ozzie Smith on the Red Sox's roster?\n\n\"I think we all operate with, like, a high degree of paranoia to make sure that doesn't happen,\" Regan said.\n\neBIS (pronounced like E-Biss) can be accessed through a phone, but Regan said he prefers using his laptop. Paranoia rarely likes shortcuts, and Regan also likes to talk through his transactions as he's entering them, which can lead to awkward mutterings at the kitchen table.\n\n\"My wife laughs because I often am reading things out loud,\" Regan said. \"Like, if I'm working from home and something's happening, I am reading things out loud to make sure it's exactly right, and she just thinks it's a funny process for me overhearing what I'm reading.\"\n\nOverhearing isn't typically a concern, but overstepping is. No player gets added to a roster without someone else coming off, and whether it's a trade, a demotion, an injury diagnosis or a release, Regan said the Red Sox have an organizational philosophy that guards against players finding out second-hand about a move. Cora and Breslow tend to handle the talking, and while demotions and cuts can be long and difficult conversations, welcoming new players -- especially lately -- tends to happen pretty quickly.\n\n\"It's short, to be honest with you,\" Cora said. \"You know the situation and what can happen in two or three days or in a week or in a month, but they're welcomed and, 'Hey, do your job.' That's what we're trying to accomplish.\"\n\nAll Regan is trying to accomplish is to create a digital footprint of the personal dialogue. He doesn't put anything into the system, he said, until the conversations are complete. His first year handling eBIS for the Red Sox was 2020 when COVID-19 created an unusual amount of roster chaos and general uncertainty. It not only gave Regan a crash course on the system, but an appreciation for the people behind the moves as well.\n\neBIS might technically be the way a move becomes official, but Regan said Red Sox executive vice president of baseball operations Brian O'Halloran taught him to think the opposite way. The discussion is the real move. The database entry is just a way to confirm, honor and remember that conversation. Hence Regan's use of the word \"memorialize\" when describing his job.\n\nSo far this season, the Red Sox have put 16 players on the injured list. In the past week and a half, they've made three trades (all for cash, which also gets entered into eBIS). They've designated four players for assignment, three of whom cleared waivers to be sent outright to Triple A. The Red Sox have optioned four others to Triple A, called up one from the minors, and signed one to a major-league deal. They've started three rehab assignments, and already ended two of them. They've acquired a player, and DFA'd him after seven at-bats.\n\nEvery move is discussed at length, but no one really goes anywhere until the computer says so.\n\n\"Before (any) transaction happens, there's a lot of boxes to check,\" Regan said. \"So, it's really making sure that stuff is centralized and the transaction happens.\"", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news",

The toss had been delayed by 30 minutes due to slight rain in the city, with clouds and windy conditions on offer right now. Sunday\u2019s match will be played on the pitch which hosted Netherlands-South Africa clash on Saturday, which the Proteas won by four wickets. Imad comes back into Pakistan\u2019s playing eleven after a side strain kept him out of the side\u2019s surprising loss in their tournament opener to co-hosts USA at Dallas earlier this week.\u201d We will bowl first because of the weather and moisture in the pitch.\u201d \u201cThe conditions suit us, we have four fast bowlers. We will try to use it to our best. Past is past, we are looking forward to today\u2019s match, we are ready and will give our 100%. Always a big game, our confidence is always high for India vs Pakistan matches,\u201d said captain Babar Azam. India have a 6-1 head-to-head record against Pakistan in Men\u2019s T20 World Cup meetings. The last five T20 World Cup games between the two teams have been won by the chasing side. India won their opening match against Ireland by eight wickets at New York earlier this week. India skipper Rohit Sharma said he would have liked to bowl first too and added his playing eleven is unchanged. \u201cWe need to assess how conditions play and come up with an idea of what a good score is. Those games have helped us assess conditions here.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve spoken about what we need to do as a batting unit to get a good score and then we\u2019ve got the bowling unit to defend. Every game is important in a World Cup, you can\u2019t just show up. Anything can happen,\u201d he said.

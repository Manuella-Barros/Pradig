(Picture Credit: AP)\n\nA resurgent United States under new coach Emma Hayes are hoping to establish themselves as the leading force in women's international football once again by claiming the gold medal in Saturday's Olympic final against Brazil and their legendary skipper Marta.\n\nThe USA came into the Olympics with a rejuvenated squad and a point to prove after a poor showing at last year's World Cup, when they were eliminated in the last 16.\n\nThey also performed below par at each of the last two Olympics, finishing out of the medals at Rio 2016 before taking bronze three years ago in Tokyo.\n\nBut the arrival of renowned English coach Hayes from Chelsea has given the USA the boost they needed, and they have been inspired on their way to the final by the exciting attacking trio of Sophia Smith, Mallory Swanson and Trinity Rodman.\n\nThey have each scored three goals at the tournament, with the USA winning all three group games against Zambia, Germany and Australia before dispatching both Japan and the Germans in extra time in the knockout rounds.\n\nNow they are hoping to add to their women's football record haul of four golds and win the title for the first time since London 2012.\n\n\"Emma came in so soon before this tournament, so we knew that was going to be a challenge, but she just came in flying and we absolutely love her,\" said Smith, the Colorado-born forward who turns 24 on the day of the final.\n\n\"She has worked every day to build our trust and show us she cares about us. She is such a great coach and such a great mentor.\n\n\"We are a completely different team and a lot of the credit goes to Emma. She has communicated everyone's roles very clearly. We are really excited for her to be our coach for a really long time.\"\n\nThird time lucky?\n\nThe USA's position as the undisputed global powerhouse of the women's game looked to be gone for some time following last year's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand, when a brilliant Spain team led by Aitana Bonmati were crowned champions.\n\nHowever, Spain missed out in their bid to add Olympic gold to that title and the UEFA Nations League after they were surprisingly beaten 4-2 by Brazil in Tuesday's semi-final in Marseille.\n\nInstead it is the Brazilians who will meet the USA in the gold medal match and they will be attempting to make it third time lucky after losing to the same opponents in the Athens final in 2004 and in Beijing in 2008.\n\nBoth of those finals were won by the USA in extra time, and both featured Marta, the Brazilian legend and multiple winner of the FIFA world player of the year award.\n\nNow 38, she is appearing at her sixth and likely last Olympics, and is hoping to sign off with gold to go with her two silver medals.\n\nMarta back from ban\n\nMarta missed both the quarter-final win against hosts France and the semi-final against Spain due to suspension after being sent off for a reckless challenge in Brazil's final group game, also against the Spanish.\n\n\"Now she will be able to finish her Olympics playing in a final, where she deserves to be. I hope she manages to come away with the gold medal,\" said Gabi Portilho, who scored in both the quarter-final and semi-final.\n\nIt remains to be seen if the final will turn out to be Marta's farewell on the international stage for her country, or whether she could be tempted to keep going until the 2027 World Cup which Brazil will host.\n\n\"Marta has changed the game of soccer around the world,\" said Rodman of Marta, who has spent much of her club career in the United States.\n\n\"She is such a talented soccer player but also a great human. I have always looked up to her. She has a legacy forever, but we want that gold.\"", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [{"uri": "harshit_bisht@news18.com", "name": "Harshit Bisht",

I hope she manages to come away with the gold medal,\" said Gabi Portilho, who scored in both the quarter-final and semi-final.\n\nIt remains to be seen if the final will turn out to be Marta's farewell on the international stage for her country, or whether she could be tempted to keep going until the 2027 World Cup which Brazil will host.\n\n\"Marta has changed the game of soccer around the world,\" said Rodman of Marta, who has spent much of her club career in the United States.\n\n\"She is such a talented soccer player but also a great human. I have always looked up to her. She has a legacy forever, but we want that gold.\"\n\nas/dj", "source": {"uri": "ccenterdispatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Clay Center Dispatch On-Line"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The two teams met in the final again at the 2008 Beijing Games, and Brazil again came away with the silver with a 1-0 loss.\n\nSo it's fitting that for her international sendoff Brazil again faces the United States in the Olympic final. The two teams meet Saturday at Parc des Princes in Paris.\n\nMarta, now 38, has said that after six Olympics and six Women's World Cups, it's time to hand over the team to the next generation. She has never won a major international title -- either at the Olympics or World Cup.\n\nSo winning gold and beating the nemesis United States at the same time would be a sweet way to walk away.\n\n\"It's been so much of my life, since I was 14, I left home and then I just live soccer every single day,\" she told The Associated Press before the tournament. \"I just feel like maybe it's time to just take a little bit away from that and let the young players shine.\"\n\nMarta is well known to the young players on the U.S. team, not just because she's one of the best women to ever play the game, but also because she plays in the United States with the Orlando Pride.\n\n\"Marta is for sure the player I looked up to growing up,\" U.S. forward Sophia Smith said. \"Whenever I would watch highlights of players with my dad, it was always Marta.\"\n\nThe 23-year-old Smith plays for the Portland Thorns.\n\n\"We get to play against her in the NWSL, we're really lucky for that,\" she said, \"and to play against her in this game, in this magnitude of the game, is so special. I know she would want us to give her our best game. That's that's the highest level of respect you can give someone.\"\n\nBetter known just by her first name, Marta Vieira da Silva has scored a record 119 goals in 184 international appearances.\n\nMarta grew up playing street soccer with the boys in Dois Riachos, a town in eastern Brazil some 1,250 miles north of Rio de Janeiro. She was just 17 when she appeared at the 2003 World Cup, held in the United States.\n\nShe has the career record for most World Cup goals with 17, and she has 13 Olympic goals, one away from matching compatriot Cristiane's record.\n\n\"It goes without saying, Marta has changed the game of soccer around the world,\" U.S. forward Trinity Rodman said. \"She is such a talented soccer player, but also a great human, which speaks volumes. I've always looked up to her. I think we all kind of do. She's a legend forever.\"\n\nMarta's journey in her final big tournament has not been smooth.\n\nShe was handed a red card for a foul on Spain's Olga Carmona in the Brazil's final group-stage match. That merited a two-match suspension from FIFA, so she missed the quarterfinals against hosts France and the semifinals, again against Spain.\n\nBrazil upset the Women's World Cup champions 4-2 in a match Tuesday in Marseille.\n\n\"Honestly, in these games Marta was out, we did it for her,\" teammate Angelina said. \"We want to give her a really great sendoff. It was a dream of mine to play with Marta -- and now it's a dream come true.\"\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anne_m_peterson@register-herald.com", "name": "Anne M.

She is such a great coach and such a great mentor.\n\n\"We are a completely different team and a lot of the credit goes to Emma. She has communicated everyone's roles very clearly. We are really excited for her to be our coach for a really long time.\"\n\nThe USA's position as the undisputed global powerhouse of the women's game looked to be gone for some time following last year's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand, when a brilliant Spain team led by Aitana Bonmati were crowned champions.\n\nHowever, Spain missed out in their bid to add Olympic gold to that title and the UEFA Nations League after they were surprisingly beaten 4-2 by Brazil in Tuesday's semi-final in Marseille.\n\nInstead it is the Brazilians who will meet the USA in the gold medal match and they will be attempting to make it third time lucky after losing to the same opponents in the Athens final in 2004 and in Beijing in 2008.\n\nBoth of those finals were won by the USA in extra time, and both featured Marta, the Brazilian legend and multiple winner of the FIFA world player of the year award.\n\nNow 38, she is appearing at her sixth and likely last Olympics, and is hoping to sign off with gold to go with her two silver medals.", "source": {"uri": "wionews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WION"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Hayes",

She is such a great coach and such a great mentor. We are a completely different team and a lot of the credit goes to Emma. She has communicated everyone's roles very clearly.\"\n\nSpain missed out in their bid to add Olympic gold to their World Cup title after they were surprisingly beaten 4-2 by Brazil in the semi-final in Marseille on Aug 6.\n\nThe Brazilians will be attempting to make it third time lucky after losing to the Americans in the Athens final in 2004 and in Beijing in 2008.\n\nBoth of those finals featured Marta, the Brazilian legend and multiple winner of the Fifa World Player of the Year award. Now 38, she is appearing at her sixth and likely last Olympics, and aims to sign off with gold to go with her two silver medals.\n\nMarta missed both the quarter-final win against France and the semi-final against Spain due to suspension after being sent off for a reckless challenge in Brazil's final group game, also against the Spaniards.\n\n\"Now she will be able to finish her Olympics playing in a final, where she deserves to be. I hope she manages to come away with the gold medal,\" said Gabi Portilho, who scored in both the quarter-final and semi-final.

For her final international tournament with Brazil, Marta is back where it all started.\n\nParis, Aug 9 (AP) For her final international tournament with Brazil, Marta is back where it all started.\n\nThe six-time world player of the year was just 18 when she first played in the Olympics 20 years ago.\n\nAlso Read | France vs Spain Paris Olympics 2024 Gold Medal Match Free Live Streaming and Match Time in IST: How to Watch Free Live Telecast of FRA U-23 vs ESP U-23 Final on TV and Online Stream Details of Men's Football Match in India.\n\nBack then, Brazil reached the gold medal match in Athens but fell to the United States 2-1. The two teams met in the final again at the 2008 Beijing Games, and Brazil again came away with the silver with a 1-0 loss.\n\nSo it's fitting that for her international sendoff Brazil again faces the United States in the Olympic final. The two teams meet Saturday at Parc des Princes in Paris.\n\nAlso Read | Australia Include Indian Origin Player Vishwa Ramkumar in 16 Member Squad for U19 Tour of India.\n\nMarta, now 38, has said that after six Olympics and six Women's World Cups, it's time to hand over the team to the next generation. She has never won a major international title -- either at the Olympics or World Cup.\n\nSo winning gold and beating the nemesis United States at the same time would be a sweet way to walk away.\n\n\"It's been so much of my life, since I was 14, I left home and then I just live soccer every single day,\" she told The Associated Press before the tournament. \"I just feel like maybe it's time to just take a little bit away from that and let the young players shine.\"\n\nMarta is well known to the young players on the US team, not just because she's one of the best women to ever play the game, but also because she plays in the United States with the Orlando Pride.\n\n\"Marta is for sure the player I looked up to growing up,\" U.S. forward Sophia Smith said. \"Whenever I would watch highlights of players with my dad, it was always Marta.\"\n\nThe 23-year-old Smith plays for the Portland Thorns.\n\n\"We get to play against her in the NWSL, we're really lucky for that,\" she said, \"and to play against her in this game, in this magnitude of the game, is so special. I know she would want us to give her our best game. That's that's the highest level of respect you can give someone.\"\n\nBetter known just by her first name, Marta Vieira da Silva has scored a record 119 goals in 184 international appearances.\n\nMarta grew up playing street soccer with the boys in Dois Riachos, a town in eastern Brazil some 1,250 miles north of Rio de Janeiro. She was just 17 when she appeared at the 2003 World Cup, held in the United States.\n\nShe has the career record for most World Cup goals with 17, and she has 13 Olympic goals, one away from matching compatriot Cristiane's record.\n\n\"It goes without saying, Marta has changed the game of soccer around the world,\" U.S. forward Trinity Rodman said. \"She is such a talented soccer player, but also a great human, which speaks volumes. I've always looked up to her. I think we all kind of do. She's a legend forever.\"\n\nMarta's journey in her final big tournament has not been smooth.\n\nShe was handed a red card for a foul on Spain's Olga Carmona in the Brazil's final group-stage match. That merited a two-match suspension from FIFA, so she missed the quarterfinals against hosts France and the semifinals, again against Spain.\n\nBrazil upset the Women's World Cup champions 4-2 in a match Tuesday in Marseille.\n\n\"Honestly, in these games Marta was out, we did it for her,\" teammate Angelina said. \"We want to give her a really great sendoff. It was a dream of mine to play with Marta -- and now it's a dream come true.\" (AP) UNG 7/21/2024", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [],

The two teams met in the final again at the 2008 Beijing Games, and Brazil again came away with the silver with a 1-0 loss.\n\nSo it's fitting that for her international sendoff Brazil again faces the United States in the Olympic final.

However, her teammates fought to potentially hand her a fairytale farewell by reaching the final, where she will play after serving a two-match suspension.\n\nThe football programme at the Olympic Games has provided a number of subplots. The French men's side has carried the weight of expectation on home soil with the deftness of a feline, reaching the final at Paris 2024.\n\nThey are set to battle with a Spanish outfit that has been equally inspired, buoyed by the tournament-winning heroics of the senior side at the 2024 European Championship just weeks before the start of the Olympics.\n\nIn the women's football draw, the US women's team has shown glimpses of its historic aura as a powerhouse in the sport. This followed a couple of years of regression, evidenced by their round of 16 elimination by Sweden at the 2023 World Cup. It was the team's earliest exit from the tournament they have won a record four times.\n\nRead more: Olympic Games Paris 2024\n\nHowever, the dominant theme heading into the Games' football finals has to do with the swansong of an all-time great of the sport - Marta Vieira da Silva (better known as, simply, Marta). The 38-year-old announced that Paris 2024 would be her final major tournament at international level.\n\nIn the national colours of Brazil, which she has donned since 2002, Marta has flourished. She has three Copa America gold medals with her country. Although an Olympic gold medal has proved to be elusive for her and her compatriots, she boasts two silver medals from the Games.\n\nAt club level - playing in her native country as well as Sweden and the US - she has won domestic and continental trophies. Never passively either. She played a key role regularly as her teams stormed to silverware.\n\nIt is because of the skilful Brazilian's incredible legacy that one of the pre-Paris 2024 sub-stories was around Marta and her compatriots, and whether they can finally win an Olympic gold after a couple of near misses.\n\nBrazil sneaked into the quarterfinals of the women's tournament in France as one of the two best third-placed teams after winning just one of their three group games, when they beat Nigeria 1-0. The rest of the group phase saw them suffer two consecutive defeats, to Japan and Spain.\n\nThe latter contest - in which the Brazilians were defeated 2-0 by reigning world champions Spain - Marta was shown a red card for dangerous play. The forward caught Spaniard Olga Carmona's head with a high boot as she attempted a clearance.\n\nDespite tears from the women's football legend, protestations from her teammates and looks of sympathy from the opposition - the referee ordered Marta to leave the pitch. A two-suspension meant that Brazil had to reach the last four for Marta to return.\n\nAt that moment, it appeared that Marta's journey with international football (which has seen her capped 200 times by her country) was over, in the most unexpected manner. Especially with tournament hosts France being Brazil's quarterfinal opponents, as well as the Brazilians being in poor form at the Games.\n\nHowever, they shocked the French 1-0 to set up a rematch with Spain in the semifinals.\n\nFollowing a legal appeal, Brazil was hopeful that Marta's ban would be reduced to one match and she'd be available for the mammoth tussle against the Spanish. The Court of Arbitration for Sport dismissed the Brazilian application.\n\nThis may have motivated the South Americans even more ahead of their tough test against the Spanish in the last four. They surprisingly passed the test with a comfortable 4-2 win over the 2023 World Cup winners. Ensuring that Marta would be granted another opportunity to craft her farewell.\n\n\"Honestly, in these games without Marta, we did it for her,\" midfielder Angelina said. \"We want to give her a really great send-off. It was a dream of mine to play with Marta. And now it's a dream come true. To do it in the final in the Olympics, it's just perfect.\"\n\nIn the final, which is set for 5pm SA time on Saturday, the Brazilians will encounter another extremely tough challenge when they clash with a rejuvenated US women's side.\n\nThe Americans went into Paris in rebuild mode after a disastrous World Cup campaign in 2023, which saw them fail to make the semifinals of the tournament for the first time in their history. In the aftermath, head coach Vlatko Andonovski resigned after four years in charge.\n\nTwila Kilgore held the fort on an interim basis as the US looked for a coach who would restore them as one of the best football sides in the world. The hierarchy of US football identified Chelsea women's coach Emma Hayes, agreeing terms with her in late 2023.\n\nShe officially took over just two months before the Games, leaving Chelsea after more than a decade in charge of the Blues.\n\nAlready, she has an opportunity to grant the US its first women's football gold medal since they last won one at London 2012. They were also gold medal winners in 2008 and 2004. At Tokyo 2020 they claimed bronze.\n\nDespite the Americans having their own golden ambitions, they recognise the significance of playing Marta in an Olympic final as her international career draws to a close.\n\n\"Marta has changed the game of soccer around the world. She's such a talented player, but also a great human, which speaks volumes,\" said US forward Trinity Rodman, who is the daughter of former basketball player Dennis Rodman.\n\n\"I've always looked up to her. We all kind of do ... I love her. But we want the gold,\" the 22-year-old added.", "source": {"uri": "dailymaverick.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Maverick"}, "authors": [{"uri": "yanga_sibembe@dailymaverick.co.za",

There is not going to be a Marta forever,\" she said, beginning to point down the barrel.\n\n\"The women's game depends on you to survive. So think about that. Value it more. Cry in the beginning so you can smile in the end.\"\n\nFive years later, the same generation Marta pleaded with to carry the torch has now lifted her, and Brazil, to a gold-medal match against the United States at the Paris Olympics. Brazil did so largely without its superstar on the pitch, but rather as a motivating presence on the sidelines. After receiving a red card and a two-game suspension for a foul committed in Brazil's group-stage loss to Spain, Marta's finale was mired in uncertainty. In April, the 38-year-old had announced her plan to retire from international soccer at the end of the year, making her sixth Olympic appearance her last. Needing to advance to the medal rounds in order to see Marta take the pitch again in Paris, Brazil fought past tournament hosts France and reigning World Cup champions Spain in its two knockout matches. In doing so, Brazil guaranteed itself a place on the Olympic podium and secured a fitting stage for its icon's farewell.\n\nIt will be the team's first Olympic final appearance since consecutive appearances in 2004 and '08, when Brazil took home silver medals after falling to the U.S. in both fixtures. Marta, of course, was there for those matches. She is the only player (by a long shot) competing in Saturday's Parisienne rematch who was present for that instant classic, extra-time thriller in Beijing. She was also there in '07 in China, when Brazil thumped the U.S., 4-0, in the World Cup semifinals, with Marta scoring a brace. And the two nations' quarterfinal epic at the 2011 World Cup? Marta was there too. Despite her scoring a brace in that match, the U.S. managed to pull out a win on penalty kicks-thanks to the late-game heroics from Megan Rapinoe and Abby Wambach.\n\nIn the available videos from some of those moments, especially in Marta's earliest major tournaments, one must contend with a grainy haze now synonymous with the technology of the early aughts to make her out. Longevity, while remarkable, isn't Marta's most notable accomplishment though. She hasn't just seen a lot in her nearly 20-year intentional career-Marta's done a lot, transforming the sport. With 17 goals, Marta is the top World Cup goalscorer (men's or women's) of all time. A stat worthy of her GOAT status.\n\nBut no quantifiable figure, no matter how jaw-dropping, can truly capture the tour de force that is Marta. Little debate surrounds who is the best women's player to grace the pitch-it's Marta. She's your favorite player's favorite player. A footballer's footballer.\n\n\"Marta's just the greatest player, I think, that's ever played in our game,\" Rapinoe said ahead of the 2023 SheBelieves Cup final.\n\nThis is a sentiment so unanimously shared that it often goes without saying. On the field, Marta appears to dance on the ball as she weaves through swarming defenders. She'll disorient opponents, flicking a ball overheard or nutmegging those who dare get too close. Her playing style can resemble a game of cat and mouse, luring a defender in only to expose, and frankly, embarrass them. That notorious flare mixed with her vision, finishing ability and technical supremacy makes Marta a once-in-a-generation footballing talent one must behold to fully appreciate. She's been likened to Pel\u00e9, even nicknamed \"Pel\u00e9 in Skirts\", a moniker the 82-year-old Brazilian icon co-signs. Meant as high praise no doubt, the designation is imprecise. Marta is a phenomenon all her own.\n\nHer mentality has come to define an era of soccer. As exquisite as Marta can look between the touchlines, she also carries herself with an apparent grit. She's intense, dogged and wields a competitive edge. Perhaps that tenacity stems from her teenage years, when she boarded a bus at just 14, leaving behind her family and traveling over 1,000 miles to Rio de Janeiro to play soccer. The giant of women's football hails from Dois Riachos, a small municipality with a population of just 11,000, and one that, at the time, had few opportunities for a girl to pursue her footballing dreams. Now, those on Brazil's national team and players across the country, look to emulate Marta's mental toughness and staying power.\n\n\"My generation, we did not have female players to look up to, so now to have players like her, especially with what she achieved and who she became, it's very important,\" Brazilian soccer star and 1999 Women's World Cup Golden Boot winner Sissi told CNN in 2023. \"You already saw how much the game changed in Brazil. Now, people can say: 'I want to be like Marta.' \"\n\nLegacy has been a concern of Marta's for some time, but not necessarily her own. When she said, \"There is not going to be a Marta forever,\" she wasn't worried about her legend, but rather the health of her successors. She wants to leave Brazilian women's football (and by extension, the sport) in a better place than when she found it. And it is. How could it not be?\n\nBut on Saturday in Paris, Marta also has the chance to etch an entry into her own biography by doing something she's yet to do in her career: win a major tournament outside of South America. Knowing Marta and this Brazilian side, they will be ruthless in that pursuit. But once the final whistle blows, no matter the result, an all-time great will exit a stage she helped build. One can only hope she'll heed her own words: \"Cry in the beginning so you can smile in the end.\"\n\nThis article was originally published on www.si.com as The Stage Is Set for a Fitting Farewell to

It's the fourth time in her career Marta has made the final at a major tournament, and third at the Olympics.\n\nThe Brazilians lost to the USWNT in 2004 and 2008. They also lost to Germany at the 2007 World Cup.\n\n\"We all wanted to play the final at the Olympics regardless of the circumstances. But of course this is an extra motivation,\" Angelina said Friday. \"We want to give this medal to Marta. She has given us so much throughout her career. She's given everything she has to us and women's football.\n\n\"She really deserves to play in the final.\"\n\n\u227b Get Olympics updates in your texts! Join USA TODAY Sports' WhatsApp Channel\n\nMarta, 38, is considered the best player in women's soccer history. She is a six-time FIFA Player of the Year and her 17 goals at the World Cup are a record for any player, male or female. She also was the first player to score at five World Cups, a mark since matched by Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo and Canada's Christine Sinclair.\n\nHer influence off the field has been equally significant. She has lobbied passionately for more support of the women's game and encouraged young women to continue playing regardless of the challenges they face.\n\nBecause of Marta, the women's game is no longer an afterthought in soccer-mad Brazil.\n\nFor years, women in Brazil had few opportunities to play \"the beautiful game.' Those who did were ridiculed. But because of Marta, and her mesmerizing style of play, Brazil has gotten behind its women's team.\n\nShe also inspired this current generation of players in her two decades-plus on the national team. As she hoped she would.\n\n\"For all of us that love the women's game, she's been more than just a role model and icon. She's been the best player over a long period of time,\" USWNT coach Emma Hayes said. \"But what she's done for Brazil and for those women in the generation coming through, the inspiration she's been to them, I'm happy she gets the opportunity.\"\n\nIt's this next generation that ensured Marta will leave the game with another Olympic medal, possibly a gold one.\n\nShe received a two-game suspension for kicking Spain's Olga Carmona in the head in the final group-stage game. Marta was trying to win an aerial ball and jumped with her leg raised to try and bring it down, but connected with Carmona's head instead.\n\nShe was distraught after being shown a red card, sobbing as she left the field.\n\nBut Brazil won its quarterfinal, beating host France. It then stunned World Cup champion Spain in the semifinals, cruising to a 4-2 victory.\n\n\"For us to be able to get to the final, and for this to be her last Olympics, with the chance to get the gold medal, it's just dream come true for all of us,\" Angelina said. \"We're just really excited to have this opportunity.\"\n\nThe USA TODAY app brings you every Team USA medal -- right when it happens.

Her team had just been booted from the 2019 Women's World Cup, but Marta had loftier things on her mind, and this post-match interview was now her bully pulpit.\n\n\"It's wanting more. It's training more. It's taking care of yourself more. It's being ready to play 90 plus 30 minutes. This is what I ask of the girls. There's not going to be a Formiga forever. There is not going to be a Marta forever,\" she said, beginning to point down the barrel.\n\n\"The women's game depends on you to survive. So think about that. Value it more. Cry in the beginning so you can smile in the end.\"\n\nFive years later, the same generation Marta pleaded with to carry the torch has now lifted her, and Brazil, to a gold-medal match against the United States at the Paris Olympics. Brazil did so largely without its superstar on the pitch, but rather as a motivating presence on the sidelines. After receiving a red card and a two-game suspension for a foul committed in Brazil's group-stage loss to Spain, Marta's finale was mired in uncertainty. In April, the 38-year-old had announced her plan to retire from international soccer at the end of the year, making her sixth Olympic appearance her last. Needing to advance to the medal rounds in order to see Marta take the pitch again in Paris, Brazil fought past tournament hosts France and reigning World Cup champions Spain in its two knockout matches. In doing so, Brazil guaranteed itself a place on the Olympic podium and secured a fitting stage for its icon's farewell.\n\nIt will be the team's first Olympic final appearance since consecutive appearances in 2004 and '08, when Brazil took home silver medals after falling to the U.S. in both fixtures. Marta, of course, was there for those matches. She is the only player (by a long shot) competing in Saturday's Parisienne rematch who was present for that instant classic, extra-time thriller in Beijing. She was also there in '07 in China, when Brazil thumped the U.S., 4-0, in the World Cup semifinals, with Marta scoring a brace. And the two nations' quarterfinal epic at the 2011 World Cup? Marta was there too. Despite her scoring a brace in that match, the U.S. managed to pull out a win on penalty kicks -- thanks to the late-game heroics from Megan Rapinoe and Abby Wambach.\n\nIn the available videos from some of those moments, especially in Marta's earliest major tournaments, one must contend with a grainy haze now synonymous with the technology of the early aughts to make her out. Longevity, while remarkable, isn't Marta's most notable accomplishment though. She hasn't just seen a lot in her nearly 20-year intentional career -- Marta's done a lot, transforming the sport. With 17 goals, Marta is the top World Cup goalscorer (men's or women's) of all time. A stat worthy of her GOAT status.\n\nBut no quantifiable figure, no matter how jaw-dropping, can truly capture the tour de force that is Marta. Little debate surrounds who is the best women's player to grace the pitch -- it's Marta. She's your favorite player's favorite player. A footballer's footballer.\n\n\"Marta's just the greatest player, I think, that's ever played in our game,\" Rapinoe said ahead of the 2023 SheBelieves Cup final.\n\nThis is a sentiment so unanimously shared that it often goes without saying. On the field, Marta appears to dance on the ball as she weaves through swarming defenders. She'll disorient opponents, flicking a ball overheard or nutmegging those who dare get too close. Her playing style can resemble a game of cat and mouse, luring a defender in only to expose, and frankly, embarrass them. That notorious flare mixed with her vision, finishing ability and technical supremacy makes Marta a once-in-a-generation footballing talent one must behold to fully appreciate. She's been likened to Pel\u00e9, even nicknamed \"Pel\u00e9 in Skirts\", a moniker the 82-year-old Brazilian icon co-signs. Meant as high praise no doubt, the designation is imprecise. Marta is a phenomenon all her own.\n\nHer mentality has come to define an era of soccer. As exquisite as Marta can look between the touchlines, she also carries herself with an apparent grit. She's intense, dogged and wields a competitive edge. Perhaps that tenacity stems from her teenage years, when she boarded a bus at just 14, leaving behind her family and traveling over 1,000 miles to Rio de Janeiro to play soccer. The giant of women's football hails from Dois Riachos, a small municipality with a population of just 11,000, and one that, at the time, had few opportunities for a girl to pursue her footballing dreams. Now, those on Brazil's national team and players across the country, look to emulate Marta's mental toughness and staying power.\n\n\"My generation, we did not have female players to look up to, so now to have players like her, especially with what she achieved and who she became, it's very important,\" Brazilian soccer star and 1999 Women's World Cup Golden Boot winner Sissi told CNN in 2023. \"You already saw how much the game changed in Brazil. Now, people can say: 'I want to be like Marta.' \"\n\nLegacy has been a concern of Marta's for some time, but not necessarily her own. When she said, \"There is not going to be a Marta forever,\" she wasn't worried about her legend, but rather the health of her successors. She wants to leave Brazilian women's football (and by extension, the sport) in a better place than when she found it. And it is. How could it not be?\n\nBut on Saturday in Paris, Marta also has the chance to etch an entry into her own biography by doing something she's yet to do in her career: win a major tournament outside of South America. Knowing Marta and this Brazilian side, they will be ruthless in that pursuit. But once the final whistle blows, no matter the result, an all-time great will exit a stage she helped build. One can only hope she'll heed her own words: \"Cry in the beginning so you can smile in the end.\"", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri":

While the USWNT has been dominant in the tournament under new coach Emma Hayes -- it has won all its games -- Brazil had a shaky group stage before beating World Cup holders Spain and hosts France in the knockouts.\n\nWill the new-look USWNT win a fifth Olympic gold medal, its first since 2012? Or will Brazil legend Marta finally win an international trophy with her country? Although the U.S. has been successful against Brazil in recent times, anything is possible in tournament soccer.\n\nAhead of Saturday's final, ESPN's Sam Borden and Jeff Kassouf break down the matchup, answer the biggest questions and give their predictions.\n\nWhy could the USWNT win?\n\nCall them whatever you want -- and the nickname with the most sticking power lately seems to be \"Triple Trouble\" -- but Trinity Rodman, Mallory Swanson and Sophia Smith have been the gas pedal for this group throughout the entire tournament. The trio has scored nine of the 11 American goals over five games in France, and they've done it in all ways: blasts from distance, cutbacks, through balls and scrambles.\n\nThere's no doubt that the U.S. will need a total team effort to beat a quality squad like Brazil, but there's also no denying that any success for the Americans will almost surely involve one of their frontline attackers doing something magical. Rodman had her moment in the quarters and Smith had hers in the semis -- is it Swanson's turn in the final? -- Borden\n\nWhy could Brazil win?\n\nBrazil is loaded with attacking talent deep enough to bring 2023 NWSL MVP Kerolin -- who miraculously made this team without playing for her club this year after tearing an ACL last fall -- off the bench in the semifinal (she scored in second-half stoppage time). They also got here without Marta for the past 2\u00bd games. Marta has literally shed a lot of tears in recent years while fighting her final on-field battles for this Brazil team, and her return from suspension for what will be her last Olympic game is an epic script. Finally sending off the six-time world player of the year with a major title, after so many near misses (including gold medal losses to the USWNT in 2004 and 2008) is an opportunity that won't be lost on this squad. -- Kassouf\n\nWhich duel do you think will be decisive in the final?\n\nThe USWNT's front three will get plenty of deserved attention, and there should be plenty of one-on-one matchups as this game develops if Brazil sticks with the three-back, but I'll go for the less obvious answer here to start: the midfield will define this game. Brazil will attempt to overload those central areas with a rotating cast, just as Germany did in the semifinal against the USWNT, and the U.S. midfield trio of Sam Coffey, Lindsey Horan and Rose Lavelle must find ways to get on the ball more often and distribute it with more precision. Marta has looked much younger than 38 in a stellar year for club and country, and she will be intent on putting her mark on one last major game against one of her original nemeses from 20 years ago. -- Kassouf\n\nI completely agree with you, Jeff, and I think that the one area where the U.S. has had some issues in France is in the midfield -- simply put, Horan and Lavelle haven't been consistent at all. In terms of a matchup, I'm looking a little further back, though -- Naomi Girma has been outstanding throughout the tournament and she'll have to lead another strong defensive effort again. As you said earlier, Brazil has real threats in attack (including coming off the bench) and their coach, Arthur Elias, asks his attackers to press high and often. Spain didn't handle that pressure from players like Gabi Portilho and Priscila, and the U.S. will have to do better if it wants to win. -- Borden\n\nUSWNT player to watch\n\nTrinity Rodman. It's hard not to point to Girma as she makes her case as the world's best center-back, but I think the wider audience discovering this game is going to be locked in on Rodman. Choosing one player from that front three of Rodman, Smith and Swanson is difficult, but there is a different energy to Rodman. She continues to show she is fitter than just about anyone on any field as she roams that right wing, and she has so often been the catalyst of USWNT attacks even beyond her three goals. A collective effort got the USWNT to this game, but Rodman is the player in form to take over this final. -- Kassouf\n\nBrazil player to watch\n\nMarta. Look, how do you pick anyone but Marta? Even the most massive USWNT fan -- if they truly love women's soccer -- has a tiny piece of them that wants Marta to finally have her moment. The Queen of Football has an unmatched r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and, at 38, is playing in her sixth Summer Games for Brazil but has never won a World Cup or Olympic title. As one might expect, the Brazilian team doesn't play through Marta the same way as it used to, but after missing the last 2\u00bd games following her straight red card, Marta will be back on stage for one last can't-miss show. -- Borden\n\nScore prediction\n\nUnited States 2-1 Brazil. Neither of these teams was widely expected to reach this game, and either victor would make for an incredible narrative. For the U.S., redemption after last year's epic World Cup failure; for Brazil, a poetic sendoff for the sport's all-time great. Tired legs will bring mistakes for both teams, and I think the U.S. front three is better suited to punish Brazil in those moments. -- Kassouf\n\nUnited States 3-2 Brazil. I'm with you on the storylines, Jeff -- either an amazing end for Marta or an incredible start for Hayes. In terms of the match, I may be blindly hopeful since international finals rarely are played wide open, but I think we could see more goals. I've said before I think Hayes has something special going, and so I'll stick with that: USWNT to win in a thriller. -- Borden", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"},

Why retiring Brazil soccer legend may not start vs. USA", "body": "Brazil superstar Marta is set to retire from international play after the 2024 Olympics in Paris.\n\nOne of the most legendary players in women's soccer history, the 38-year-old was at risk of an ignominious end to her career after being sent off against Spain in the final group-stage match. The red card left her suspended for two games, forced to look on as her teammates faced a pair of daunting matchups.\n\nYet thanks to sensational upsets over hosts France in the quarterfinals and a rematch with Spain in the semifinals, Marta will get a chance to win her country's first-ever gold medal.\n\nThe Sporting News has the details on Marta's possible return to the field and whether she will make the starting lineup as she rejoins the action.\n\nMORE: Marta ranks No. 1 among TSN's top 10 women's soccer players ever\n\nAfter missing Brazil's two knockout stage matches against France and Spain, Marta will be once again available for Brazil selection in the 2024 gold medal match.\n\nWith Marta back from suspension, it means Brazil may once again have the full compliment of seven bench players allowed, having been forced to play with six during her time on the sideline per Olympic rules.\n\nIt's not entirely certain that she will start, but it's a virtual certainty that Marta will see the field at some point, whether from the starting lineup or off the bench.\n\nSN's 2024 OLYMPICS HQ\n\nUpdated medal count | Day-by-day schedule | How to watch in USA\n\nIt would have seemed inconceivable at the onset of the tournament, but there's a real argument for Marta to begin this gold medal match vs. the USWNT on the bench.\n\nAt 38 years old, Marta still has a cutting edge to her game, but it's hard to argue against what this team achieved in her absence, and in such a condensed knockout tournament, form and vibes are of enormous importance to a team's success.\n\nThe Brazilian forwards have performed exceedingly well with Marta unavailable, starting with her replacement Gabi Portilho who scored in both games Marta was sidelined. Kerolin and Adriana Leal both scored goals in the semifinal against Spain, while Ana Vitoria, Ludmila, and Jheniffer have all been strong as well.\n\nMeanwhile, a fresh-legged Marta would be a game-breaker off the bench, having already scored once this summer as a substitute, coming off the bench to score against Jamaica in an early June friendly. She also has one of her five NWSL goals this season as a substitute, scoring the only goal of a 1-0 victory for the Orlando Pride over the Utah Royals back in April.\n\nWhile it would seem harsh to leave Marta on the bench of her final international match, but with the team in exceptional form in her absence and a first-ever gold medal on the line, Brazil head coach Arthur Elias may have a real decision to make.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sporting_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Sporting News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penalty card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejection_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ejection (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Soccer_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Soccer Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adriana_(footballer,_born_1996)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adriana (footballer, born 1996)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabi_Portilho", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gabi Portilho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Elias", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arthur Elias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerolin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kerolin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_Pride", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orlando Pride"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Women's_Soccer_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Women's Soccer League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Substitute (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_Royals_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Utah Royals FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_women's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States women's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitoria-Gasteiz", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vitoria-Gasteiz"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vitoria-Gasteiz"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://ng-sportingnews.com/s3/files/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-08/GettyImages-2164721154.jpg?itok=bsiTx3Yi", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803279", "eventUri": "eng-9803279", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

New head coach Emma Hayes has breathed new life in to the attacking \"trident\" of Sophia Smith, Trinity Rodman, and Mallory Swanson who have three goals each at the Olympics to bring this side to the precipice of reestablishing itself atop the women's football landscape.\n\nBrazil, meanwhile, have never won Olympic gold, meaning triumph here would be an incredible storybook finish to the legendary career of 38-year-old forward Marta, who will retire from international football after this match.\n\nA red card in the final group match threatened to send Marta's career out on a sour note, as she was suspended for both the quarterfinals and semifinals, but her teammates managed to engineer two massive upsets against hosts France and reigning Women's World Cup champions Spain to give the legendary superstar one more shot at glory.\n\nTV channel: NBC, Telemundo\n\nLive stream: Fubo, Peacock, NBC Sports app/website, Telemundo Deportes en Vivo\n\nIn the United States, this game is available for live broadcast on TV in English on NBC's USA Network. Live streaming options are available on Fubo, which offers a FREE trial to new subscribers and Peacock.\n\nA Spanish language option is available via Telemundo, which is also an option to stream on Fubo.\n\nThis Olympic women's soccer gold medal match kicks off from Parc des Princes on Saturday, August 10 at 5 p.m. local time in Paris, France.\n\nHere's how that time translates across some of the major territories across the United States:\n\nMORE: A full rundown of Olympic soccer results, scores, and bracket for men's and women's\n\nThe United States women have all their injured players back to full fitness. Tierna Davidson and Jaedyn Shaw are both back to match availability after missing games previously in the competition, while Emily Fox shook off a late scare in the quarterfinals to start the semifinal victory.\n\nEmma Hayes has leaned extremely heavily on her starters this whole competition, only dipping to the bench when absolutely necessary, but there is one potentially bold change that could throw USWNT fans for a loop. It's highly unlikely yet still conceivable that Hayes could bench captain Lindsey Horan, who has been largely poor throughout this tournament and was hauled off in extra-time of the semifinal against Germany. If she does make that leap, Korbin Albert would be the likely addition to the midfield.\n\nUSA projected starting lineup (4-3-3): Naeher (GK) -- Fox, Girma, Davidson, Dunn -- Horan, Coffey, Lavelle -- Rodman, Swanson, S. Smith.\n\nMarta is a legend of not only the Brazil women's team but the sport in general, but there's a real question for head coach Arthur Elias about whether to start the 38-year-old. She will return from her two-match red card suspension, but her replacement Gabi Portilho scored in both knockout games Marta missed, and she could have done enough to earn a third start, leaving Marta on the bench.\n\nWhat to do with Marta is far from the only point of debate for Elias in the final, especially up front. Kerolin is a star in her own right, but Jheniffer was preferred in the semifinal instead, leaving the former to enter off the bench and score the clinching goal. Duda Sampaio, Adriana Leal, Gabriela, and Ana Vitoria all came off the bench against Spain but have started at least one previous match in this Olympic tournament.\n\nBrazil projected starting lineup (3-4-3): Leite (GK) -- Ferreira, Lauren, Tarciane -- Ludmila, Angelina, Yaya, Ribeiro -- Kerolin, Portilho, Leal.\n\nBrazil will be extremely well prepared for this match, and won't be intimidated by the matchup having already knocked off Spain and France in the knockout stage.\n\nYet this is a different animal. While France and Spain looked beatable at various stages in this tournament, the United States women are a revitalized side that has yet to trail at any point in this tournament. They've only conceded two goals all Olympics, and none in the knockout stage, and have shown the grit to pull out results when opponents bunker.\n\nThe U.S. beat Brazil earlier this year by a 1-0 score in the W Gold Cup final, and will be out to return themselves to the top of the women's football hierarchy.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"},

The United States has faced Brazil twice in the Olympic final, beating them on both occasions to win the gold medal.\n\nThe U.S. defeated Brazil 1-0 in extra time in the final at the 2008 Games in Beijing, while they won 2-1 in extra time in the final at the 2004 Games in Greece.\n\nThey also met earlier this year in the the inaugural CONCACAF W Gold Cup final, where the U.S. defeated Brazil 1-0.\n\nThe U.S., coached by Emma Hayes, finished on top of Group B by winning all three games. Then, the team defeated Japan in extra time in the quarterfinals followed by another extra-time win over Germany.\n\nPlaying in Group C, Brazil reached the knockouts as one of the two best third-placed sides. Later, they knocked out hosts and one of the favourites, France, in the quarterfinals before thrashing world champions Spain in the semifinals.\n\nThe U.S. attacking trio of Sophia Smith, Mallory Swanson and Trinity Rodman are ones to watch in the Olympic final. They have all been on the scoresheet at least once for the Americans at the Paris Games.\n\nFor Brazil, legendary forward Marta is a key player, as the 38-year-old plays in her final Olympic fixture. Gabi Portilho is also a must-watch player.\n\nThe U.S. have won the most golds - four - at the women's soccer Olympic tournament.

The team advanced through the field unbeaten, including nail-biter, 1-0 victories against Japan and Germany.\n\nBrazil enters the finale with momentum on its side.\n\nThe team suffered two consecutive losses, to Japan and Germany, in group play and looked to be out of contention to secure the gold medal.\n\nA late surge, fueled by the desire to win Brazil's first Olympic gold medal in women's soccer and send the legendary Marta off with the biggest international tournament victory over her career, has them one win away from history.\n\nThis will be the third time that the United States and Brazil match-up in the finals of the Olympics, with the previous two coming in 2004 and 2008. Both were won by the Americans.\n\nIt is also the seventh time the two will clash in the knockout rounds of a major tournament, meaning the two countries are no strangers to each other in high-pressure matches.\n\nThe United States has already played a lot of soccer, an hour more than Brazil according to NBC Sports. Head coach Emma Hayes has not made a habit of rotating and substituting, either, meaning the same starters have played the majority of the tournament's games.\n\nHenry Bushnell of Yahoo wrote of Hayes showing her team video of ultramarathoner Courtney Dauwalter discussing pain caves and the amount of suffering that goes into excelling in a grinding sport.\n\n\"[If] she can do that, more than 100 miles in 26 hours, we can dig deep in here,\" Hayes said.\n\nShe continued, \"I want them to suffer. I want them to have that moment. 'Cause I do not believe you can win without it. And I haven't had long enough with this group to get that yet. And I want to see who they are when it's hard.\"\n\nThat decision may rear its head late in the game, when exhaustion sets in. The team was built for situations exactly like this, though, with its youthfulness likely a deciding factor in Hayes' decision to ride it out with the players on the field.\n\nThey will need to find some scoring, though, after each of the last two games went to extra minutes and ended with one goal scored apiece.\n\nConversely, Brazil's most pertinent coaching decision revolves around Marta and whether she starts the game or comes off the bench. She is a legend in the sport and one of the greatest scorers to ever lace a pair of cleats on a pitch, so the idea of asking her not to start the final game of her international playing career is a huge ask of head coach Arthur Elias.\n\nIt is nearly impossible not to notice how much better the team was in her absence, though. Brazil defeated two teams in France and Spain that were, by all accounts, better than them all tournament long. They found momentum and on-field chemistry and put up four goals on La Roja, shocking the world and cashing their ticket to the gold medal game.\n\nDoes the coach dare interrupt what the team has going to start Marta?\n\nPotentially, if it means achieving something the country never has, despite generations of success in the sport.\n\nBrazil dismantled Spain, one of the tournament favorites. They have purpose and momentum on their side.\n\nThis United States team has a legacy of its own to write and a coach looking to set the tone for her time at the helm of the international squad.\n\nWith one game left, the Americans dig down and pull out another dramatic victory to claim gold and leave France once again the team to beat.", "source": {"uri": "bleacherreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleacher Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "erik_beaston@bleacherreport.com", "name": "Erik Beaston", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Hayes", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emma Hayes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parc_des_Princes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parc des Princes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courtney_Dauwalter", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Courtney Dauwalter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultramarathon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ultramarathon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Elias", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arthur Elias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Football pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/c_fill,g_faces,w_3800,h_2000,q_95/v1723200718/q82dmooiu38yhd3ejoig.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803279", "eventUri": "eng-9803279", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

Aurelien Morissard/Associated Press\n\nPARIS -- Just when it appeared the U.S. had conceded its dominance with an early exit from Women's World Cup, the Americans have roared back under new coach Emma Hayes with an undefeated run in the Paris Olympics.\n\nThere's one more hurdle: The U.S. faces Brazil for the gold medal on Saturday at Parc des Princes.\n\n\"We had a tough year last year in every way possible,\" forward Sophia Smith said. \"But I feel like this is a new year and we're really just showing the world that we never did drop off. We just needed a learning year and a growth year. We're back, and hopefully on top after this next game.\"\n\nThe United States is the winningest team at the Olympics with four gold medals, a silver and a bronze. But the U.S. hasn't won a gold since 2012 in London. The team was knocked in the quarterfinals of the Rio de Janeiro Games and settled for bronze three years ago at Tokyo.\n\nLast summer as defending champions, they were eliminated from the World Cup earlier in the tournament than ever before. Since then, the Americans dropped to No. 5 in the FIFA rankings, the team's lowest rank ever.\n\n\"I've always said I want our players to look at our history as a privilege and something that can help guided us,\" Hayes said. \"But ultimately, I want us to forge our own path and I want to forge a path based on the values and the ambitions of this current group.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHayes, who arrived in May after wrapping up the season with Chelsea, has given the team new life.\n\nSo far the U.S. hasn't lost at the Olympics, with 11 goals scored while conceding just two. The forward trio of Smith, Trinity Rodman and Mallory Swanson have three goals apiece.\n\nThe team is playing with renewed joy and a determination to re-establish American dominance. The players got a visit before the tournament from the entire squad that won the 1999 World Cup, the so-called '99ers that included Brandi Chastain and Mia Hamm. And then there's the intra-squad karaoke battles in their downtime in France.\n\nCaptain Lindsey Horan said the key has been to live in the moment.\n\n\"That's been the most enjoyable thing, because you're just staying present. You get to enjoy it with your team and see smiling faces all over the place,\" the 30-year-old midfielder said. \"And the karaoke machine is coming out going into the gold medal match, it's amazing.\"\n\nThe United States advanced to the final in France with an 1-0 extra-time victory over Germany in Lyon. Smith scored the lone goal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Brazilians upset World Cup champion Spain 4-2 in the other semifinal Tuesday in Marseille.\n\nBrazil gets its captain Marta back after a two-game suspension that kept her out of the quarterfinals and semis - the result of a straight red in the final group-stage match.\n\nThe Americans previously faced Brazil in gold medal matches at the 2004 and 2008 Games, coming away with the title in both tournaments. The two silvers are the only medals Brazil has won.\n\n\"They're building something special, like us, too,\" Brazilian midfielder Angelina said about the Americans. \"We are also building something new. I know it's going to be a very tough game, so we are just preparing for that.\"\n\nRodman said she's personally grown, along with the rest of the team, since the World Cup disappointment.\n\n\"I feel like this time around it's just more fun because we're working so hard and we're meshing and we're doing so much behind the scenes,\" Rodman said. \"I just feel like we're all free, which has been so nice to see. And I feel like we're just like building on that.

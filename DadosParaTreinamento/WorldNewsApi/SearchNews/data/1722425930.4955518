This dress looks great and is so comfortable that I didn\u2019t want to take it off! The empire waistline and sexy V-neck is perfect for my 36DDs. I look adorable in this dress. One thing that is important about this dress is the pockets! They are big enough to hold my schungite rocks without distorting the shape of my body in the dress. I want another one. Maybe I\u2019ll wear this dress all the time.\" \u2014Silver Rain Runningcloud Get it from Amazon for $18.79+ (available in sizes S\u20133XL, short and long sleeve styles, and dozens of colors and patterns).", "summary": "<h1>The only exception here being wash day.</h1><p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2024-06/18/22/tmp/6cef19e130aa/tmp-name-3-1006-1718748071-6_dblbig.jpg\" /></p><hr /><p><a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/cierracowan/pieces-clothing-reviewers-say-they-live-in-during-the\">View Entire Post &rsaquo;</a></p>", "url": "https://www.buzzfeed.com/cierracowan/pieces-clothing-reviewers-say-they-live-in-during-the", "image": "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2024-06/18/22/tmp/6cef19e130aa/tmp-name-3-1006-1718748071-6_dblbig.jpg?resize=1200:*", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 01:31:01", "author": "Cierra Cowan,https://www.buzzfeed.com/about", "authors": ["Cierra Cowan", "https://www.buzzfeed.com/about"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.526}

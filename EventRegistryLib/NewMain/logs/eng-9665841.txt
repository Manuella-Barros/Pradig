What we are increasingly finding is that the father is also important,\" Dr. Ran Rotem, who authored the new study on the paternal use of metformin and birth defects, told CNN.\n\n\"We know that diabetes itself is not good when it is in the mother, and we are finding evidence that it's also tricky for the fathers,\" Rotem noted. \"If you can manage diabetes with just changing your lifestyle -- doing more exercise, watching your diet -- that's probably good, and that's helpful anyways. But if you have to be medicated, it seems like metformin is a safe choice for both.\"\n\nThe raised risk of birth defects seen in earlier research could have been associated with diabetes itself or with related illnesses, instead of the medication, noted Rotem, a researcher at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston.\n\n\"When we think about a medication, we also have to think about the underlying conditions in which the medication is usually prescribed,\" Rotem said. \"We know that diabetes itself is tricky when it comes to both fertility and potential complications in pregnancy and in newborns.\"\n\nIn Rotem's study, his team analyzed data from medical records on nearly 400,000 babies born in Israel between 1999 and 2020. They compared that with information on the babies' fathers, such as their ages, lab test results and medication records.\n\nHis team found the rate of major birth defects was 4.7% in children of fathers not exposed to diabetes medications in the months leading up to conception, compared with 6.2% in children of fathers exposed to metformin before conceiving.\n\nBut when the researchers also weighed fathers' other underlying health conditions and whether the mother also had diabetes or related co-morbidities, they found no increased risk of major birth defects in children exposed to paternal metformin.\n\nThe data did show that the risk of a birth defect was higher when the father used other medications along with metformin.\n\n\"When we examined specific treatment regimens, modestly elevated excess risks were still observed, specifically among children of fathers who used metformin in tandem with some other diabetes medication,\" Rotem said.\n\n\"But we also observed that fathers who took multiple medications had more poorly controlled diabetes,\" he added. \"This again indicates that the modestly elevated risk seen for diabetes polytherapies was likely not caused by the medications themselves, but rather by the worse cardio-metabolic health profile of the fathers.\"\n\nThe second study, published Tuesday in the Annals of Internal Medicine alongside Rotem's research, reported similar findings for women. Those who continued using metformin while adding insulin as a treatment in their first trimester of pregnancy showed little to no increased risk of giving birth to a baby with birth defects.\n\nThose researchers, also from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, studied Medicaid data on more than 12,000 women with type 2 diabetes and their pregnancies.\n\nThe estimated risk for giving birth to a baby with birth defects was about 6% when the mother received insulin plus metformin, versus 8% when the mother received insulin alone.\n\n\"We were not surprised by our findings. Although metformin may cross the placenta, potentially affecting the fetus, metformin can help with blood sugar control which may lower the risk of birth defects,\" study author Dr. Yu-Han Chiu, a researcher at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Penn State College of Medicine, told CNN.\n\n\"Poor blood sugar control is a risk factor for birth defects. Insulin in combination with metformin may result in better blood sugar control than using insulin alone. This may explain why we observed a slightly lower risk of live birth with congenital malformations when comparing with using insulin alone,\" Chiu said.\n\nThe new studies begin to clarify the risks of metformin use around pregnancy by both parents, Dr. Sarah Martins da Silva, of the University of Dundee in Scotland, wrote in an editorial published with the studies.\n\n\"Nonetheless, these recent analyses suggest that metformin is a safe and effective treatment option for [type 2 diabetes] for men and women trying to conceive as well as managing hyperglycemia [high blood sugar] in pregnant women in the first trimester, and it may be time to reconsider current prenatal care guidelines that advocate switching to insulin therapy,\" she added.\n\nDisclaimer: Statistical data in medical articles provide general trends and do not pertain to individuals.

What we are increasingly finding is that the father is also important,\" Dr. Ran Rotem, who authored the new study on the paternal use of metformin and birth defects, told CNN.\n\n\"We know that diabetes itself is not good when it is in the mother, and we are finding evidence that it's also tricky for the fathers,\" Rotem noted. \"If you can manage diabetes with just changing your lifestyle -- doing more exercise, watching your diet -- that's probably good, and that's helpful anyways. But if you have to be medicated, it seems like metformin is a safe choice for both.\"\n\nThe raised risk of birth defects seen in earlier research could have been associated with diabetes itself or with related illnesses, instead of the medication, noted Rotem, a researcher at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston.\n\n\"When we think about a medication, we also have to think about the underlying conditions in which the medication is usually prescribed,\" Rotem said. \"We know that diabetes itself is tricky when it comes to both fertility and potential complications in pregnancy and in newborns.\"\n\nIn Rotem's study, his team analyzed data from medical records on nearly 400,000 babies born in Israel between 1999 and 2020. They compared that with information on the babies' fathers, such as their ages, lab test results and medication records.\n\nHis team found the rate of major birth defects was 4.7% in children of fathers not exposed to diabetes medications in the months leading up to conception, compared with 6.2% in children of fathers exposed to metformin before conceiving.\n\nBut when the researchers also weighed fathers' other underlying health conditions and whether the mother also had diabetes or related co-morbidities, they found no increased risk of major birth defects in children exposed to paternal metformin.\n\nThe data did show that the risk of a birth defect was higher when the father used other medications along with metformin.\n\n\"When we examined specific treatment regimens, modestly elevated excess risks were still observed, specifically among children of fathers who used metformin in tandem with some other diabetes medication,\" Rotem said.\n\n\"But we also observed that fathers who took multiple medications had more poorly controlled diabetes,\" he added. \"This again indicates that the modestly elevated risk seen for diabetes polytherapies was likely not caused by the medications themselves, but rather by the worse cardio-metabolic health profile of the fathers.\"\n\nThe second study, published Tuesday in the Annals of Internal Medicine alongside Rotem's research, reported similar findings for women. Those who continued using metformin while adding insulin as a treatment in their first trimester of pregnancy showed little to no increased risk of giving birth to a baby with birth defects.\n\nThose researchers, also from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, studied Medicaid data on more than 12,000 women with type 2 diabetes and their pregnancies.\n\nThe estimated risk for giving birth to a baby with birth defects was about 6% when the mother received insulin plus metformin, versus 8% when the mother received insulin alone.\n\n\"We were not surprised by our findings. Although metformin may cross the placenta, potentially affecting the fetus, metformin can help with blood sugar control which may lower the risk of birth defects,\" study author Dr. Yu-Han Chiu, a researcher at the Harvard T.H.

For example, a 2022 BMJ Open Diabetes Research and Care study found that metformin use -- either alone or combined with other treatment -- was tied to increased risks for adverse pregnancy outcomes like preterm birth, large or small for gestational age and hypoglycemia.\n\nBecause of a lack of data on the safety of noninsulin medications in early pregnancy, Yu-Han Chiu, MD, ScD, an assistant professor in the division of epidemiology at the Penn State College of Medicine, and colleagues wrote that clinical guidelines recommend switching from noninsulin diabetes medication to insulin therapy \"when a pregnancy is planned or recognized.\"\n\nHowever, \"around 40% of women with type 2 diabetes continue using noninsulin antidiabetics, mostly metformin, with or without insulin,\" they wrote.\n\nThe researchers analyzed 2000 to 2018 data from the U.S. Medicaid health care administration database to estimate the risks for non-live births and live births with congenital malformations among metformin vs. nonmetformin users.\n\nThe cohort included 12,489 women with type 2 diabetes, among whom 850 discontinued metformin and started insulin within 90 days of their last menstrual period and 1,557 combined metformin and insulin treatment during that time.\n\nOverall, the estimated risk for a non-live birth was:\n\nMeanwhile, the estimated risk for a live birth with congenital malformations was\n\nWhen comparing metformin vs. nonmetformin use among all pregnant women, the researchers estimated that the RR of congenital malformations among live births was 1.25 (95% CI, 1.15-1.37), even after adjusting for diabetes status.\n\n\"This higher risk ratio is likely the result of choosing a noncomparable reference because most women in the no metformin group would not have diabetes and, among those with diabetes, the disease would be mild or in early stages,\" Chiu and colleagues wrote. \"That is, pregnant women receiving metformin have a higher risk for having an infant with a major congenital malformation (MCM) than the general population, but such an increase is likely explained by the underlying diabetes.\"\n\nBased on the results, current guidelines that recommend switching from metformin to insulin \"may require reconsideration,\" they concluded.\n\nA second study evaluating metformin use in men also found that it may be safe to use before conception.\n\nDespite metformin's established safety record, \"effects on androgen homeostasis have raised concerns about potential adverse male reproductive effects,\" according to Ran S. Rotem, SM, ScD, a research associate at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and colleagues.\n\nSpecifically, a recent Danish analysis connected metformin use during the spermatogenesis period before conception, with 40% higher odds for MCMs in newborns.\n\n\"However, whether the observed findings reflect a causal effect remains unclear,\" the researchers wrote.\n\nIn the cohort study, Rotem and colleagues analyzed data from a large Israeli health fund on 383,851 live births from 1999 to 2020 to determine possible associations between metformin use and MCMs during the spermatogenesis period.\n\nThe researchers assessed MCMs and parental cardiometabolic conditions through clinical diagnoses, laboratory test results and medication dispensing information.\n\nOverall, the prevalence of cardiometabolic morbidity was significantly higher in fathers who used metformin during spermatogenesis and their spouses vs. fathers who were unexposed.\n\nThe OR for paternal metformin exposure in all formulations and MCMs was 1.28 (95% CI, 1.01-1.64); however, when the researchers adjusted for paternal cardiovascular and metabolic comorbid conditions, the association became null.\n\nAdditionally, the adjusted ORs for MCMs were:\n\nThe researchers suggested that associations for metformin polytherapies \"could be related to a worse underlying parental cardiometabolic risk profile\" and concluded further studies should examine intergenerational effects of paternal cardiometabolic morbidity.\n\nIn a related editorial, Sarah Martins da Silva, MBChB, MD, a clinical reader in reproductive medicine at the School of Medicine at the University of Dundee in the United Kingdom, pointed out that men and women prescribed diabetic medicine were likelier to have fertility problems and cardiovascular comorbid conditions.\n\nThus, the results \"underscore the importance of considering paternal health in the context of reproductive planning and prenatal care, advocating for both parents to adopt healthier lifestyles to optimize their children's health,\" she wrote.\n\nShe also added that individual risks and benefits should be carefully considered, and the findings should be taken with caution due to a lack of information on glycemic control.\n\nStill, Martins Da Silva reiterated that \"it may be time to reconsider current prenatal care guidelines that advocate switching to insulin therapy.\"", "source": {"uri":

Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may decrease.\n\nAbsorption\n\nThe absolute bioavailability of a metformin hydrochloride tablets 500 mg tablet given under fasting conditions is approximately 50% to 60%. Studies using single oral doses of metformin hydrochloride tablets 500 to 1500 mg and 850 to 2550 mg, indicate that there is a lack of dose proportionality with increasing doses, which is due to decreased absorption rather than an alteration in elimination. At usual clinical doses and dosing schedules of metformin hydrochloride tablets, steady state plasma concentrations of metformin are reached within 24 to 48 hours and are generally <1 \u03bcg/mL.\n\nFollowing a single oral dose of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, C max is achieved with a median value of 7 hours and a range of 4 to 8 hours. Peak plasma levels are approximately 20% lower compared to the same dose of metformin hydrochloride tablets, however, the extent of absorption (as measured by AUC) is comparable to metformin hydrochloride tablets.\n\nAt steady state, the AUC and C max are less than dose proportional for metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets within the range of 500 to 2000 mg administered once daily. Peak plasma levels are approximately 0.6, 1.1, 1.4 and 1.8 mcg/mL for 500, 1000, 1500, and 2000 mg once-daily doses, respectively. The extent of metformin absorption (as measured by AUC) from metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets at a 2000 mg once-daily dose is similar to the same total daily dose administered as metformin hydrochloride tablets 1000 mg twice daily. After repeated administration of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, metformin did not accumulate in plasma.\n\nEffect of food: Food decreases the extent of absorption and slightly delays the absorption of metformin, as shown by approximately a 40% lower mean peak plasma concentration (C max), a 25% lower area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), and a 35-minute prolongation of time to peak plasma concentration (T max) following administration of a single 850 mg tablet of metformin hydrochloride tablets with food, compared to the same tablet strength administered fasting.\n\nAlthough the extent of metformin absorption (as measured by AUC) from the metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets increased by approximately 50% when given with food, there was no effect of food on C max and T max of metformin. Both high and low fat meals had the same effect on the pharmacokinetics of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n\nDistribution\n\nThe apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of metformin following single oral doses of metformin hydrochloride tablets 850 mg averaged 654 \u00b1 358 L. Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins. Metformin partitions into erythrocytes, most likely as a function of time.\n\nMetabolism\n\nIntravenous single-dose studies in normal subjects demonstrate that metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism (no metabolites have been identified in humans) nor biliary excretion.\n\nElimination\n\nRenal clearance (see Table 4) is approximately 3.5 times greater than creatinine clearance, which indicates that tubular secretion is the major route of metformin elimination. Following oral administration, approximately 90% of the absorbed drug is eliminated via the renal route within the first 24 hours, with a plasma elimination half-life of approximately 6.2 hours. In blood, the elimination half-life is approximately 17.6 hours, suggesting that the erythrocyte mass may be a compartment of distribution.\n\nSpecific Populations\n\nRenal Impairment\n\nIn patients with decreased renal function the plasma and blood half-life of metformin is prolonged and the renal clearance is decreased (see Table 3) [See Dosage and Administration (2.3), Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].\n\nHepatic Impairment\n\nNo pharmacokinetic studies of metformin have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].\n\nGeriatrics\n\nLimited data from controlled pharmacokinetic studies of metformin hydrochloride tablets in healthy elderly subjects suggest that total plasma clearance of metformin is decreased, the half-life is prolonged, and C max is increased, compared to healthy young subjects. It appears that the change in metformin pharmacokinetics with aging is primarily accounted for by a change in renal function (see Table 4).

Gonzalez Moret, MD, of Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia, and two colleagues.\n\nAdditionally, the propensity-matched analysis showed that major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were 21% more common in the no-metformin group (95% CI 0%-46%), the researchers reported in ACR Open Rheumatology.\n\nLupus nephritis and CKD rates remained significantly elevated in the absence of metformin treatment 5 years after SLE diagnosis (by 82% and 17%, respectively), Gonzalez Moret and colleagues found, but MACE rates were not.\n\n\"These findings underscore the potential protective effects of metformin in mitigating the progression of renal complications and cardiovascular events in individuals with SLE,\" the researchers wrote. \"Further studies and clinical trials may be warranted to validate these findings and explore the underlying mechanisms responsible for the observed protective effects of metformin in patients with SLE.\"\n\nIt's just the latest study to show that metformin is not just a hypoglycemic agent for people with type 2 diabetes, although that is what it's primarily used for. Previous research has shown a plethora of other effects and clinical benefits: Gonzalez Moret and colleagues listed \"antitumor, anti-aging, cardioprotective, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory effects,\" plus an ability to \"decrease immune cell activation and proliferation, proinflammatory cytokine production, and oxidative stress.\" The researchers also cited a recent study showing that metformin reduced renal damage in a mouse model of SLE.\n\nTo see whether such an effect could be discerned in humans, Gonzalez Moret's group analyzed data from the TriNetX research collaboration, which collects records from 88 institutions in the U.S., Taiwan, Brazil, and Georgia, covering some 106 million patients. The researchers identified patients diagnosed with SLE with inpatient admissions from 2014 to early 2024: a total of 9,178 on metformin and 78,983 non-users.\n\nPropensity matching was performed for demographics, lab parameters such as C-reactive protein and hemoglobin A1c, comorbidities, and medications taken at baseline. This yielded 7,242 metformin users matched to the same number of non-users.\n\nAfter matching, patients had a mean age of 55-56; about 85% were women. Some two-thirds of both groups had diagnoses of type 2 diabetes and 8-9% were considered prediabetic. Two-thirds also had hypertension. Just over 40% had elevated blood lipids. About half of both groups were on corticosteroids and 40% were taking hydroxychloroquine. Statin use was common, but diabetes drugs other than metformin were not -- fewer than 10% were taking such agents as sulfonylurea, gliflozin, glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists, or dipeptidyl dipeptidase-4 inhibitors. However, some 40% of patients were insulin users.\n\nWithin 1 year after SLE diagnosis, the main outcomes -- lupus nephritis, stage 1-3 CKD, and MACE -- developed as follows:\n\nAnd these were the outcome counts within 5 years:\n\nIn general, Gonzalez Moret and colleagues observed, these findings are in line with previous studies suggesting that metformin prevents or slows development of many conditions beyond type 2 diabetes. The study couldn't shed much light on the underlying mechanisms; however, the researchers indicated, suppression of pro-inflammatory immune processes is likely to be key.\n\nLimitations to the study included its retrospective design and reliance on administrative records.", "source": {"uri": "medpagetoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MedPage Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lupus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupus_nephritis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lupus nephritis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chronic kidney disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metformin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Metformin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Confidence interval"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Diagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cardiovascular disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rheumatology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doctor of Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kidney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_proliferation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cell proliferation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammatory_cytokine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflammatory cytokine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_2_diabetes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Type 2 diabetes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oxidative stress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_organism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Model organism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-inflammatory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hypoglycemia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_extension", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Life extension"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White blood cell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immunotherapy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Research", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Research", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs_and_Medications", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs and Medications", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Musculoskeletal_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Musculoskeletal Disorders", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Genitourinary_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Genitourinary Disorders", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://assets.medpagetoday.net/media/images/110xxx/110750.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665841", "eventUri": "eng-9665841", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (>5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels >5 mcg/mL are generally found.\n\nThe reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin hydrochloride tablets. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin hydrochloride tablet treatment should not be initiated in patients >80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin hydrochloride tablets should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin hydrochloride tablets should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin hydrochloride tablets, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin hydrochloride tablets should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also PRECAUTIONS).\n\nThe onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. The patient and the patient's physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur (see also PRECAUTIONS). Metformin hydrochloride tablets should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose, and if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels, and even blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of Metformin hydrochloride tablets, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease.\n\nLevels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity, or technical problems in sample handling. (See also PRECAUTIONS.)\n\nLactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and ketonemia).\n\nLactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital setting. In a patient with lactic acidosis who is taking metformin hydrochloride tablets, the drug should be discontinued immediately and general supportive measures promptly instituted. Because metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable (with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions), prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove the accumulated metformin. Such management often results in prompt reversal of symptoms and recovery.

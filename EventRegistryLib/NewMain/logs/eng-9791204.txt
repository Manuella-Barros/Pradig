The news and editorial departments had no role in the creation or display of this content.\n\nAs preseason camps begin across the college football landscape, we are just a few weeks away from the start of the 2024 season.\n\nMassive conference and College Football Playoff expansion, along, of course, with ongoing NIL legislation, highlighted the offseason.\n\nBut soon kickoff, where all the really matters is what happens on the field.\n\nIn preparation for the start of the season, FrontPageBets takes a look at the first game on the 2024 docket, with a Week 0 matchup between ACC opponents Florida State and Georgia Tech, which will kickoff in Dublin, Ireland, on Aug. 24.\n\nThis will be one of four Week 0 games on the schedule, with the ACC-favorite Seminoles, as a 12.5 to 13-point favorite over the Yellow Jackets. The Over/Under is 54.5.\n\nThe expected sellout crowd at Dublin's Aviva Stadium for the Aer Lingus College Football Classic will also be able to experience ESPN's College GameDay, which will broadcast outside the United States for the first time in the pregame show's history.\n\nBest College Football Betting Sites 2024 READ: 2024 College Football Playoff and power conference picks & predictionsREAD: 2024 Heisman Trophy odds and preseason predictions2024 College Football Week 0 odds: Florida State (-12.5, -110) vs. Georgia Tech (+12.5, -110)\n\nFlorida State will be on a redemption tour to start 2024, after being left out of last season's four-team College Football Playoff, despite finishing 13-0 and winning the ACC.\n\nThe reason was simple - although distressing to a lot of college football fans, especially those in Tallahassee. Star quarterback Jordan Travis, who was in the running for the Heisman Trophy as well, suffered a season-ending injury in mid-November, and FSU was never the same team. That was made apparent in the Orange Bowl against Georgia, who wiped the floor with the Seminoles, 63-3.\n\nThis year, fifth-year coach Mike Norvell will have a new quarterback, but there won't be much of a learning curve with this one.\n\nDJ Uiagalelei, who is a grad transfer from Oregon State, and prior to that was at Clemson, will take the reins in Tallahassee. Uiagalelei has played in 48 career college football games, starting 40. His career record as a starter is 30-10; and he's thrown for over 8,000 yards and 57 touchdowns in four college football seasons.\n\nGeorgia Tech was 12th in rushing offense last season, averaging 203.8 yards per game and nearly 5.5 yards per carry, which led the ACC. The Yellow Jackets were paced by running back Jamal Haynes, who broke the 1,000-yard mark last season, averaging 6.1 yards per carry, which was top 25 in the nation.\n\nHaynes is back along with most of last year's offense, including quarterback Haynes King and four of his five starting offensive linemen. Not to mention two of the team's leading receivers and tight end.\n\nThis could potentially be a high-scoring game right out of the gate, if these two offenses start clicking early. And with a 54.5-point total, the Over might be a safe bet ... along with taking FSU to cover the near two-touchdown spread.\n\nFSU was 8-6 last season against the spread, while Georgia Tech was 8-5.\n\n2024 Week 0 College Football oddsFlorida State (-12.5) vs. Georgia TechMontana State (-7.5) vs. New MexicoSMU (-24.5) vs. NevadaDelaware State vs. Hawaii (-37.5)\n\nGambling problem?

Star quarterback Jordan Travis, who was in the running for the Heisman Trophy as well, suffered a season-ending injury in mid-November, and FSU was never the same team. That was made apparent in the Orange Bowl against Georgia, who wiped the floor with the Seminoles, 63-3.\n\nThis year, fifth-year coach Mike Norvell will have a new quarterback, but there won't be much of a learning curve with this one.\n\nDJ Uiagalelei, who is a grad transfer from Oregon State, and prior to that was at Clemson, will take the reins in Tallahassee. Uiagalelei has played in 48 career college football games, starting 40.

The Yellow Jackets were paced by running back Jamal Haynes, who broke the 1,000-yard mark last season, averaging 6.1 yards per carry, which was top 25 in the nation.\n\nHaynes is back along with most of last year's offense, including quarterback Haynes King and four of his five starting offensive linemen. Not to mention two of the team's leading receivers and tight end.\n\nThis could potentially be a high-scoring game right out of the gate, if these two offenses start clicking early. And with a 54.5-point total, the Over might be a safe bet ... along with taking FSU to cover the near two-touchdown spread.\n\nFSU was 8-6 last season against the spread, while Georgia Tech was 8-5.\n\n2024 Week 0 College Football odds Florida State (-12.5) vs. Georgia TechMontana State (-7.5) vs. New MexicoSMU (-24.5) vs. NevadaDelaware State vs. Hawaii (-37.5)\n\nGambling problem?

Star quarterback Jordan Travis, who was in the running for the Heisman Trophy as well, suffered a season-ending injury in mid-November, and FSU was never the same team. That was made apparent in the Orange Bowl against Georgia, who wiped the floor with the Seminoles, 63-3.\n\nThis year, fifth-year coach Mike Norvell will have a new quarterback, but there won't be much of a learning curve with this one.\n\nDJ Uiagalelei, who is a grad transfer from Oregon State, and prior to that was at Clemson, will take the reins in Tallahassee. Uiagalelei has played in 48 career college football games, starting 40. His career record as a starter is 30-10; and he's thrown for over 8,000 yards and 57 touchdowns in four college football seasons.\n\nGeorgia Tech was 12th in rushing offense last season, averaging 203.8 yards per game and nearly 5.5 yards per carry, which led the ACC. The Yellow Jackets were paced by running back Jamal Haynes, who broke the 1,000-yard mark last season, averaging 6.1 yards per carry, which was top 25 in the nation.\n\nHaynes is back along with most of last year's offense, including quarterback Haynes King and four of his five starting offensive linemen. Not to mention two of the team's leading receivers and tight end.\n\nThis could potentially be a high-scoring game right out of the gate, if these two offenses start clicking early. And with a 54.5-point total, the Over might be a safe bet ... along with taking FSU to cover the near two-touchdown spread.\n\nFSU was 8-6 last season against the spread, while Georgia Tech was 8-5.\n\n2024 Week 0 College Football odds Florida State (-12.5) vs. Georgia TechMontana State (-7.5) vs. New MexicoSMU (-24.5) vs. NevadaDelaware State vs. Hawaii (-37.5)\n\nGambling problem?

The news and editorial departments had no role in the creation or display of this content.\n\nAs preseason camps begin across the college football landscape, we are just a few weeks away from the start of the 2024 season.\n\nMassive conference and College Football Playoff expansion, along, of course, with ongoing NIL legislation, highlighted the offseason.\n\nBut soon kickoff, where all the really matters is what happens on the field.\n\nIn preparation for the start of the season, FrontPageBets takes a look at the first game on the 2024 docket, with a Week 0 matchup between ACC opponents Florida State and Georgia Tech, which will kickoff in Dublin, Ireland, on Aug. 24.\n\nThis will be one of four Week 0 games on the schedule, with the ACC-favorite Seminoles, as a 12.5 to 13-point favorite over the Yellow Jackets. The Over/Under is 54.5.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Star quarterback Jordan Travis, who was in the running for the Heisman Trophy as well, suffered a season-ending injury in mid-November, and FSU was never the same team. That was made apparent in the Orange Bowl against Georgia, who wiped the floor with the Seminoles, 63-3.\n\nThis year, fifth-year coach Mike Norvell will have a new quarterback, but there won't be much of a learning curve with this one.\n\nDJ Uiagalelei, who is a grad transfer from Oregon State, and prior to that was at Clemson, will take the reins in Tallahassee.

Star quarterback Jordan Travis, who was in the running for the Heisman Trophy as well, suffered a season-ending injury in mid-November, and FSU was never the same team. That was made apparent in the Orange Bowl against Georgia, who wiped the floor with the Seminoles, 63-3.\n\nThis year, fifth-year coach Mike Norvell will have a new quarterback, but there won't be much of a learning curve with this one.\n\nDJ Uiagalelei, who is a grad transfer from Oregon State, and prior to that was at Clemson, will take the reins in Tallahassee. Uiagalelei has played in 48 career college football games, starting 40. His career record as a starter is 30-10; and he's thrown for over 8,000 yards and 57 touchdowns in four college football seasons.\n\nGeorgia Tech was 12th in rushing offense last season, averaging 203.8 yards per game and nearly 5.5 yards per carry, which led the ACC. The Yellow Jackets were paced by running back Jamal Haynes, who broke the 1,000-yard mark last season, averaging 6.1 yards per carry, which was top 25 in the nation.\n\nHaynes is back along with most of last year's offense, including quarterback Haynes King and four of his five starting offensive linemen. Not to mention two of the team's leading receivers and tight end.\n\nThis could potentially be a high-scoring game right out of the gate, if these two offenses start clicking early. And with a 54.5-point total, the Over might be a safe bet ... along with taking FSU to cover the near two-touchdown spread.\n\nFSU was 8-6 last season against the spread, while Georgia Tech was 8-5.\n\n2024 Week 0 College Football odds Florida State (-12.5) vs. Georgia TechMontana State (-7.5) vs. New MexicoSMU (-24.5) vs. NevadaDelaware State vs. Hawaii (-37.5)\n\nGambling problem?

Star quarterback Jordan Travis, who was in the running for the Heisman Trophy as well, suffered a season-ending injury in mid-November, and FSU was never the same team. That was made apparent in the Orange Bowl against Georgia, who wiped the floor with the Seminoles, 63-3.\n\nThis year, fifth-year coach Mike Norvell will have a new quarterback, but there won't be much of a learning curve with this one.\n\nDJ Uiagalelei, who is a grad transfer from Oregon State, and prior to that was at Clemson, will take the reins in Tallahassee. Uiagalelei has played in 48 career college football games, starting 40. His career record as a starter is 30-10; and he's thrown for over 8,000 yards and 57 touchdowns in four college football seasons.\n\nGeorgia Tech was 12th in rushing offense last season, averaging 203.8 yards per game and nearly 5.5 yards per carry, which led the ACC. The Yellow Jackets were paced by running back Jamal Haynes, who broke the 1,000-yard mark last season, averaging 6.1 yards per carry, which was top 25 in the nation.\n\nHaynes is back along with most of last year's offense, including quarterback Haynes King and four of his five starting offensive linemen. Not to mention two of the team's leading receivers and tight end.\n\nThis could potentially be a high-scoring game right out of the gate, if these two offenses start clicking early. And with a 54.5-point total, the Over might be a safe bet ... along with taking FSU to cover the near two-touchdown spread.\n\nFSU was 8-6 last season against the spread, while Georgia Tech was 8-5.\n\n2024 Week 0 College Football odds Florida State (-12.5) vs. Georgia TechMontana State (-7.5) vs. New MexicoSMU (-24.5) vs. NevadaDelaware State vs. Hawaii (-37.5)\n\nGambling problem?

Star quarterback Jordan Travis, who was in the running for the Heisman Trophy as well, suffered a season-ending injury in mid-November, and FSU was never the same team. That was made apparent in the Orange Bowl against Georgia, who wiped the floor with the Seminoles, 63-3.\n\nThis year, fifth-year coach Mike Norvell will have a new quarterback, but there won't be much of a learning curve with this one.\n\nDJ Uiagalelei, who is a grad transfer from Oregon State, and prior to that was at Clemson, will take the reins in Tallahassee. Uiagalelei has played in 48 career college football games, starting 40. His career record as a starter is 30-10; and he's thrown for over 8,000 yards and 57 touchdowns in four college football seasons.\n\nGeorgia Tech was 12th in rushing offense last season, averaging 203.8 yards per game and nearly 5.5 yards per carry, which led the ACC. The Yellow Jackets were paced by running back Jamal Haynes, who broke the 1,000-yard mark last season, averaging 6.1 yards per carry, which was top 25 in the nation.\n\nHaynes is back along with most of last year's offense, including quarterback Haynes King and four of his five starting offensive linemen. Not to mention two of the team's leading receivers and tight end.\n\nThis could potentially be a high-scoring game right out of the gate, if these two offenses start clicking early. And with a 54.5-point total, the Over might be a safe bet ... along with taking FSU to cover the near two-touchdown spread.\n\nFSU was 8-6 last season against the spread, while Georgia Tech was 8-5.\n\n2024 Week 0 College Football odds Florida State (-12.5) vs. Georgia TechMontana State (-7.5) vs. New MexicoSMU (-24.5) vs. NevadaDelaware State vs. Hawaii (-37.5)\n\nGambling problem?

Star quarterback Jordan Travis, who was in the running for the Heisman Trophy as well, suffered a season-ending injury in mid-November, and FSU was never the same team. That was made apparent in the Orange Bowl against Georgia, who wiped the floor with the Seminoles, 63-3.\n\nThis year, fifth-year coach Mike Norvell will have a new quarterback, but there won't be much of a learning curve with this one.\n\nDJ Uiagalelei, who is a grad transfer from Oregon State, and prior to that was at Clemson, will take the reins in Tallahassee. Uiagalelei has played in 48 career college football games, starting 40. His career record as a starter is 30-10; and he's thrown for over 8,000 yards and 57 touchdowns in four college football seasons.\n\nGeorgia Tech was 12th in rushing offense last season, averaging 203.8 yards per game and nearly 5.5 yards per carry, which led the ACC. The Yellow Jackets were paced by running back Jamal Haynes, who broke the 1,000-yard mark last season, averaging 6.1 yards per carry, which was top 25 in the nation.\n\nHaynes is back along with most of last year's offense, including quarterback Haynes King and four of his five starting offensive linemen. Not to mention two of the team's leading receivers and tight end.\n\nThis could potentially be a high-scoring game right out of the gate, if these two offenses start clicking early. And with a 54.5-point total, the Over might be a safe bet ... along with taking FSU to cover the near two-touchdown spread.\n\nFSU was 8-6 last season against the spread, while Georgia Tech was 8-5.\n\n2024 Week 0 College Football odds Florida State (-12.5) vs. Georgia TechMontana State (-7.5) vs. New MexicoSMU (-24.5) vs. NevadaDelaware State vs. Hawaii (-37.5)\n\nGambling problem?

That was made apparent in the Orange Bowl against Georgia, who wiped the floor with the Seminoles, 63-3.\n\nThis year, fifth-year coach Mike Norvell will have a new quarterback, but there won't be much of a learning curve with this one.\n\nDJ Uiagalelei, who is a grad transfer from Oregon State, and prior to that was at Clemson, will take the reins in Tallahassee. Uiagalelei has played in 48 career college football games, starting 40. His career record as a starter is 30-10; and he's thrown for over 8,000 yards and 57 touchdowns in four college football seasons.\n\nGeorgia Tech was 12th in rushing offense last season, averaging 203.8 yards per game and nearly 5.5 yards per carry, which led the ACC. The Yellow Jackets were paced by running back Jamal Haynes, who broke the 1,000-yard mark last season, averaging 6.1 yards per carry, which was top 25 in the nation.\n\nHaynes is back along with most of last year's offense, including quarterback Haynes King and four of his five starting offensive linemen. Not to mention two of the team's leading receivers and tight end.\n\nThis could potentially be a high-scoring game right out of the gate, if these two offenses start clicking early. And with a 54.5-point total, the Over might be a safe bet ... along with taking FSU to cover the near two-touchdown spread.\n\nFSU was 8-6 last season against the spread, while Georgia Tech was 8-5.\n\n2024 Week 0 College Football oddsFlorida State (-12.5) vs. Georgia TechMontana State (-7.5) vs. New MexicoSMU (-24.5) vs. NevadaDelaware State vs. Hawaii (-37.5)\n\nGambling problem?

The news and editorial departments had no role in the creation or display of this content.\n\nAs preseason camps begin across the college football landscape, we are just a few weeks away from the start of the 2024 season.\n\nMassive conference and College Football Playoff expansion, along, of course, with ongoing NIL legislation, highlighted the offseason.\n\nBut soon kickoff, where all the really matters is what happens on the field.\n\nIn preparation for the start of the season, FrontPageBets takes a look at the first game on the 2024 docket, with a Week 0 matchup between ACC opponents Florida State and Georgia Tech, which will kickoff in Dublin, Ireland, on Aug. 24.\n\nThis will be one of four Week 0 games on the schedule, with the ACC-favorite Seminoles, as a 12.5 to 13-point favorite over the Yellow Jackets. The Over/Under is 54.5.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Star quarterback Jordan Travis, who was in the running for the Heisman Trophy as well, suffered a season-ending injury in mid-November, and FSU was never the same team. That was made apparent in the Orange Bowl against Georgia, who wiped the floor with the Seminoles, 63-3.\n\nThis year, fifth-year coach Mike Norvell will have a new quarterback, but there won't be much of a learning curve with this one.\n\nDJ Uiagalelei, who is a grad transfer from Oregon State, and prior to that was at Clemson, will take the reins in Tallahassee. Uiagalelei has played in 48 career college football games, starting 40. His career record as a starter is 30-10; and he's thrown for over 8,000 yards and 57 touchdowns in four college football seasons.\n\nGeorgia Tech was 12th in rushing offense last season, averaging 203.8 yards per game and nearly 5.5 yards per carry, which led the ACC. The Yellow Jackets were paced by running back Jamal Haynes, who broke the 1,000-yard mark last season, averaging 6.1 yards per carry, which was top 25 in the nation.\n\nHaynes is back along with most of last year's offense, including quarterback Haynes King and four of his five starting offensive linemen. Not to mention two of the team's leading receivers and tight end.\n\nThis could potentially be a high-scoring game right out of the gate, if these two offenses start clicking early. And with a 54.5-point total, the Over might be a safe bet ... along with taking FSU to cover the near two-touchdown spread.\n\nFSU was 8-6 last season against the spread, while Georgia Tech was 8-5.\n\n2024 Week 0 College Football odds Florida State (-12.5) vs. Georgia TechMontana State (-7.5) vs. New MexicoSMU (-24.5) vs. NevadaDelaware State vs. Hawaii (-37.5)\n\nGambling problem?

{"id": 225014738, "title": "China-Russia alliance is going strong but unlikely to unseat the US", "text": "China and Russia cemented their 75th year of bilateral relations recently when Russian President Vladimir Putin met President Xi Jinping in Beijing. As Putin said, visiting China for his first foreign trip since being re-elected president was certainly symbolic. There is more to it. Both leaders signed several agreements to enhance cooperation in trade and technology, and they issued a joint statement on deepening their comprehensive strategic partnership. Putin\u2019s visit highlights the continuing improvement of Sino-Russian ties since the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1992. Cooperation on security and the economy was institutionalised through the establishment of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO). The formulation of the Belt and Road Initiative, Russian aggression against Ukraine in 2014 and 2022 and subsequent sanctions by the United States and other countries against Russia have brought the two sides closer together. This relationship is driven by three factors. First, China needs a reliable supply of energy to sustain its economic growth. Russia is one of the world\u2019s major exporters of oil and gas and an energy supplier to China. Its need to diversify its export markets makes each side important to the other. Second, the two countries have mutual geopolitical interests. While Russia is concerned about Nato\u2019s expansion especially in Eastern Europe and near Russian borders, China casts a wary eye to US-led initiatives such as Nato\u2019s bid to expand into Asia. Accordingly, both countries share the vision of challenging American hegemony and establishing a new world order. Third, the Ukraine crisis has brought Moscow and Beijing closer. Russia launched its military operation against Ukraine shortly after Putin\u2019s visit to China in 2022, which was perceived as China implicitly recognising the offensive. Xi and Putin\u2019s vision is clear. They are deepening their strategic cooperation to foster a friendship with \u201cno limits\u201d and cooperation without any forbidden areas. Both countries are targeting the United States and its partners for interfering in the internal affairs of other countries and criticising the US for turning outer space into an arena of conflict. They advocate for a multipolar world that could significantly alter global power dynamics. However, it is also clear that the Sino-Russian alliance faces some friction and might not achieve its objectives. For example, it is imperative for China that Russia emerges victorious in Ukraine as, if it was to lose, it would deprive China of a stable partner \u2013 an outcome Beijing does not look forward to. This alone could undercut the shared goal of challenging the US\u2019 position in the global order. Also, despite China and Russia attempting to woo countries in the Global South, as seen in their actions within the SCO and the Brics bloc, developing nations are unlikely to disengage from the US whatever problems they might have with Washington. This is because they want to keep their options open and will always welcome the status implications of balancing between the US-led West on the one hand and the China-Russia alliance on the other. Finally, both China and Russia have their own internal issues to deal with. Russia\u2019s financial resources are growing increasingly strained amid sanctions imposed by the US and other countries, leading to a heavy reliance on China for trade. Meanwhile, China is dealing with a sluggish economic recovery and needs to ensure that no major challenges arise internationally. The world has witnessed a decline in the US\u2019 appetite for directly engaging in issues outside its immediate circle of influence. This can be seen in its withdrawal from Afghanistan as well as a reluctance to engage in conflicts in the Middle East, beyond selling weapons. Its waning influence in the region can also be seen in its inability to rein in Israel, whose behaviour of late is akin to a rogue state\u2019s. This has only strengthened the appeal of a multipolar world with new centres of power. Yet despite the Sino-Russian alliance\u2019s challenge to US leadership, the countries still face several internal and external obstacles. The US is unlikely to be destabilised by them, but will instead keep up its rivalry with them.

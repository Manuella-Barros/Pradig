If Marsiglio is chosen by delegates, he would join the campaign of Democratic gubernatorial candidate Jennifer McCormick, the state's former Superintendent of Public Instruction.\n\n\"I had hoped to sit this one out, but Indiana stands at a crossroads,\" Marsiglio said in the release. \"We can travel down the authoritarian vision of a convicted criminal and those who worship him, or we can build a state where every community thrives, every person is valued and education is governed rationally. Indiana has always loved those who fight, and until the Democratic Party fights as hard as those on the other side, we will lose.\"\n\nFormer gubernatorial candidate Bob Kern has also announced his campaign for the Democratic nomination for the lieutenant governor seat.\n\nNormally, gubernatorial candidates of each major political party in Indiana would go into their respective party convention after announcing their respective choice for their running mate. Then, the delegates would normally choose that nominee for lieutenant governor during the convention, solidifying the gubernatorial candidate's preferred ticket.\n\nHowever, that approach changed this particular election cycle. According to previous reports, Micah Beckwith openly ran for the Republican nomination for lieutenant governor, running against Indiana Rep. Julie McGuire, the individual endorsed by U.S. Senator Mike Braun, R-Ind., the Republican nominee for governor, as well as Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president.\n\nAt the convention, Beckwith was named the state's Republican nominee for lieutenant governor at the state's Republican convention with a vote of 898-828 from state delegates.\n\nMarsiglio said that he was hoping that McCormick would announce a running mate to \"help push the (Democrats) into action.\" This pushed Marsiglio to run for the position. In the release, Marsiglio's platform includes:\n\n\"Our state is strongest when we work together, listen to each other, and find solutions that uplift everyone,\" he said in the release. \"I'm excited to embark on this journey with my fellow Hoosiers and make Indiana a beacon of progress and unity.\"\n\nAfter Marsiglio made his announcement, McCormick announced that she would announce the candidate she would endorse for lieutenant governor on Thursday afternoon. According to previous reports, McCormick said her pick is a \"person of character\" who is \"laser-focused\" on public service.\n\nIn a tweet on Wednesday, Marsiglio said that he would \"walk away (from his campaign) when (the Democratic Party has) a candidate who shares the loving values we all desire.\"\n\nThe Indiana Democratic Party's convention, where delegates will make decisions on the lieutenant governor's race, as well as the contested attorney general's race, will be on July 13.", "source": {"uri": "cbs4indy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS4 Indy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_gay@cbs4indy.com", "name": "David Gay", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_Governor_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lieutenant Governor of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Superintendent_of_Public_Instruction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Superintendent of Public Instruction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_McCormick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer McCormick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_W._Kern", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John W.

This comes after McCormick stated she would select her preferred running mate during a Tuesday morning news conference.\n\nGoodin, who has previously been called a \"folksy state lawmaker\" and a \"throwback\" conservative Democrat, served for 20 years in the Indiana House of Representatives. Goodin served the 66th district, which consists of southeast Indiana near the Kentucky border, from 2000 to 2020. Goodin was chosen as the state's House minority leader in 2017.\n\nAccording to his bio on the USDA's website, Goodin advocated for rural Indiana and various educational, agricultural and rural development initiatives. Goodin highlighted the importance of broadband connectivity throughout Indiana as well.\n\nGoodin also served as the superintendent at Crothersville Community Schools for 24 years. The district, which is north of Austin, developed an early college initiative, allowing students to graduate from high school with a college degree, according to his bio.\n\nDuring Tuesday's conference, McCormick said a lieutenant governor's role is \"critical\" to the overall well-being of the state of Indiana. McCormick said that Goodin is a \"person of character\" who is \"laser-focused\" on public service. McCormick also said on Tuesday that Goodin shares her priorities and is in \"lock step\" with her on issues, including:\n\nAs Goodin's name was circulating as a possibility to be McCormick's running mate, many people have taken to social media to criticize portion's of Goodin's voting record in the Indiana House of Representatives. Many people have highlighted Goodin's 2011 vote in favor of an Indiana constitutional ban of gay marriage, as well as his previously published views on abortion, according to an article from Politico.\n\n\"(Goodin is) an anti-abortion, pro-gun, self-described \"Bible-poundin', aisle-runnin'\" Pentecostal,\" the 2018 Politico profile said at the time.\n\nMcCormick's endorsement of Goodin comes after Micah Beckwith was elected as the Republican nominee for lieutenant governor. Beckwith campaigned for the lieutenant governor position after U.S. Senator Mike Braun, R-Ind., the Republican nominee for governor, endorsed Indiana Rep. Julie McGuire for the position.\n\nAs of Thursday, two other Democratic candidate, community activist Clif Marsiglio and former gubernatorial candidate Bob Kern, have filed with the Indiana Democratic Party to run for lieutenant governor.\n\nThe Indiana Democratic Party's convention, where delegates will make decisions on the lieutenant governor's race, as well as the contested attorney general's

(AP) -- Indiana's Democratic nominee for governor, Jennifer McCormick, on Thursday chose as her running mate a former state lawmaker who spent much of his introductory speech apologizing for past votes against abortion and same-sex marriage and promising he's changed his mind.\n\nTerry Goodin, a member of the Indiana House from 2000 to 2020, was tabbed for the McCormick ticket in an online announcement from Indianapolis. But his record will leave voters questioning his Democratic bona fides.\n\nMcCormick, herself a former one-term Republican Superintendent of Public Instruction who switched parties in 2021, will square off in November against Republican gubernatorial nominee Mike Braun, who's leaving the U.S. Senate after one term. Braun, too, has had his own intraparty troubles over a running mate.\n\nIncumbent Gov. Eric Holcomb, a two-term Republican, is term-limited.\n\nIn his remarks to reporters, Goodin took the issue head on, explaining he's dropped positions that ran counter to core Democratic values, including access to abortion, a top-of-mind issue for voters since the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision two years ago overturned the Roe v. Wade decision legalizing the procedure.\n\n\"My vote on women's reproductive rights was pretty spotty at best, but I was always counseled by my female colleagues that if these bills go too far, Roe v. Wade would nullify them,\" Goodin, 57, said. \"The Dobbs decision has changed all that. We are in a completely new universe.\"\n\nGoodin, like McCormick a former teacher and educational administrator, denounced Dobbs as \"an all-out assault on personal freedoms,\" then pivoted and said that his 2011 vote against same-sex marriage \"dehumanized, demeaned thousands of Hoosiers. I am sorry for the hurt that I caused so many.\" Indiana legalized same-sex marriage in 2014.\n\n\"If two people want to affirm that love with marriage, then they should be able to do that in the great state of Indiana,\" Goodin said.\n\nMcCormick said many voters would be able to relate to Goodin's change of heart.\n\n\"That evolution, people need space and time, sometimes it takes a personal experience for that thought to change, and that's what we should be celebrating,\" McCormick said. \"Terry did a great job of explaining where he was and how he has evolved. He is not alone.\"\n\nBut first, McCormick must convince party regulars. Like the Republicans, it will be delegates to next month's state Democratic Party Convention who vote on the running mate, and Goodin has two challengers, Bob Kern and Clif Marsiglio.\n\nJust last weekend, GOP nominee Braun faced a setback when delegates dumped his preferred candidate, state Rep. Julie McGuire, for pastor Micah Beckwith, who promotes uncompromising positions on abortion, gender and sexuality and cohosts his \"Jesus, Sex and Politics\" podcast.\n\nAsked how she'd smooth over concerns about Goodin's past record with party members, McCormick said she would avoid \"the divisiveness of the Republican party\" by meeting with anyone who has concerns, listening and resolving issues.\n\n\"I have said many times the Democratic Party, the beautiful thing about it is it is truly a big tent,\" McCormick said. \"It's a lot of ideas, a lot of opinions, a lot of big personalities and a lot of heart.\"", "source": {"uri": "apnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AP NEWS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Goodin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Terry Goodin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Same-sex marriage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

Terry Goodin for lieutenant governor", "body": "The Democratic candidate for governor in 2024, Jennifer McCormick, talks with an audience member before a March 19, 2024 gubernatorial forum. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)\n\nDemocratic gubernatorial nominee Jennifer McCormick has picked former Indiana lawmaker and social conservative Terry Goodin as her running mate, despite pushback from some within her party.\n\nMcCormick made the lieutenant governor announcement Thursday afternoon in Indianapolis, just days after she called out Republican state delegates for choosing conservative Noblesville pastor Micah Beckwith as that party's lieutenant governor nominee.\n\nGoodin must still be approved by convention delegates in July, however. In Indiana, delegates in private party conventions decide the nomination of lieutenant governor alongside picks for other statewide offices, such as attorney general.\n\nTwo Hoosiers -- Bob Kern and Clif Marsiglio -- have also filed to run for Indiana lieutenant governor at the upcoming state convention.\n\nA former Democratic member of the Indiana House of Representatives, Goodin represented District 66 -- which includes portions of Scott, Clark and Jefferson counties -- from 2000 to 2020.\n\nHe served as the Minority Leader of the House for a partial term in 2017 but was not re-elected to the position by the Democratic caucus the following year.\n\nGoodin sparked controversy in 2011, when he voted with a majority of lawmakers for a constitutional ban on gay marriage in Indiana. Three years later, when the measure came up for a vote again, nearly every Democrat voted against it, but Goodin was excused and did not vote.\n\nGoodin also voted with Republicans in support of expanding the ability to carry firearms. In 2020, he co-authored a bill to let off-duty police officers carry firearms into casinos, and in 2019 he co-authored separate legislation to expand Indiana's \"stand your ground\" law.\n\nHis record also includes votes in favor of several bills adding restrictions or regulations on abortions.\n\nFour years ago, Democrat candidate for governor Woody Myers was readying to tap Goodin as his running mate but progressive Democrats in the party rebelled and he ultimately chose Linda Lawson instead.\n\nIn February 2022, President Joe Biden appointed Goodin as the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Indiana state director for rural development.\n\nA USDA spokesperson confirmed that Goodin has since resigned from that post. His last day was June 14.\n\nOutside of the Statehouse, Goodin previously served for 24 years as superintendent of Crothersville Community Schools, and as an assistant teacher and principal in Brown and Scott counties. He additionally raises beef cattle on his family farm in Austin, Indiana, according to his USDA biography.\n\nThe Democrat duo will face Republican gubernatorial nominee Mike Braun and his running mate, Beckwith.\n\nIndiana's GOP delegates narrowly named Beckwith as the Republican nominee for lieutenant governor in a shocking vote at the party's convention Saturday, rebuffing first-term Rep. Julie McGuire -- Braun's handpicked choice for the role -- who had received a last-minute endorsement from former President Donald Trump.\n\nBeckwith ran an unorthodox solo campaign for the number two spot, publicly pitching himself as both the prospective governor's cheerleader and a check on his power.\n\nThe GOP delegates' pick has since spurred turmoil within the Indiana Republican Party. In a confidential memo, prominent conservative attorney Jim Bopp predicted that Beckwith could be catastrophic for Braun's campaign and open the door for a Democratic victory.\n\nThe post Democrat Jennifer McCormick taps former Indiana Rep. Terry Goodin for lieutenant governor appeared first on Indiana Capital Chronicle.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

(AP) -- Indiana's Democratic nominee for governor, Jennifer McCormick, on Thursday chose as her running mate a former state lawmaker who spent much of his introductory speech apologizing for past votes against abortion and same-sex marriage and promising he's changed his mind.\n\nTerry Goodin, a member of the Indiana House from 2000 to 2020, was tabbed for the McCormick ticket in an online announcement from Indianapolis. But his record will leave voters questioning his Democratic bona fides.\n\nMcCormick, herself a former one-term Republican Superintendent of Public Instruction who switched parties in 2021, will square off in November against Republican gubernatorial nominee Mike Braun, who's leaving the U.S. Senate after one term. Braun, too, has had his own intraparty troubles over a running mate.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Aaron Rossi accused of defrauding state of Illinois during COVID-19 pandemic At Bloomington's Mobile Pride Parade, a celebration of joy and acceptance State: Murder defendant fought Bloomington man over a gun before fatal shooting\n\nIncumbent Gov. Eric Holcomb, a two-term Republican, is term-limited.\n\nIn his remarks to reporters, Goodin took the issue head on, explaining he's dropped positions that ran counter to core Democratic values, including access to abortion, a top-of-mind issue for voters since the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision two years ago overturned the Roe v. Wade decision legalizing the procedure.\n\n\"My vote on women's reproductive rights was pretty spotty at best, but I was always counseled by my female colleagues that if these bills go too far, Roe v. Wade would nullify them,\" Goodin, 57, said. \"The Dobbs decision has changed all that. We are in a completely new universe.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nGoodin, like McCormick a former teacher and educational administrator, denounced Dobbs as \"an all-out assault on personal freedoms,\" then pivoted and said that his 2011 vote against same-sex marriage \"dehumanized, demeaned thousands of Hoosiers. I am sorry for the hurt that I caused so many.\" Indiana legalized same-sex marriage in 2014.\n\n\"If two people want to affirm that love with marriage, then they should be able to do that in the great state of Indiana,\" Goodin said.\n\nMcCormick said many voters would be able to relate to Goodin's change of heart.\n\n\"That evolution, people need space and time, sometimes it takes a personal experience for that thought to change, and that's what we should be celebrating,\" McCormick said. \"Terry did a great job of explaining where he was and how he has evolved. He is not alone.\"\n\nBut first, McCormick must convince party regulars. Like the Republicans, it will be delegates to next month's state Democratic Party Convention who vote on the running mate, and Goodin has two challengers, Bob Kern and Clif Marsiglio.\n\nJust last weekend, GOP nominee Braun faced a setback when delegates dumped his preferred candidate, state Rep. Julie McGuire, for pastor Micah Beckwith, who promotes uncompromising positions on abortion, gender and sexuality and cohosts his \"Jesus, Sex and Politics\" podcast.\n\nAsked how she'd smooth over concerns about Goodin's past record with party members, McCormick said she would avoid \"the divisiveness of the Republican party\" by meeting with anyone who has concerns, listening and resolving issues.\n\n\"I have said many times the Democratic Party, the beautiful thing about it is it is truly a big tent,\" McCormick said. \"It's a lot of ideas, a lot of opinions, a lot of big personalities and a lot of heart.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

He lost the 2020 general election to Republican Zach Payne.\n\nGoodin also served as superintendent at Crothersville Community Schools for 24 years. These days, he's the state director for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Development branch.\n\nMcCormick, a former Republican herself, faces Republican Sen.

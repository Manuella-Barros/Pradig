Dilwar on Friday made a controversial statement saying, \u201cIf BAP leader does not consider himself a Hindu then a DNA test should be done to verify whether he is the son of a Hindu\u201d. The minister's remark came after Roat recently said that he belongs to a tribal community and adheres to a belief system distinct from organised religions, including Hinduism. At a programme in Udaipur on Saturday, Dilawar said that the tribal community is an integral part of the Hindu community and hoped that the tribal people will not get misled by \u201csome people\u201d.In response, Roat said that \u201cthe minister's mentality needs to be tested\u201d. Roat released a video statement and condemned the minister's comments on him. He said in the video: \u201cVery soon my blood sample will be sent to the official residence of Education Minister Madan Dilawar, and a campaign will be launched to send samples from every tribal\u2019s house. Minister, please arrange for a DNA test machine.\u201d \u201cYou are talking about DNA tests, ancestors, that applies to you. Your mentality needs to be tested. Such language does not suit you, you are holding the post of minister,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you want to talk about the tribal community, then tell us what changes you have brought in the education sector for the tribals in the last six months,\u201d he said.He said that the minister made indecent remarks for the tribal community, him and his party and the tribal people will give a befitting reply to this statement in the time to come. Even BAP's state president Mohanlal Roat quoted the Supreme Court and said that tribals are not Hindus. \u201cThe customs, rituals, deities, worship methods of the tribals are all different. Even the Hindu Marriage Act does not apply to tribals. Tribals are only tribals, not Hindus,\u201d he said. Roat had defeated BJP leader Mahendrajeet Singh Malviya from Banswara seat in the recently-held Lok Sabhha elections.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/jaipur/rajasthan-minister-mp-engage-in-war-of-words-over-dna-test-remark-9409317/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/06/Rajasthan-.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-23 01:23:53", "author": null, "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.209}

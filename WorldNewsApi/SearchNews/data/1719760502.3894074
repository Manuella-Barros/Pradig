The deliberations are poised to commence after judge Juan Merchan instructs jurors on the law. Merchan\u2019s directives on the law are intended on guiding jurors about how they are supposed to weigh the case. The former president is charged with falsifying business records in relation to paying off adult film actor Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. Trump is the first US president, former or present, to face a criminal trial. Manhattan prosecutors allege that Trump\u2019s then attorney, Michael Cohen, shuttled $130,000 to Daniels days before the election, so that her claim of an extramarital sexual liaison wouldn\u2019t go public and tank his chances at the polls. This next step of Trump\u2019s trial marks a pivotal moment. If jurors reach a verdict, they will determine whether he is guilty or not guilty. If Trump is found guilty, the presumptive GOP presidential candidate faces the prospect of jail \u2013 albeit unlikely \u2013 when he\u2019s sentenced. Trump has denied the charge against him. Trump also faces three other criminal cases: one for trying to influence the 2020 election in Georgia, another for his conduct around the January 6 Capitol attack, and a third one involving his treatment of sensitive documents after he left the White House. These other three cases have been pushed back and it\u2019s unlikely that any would conclude before the November election. Trump\u2019s legal woes do not appear to have affected him in the polls. He still boasts a narrow edge over Joe Biden in some polls and is proving strong in some key states that are key to winning the race. On Tuesday, the defense and prosecution presented their summations. Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass insisted that the case was about far more than paying off Daniels. Rather, Steinglass said, Trump\u2019s plot with Cohen and tabloid honcho David Pecker in summer 2015 \u2013 where the scandal sheet publisher said he\u2019d keep an eye out for damaging information about the then-candidate \u2013 deprived Americans of true choice at the ballot box. \u201cThree rich and powerful men, high up in Trump Tower, tried to become even more powerful by controlling the information that reached voters,\u201d Steinglass said. \u201cThe value of this corrupt bargain. It turned out to be one of the most valuable contributions to the Trump campaign. This scheme cooked up by these men, at this time, could very well be what got Donald Trump elected.\u201d \u201cIn simplest terms, Stormy Daniels is the motive,\u201d Steinglass said at one point. Trump\u2019s defense lawyer, Todd Blanche, insisted that Cohen was a liar and that even if there were a conspiracy, it\u2019s not a big deal. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if there was a conspiracy to try and win an election,\u201d Blanche said of the alleged scheme involving Trump, who is accused elsewhere of election meddling and fostering civil unrest to stop Biden from taking office. \u201cEvery campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate.\u201d Blanche phrased this as a hypothetical \u2013 he didn\u2019t admit there was a conspiracy and in fact, denied one. But, even if there were, Blanche insisted it was business as usual. \u201cMany politicians work with the media to try and promote their image,\u201d Blanche said, telling jurors at one point that in order for it to be a legal problem, \u201cyou have to find that this effort was done by unlawful means\u201d.", "summary": "<p>If jurors reach verdict after judge Juan Merchan\u2019s directives on the law, they\u2019ll determine whether ex-president is guilty or not guilty</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/may/29/jury-trump-hush-money-trial-latest-updates\">Trump trial \u2013 live updates</a></li></ul><p>Donald Trump\u2019s criminal hush money trial in New York inches towards its concluding stages Wednesday with the expected start of jury deliberations.</p><p>The deliberations are poised to commence after judge Juan Merchan instructs jurors on the law.

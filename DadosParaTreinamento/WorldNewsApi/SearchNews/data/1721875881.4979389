Here's what we know about Jay Slater's disappearance. Who is Jay Slater? Jay Slater is a 19-year-old apprentice bricklayer from Lancashire in north-west England. He went missing after attending a music festival on Sunday, June 16 on the island of Tenerife. His friends raised the alarm after Mr Slater made a call to travel companion Lucy Law to say he was lost and attempting to walk back to their accommodation but needed water. Mr Slater said his phone battery was on 1 per cent. The call was cut off. Where did he go missing? Mr Slater's last known location is a mountainous path in Rural de Teno Park, which was determined by a ping from his phone. The national park is in the north-west of Tenerife, the largest of the Canary Islands, off West Africa. The 19-year-old and two friends had attended a music festival at Papagayo nightclub in the tourist hotspot Playa de las Am\u00e9ricas in southern Tenerife. His friends say they last saw him getting into a car with two men he met while on holiday, leaving Playa de las Am\u00e9ricas.

They had been together the best part of a decade and lived together in what he called a 'good relationship'. But as the country was plunged into a national lockdown, something began to shift. Joel, now 50, saw his girlfriend struggle to cope with the increasing isolation, noticing the dependence on drinking that had begun to seep into their happy house. Behind closed doors, their relationship became controlling and toxic. Even once restrictions were lifted, Joel's partner continued to be reliant on alcohol, often leaving the house on a Friday night and not returning until Sunday. He says she became increasingly possessive, stopping him from going on his phone or seeing his children. But one night when she returned it also became violent.

I used to go out and take my grandkids swimming on the weekend, but (the abuse) put a stop to that. \"I wasn't allowed out.\" Joel says his partner forced him to become isolated from his family, only allowing him to see them occasionally. When he did see them, he would become embroiled in arguments about his relationship and stick up for his partner, putting further distance between himself and his loved ones. He lived an increasingly isolated and controlled life over the next year, suffering through frequent physical and emotional assaults. Feeling 'trapped' by the relationship and by the feeling that domestic abuse couldn't happen to someone like him, he made an attempt on his own life. \"The relationship got really violent, and I got to the point where I nearly killed myself,\" he told the Manchester Evening News. \"I couldn't tell anyone what was going on, why I had all the bruises. \"People don't think it happens to men. I'm quite a big lad, and people just think why would you let a girl hit you and you don't do anything back? \"So I just got into my car and drove into a wall to try and kill myself.\" Joel survived - but it was only when a friend eventually noticed his bruises that he finally made the decision to speak to his doctor about the abuse he was facing. He was referred to a domestic violence service, who recognised his need to flee his situation, and secured him a space at a specialist facility for men suffering from domestic abuse. He was moved to Oak House, a six-bedroom property run by Trafford Domestic Abuse Services (TDAS), in the spring of last year. There, he was given a safe space away from his abuser to heal, as well as hands-on emotional support to help him start to rebuild his life. \"Walking in was daunting,\" he says. \"It was hard. I've never been in that situation before - I've worked all my life and been in good relationships. With the help of staff at Oak House, Joel began to repair his relationships with his family and children again. \"They helped me to get back to the life I used to have,\" he says, adding that he never felt 'judged' by anybody at the refuge. \"The first few days there were quite hard. But they don't push you, they let you do the talking, and they're there to listen. \"I always felt sorry for my ex-partner and I was always going back to her, but they got it into me that you don't allow it, and there is a way to get away from that.\" But, more than anything else, Joel says the company of other men in the same position helped him realise that what he had been suffering through was domestic abuse. He is still in touch with many of the men he met while living there. \"It was scary at first,\" he adds. \"People don't think domestic abuse can happen to men. But obviously we were all in there for the same thing. You get talking to the other lads - it was the first time I could speak to someone about it. \"I could open up, and it was like I could breathe easily then.\" Joel stayed in Oak House for four months before the centre helped him move out and settle into a place of his own. Now, nearly a year after he left, he is living a life he would not have believed possible while in the depths of his abuse. \"I'm seeing all my children, I'm doing things I used to do like going swimming with my grandchildren on the weekend and go on my motorbike,\" he said. \"It's just like the good old me. Oak House was the best thing that has ever happened really. \"It was a really huge help and I think we need more places like it.\"", "summary": "&quot;People don't think domestic abuse can happen to men - but you get talking to the other lads, it was the first time I could speak to someone about it&quot;", "url": "https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/im-6ft-tall-big-man-29263981", "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29293117.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Mental-health-stock.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 15:10:00", "author": "Nicole Wootton-Cane", "authors": ["Nicole Wootton-Cane"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.575}

nonetheless \"the best of allies in the whole world\" as he met with the new Prime Minister, Sir Keir Starmer, in the Oval Office on Wednesday.\n\nThe meeting between the 81-year-old American president and Starmer, a full two decades his junior, came after both leaders participated in talks with other NATO heads of state and government on the first full day of the 32-member block's annual summit in Washington.\n\nBiden expressed support for Starmer's efforts to fix the harm caused by Brexit as he urged the UK to become closer to Europe again.\n\nHe called the UK -- a founding signatory of the North Atlantic Treaty -- is \"knot that ties the transatlantic alliance together\" as the two men sat side-by-side during a brief availability with reporters.\n\n\"'The closer you are with Europe, the more engaged ... because we know where you are and we know where we are,\" he said.\n\nThe sit-down between the two leaders kicked off with a bit of levity when reporters asked Starmer if football was \"coming home\" following England's 2-1 victory over The Netherlands in the Euro 2024 semifinal.\n\nWhen he replied that \"it looks like it,\" Biden chimed in to credit the Prime Minister with the win.\n\nSir Keir played along, quipping that England remains undefeated since the start of the Labour government he leads after the party won the most seats in the July 4 general election.\n\nTurning to more serious matters, the Prime Minister congratulated Biden on hosting this year's summit and credited the president with ushering in what he described as \"a bigger NATO, a stronger NATO and a NATO with the resolve that we need.\"\n\nHe also said the Anglo-American \"special relationship\" was \"so important\" and added that it was \"forged in difficult circumstances,\" had \"endured for so long\" and is \"stronger now than ever.\"\n\nThe meeting between American and British leaders comes as Biden faced more calls for him to stand down from his re-election effort following his disastrous performance in a general election debate against his predecessor and current Republican challenger, former president Donald Trump.\n\nTrump, an opponent of NATO who has threatened to reneg on America's commitment to the mutual defense provisions of the North Atlantic Treaty should allied nations fail to spend enough on defense, is currently leading Biden in most public opinion polling, causing consternation among NATO leaders who fear that the Republican could destabilize the alliance by pulling America out of it should he return to office next year.",

between the two leaders kicked off with a bit of levity when reporters asked Starmer if football was \"coming home\" following England's 2-1 victory over The Netherlands in the Euro 2024 semifinal.\n\nWhen he replied that \"it looks like it,\" Biden chimed in to credit the Prime Minister with the win.\n\nSir Keir played along, quipping that England remains undefeated since the start of the Labour government he leads after the party won the most seats in the July 4 general election.\n\nTurning to more serious matters, the Prime Minister congratulated Biden on hosting this year's summit and credited the president with ushering in what he described as \"a bigger NATO, a stronger NATO and a NATO with the resolve that we need.\"\n\nHe also said the Anglo-American \"special relationship\" was \"so important\" and added that it was \"forged in difficult circumstances,\" had \"endured for so long\" and is \"stronger now than ever.\"\n\nThe meeting between American and British leaders comes as Biden faced more calls for him to stand down from his re-election effort following his disastrous performance in a general election debate against his predecessor and current Republican challenger, former president Donald Trump.\n\nTrump, an opponent of NATO who has threatened to reneg on America's commitment to the mutual defense provisions of the North Atlantic Treaty should allied nations fail to spend enough on defense, is currently leading Biden in most public opinion polling, causing consternation among NATO leaders who fear that the Republican could destabilize the alliance by pulling America out of it should he return to office next year.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [],

But he had to prompt the premier to take it - saying 'gimme your hand pal'.\n\nSir Keir has vowed to renegotiate the Brexit deal, with concerns that he could make concessions such as paying into Brussels budgets - although he has insisted Britain will not rejoin the customs union or single market.\n\nMr Biden has made great play of his Irish roots and -in contrast to his rival Donald Trump - was accused of taking the EU's side during wrangling over the divorce.\n\nThe meeting came as Sir Keir made his debut on the world stage by attending a Nato summit in Washington.\n\nHe also appeared to play down the raging controversy over Mr Biden's age, with Democrats urging the 81-year-old not to run again after a disastrous debate against Mr Trump.\n\nSir Keir told reporters that Labour's manifesto plan to force members of the House of Lords to retire at 80 did not imply other octogenarian politicians should quit.\n\nJoe Biden described the UK as the 'transatlantic knot' binding the two continents as he met the new PM in the White House\n\nThe meeting came as Sir Keir made his debut on the world stage by attending a Nato summit in Washington\n\nThe two leaders were in the famous Oval Office in the White House last night\n\nAt the start of the meeting, the President said: 'I kind of see you guys as the knot tying the transatlantic alliance together, the closer you are with Europe. We know where you are, you know where we are.'\n\nSir Keir told the president: 'The special relationship is so important. It's forged in difficult circumstances, endured for so long, and stronger now than ever.\n\nBe the first to commentBe one of the first to commentCommentsIs Keir right to play down fears about Biden's age?Comment now\n\n'I'm very pleased to be able to come so early in government to recommit to Nato, to recommit to the special relationship and to discuss these affairs with you.'\n\nBoris Johnson has been among those warning that Labour will water down the terms agreed with the EU.\n\nA UK Government spokesman said Mr Biden and Sir Keir 'agreed we must continue to do whatever it takes to support Ukraine and ensure aggressors like Putin do not win'.\n\nThe spokesman added: 'The President welcomed the Prime Minister's recent comments on establishing closer relationships with our European counterparts, as well as the UK's commitment to Aukus.'\n\nSpeaking before the talks, Sir Keir tried to dodge questions about Mr Biden's age.\n\n'In terms of the age in the House of Lords, the simple fact is that our House of Lords is massive,' he said.\n\n'It's the second biggest political chamber in the world. I think it's only the Chinese who have a bigger political chamber than our House of Lords, we have to reduce it.\n\n'That is the primary driver of the retirement at 80. You can see why that needs to be done. We've got 800-plus members of the House of Lords, it's simply too big. We need to reduce it.\n\n'So it doesn't reflect on how other elected representatives are chosen in other countries, it's to do with the size of the House of Lords.'\n\nMr Biden is facing calls from some Democrats to step aside. He has vowed to fight on but commentators have warned his performance at the NATO summit could decide his fate.\n\nThe meeting came as Sir Keir prepared to urge Nato allies to support Ukraine for 'as long as it takes' as he confirmed the UK's own \u00a33 billion a year military aid for Kyiv will continue.\n\nThe PM, who met Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky in the margins of the Nato summit in Washington yesterday, will tell members of the alliance later that they need to send a 'clear message' to Russian leader Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe UK's military support for Ukraine will continue until at least 2030/31 and for as long as it is needed.\n\nAt a special session on Ukraine at the Nato summit, Sir Keir will warn that the frontline defence of the Euro-Atlantic region is the Ukrainian trenches.\n\nHe will say: 'Nato was founded by the generation who defeated fascism. They understood not just the value of our strength, but the strength of our values.\n\n'Those values are under attack once again. Putin needs to hear a clear message ringing out from this summit - a message of unity and determination, that we will support Ukraine with whatever it takes, for as long as it takes, to uphold our shared values and our shared security.'\n\nThe Washington summit cemented Ukraine's 'irreversible' progress towards Nato membership, with a joint statement by the allies.\n\nNATO leaders posing for a family photo as the summit began yesterday\n\nBut because of Nato's Article V, which commits to mutual defence, the allies will not allow Ukraine to join while it is still at war as that would trigger an immediate conflict with Russia.\n\nNato allies are stepping up commitments on Ukraine while they await the results of November's US presidential election, where Donald Trump has threatened to reduce American support.\n\nConcerns about Mr Biden's plan to run for re-election were evident during his Oval Office meeting with Sir Keir.\n\nThe president did not directly respond to questions about George Clooney's criticism, after the actor and prominent Democrat supporter suggested he should leave the race.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail

It's forged in difficult circumstances, endured for so long, and stronger now than ever.\"\n\nThe new prime minister met President Biden for the first time at Nato's 75th anniversary summit in Washington just hours before their private talks in the Oval Office.\n\nPresident Biden called the US and UK the \"best of allies\", saying the UK was \"the transatlantic knot\" that ties Nato together with its European members.\n\nIt comes as Sir Keir is looking to form a new security pact with EU nations to strengthen co-operation on defence.\n\nThe two leaders' meeting came as Nato agreed further support for Ukraine at the Washington summit.\n\nSir Keir also confirmed that the UK's \u00a33bn a year military aid for Kyiv would continue.\n\nPresident Biden said \"things are moving in the right direction, I'm feeling really optimistic\".\n\nThe prime minister congratulated President Biden on hosting the summit, adding it was \"a bigger Nato, a stronger Nato and a Nato with the resolve that we need\".\n\nThe Labour leader - on his first overseas visit as prime minister - is a season ticket holder at Arsenal Football Club and gave President Biden a personalised team shirt as a present.\n\nIt has President Biden's surname on the back and the number 46 - a reference to him being the 46th US president.\n\nSir Keir also gave him a copy of the Atlantic Charter - the 1941 US-UK declaration which paved the way for the formation of the military alliance - featuring amendments from the then Labour leader Clement Attlee.\n\nForeign Secretary David Lammy, who accompanied Sir Keir on the trip, met his US counterpart Antony Blinken.\n\nThe State Department said the pair \"re-affirmed the importance of ensuring Ukraine has the economic, security, and humanitarian assistance it needs to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity\".\n\nThey \"discussed the need to reach a ceasefire in Gaza that secures the release of hostages and lays the groundwork for durable peace\".\n\nNew UK Defence Secretary John Healey met his US counterpart Lloyd Austin.\n\nThere was no mention of Sir Keir's Arsenal shirt gift when the two leaders spoke to reporters before their White House meeting - but there was a little time for both men to hail England's 2-1 victory over the Netherlands in the semi-finals of Euro 2024.\n\nSubstitute Ollie Watkins's last-minute winning goal in the match was scored just before Sir Keir arrived for the talks.\n\nAsked by reporters about the result, President Biden said, \"I heard\".\n\n\"Good news indeed,\" he added, joking that \"it's all because of the prime minister\".\n\nAnd the prime minister, when asked by the BBC's political editor Chris Mason, \"is football coming home?\", replied: \"It looks like it.\"\n\nSir Keir has confirmed he will be attending the final against Spain in Berlin on Sunday.\n\nAt one point during the Nato summit, a video clip posted on X by Sir Keir showed him stopping between meetings to watch England captain Harry Kane take a penalty.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The US president described the UK as the 'transatlantic knot' binding the two continents as he met the new PM in the White House.\n\nSir Keir has vowed to renegotiate the Brexit deal, with concerns that he could make concessions such as paying into Brussels budgets - although he has insisted Britain will not rejoin the customs union or single market. Mr Biden has made great play of his Irish roots and -in contrast to his rival Donald Trump - was accused of taking the EU's side during wrangling over the divorce.\n\nThe meeting came as Sir Keir made his debut on the world stage by attending a Nato summit in Washington. The premier said the visit was an opportunity to 'recommit' the military alliance and the 'special relationship'.\n\nThe President said: 'I kind of see you guys as the knot tying the transatlantic alliance together, the closer you are with Europe. We know where you are, you know where we are.' Sir Keir told the president: 'The special relationship is so important. It's forged in difficult circumstances, endured for so long, and stronger now than ever. I'm very pleased to be able to come so early in government to recommit to Nato, to recommit to the special relationship and to discuss these affairs with you.'\n\nBoris Johnson has been among those warning that Labour will water down the terms agreed with the EU. A UK Government spokesman said Mr Biden and Sir Keir 'agreed we must continue to do whatever it takes to support Ukraine and ensure aggressors like Putin do not win'.\n\nThe spokesman added: 'The President welcomed the Prime Minister's recent comments on establishing closer relationships with our European counterparts, as well as the UK's commitment to Aukus.' The meeting came as Sir Keir prepared to urge Nato allies to support Ukraine for 'as long as it takes' as he confirmed the UK's own \u00a33 billion a year military aid for Kyiv will continue.\n\nThe PM, who met Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky in the margins of the Nato summit in Washington yesterday, will tell members of the alliance later that they need to send a 'clear message' to Russian leader Vladimir Putin. The UK's military support for Ukraine will continue until at least 2030/31 and for as long as it is needed.\n\nAt a special session on Ukraine at the Nato summit, Sir Keir will warn that the frontline defence of the Euro-Atlantic region is the Ukrainian trenches. He will say: 'Nato was founded by the generation who defeated fascism. They understood not just the value of our strength, but the strength of our values. 'Those values are under attack once again. Putin needs to hear a clear message ringing out from this summit - a message of unity and determination, that we will support Ukraine with whatever it takes, for as long as it takes, to uphold our shared values and our shared security.'\n\nThe Washington summit cemented Ukraine's 'irreversible' progress towards Nato membership, with a joint statement by the allies. But because of Nato's Article V, which commits to mutual defence, the allies will not allow Ukraine to join while it is still at war as that would trigger an immediate conflict with Russia. Nato allies are stepping up commitments on Ukraine while they await the results of November's US presidential election, where Donald Trump has threatened to reduce American support.\n\nConcerns about Mr Biden's plan to run for re-election were evident during his Oval Office meeting with Sir Keir. The president did not directly respond to questions about George Clooney's criticism, after the actor and prominent Democrat supporter suggested he should leave the race.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

We know where you are, you know where we are,\" he said, to which Sir Keir replied: \"Well that is absolutely right.\"\n\nSo while Sir Keir leans more into Europe, President Biden and allies are also happy that, when it comes to NATO and Ukraine, the new prime minister is presenting continuity from Mr Sunak.\n\nHe has recommitted to the \u00a33bn funding package laid out by his predecessor and also came to the NATO summit with an \"iron-cast commitment\" to lift Britain's spending on defence to 2.5% - although, in contrast to Mr Sunak, he hasn't put a timeframe on when that will be achieved.\n\nIn the read-out after the prime minister and president bi-lateral - which I hear went over time - the UK government said the duo had \"reflected on the importance of the NATO alliance and the special relationship in the context of current geopolitical challenges, including the ongoing war in Ukraine\".\n\nThey agreed both countries must continue to do \"whatever it takes to support Ukraine and ensure aggressors like Putin do not win\".\n\nThe UK government also said the president had \"welcomed the prime minister's recent comments on establishing closer relationships with our European counterparts, as well as the UK's commitment to AUKUS. They reflected that at a time when we face growing challenges across the world, we are at our strongest when we unite and work together\".\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Click to subscribe to the Sky News Daily wherever you get your podcasts \ud83d\udc48\n\nSir Keir has brought Nick Thomas-Symonds, the cabinet minister responsible for EU relations, with him to this summit as he looks to accelerate talks on forging closer relations with EU leaders.\n\nThe new government has started the process of trying to renegotiate Boris Johnson's Brexit deal and is also setting up a new EU security pact.\n\nRead more from Sky News:\n\nGeorge Clooney calls on Biden to drop out of presidential race\n\nF-16 fighter jets to take to 'Ukrainian skies this summer'\n\nStarmer flexes diplomatic muscles at NATO summit\n\nMr Starmer and President Biden also joked about football, as they met shortly after England's victory over the Netherlands to win a place in the Euros finals.\n\nAsked in the Oval Office if football's coming home?

It's forged in difficult circumstances, endured for so long, and stronger now than ever. I'm very pleased to be able to come so early in government to recommit to Nato, to recommit to the special relationship and to discuss these affairs with you.\"\n\nHis first meeting with the US president would normally be a highlight, but with questions raging about Biden's health and age and the American election just four months away, it called for careful choreography.\n\nAt the start of their talks Biden was asked by reporters about George Clooney's article in the New York Times stating that Biden should stand down as the Democrat presidential candidate, but the president just shrugged.\n\nBiden was also asked about the England football team's victory earlier in the day. \"Good news indeed. It's all because of the prime minister,\" he said.\n\nStarmer was asked by reporters if \"football is coming home\". \"It looks like it,\" he replied. A visibly delighted prime minister told the president: \"I began to watch the game with the Netherlands prime minister, but we left at 1-1.\"\n\nBiden threw his head back and laughed, revealing a glistening set of teeth. \"And you guys are still talking to one another?\" he joked.\n\nThe prime minister, a passionate football fan, had earlier given the president an Arsenal shirt with the name \"Biden\" and the number 46 on the back - a reference to his status as the 46th US president.\n\n\"It's [Starmer's] team and [he] thought it would make a personal gift,\" a senior No 10 official said. Starmer has previously given Emmanuel Macron, the French president, an Arsenal top as a gift.\n\nHe also gave Biden a framed copy of the original Atlantic charter that led to the formation of Nato, with the then Labour prime minister Clement Attlee's amendments.\n\nAfter the talks, the Bidens were hosting Starmer, who has been accompanied by his wife, Victoria, to Washington, and other Nato

Later, he and wife Victoria would attend an 'informal' dinner at the White House alongside other Nato leaders.\n\nIn between there were 'brush bys' - US diplomatic code for brief meetings - with a string of other leaders, all keen to see if a bit of Sir Keir's election-winning shine rubs off on them. Everyone at these summits loves the new boy.\n\nEmmanuel Macron, who has deep electoral problems of his own at home, greeted him like an old friend, treating him to an elaborate handshake and a Gallic embrace.\n\nOn board the PM's jet - dubbed Keir Force One - there was an air of unreality among ministers and aides alike that they were there at all. Just a week before they had been slogging round the country, staying in B&Bs for the final days of the election campaign, now they were heading for the Nato summit and the world stage.\n\nAides were nervous about the one-on-one meeting with President Biden, writes Jason Groves\n\nOne insider said: 'It is just surreal. Last week we were at a community centre in Redditch, this week we're at the White House.'\n\nThat sense permeated right to the top. When Sir Keir came to the back of the plane for a 'huddle' with travelling journalists he joked: 'I've seen pictures of this - how does it work?'\n\nThe new PM, battle-hardened after weeks of campaigning, handled the session reasonably comfortably - neatly swerving a potentially tricky question about Joe Biden's age, and allowing himself to make little news.\n\nHowever, he froze, sitting silent for 15 seconds, when asked whether he was committed to stopping the small boats. Eventually the questions moved on but it was a strange moment, which would have caused him problems had it happened at a televised press conference.\n\nAlso noteworthy was his note-taking. The PM arrived clutching a sheaf of No 10 notepaper. But instead of jotting down his thoughts as the questions came in, he doodled a series of very deliberate rectangles. Curious.\n\nBut he came alive when the subject turned to football, enthusing about his beloved Arsenal and England star Bukayo Saka.\n\n'I'd remind you, England have not missed a penalty under a Labour government in 2024,' he joked.\n\nIn fact the football was something of a preoccupation yesterday. Sir Keir was alarmed to find that he was due to be in summit meetings when England's semi-final kicked off, and - worse - his phone would be taken off him. Officials were instructed to keep him updated via diplomatic notes, which is how he learned England had fallen behind. A brief break in the schedule allowed him and the Dutch PM Dick Schoof to find a screen in time to watch Harry Kane slot him the equalising penalty before they were summoned in to the next session.\n\nAides were nervous about the one-on-one meeting with President Biden. The talks were due to be preceded by five minutes of small talk in front of a group of journalists packed into the Oval Office.\n\nNormally it would be a routine occasion, but with President Biden under intense pressure at home, both men suddenly found their meeting was under heavy scrutiny.\n\nWhen Sir Keir came to the back of the plane for a 'huddle' with travelling journalists he joked: 'I've seen pictures of this - how does it work?'\n\nKeir Starmer's wife Victoria was resplendent in red on the White House balcony as leaders and their wives posed for pictures\n\nThe PM appears to have been briefed to treat President Biden as he might an elderly care home relative, speaking loudly, slowly and deliberately and making an effort to involve the older man in the conversation.\n\nPresident Biden looks waxen and moves more stiffly than he did even a couple of years ago. Earlier he had struggled to bend to embrace Italian PM Giorgia Meloni, who stands a full foot shorter than him.\n\nBut on this occasion, the President's mental faculties appeared to be in reasonable order. In fact he even managed to slip in a political favour to Sir Keir. In an apparent endorsement of the PM's plan to unpick the UK's Brexit deal, he told him: 'I kind of see you guys as the knot tying the transatlantic alliance together, the closer you are with Europe.'\n\nDid it cross Sir Keir's mind that he should savour this encounter? Things could be very different in six months' time if Donald Trump returns to the White House.\n\nThe PM appeared taken aback when the short on-camera session ended and the Oval Office erupted with shouted questions to the President about George Clooney's explosive call for him to stand down.\n\nPresident Biden responded with a small shrug. Sir Keir looked horrified as journalists were hustled, still shouting, out of the President's inner sanctum.\n\nAnd then to dinner. When Labour won last week, journalists were warned not to expect to see much of Sir Keir's wife, who is dubbed 'Lady Vic' in Labour circles, and who is said to be a reluctant first lady.\n\nYet there she was, on his very first trip, pictured holding his hand at the top of the aeroplane steps wearing a light white dress, perfect for the suffocating heat which has descended on Washington this week.\n\nYesterday she and other spouses were hosted by Jill Biden for a brunch at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History. Today they will tour the US President's Camp David retreat.\n\nLast night she was there again, resplendent in red on the White House balcony as leaders and their wives posed for pictures ahead of a dinner to mark Nato's 75th anniversary.\n\nIt was a lavish affair.

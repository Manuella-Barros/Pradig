The United Jewish Appeal is holding its annual \u201cWalk with Israel\u201d event, which involves a five-kilometre walk and a festival in the city\u2019s north end. Police have said they aim to \u201cavoid confrontations\u201d by designating certain areas for those who plan to protest the event, and they have warned that anyone engaging in criminal behaviour will be arrested. Police also said officers from various other forces will be present to ensure public safety. The United Jewish Appeal Federation of Greater Toronto said the annual \u201cWalk with Israel\u201d attracts roughly 20,000 participants, but many more are expected to attend this year in light of the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. Several groups representing Jews who oppose Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza are urging community members to instead sit with the students at a pro-Palestinian encampment on the University of Toronto campus this morning.", "summary": "The United Jewish Appeal is holding its annual \"Walk with Israel\" event, which involves a five-kilometre walk and a festival in the city's north end.", "url": "https://globalnews.ca/news/10555309/walk-with-israel-toronto/", "image": "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240608150620-ddf2eded28a67d67310993844a0f06f6e3073baeacfd33f3b2953f5d30186ec1_4ff8e5.jpg?quality=85&#038;strip=all", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 13:23:26", "author": "Kevin Nielsen", "authors": ["Kevin Nielsen"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ca", "sentiment": 0.519}

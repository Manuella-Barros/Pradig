The former Selling Sunset star, 35, said that she is taking \"applications\" for her next partner in a video posted on her Instagram on Saturday, June 8. \u201cNow taking baby daddy applications ?,\u201d Quinn wrote in the caption of her post. The comment comes after Quinn\u2019s estranged husband Christian Dumontet filed for divorce on April 5 following his arrest on a domestic violence charge. In a clip, which was filmed on the night Quinn attended the White Fox Hot Summer Nights party at LAVO Hollywood in Los Angeles on June 7, she swiveled her face to the camera flirtatiously and swished her hair. \u201cDo we got it, Daddy?\u201d Quinn asked her friend behind the camera, who was filming her. \u201cWe got it,\u201d they replied. Quinn also declared it a \u201cHot Girl Summer\u201d while sharing other footage from the event. \u201c? Who\u2019s ready for hot girl summer? ?,\u201d the reality star remarked in one caption, tagging the clothing brand White Fox. \u201cI am! ?.\" At the party, Quinn was seen reuniting with her formerly Selling Sunset costars Mary Fitzgerald and Jason Oppenheim, along with newer cast member Nicole Young. The star \u2014 who departed the show after five seasons in 2022 \u2014 appeared in happy spirits with the group. Quinn\u2019s appearance at the party came days after she accused her estranged husband of violating a temporary restraining order placed against him by allegedly having an acquaintance \u201cspy\u201d on her at the home the pair formerly shared, where she currently resides with their son. In a court filing obtained by PEOPLE, Quinn\u2019s attorney provided video doorbell footage of \u201can unknown man\u201d at the residence on May 27. The same individual left with Dumontet, 45, after a court appearance on Tuesday, June 4, according to the court documents.

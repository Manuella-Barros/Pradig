As I stand before you, I am met with a mixture of pride, gratitude and excitement, as this next chapter in our lives will be filled with new opportunities of university and adulthood. It is this journey to this moment I would like to commemorate with this speech. We have all taken different paths to arrive here today. Some of us have diligently studied to go into a profession we have always admired, while others have been searching and learning new passions here at Eastglen exploring the many possibilities they can work towards. All of our journeys have been unique, but today we can all stand here as one graduating class. Our journey through school has been marked by perseverance and dedication. We have spent countless hours studying in the math lab, written dozens of essays in the library all while rehearsing our lines for a play or attending the early morning practices for handball. We have faced hurdles and setbacks. Gone through years of schooling with COVID, online classes that no one ever wanted to attend, but each time, we have persevered. Through all these difficulties, we have discovered the true benefit of our resilience. As we celebrate our achievements, it is important to thank all those who supported us and made these accomplishments possible.", "summary": "Profiles of Edmonton's top students in 2023-2024.", "url": "https://edmontonjournal.com/news/edmontons-valedictorians-eastglen", "image": "https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/edmontonjournal/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/peebles_jonathan_eastglen-kim-smith.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-23 01:27:00", "author": "Postmedia News", "authors": ["Postmedia News"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ca", "sentiment": 0.637}

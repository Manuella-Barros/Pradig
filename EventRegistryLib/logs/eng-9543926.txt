According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, fentanyl is 50 times stronger than heroin and 100 times stronger than morphine. Now, a new study published in BMJ Case Reports reveals how much more terrifying this synthetic opioid can be. Doctors from Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU) have documented the first known instance of toxic leukoencephalopathy, a rare type of brain damage resulting from the inhalation of fentanyl.\n\nThe findings shed light on a new and alarming way this dangerous drug can wreak havoc on the brain. The patient, a 47-year-old man with no prior medical issues, was found unresponsive in a hotel room during a work conference. Crushed pills and white residue, later identified as fentanyl, were discovered nearby. When he arrived at the hospital, he was barely conscious and unable to communicate.\n\nInitially, a standard drug screen came back negative. However, doctors had a hunch and ordered a specialized test for fentanyl, which revealed shockingly high levels in his system. Brain scans painted a concerning picture -- there was significant damage to the white matter, the brain's communication highways.\n\nToxic leukoencephalopathy is a condition where white matter in the brain becomes damaged due to exposure to toxins. Think of it like a city's roads and bridges crumbling after a massive chemical spill. In this case, inhaling fentanyl vapors is thought to have directly attacked these delicate structures.\n\n\"We know very well the classic opiate side effects: respiratory depression, loss of consciousness, disorientation,\" says lead study author Dr. Chris Eden, a second-year resident in internal medicine at the OHSU School of Medicine who was part of the patient's treatment team, in a media release. \"But we don't classically think of it causing possibly irreversible brain damage and affecting the brain, as it did in this case.\"\n\nFentanyl is an opioid commonly prescribed for severe pain, but in recent years, it has become a major player in the opioid epidemic due to skyrocketing levels of misuse. This case reveals that beyond its known dangers, fentanyl can also silently ravage the brain when inhaled.\n\nThe OHSU medical team ruled out other potential causes like infections, stroke, or oxygen deprivation before landing on the diagnosis of fentanyl-induced toxic leukoencephalopathy. Although cases of brain damage from inhaling heroin have been reported before, this is the first time doctors have seen it happen with fentanyl.\n\nOver his month-long hospital stay, the patient slowly regained consciousness and the ability to communicate. He went through intensive rehabilitation to relearn basic skills. Fortunately, he recovered enough to eventually return to work. However, the long-term impacts remain unknown, as toxic leukoencephalopathy can have lasting effects.\n\n\"I have regrets often about what I did to myself, my wife and my family,\" the patient says. \"I'm grateful to all the doctors, nurses and EMTs who saved my life, and the therapists who got me back to a functioning member of society.\"\n\nThis case is a wake-up call about the hidden neurological dangers of fentanyl abuse, especially for use inhaling the drug. It underscores the importance of screening for this potent opioid, as standard drug tests often miss it. Catching fentanyl poisoning early could prevent devastating brain damage.\n\nAs our understanding of toxic leukoencephalopathy grows, doctors hope to find better ways to protect and heal the brain from these damaging effects. For now, the best defense is preventing fentanyl abuse in the first place through education, addiction treatment, and policies to restrict the illegal opioid supply.", "source": {"uri": "studyfinds.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Study Finds"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Health_&_Science_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oregon Health & Science University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fentanyl", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fentanyl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_damage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brain damage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Opioid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukoencephalopathy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leukoencephalopathy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhalation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inhalation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amino acid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Morphine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_matter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White matter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_overdose", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drug overdose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toxicity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chemical synthesis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heroin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Side effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoventilation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hypoventilation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconsciousness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unconsciousness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neuroimaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internal medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opiate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Opiate"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cardiovascular_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cardiovascular Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Wounds_and_Injuries", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Wounds and Injuries", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Men's_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Men's Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://studyfinds.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AdobeStock_176873221-scaled.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543926", "eventUri": "eng-9543926", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

But this is the first reported case associated with fentanyl, say the report authors.\n\nThe condition is manifest in various signs and symptoms, the most obvious of which are neurological and behavioral changes, ranging from mild confusion to stupor, coma, and death.\n\nThe outlook for those affected generally depends on the extent of white matter injury, explain the report authors: some people will recover fully; others will progressively get worse.\n\nIn this case, the man had no previous medical problems of any note, and had been unconscious for an unknown period of time in his hotel room, where unidentified crushed pills and a white residue were found on a nearby table.\n\nOn arrival at the hospital, he wasn't able to answer questions or follow commands. He responded to pain stimuli to his legs, but not his arms.\n\nA brain scan revealed inflammation and swelling of white matter as well as cerebellar injury. The cerebellum is the part of the brain responsible for gait and balance. He tested negative for epilepsy.\n\nA drug screen returned negative results, but a separate urine test indicated a very high level of fentanyl, prompting a diagnosis of toxic leukoencephalopathy induced by fentanyl inhalation.\n\nEighteen days later, he remained bedbound and still required tube feeding. He was given several different drugs to treat urinary incontinence, kidney injury, cognitive impairment, suspected opioid withdrawal, pain and agitation, and pneumonia.\n\nAfter 26 days he was discharged to a rehabilitation facility, and after another month returned home with the support of outpatient physiotherapy and occupational therapy.\n\nLess than a year after his hospital admission he had fully recovered and had returned to work full time.\n\nCommenting on the incident, he describes his recovery as \"miraculous,\" adding: \"Early on it was looking like I would need 24-hour care after being discharged, but I focused and worked hard in my therapy session and was determined not to leave the hospital only to be checked into a group facility for ongoing care.\"\n\nExpressing gratitude to all the healthcare professionals who not only saved his life, but enabled him to get back to the life he had before, he says: \"I have regrets often about what I did to myself, my wife, and my family.\"\n\nThe report's authors conclude: \"This case illustrates the need for inclusion of fentanyl in routine urine drug screens for earlier identification and appropriate management.\"\n\nFor more on this research, see First Documented Brain Damage From Fentanyl Inhalation.\n\nReference: \"Clinical and neuroradiographic features of fentanyl inhalation-induced leukoencephalopathy\" by Christopher O Eden, Duna S Alkhalaileh, David R Pettersson, Alan J Hunter and Asad H Arastu, 1 April 2024, BMJ Case Reports CP.\n\nDOI: 10.1136/bcr-2023-258395", "source": {"uri": "scitechdaily.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SciTechDaily"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukoencephalopathy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Leukoencephalopathy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhalation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inhalation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_matter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White matter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fentanyl", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fentanyl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heroin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Toxicity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Neurology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inflammation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chasing_the_dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chasing the dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_matter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grey matter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insufflation_(medicine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Insufflation (medicine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cerebellum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chemical synthesis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Axon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_damage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brain damage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Opioid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stupor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stupor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconsciousness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unconsciousness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neuroimaging"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cardiovascular_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cardiovascular Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Men's_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Men's Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Chronic_Illness", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Chronic Illness", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://scitechdaily.com/images/Brain-Disease-Scan-Neurological-Disorder-Concept-Art.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543926", "eventUri": "eng-9543926", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4588235294117647, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

Tomorrow represents an important opportunity to honor those we've lost to fentanyl poisonings by educating others about the deadly threat of this synthetic opioid.\n\nTo commemorate the first-ever National Fentanyl Awareness Day two years ago, the DEA Museum opened the Faces of Fentanyl exhibit at DEA Headquarters. The memorial wall, which now features more than 5,000 photos of Americans lost to the fentanyl crisis, has become a memorial for families and friends to visit when in the Washington, D.C., area.\n\nThe memorial serves as a powerful illustration of the deadliest drug threat our nation has ever faced. In 2022 alone, 107,941 Americans died from drug poisonings, with a staggering 70% of those deaths caused by fentanyl and synthetic opioids. Fentanyl remains the leading cause of death among Americans aged 18-45.\n\nTo mark National Fentanyl Awareness Day 2024, the DEA Museum and the Faces of Fentanyl exhibit will have extended hours on Tuesday, May 7, from 6 a.m. until 6 p.m.\n\n\"Americans today are experiencing the most devastating drug crisis in our nation's history. This is because one drug - fentanyl - has transformed the criminal landscape. DEA will stop at nothing to defeat the two Mexico based cartels - Sinaloa and Jalisco Cartels - responsible for American deaths,\" said Administrator Anne Milgram. \"All Americans across the U.S., coast to coast, and every community in between have been harmed by fentanyl.

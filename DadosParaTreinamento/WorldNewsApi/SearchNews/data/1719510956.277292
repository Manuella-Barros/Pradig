Held at Hollinwell, the English Stroke-Play Championship had been to be completed with two rounds on Sunday only for the threat of lightning lead to the final day being reduced to just 12 holes. After opening scores of 66 and 72, Graham started out four shots off the lead, held by Australian Harry Takis, but a closing 47 for a nine-under-par total catapulted the Scot to the top of the leaderboard. Graham birdied the third and sixth as players tackled the opening eight holes before then missing out the next six holes at the Nottinghamshire venue. He then birdied both the 16th and 17th before finishing with a three-putt bogey on the par-4 18th. That left him facing a nervous wait, but it was job done as Englishman Daniel Hayes and Swede Wilhelm Ryding both came up just short in their bid to force a play-off as Takis tumbled out of contention after running up two 7s in the space of three holes. \u201cIt feels absolutely amazing,\u201d said Graham of his latest success, having landed the South African Amateur title in February during a strong start to the new season. \u201cI\u2019m so happy to get the win today as it\u2019s obviously such a big event and it\u2019s great to get a win like this.\u201d On the way the last day panned out, the Paul Lawrie Foundation ambassador added: \u201cWe found out last and it was obviously a bit strange, but I knew it was a great chance as it became a bit of a shoot-out so I just had to go out and give myself as many chances as possible. I did that and tried to make as many birdies as possible. \u201cI was on edge waiting to see what the result was going to be. Yeah, I was a bit nervous standing around with my dad and all my friends.\u201d Graham is the first Scot to get his hands on the Brabazon Trophy since Lloyd Saltman in 2005. Prior to that, Ronnie Shade recorded a hat-trick of victories in 1961, 1963 and 1967 before Sandy Lyle won it in both 1975 and 1977 then Gordon Brand jnr got his name on it in 1978. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s amazing,\u201d admitted Graham of landing the latest tartan triumph. It\u2019s nice to get another Scottish name on the trophy and hopefully we can continue to get more and more.\u201d As for how he planned to celebrate, he said: \u201cI\u2019ve got a long drive back but once we get home I\u2019ll be having a few beers with my family and friends and I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d", "summary": "Scot records second big victory of season after South African Amateur success in February", "url": "https://www.scotsman.com/sport/golf/gregor-graham-wins-brabazon-trophy-after-12-hole-final-round-shoot-out-4643077", "image": "https://www.scotsman.com/webimg/b25lY21zOjA2MDM0NTExLTBmMmYtNDE1Ny04ODdmLTc2OTEzZTc0N2YxYjowODFkNGJkYy00OWRjLTQ4NmItOGE2Ny1lNjQ1NGRhYmM1Njc=.jpg?width=1200&enable=upscale", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 13:59:39", "author": "Martin Dempster", "authors": ["Martin Dempster"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.147}

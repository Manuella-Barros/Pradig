Pilates instructor and founder of Reform Me Sami McDonald, 25, said the boys from Hurstville Zagreb FC are loving their weekly pilates classes and are noticing the benefits after just one month. \u201cSoccer players are very heavy on their ankles and their feet with kicking, so I\u2019ve prioritised ankle stability and support, for example, we do a lot of stuff on their toes where they lift and lower their heels,\u201d she said. \u201cI think their flexibility and mobility has improved; the biggest benefit for men generally is improved mobility in their hip region, which is not as naturally loose as women\u2019s.\u201d The first-grade soccer players are spreading the word to the rest of their teammates at Zagreb FC, with Ms McDonald saying she has had to expand her services to include mat pilates to accommodate the growing interest from the other players. \u201cMy reformer studio is limited to six beds at the moment, so I\u2019ve got plans in the works to set up a mat class so I can fit everyone in because they are really keen to join their teammates,\u201d she said. Commenters on the now viral Instagram reel have commended the boys on their effort in the class and called for more sports departments to incorporate pilates into their athletes\u2019 regular training. \u201cPersonally I think all footballers should take reformer pilates,\u201d one commenter said. \u201cIt would most certainly prevent a lot of injuries, especially if the focus is on improving their core stability and their contralateral sling patterns.\u201d With a different male commenter saying, \u201cThere really needs to be more marketing and messaging for men doing pilates. \u201cI\u2019d love to try it but the classes are all full of women and there is a real stigma around it.\u201d When the Zagreb players came to their first class Ms McDonald said most of them were expecting a class full of just stretching. \u201cThey really had no idea that pilates is a real workout, they weren\u2019t expecting the pilates burn, they didn\u2019t even know that was a thing,\u201d she said. Ms McDonald has been teaching pilates for three years and said over this time she has noticed a significant increase in men taking pilates as a form of regular exercise. \u201cIn my general classes I have at least two men who come regularly every week,\u201d she said. \u201cRecently I\u2019ve seen an increase in younger men doing pilates, whereas when I started it was more middle-age men, but both can benefit of course.\u201d In her professional experience, Ms McDonald said men tend to care for their bodies differently to women. \u201cIf men get an injury they tend to just ignore it and that is not what you\u2019re meant to do,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why increasing men\u2019s awareness of the benefits of pilates is so important, for them to understand you know it was initially made for physiotherapy, that it is not just this \u2018girly\u2019 exercise.\u201d Pilates has surged in popularity over the last ten years, growing from a niche service to a more mainstream form of exercise, according to the latest data from IBISWorld 2019-2024 report. Pilates is still heavily dominated by women in Australia, with the difference between women and men taking classes being about 9 to 1, says market research company Roy Morgan. According to its 2018 data, 1.1 million women take pilates compared to just over 120,000 men. Pilates instructor and founder of Pilates Insync Helen Stamatakos has been training elite athletes for 18 years and says an increasing number of athletes are cross-training with pilates. She\u2019s trained big names, from the likes of diver Melissa Wu to athletics star Rohan Browning, including several beloved Matildas prior to the Women\u2019s World Cup 2023, from Alanna Kennedy to Charlotte Grant, and currently trains the young Matildas team. Training elite athletes makes up a large portion of Ms Stamatakos\u2019 business, which includes NRL players, like the St George Illawarra Dragons. The Dragons train regularly with Ms Stamatakos who travels to Wollongong from her studio in Menai to teach the team. \u201cPilates is popular with elite athletes as it is beneficial in reducing the risk of injury because it is eccentric movement,\u201d Ms Stamatakos said. \u201cIt increases their range of motion while under load, so therefore it improves mobility and that\u2019s the biggest thing.\u201d Traditionally, athletic training is based on progressive load, where you up your weights with your reps, but with pilates you are lengthening your muscles through springs under load, she said. \u201cSo therefore with pilates, they are strengthening but they are also improving their mobility.\u201d Pilates is the secret to athlete longevity, performance enhancement and injury prevention, she said.", "summary": "A men\u2019s soccer team has gone viral on Instagram after being \u201chumbled\u201d by a reformer pilates class in southern Sydney, showing viewers it is a lot harder than it looks.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/05/29/lifestyle/sydney-soccer-players-humbled-by-reformer-pilates-class/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/sydney-soccer-players-humbled-reformer-82840340.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/1vU6S9DH-RyIcpnTz.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:20:19", "author": "News.com.au", "authors": ["News.com.au"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.062}

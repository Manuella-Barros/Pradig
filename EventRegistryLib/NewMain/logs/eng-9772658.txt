He collected six PGA Tour trophies through June, the most of anyone since Arnold Palmer in 1962.\n\n\"We built a couple additional shelves,\" Scheffler said Monday. \"We were redoing the room as I was winning a bunch and so we just kind of had to continue to adjust, which was a pretty fun thing to be able to do.\"\n\nAn Olympic gold medal would be a nice addition, and it wouldn't even take up much room.\n\nThat's what Scheffler has set out to do at Le Golf National, where the men's competition starts on Thursday with its strongest field since golf returned to the Olympic program in 2016.\n\nScheffler, the No. 1 player in golf since May of last year, leads a 60-man field that features the top seven players in the world ranking. He is the favorite, as he has been all year, although he now faces a significant challenge from PGA and British Open champion Xander Schauffele.\n\nHideki Matsuyama considers Scheffler the benchmark.\n\n\"To win any medals, we need to beat Scottie and Xander Schauffele, the best players,\" he said.\n\nScheffler and Schauffele played 18 holes on Sunday when they arrived, teeing off about 30 minutes apart. They joined the other Americans -- Collin Morikawa and Wyndham Clark -- for nine holes on Monday.\n\nScheffler, who won the Masters for the second time this year, sees a lot of similarities with Schauffele, who delivered a masterpiece in the final round at Royal Troon two weeks ago to win the British Open.\n\n\"I love seeing people like him have success because he does it the right way. He works hard. He's not full of himself,\" Scheffler said. \"We were playing a practice round today and I was actually thinking about it. Xander is the exact same today after winning the tournament as he was if he had lost the tournament by one.\"\n\nThat's been Scheffler's mantra since he began this blistering pace two years ago. Golf is what he plays, it's not what defines him. He separates home from work.\n\n\"I've just been out here competing and I've been fortunate to have a few wins, but when I show up to a tournament, I don't feel any different,\" Scheffler said. \"I'm not trying to be any different. I don't show up acting like the No. 1 player in the world. I don't show up as anybody other than myself, and I just try to do my best to compete.\"\n\nThe additional attention has been a challenge, and Scheffler got a taste of that over the weekend when he went to the Louvre with his family. He was stunned by the size and the amount of people, and he felt he saw only a fraction of the museum in two hours.\n\nScheffler wasn't part of the attraction, but he did not go unnoticed.\n\n\"I definitely saw a few people looking at me weird,\" he said. \"It wasn't like I got recognized in a crowded room and all of a sudden I had to take like a hundred pictures. One person would come up, and a few minutes later another person would. ... No big deal.\"\n\nIf there was a chance to get a big head, it would be that remodeled golf room.\n\nIn the last five months, he has added another Masters trophy along with The Players Championship and four \"signature events\" against the strongest field. If friends come over and want to see the green jacket, he'll take them to his office.\n\n\"But for the most part, I go there to work on my clubs and practice a bit,\" he said.\n\nThere was one brief moment when Scheffler allowed for a little reflection. His wife, Meredith, was in the other room and Scheffler jokingly grabbed his Masters green jacket and his plaid jacket from winning at Hilton Head.\n\n\"I held The Players trophy in one hand, and I had another trophy in the other hand and walked in the living room like, 'Wassup, Mere,'\" he said with a laugh.\n\nThat's the extent of it. He married his high school girlfriend. They had their first child in May. He plays golf for a living and has produced an elite tee-to-green game at a level not seen since the peak years of Tiger Woods. In his eyes, nothing has changed but the number of trophies and earnings that top $28 million.\n\nNow it's about a medal, not money.\n\nScheffler is taking in as much of the Olympic experience as possible. He was at table tennis on Sunday and plans to see gymnastics on Tuesday. And then it's all about golf.\n\nPlayers are still trying to gauge the value of a gold medal in a sport where the emphasis is on four majors each year.\n\n\"It would be very special to have the gold medal. If I don't, my life is certainly not going to end,\" Scheffler said. \"But it would be extremely special, and it's one of the reasons why I'm here. I love going to watch table tennis. But that's not why I showed up.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideki_Matsuyama", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hideki Matsuyama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Golf_National", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Le Golf National"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Palmer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arnold Palmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_World_Golf_Ranking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Official World Golf Ranking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyndham_Clark", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wyndham Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collin_Morikawa", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Collin Morikawa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Players_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Players Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tartan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Table tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilton_Head_Island,_South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hilton Head Island, South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hilton Head Island, South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/07/30/2e1dab2a-832a-41c5-bd8a-ff4a3825063e/thumbnail/1200x630/f03d5406d165395b502eee63134a259f/ap24211439812424.jpg?v=5501038cbc281520ff9fdc308faab7dc", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772658", "eventUri": "eng-9772658", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.419607843137255, "wgt": 227, "relevance": 1}

He collected six PGA Tour trophies through June, the most of anyone since Arnold Palmer in 1962.\n\n\"We built a couple additional shelves,\" Scheffler said Monday. \"We were redoing the room as I was winning a bunch and so we just kind of had to continue to adjust, which was a pretty fun thing to be able to do.\"\n\nAn Olympic gold medal would be a nice addition, and it wouldn't even take up much room.\n\nThat's what Scheffler has set out to do at Le Golf National, where the men's competition starts on Thursday with its strongest field since golf returned to the Olympic program in 2016.\n\nScheffler, the No. 1 player in golf since May of last year, leads a 60-man field that features the top seven players in the world ranking. He is the favorite, as he has been all year, although he now faces a significant challenge from PGA and British Open champion Xander Schauffele.\n\nHideki Matsuyama considers Scheffler the benchmark.\n\n\"To win any medals, we need to beat Scottie and Xander Schauffele, the best players,\" he said.\n\nScheffler and Schauffele played 18 holes on Sunday when they arrived, teeing off about 30 minutes apart. They joined the other Americans -- Collin Morikawa and Wyndham Clark -- for nine holes on Monday.\n\nScheffler, who won the Masters for the second time this year, sees a lot of similarities with Schauffele, who delivered a masterpiece in the final round at Royal Troon two weeks ago to win the British Open.\n\n\"I love seeing people like him have success because he does it the right way. He works hard. He's not full of himself,\" Scheffler said. \"We were playing a practice round today and I was actually thinking about it. Xander is the exact same today after winning the tournament as he was if he had lost the tournament by one.\"\n\nThat's been Scheffler's mantra since he began this blistering pace two years ago. Golf is what he plays, it's not what defines him. He separates home from work.\n\n\"I've just been out here competing and I've been fortunate to have a few wins, but when I show up to a tournament, I don't feel any different,\" Scheffler said. \"I'm not trying to be any different. I don't show up acting like the No. 1 player in the world. I don't show up as anybody other than myself, and I just try to do my best to compete.\"\n\nThe additional attention has been a challenge, and Scheffler got a taste of that over the weekend when he went to the Louvre with his family. He was stunned by the size and the amount of people, and he felt he saw only a fraction of the museum in two hours.\n\nScheffler wasn't part of the attraction, but he did not go unnoticed.\n\n\"I definitely saw a few people looking at me weird,\" he said. \"It wasn't like I got recognized in a crowded room and all of a sudden I had to take like a hundred pictures. One person would come up, and a few minutes later another person would. ... No big deal.\"\n\nIf there was a chance to get a big head, it would be that remodeled golf room.\n\nIn the last five months, he has added another Masters trophy along with The Players Championship and four \"signature events\" against the strongest field. If friends come over and want to see the green jacket, he'll take them to his office.\n\n\"But for the most part, I go there to work on my clubs and practice a bit,\" he said.\n\nThere was one brief moment when Scheffler allowed for a little reflection. His wife, Meredith, was in the other room and Scheffler jokingly grabbed his Masters green jacket and his plaid jacket from winning at Hilton Head.\n\n\"I held The Players trophy in one hand, and I had another trophy in the other hand and walked in the living room like, 'Wassup, Mere,'\" he said with a laugh.\n\nThat's the extent of it. He married his high school girlfriend. They had their first child in May. He plays golf for a living and has produced an elite tee-to-green game at a level not seen since the peak years of Tiger Woods. In his eyes, nothing has changed but the number of trophies and earnings that top $28 million.\n\nNow it's about a medal, not money.\n\nScheffler is taking in as much of the Olympic experience as possible. He was at table tennis on Sunday and plans to see gymnastics on Tuesday. And then it's all about golf.\n\nPlayers are still trying to gauge the value of a gold medal in a sport where the emphasis is on four majors each year.\n\n\"It would be very special to have the gold medal.

An Olympic...", "body": "SAINT QUENTIN-EN-YVELINES, France (AP) - Scottie Scheffler picked a good time to remodel his golf room at his home in Dallas, an office where he keeps trophies and a Masters green jacket, special memorabilia and space to tinker with his golf clubs.\n\nHe started winning, and then winning some more. He collected six PGA Tour trophies through June, the most of anyone since Arnold Palmer in 1962.\n\n\"We built a couple additional shelves,\" Scheffler said Monday. \"We were redoing the room as I was winning a bunch and so we just kind of had to continue to adjust, which was a pretty fun thing to be able to do.\"\n\nAn Olympic gold medal would be a nice addition, and it wouldn't even take up much room.\n\nThat's what Scheffler has set out to do at Le Golf National, where the men's competition starts on Thursday with its strongest field since golf returned to the Olympic program in 2016.\n\nScheffler, the No. 1 player in golf since May of last year, leads a 60-man field that features the top seven players in the world ranking. He is the favorite, as he has been all year, although he now faces a significant challenge from PGA and British Open champion Xander Schauffele.\n\nScottie Scheffler, of the United States, smiles on the 11th green during a practice round for the men's golf event at the 2024 Summer Olympics, Monday, July 29, 2024, at Le Golf National in Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, France. (AP Photo/Matt York)\n\nHideki Matsuyama considers Scheffler the benchmark.\n\n\"To win any medals, we need to beat Scottie and Xander Schauffele, the best players,\" he said.\n\nScheffler and Schauffele played 18 holes on Sunday when they arrived, teeing off about 30 minutes apart. They joined the other Americans - Collin Morikawa and Wyndham Clark - for nine holes on Monday.\n\nScheffler, who won the Masters for the second time this year, sees a lot of similarities with Schauffele, who delivered a masterpiece in the final round at Royal Troon two weeks ago to win the British Open.\n\n\"I love seeing people like him have success because he does it the right way. He works hard. He's not full of himself,\" Scheffler said. \"We were playing a practice round today and I was actually thinking about it. Xander is the exact same today after winning the tournament as he was if he had lost the tournament by one.\"\n\nThat's been Scheffler's mantra since he began this blistering pace two years ago. Golf is what he plays, it's not what defines him. He separates home from work.\n\n\"I\u00b4ve just been out here competing and I\u00b4ve been fortunate to have a few wins, but when I show up to a tournament, I don\u00b4t feel any different,\" Scheffler said. \"I\u00b4m not trying to be any different. I don\u00b4t show up acting like the No. 1 player in the world. I don\u00b4t show up as anybody other than myself, and I just try to do my best to compete.\"\n\nThe additional attention has been a challenge, and Scheffler got a taste of that over the weekend when he went to the Louvre with his family. He was stunned by the size and the amount of people, and he felt he saw only a fraction of the museum in two hours.\n\nScheffler wasn't part of the attraction, but he did not go unnoticed.\n\n\"I definitely saw a few people looking at me weird,\" he said. \"It wasn't like I got recognized in a crowded room and all of a sudden I had to take like a hundred pictures. One person would come up, and a few minutes later another person would. ... No big deal.\"\n\nIf there was a chance to get a big head, it would be that remodeled golf room.\n\nIn the last five months, he has added another Masters trophy along with The Players Championship and four \"signature events\" against the strongest field. If friends come over and want to see the green jacket, he'll take them to his office.\n\n\"But for the most part, I go there to work on my clubs and practice a bit,\" he said.\n\nThere was one brief moment when Scheffler allowed for a little reflection. His wife, Meredith, was in the other room and Scheffler jokingly grabbed his Masters green jacket and his plaid jacket from winning at Hilton Head.\n\n\"I held The Players trophy in one hand, and I had another trophy in the other hand and walked in the living room like, 'Wassup, Mere,'\" he said with a laugh.\n\nThat's the extent of it. He married his high school girlfriend. They had their first child in May. He plays golf for a living and has produced an elite tee-to-green game at a level not seen since the peak years of Tiger Woods. In his eyes, nothing has changed but the number of trophies and earnings that top $28 million.\n\nNow it's about a medal, not money.\n\nScheffler is taking in as much of the Olympic experience as possible. He was at table tennis on Sunday and plans to see gymnastics on Tuesday. And then it's all about golf.\n\nPlayers are still trying to gauge the value of a gold medal in a sport where the emphasis is on four majors each year.\n\n\"It would be very special to have the gold medal. If I don't, my life is certainly not going to end,\" Scheffler said. \"But it would be extremely special, and it's one of the reasons why I'm here. I love going to watch table tennis. But that's not why I showed up.\"\n\nAP Olympic coverage: https://apnewscom/hub/2024-paris-olympics-games\n\nScottie Scheffler, left, and Xander Schauffele, of the United States, watch a putt during a practice round for the men's golf event at the 2024 Summer Olympics, Monday, July 29, 2024, at Le Golf National in Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, France.

He collected six PGA Tour trophies through June, the most of anyone since Arnold Palmer in 1962.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We built a couple additional shelves,\" Scheffler said Monday. \"We were redoing the room as I was winning a bunch and so we just kind of had to continue to adjust, which was a pretty fun thing to be able to do.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn Olympic gold medal would be a nice addition, and it wouldn't even take up much room.\n\nSports Roundup\n\nGet the latest D-FW sports news, analysis, scores and more.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nOr with:\n\nGoogle\n\nFacebook\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nThat's what Scheffler has set out to do at Le Golf National, where the men's competition starts on Thursday with its strongest field since golf returned to the Olympic program in 2016.\n\nScheffler, the No. 1 player in golf since May of last year, leads a 60-man field that features the top seven players in the world ranking. He is the favorite, as he has been all year, although he now faces a significant challenge from PGA and British Open champion Xander Schauffele.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHideki Matsuyama considers Scheffler the benchmark.\n\n\"To win any medals, we need to beat Scottie and Xander Schauffele, the best players,\" he said.\n\nScheffler and Schauffele played 18 holes on Sunday when they arrived, teeing off about 30 minutes apart. They joined the other Americans -- Collin Morikawa and Wyndham Clark -- for nine holes on Monday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScheffler, who won the Masters for the second time this year, sees a lot of similarities with Schauffele, who delivered a masterpiece in the final round at Royal Troon two weeks ago to win the British Open.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I love seeing people like him have success because he does it the right way. He works hard. He's not full of himself,\" Scheffler said. \"We were playing a practice round today and I was actually thinking about it. Xander is the exact same today after winning the tournament as he was if he had lost the tournament by one.\"\n\nThat's been Scheffler's mantra since he began this blistering pace two years ago. Golf is what he plays, it's not what defines him. He separates home from work.\n\n\"I've just been out here competing and I've been fortunate to have a few wins, but when I show up to a tournament, I don't feel any different,\" Scheffler said. \"I'm not trying to be any different. I don't show up acting like the No. 1 player in the world. I don't show up as anybody other than myself, and I just try to do my best to compete.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe additional attention has been a challenge, and Scheffler got a taste of that over the weekend when he went to the Louvre with his family. He was stunned by the size and the amount of people, and he felt he saw only a fraction of the museum in two hours.\n\nScheffler wasn't part of the attraction, but he did not go unnoticed.\n\n\"I definitely saw a few people looking at me weird,\" he said. \"It wasn't like I got recognized in a crowded room and all of a sudden I had to take like a hundred pictures. One person would come up, and a few minutes later another person would. ... No big deal.\"\n\nIf there was a chance to get a big head, it would be that remodeled golf room.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the last five months, he has added another Masters trophy along with The Players Championship and four \"signature events\" against the strongest field. If friends come over and want to see the green jacket, he'll take them to his office.\n\n\"But for the most part, I go there to work on my clubs and practice a bit,\" he said.\n\nThere was one brief moment when Scheffler allowed for a little reflection. His wife, Meredith, was in the other room and Scheffler jokingly grabbed his Masters green jacket and his plaid jacket from winning at Hilton Head.\n\n\"I held The Players trophy in one hand, and I had another trophy in the other hand and walked in the living room like, 'Wassup, Mere,'\" he said with a laugh.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat's the extent of it. He married his high school girlfriend. They had their first child in May. He plays golf for a living and has produced an elite tee-to-green game at a level not seen since the peak years of Tiger Woods. In his eyes, nothing has changed but the number of trophies and earnings that top $28 million.\n\nNow it's about a medal, not money.\n\nScheffler is taking in as much of the Olympic experience as possible. He was at table tennis on Sunday and plans to see gymnastics on Tuesday. And then it's all about golf.\n\nPlayers are still trying to gauge the value of a gold medal in a sport where the emphasis is on four majors each year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It would be very special to have the gold medal. If I don't, my life is certainly not going to end,\" Scheffler said. \"But it would be extremely special, and it's one of the reasons why I'm here. I love going to watch table tennis. But that's not why I showed up.\"\n\nRelated Stories\n\nView More\n\nTexas ex Ryan Crouser says he's 'as good as I ever was, if not better' for Paris Olympics\n\nJoshua Edwards, super heavyweight

They also saw the Mona Lisa.\n\nOn Sunday, Scheffler went to the table tennis competition, and he plans to attend gymnastics Tuesday. All of this in the midst preparing for his first Olympics golf competition.\n\n\"Obviously my biggest priority is showing up ready to play this week, but I definitely want to experience a little bit of the Olympics,\" Scheffler said, \"but it's definitely been fun, being part of the Olympics, and it's definitely a different vibe this week.\"\n\nScheffler said come Wednesday, it's all business as he, along with Xander Schauffele, Collin Morikawa and Wyndham Clark, represent Team USA in the Paris Olympics. The men's golf competition, featuring 60 golfers from across the globe, will take place at Le Golf National, site of the 2018 Ryder Cup, beginning Thursday.\n\nAs for the No. 1 golfer in the world, he's one of the favorites, along with Schauffele, the defending gold medalist and winner of two majors this year, including two weeks ago in the Open Championship at Royal Troon.\n\nAnd Scheffler would be more than willing to don the gold medal come Sunday afternoon.\n\n\"It would be very special to have the gold medal,\" Scheffler said. \"It's definitely one of the reasons why I'm here this week. I didn't come here to -- I love going to watch table tennis yesterday but that's not why I showed up.\n\n\"I try to place an equal amount of value to all the tournaments I play. I feel like that any time I show up, I'm trying to do my best, and that's definitely the case this week. It's definitely special to be part of the Olympics and I'm looking forward to the chance to compete for a medal for our country.\"\n\nScheffler has six wins this season, including the Masters, and he has grown to become one of the faces of professional golf since bursting onto the scene with his stellar 2022 season.\n\nHis fame is worldwide, too. Although he said nothing too crazy happened, he said people have recognized him in Paris and from time to time come up for a picture or autograph.\n\nOne of the most memorable moments of his time in Paris thus far was the Louvre.\n\n\"As we were walking around, I felt like we saw 1/10th of the museum at most. We were there for two hours and I felt like I could have been there for days exploring around looking at all the old paintings,\" he said. \"I would say the paintings were something that really took me back. It was pretty wild how big they were and how talented people were back then, and also how long they preserved them for as long as they have.\n\n\"I can get pretty interested in that kind of stuff just standing there reading the descriptions of all the stuff and the images, and it was definitely a fun few hours.\"\n\nScheffler said he played 18 holes Sunday and another nine Monday, his first times at the course. He watched footage from the 2018 Ryder Cup, and his caddie, Ted Scott, has experience at the venue from that competition.\n\nWhen it comes to the golf, Scheffler isn't worried about how he can perform on the course. When it comes to being an Olympic athlete in another sport?\n\n\"I think at one time I would have considered the table tennis that we played elite, and I'm pretty sure it's far from it,\" Scheffler said after watching the competition Sunday. \"\n\n\"Could I be a multi-sport athlete in the Olympics? I don't think so. But sometimes I have irrational self-confidence, and maybe if I really put my mind to it.\"", "source": {"uri": "golfweek.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Golfweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cameron_jourdan@golfweek.usatoday.com", "name": "Cameron Jourdan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Table tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyndham_Clark", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wyndham Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collin_Morikawa", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Collin Morikawa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louvre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louvre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_Lisa", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mona Lisa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Golf_National", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Le Golf National"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://golfweek.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/87/2024/07/USATSI_23770349.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772658", "eventUri": "eng-9772658", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

That definitely was -- definitely shocked me a little bit just how many people were in there and how big the place was,\" Scheffler said during a news conference at Le Golf National, site of this week's tournament outside Paris. \"I couldn't believe how big it was.\n\n\"But we saw the Mona Lisa which was really cool and saw some of the crown jewels. And as we were walking around, I felt like we saw 1/10th of the museum at most. We were there for two hours and I felt like I could have been there for days exploring around looking at all the old paintings.\n\n\"I would say the paintings were something that really took me back. It was pretty wild how big they were and how talented people were back then, and also how long they preserved them for as long as they have. I can get pretty interested in that kind of stuff just standing there reading the descriptions of all the stuff and the images, and it was definitely a fun few hours.\"\n\nSo Scheffler got a nice little history lesson. If he could add a gold medal to his second Masters title, the Players Championship and four other wins this year, that would be an impressive bonus.\n\nMORE: Pros increasingly appreciative of Olympic opportunity\n\nScheffler is coming off a tie for seventh at the British Open where he was in the thick of contention until a four-putt -- one of the putts was from off the green -- at the par-4 9th hole. That effectively knocked him from contention.\n\nIt was a less-than-stellar putting week for Scheffler, who has improved in that area significantly this year.\n\n\"I would have felt like some weeks, the ball is going up towards the hole and it tends to go in and there's other weeks where is it tends to go towards the edge and lip out, and felt like I was on the lip-out side of the week,\" Scheffler said. \"But still coming in having a T7 and putting up a good fight was a solid week overall. But Xander played some great golf.\"\n\nScheffler was referring to Xander Schauffele, who won his second major title of the year after also having captured the PGA Championship. Schauffele, Scheffler, Collin Morikawa and Wyndham Clark are the four Americans in the 60-player Olympic field that begins play Thursday.\n\nAfter the Open, Scheffler said he and his family headed to a location south of Paris to get in some rest and relaxation while also practicing. He played the Le Golf National course for the first time on Sunday and played another nine holes Monday.\n\nThe course was the site of the 2018 Ryder Cup, where the Americans were trounced. None of those players made the Olympic field although five players from that European team did, including Jon Rahm.\n\nHelping Scheffler is his caddie, Ted Scott, who worked that Ryder Cup for Bubba Watson.\n\n\"The rough is not nearly as penal as it was for the Ryder Cup and right now the golf course is not nearly as firm,\" Scheffler said. \"We'll see how the weather is for the rest of the week but I'm sure it will firm up a bit if we get no rain.\n\n\"Teddy did mention how much the course changed from practice rounds to tournaments that week -- from the practice rounds to the tournament this week. So maybe it will be a little bit similar this week in terms of the golf course changing. But I did watch the Ryder Cup and Ted has got some good info from the course that week.\"\n\nScheffler has a lot of golf ahead. The FedEx Cup playoffs -- he's been leading the points list for months -- follow just a week after the Olympic tournament ends. And then the Presidents Cup.\n\n\"It would be very special to have the gold medal,\" he said. \"If I don't, my life is certainly not going to end but it would be extremely special to have a gold medal and it's definitely one of the reasons why I'm here this week.

marked the Tokyo Games to soak up the atmosphere of the host city and watch other events.\n\nThat included a visit to the world's biggest museum on Saturday where was able to roam freely with little attention, he told reporters.\n\n\"I could not believe how many people were in there and how big it was,\" he said of the Louvre during a press conference at Le Golf National, the Olympic venue south of Paris.\n\n\"I would say the paintings were something that really took me back,\" he said, mentioning Leonardo Da Vinci's Mona Lisa as part of \"one tenth of the museum at most\" that he saw.\n\nAfter a packed PGA Tour season, including a final major of the season in wild Scottish weather at the British Open this month, Scheffler said he enjoyed having his wife and baby boy with him last week as he practiced further south in France before coming up to Paris.\n\nThe downtime included Olympic table-tennis and Scheffler plans to catch gymnastics on Tuesday before focusing on the men's golf tournament Thursday-Sunday.\n\nJoining his U.S. teammates for practice since Sunday, he praised Schauffele's unchanged, down-to-earth nature after the Tokyo gold medalist also had a stellar year with two major titles including the British Open.\n\nAs he prepares at the Le Golf National, Scheffler has been able to pick the brains of his caddie Ted Scott, who was part of the U.S. Ryder Cup

We were playing a practice round today and I was actually thinking about it like, 'Man, Xander is the exact same today after winning tournaments as he was if he had lost the tournament by one'.\"\n\njc/jw", "source": {"uri": "ccenterdispatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Clay Center Dispatch On-Line"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@ccenterdispatch.com", "name": "Agence France-Presse", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Golf_National", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Le Golf National"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Players_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Players Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_World_Golf_Ranking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Official World Golf Ranking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zika_virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zika virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Table tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyndham_Clark", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wyndham Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collin_Morikawa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Collin Morikawa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Women", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/ccenterdispatch.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/e5/ae58d955-c723-53cb-82e4-28530bbdcff1/669d17fd847a0.image.jpg?crop=349%2C349%2C81%2C0&resize=200%2C200&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772658", "eventUri": "eng-9772658", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

Different golfers also play in this event every four years, leading these routine-oriented players to adapt to a new environment each time around -- a tall task for any athlete.\n\nYet Scheffler remained as calm, cool, and collected as ever on Monday, a big reason why he is the best player in the world and has won six times already this season.\n\n\"It's definitely fun being here and it's fun being a part of the event,\" Scheffler said.\n\n\"Looking forward to competing.\"\n\nPlayers, pundits, and fans struggle to calculate the weight of a Gold Medal compared to a major championship or a regular PGA Tour event, as this competition now disrupts pro golf's schedule every four years.

year, headlines a U.S. team that also features world No. 2 and reigning Olympic champion Xander Schauffele.\n\nLike other athletes, Olympic debutant Scheffler is taking advantage of the absence of COVID-restrictions that marked the Tokyo Games to soak up the atmosphere of the host city and watch other sports.\n\nThat included a visit to the world's biggest museum on Saturday where was able to roam freely with little attention, he told reporters.\n\n\"I could not believe how many people were in there and how big it was,\" he said of the Louvre during a press conference Monday at Le Golf National, the Olympic venue south of Paris.\n\n\"I would say the paintings were something that really took me back,\" he said, mentioning Leonardo Da Vinci's Mona Lisa as part of \"one-tenth of the museum at most\" that he saw.\n\nAfter a packed season, including a final major in wild Scottish weather at The Open this month, Scheffler said he enjoyed having his wife and baby boy with him last week as he practiced further south in France before coming up to Paris.\n\nThe downtime has also involved seeing some Olympic table tennis, with plans to catch gymnastics on Tuesday before focusing on the Aug. 1-4 men's golf tournament, he added.\n\nJoining his U.S. teammates for practice since Sunday, he praised Schauffele's unchanged down-to-earth nature after the Tokyo gold medallist also had a stellar year with two major titles, including The Open.\n\nAs he prepares at the Le Golf National, Scheffler has been able to pick the brains of his caddie, Ted Scott, who was part of the U.S. Ryder

He has yet to record a hole-in-one, but he did secure an M.A. in Sports Journalism from St. Bonaventure University.\n\nScottie Scheffler is a humble man, a player who does not bask in the glory of being the best player on the planet.\n\nInstead, he is pretty reserved, focusing his energy on 'the present' and the task at hand. Scheffler also takes great pride in his preparation, working tirelessly to perfect his craft, which has worked well for him this season. He has amassed six victories so far in 2024, including one at TPC Sawgrass and another at Augusta National. His four other wins came against strong fields in Signature Events, with his latest triumph being the Travelers Championship in Connecticut a month ago.\n\nHe has plenty of reason to boast about himself but would never do so publicly. And yet, Scheffler, ahead of this week's Men's Golf Competition in the Olympics in Paris, shared a cheeky story about something he did earlier this year while at home with his wife, Meredith.\n\nInside his house is a space Scheffler calls 'The Golf Room.' He keeps some of his trophies and trinkets in there, like a small pin from Augusta National that signifies that he is a member of the club. But the room's primary purpose is to serve as Scheffler's trophy case and keep anything golf-related in a safe space.\n\nSo earlier this year, when he and his wife were re-doing this room at home, Scheffler decided to have some fun with Meredith.\n\n\"I took a trophy, my green jacket, and the plaid jacket, and I think I held the Players trophy in one hand, and I had another trophy in the other hand, and I walked in the living room like, 'Sup Mer,'\" Scheffler said.\n\nThe two-time Masters champion then explained that he does not go in there to reflect on his victories but instead enters this room to work on his clubs and practice. It's like his \"office,\" he says.\n\n\"Sometimes, when we have people over and they want to talk about golf or see the jacket or whatever, I'll take them back there and show them a few things,\" Scheffler added.\n\n\"I definitely don't sit in there. I work on my clubs back there, but I don't do anything else.\"", "source": {"uri": "sbnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SB Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jack_milko@sbnation.com", "name": "Jack Milko", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Bonaventure_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Bonaventure University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusta_National_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Augusta National Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hole_in_one", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hole in one"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPC_at_Sawgrass", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TPC at Sawgrass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelers_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Travelers Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6EjKxSh7JL36sF93Z9jNMgvPUAc=/0x320:4166x2403/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25550727/2158409298.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772658", "eventUri": "eng-9772658", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

The course that will be used for the Olympics is the well-known Albatros course, which is considered one of the top courses in Europe. It has been the annual host for the French Open since it opened in 1991.\n\nGolf Channel will broadcast all golf competitions from the 2024 Paris Olympics at Le Golf National.

The world No. 1 golfer was a Captain's Pick at the 2021 Ryder Cup at Whistling Straits in Sheboygan, Wisconsin and an automatic qualifier for the 2023 Ryder Cup team at Marco Simone Golf & Country Club in Italy.\n\nAt the 2021 Ryder Cup, Scheffler helped the United States to a 19-9 win over Europe with a 2-0-1 record (a win in the four-ball and singles portion of the event). Scheffler was only able to earn one point for the United States at the 2023 Ryder Cup, one in which they lost 16.5-11.5 to Europe in.\n\nScheffler heads to Paris with 12 career wins on the PGA Tour and two major championships -- both at The Masters -- on his resume.\n\nWith the win at Augusta National Golf Club in April at the 2024 Masters Tournament, Scheffler became one of 18 golfers to have won the Masters at least twice in their careers. Since then, Scheffler has finished in first place in three events, including beating Tom Kim in a playoff at the 2024 Travelers Championship.\n\nHere's a full breakdown of the events that Scheffler

He is very much of the aw, shucks style, chuckling away pressure and, as he said Monday at the Olympics, showing up to each tournament as the same exact person he was before his latest victory.\n\nBut at home, it's starting to get a bit more difficult. The trophy room has been growing.\n\nScheffler is the front-runner for the PGA Tour Player of the Year award and also the rare, doesn't-need-to-show-up-until-East-Lake designation. He's claimed so many FedEx Cup points he could take the first two weeks of the playoffs off and still likely arrive at the Tour Championship in first place. That happens when you win six times in a season. It also demands you get serious about your trophy space.\n\nThe winningest room in golf this year is what Scheffler aptly calls his \"Golf Room\" at his home in Dallas. His clubs are kept in there, old \"trinkets\" from this golf thing and that golf thing, even a pin-sized piece that Augusta National awards Masters Champions, signifying their membership to the club. He'll practice in there, too, so Scheffler has had to clear out some stuff this year and, considering all the winning he's done, also add more shelving for trophies. On Monday, he called that simply, \"pretty fun.\"\n\nOnly problem was he was winning at a rate we haven't seen since the peak of Tiger Woods. Scheffler once won four times in five starts over the course of seven weeks this March and April. He added another win at the Memorial tournament, and then polished off June with a win at the Travelers Championship.\n\n\"We were redoing the room as I was winning a bunch,\" he began, \"and so we just kind of had to continue to adjust, which was a pretty fun thing to be able to do.\"\n\nYes, we imagine that could be a pretty fun thing to do. The winning and the adjusting. Also a pretty fun flex to make on your general contractor.\n\nScheffler's ability to not get caught up in his accomplishments is nearly as impressive as his accomplishments themselves. He seemingly possesses zero scar tissue from close losses. And seems to never ride a wave of overconfidence after a win. There has been a bit of an unbothered nature to his immense success that most golf mortals can't seem to fathom. But he did have one relatable moment recently.\n\nOn Monday at Le Golf National, Scheffler was asked if he ever looks around that golf room of his and pause to enjoy all he's done. Right now? Not quite. He hopes to do so maybe sometime this fall, during his offseason. But until then, there's only really been one moment where he's decided to be a bit of a show-off.\n\n\"I think one time this year I took like a trophy, I took my green jacket and the plaid jacket, and I think I held like the Players trophy in one hand, and I had another trophy in the other hand and walked in the living room like, 'Sup, Mer.'\"\n\nWhat a visual. One that draws to mind the famous images of Tiger Woods posing with all four World Golf Championship trophies at once, since he was the reigning champion in each tournament. Only this would take place from the intimate comforts of Casa de Scheffler.\n\n\"At the end of the day, I'm just a golfer and I'm just out here trying to compete,\" Scheffler continued, sprinting back into humble mode. \"That's really all there is to it, and sometimes I'm good at it and sometimes I'm bad at it. I've talked about it a lot. It doesn't define me as a person. Doesn't define my life and I'm just happy to be here.\"", "source": {"uri": "golf.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Golf"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tour_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tour Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FedEx_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FedEx Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusta_National_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Augusta National Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelers_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Travelers Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Golf_National", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Le Golf National"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Golf_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Golf Championships"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://golf.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/scheff.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772658", "eventUri": "eng-9772658", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

I don't think so, Scheffler said.

The American golfer is part of a star-studded USA team that includes reigning Olympic champion Schauffele, Wyndham Clark and Collin Morikawa. Scheffler is aiming to cap off an impressive season by adding an Olympic gold medal to his collection.\n\n\"It's not very often you get to compete in the Olympics, so to be able to have a medal for the rest of your life would be very special,\" he said on Monday, adding: \"If I don't, my life is certainly not going to end but it would be extremely special to have a gold medal and it's definitely one of the reasons why I'm here this week. I loved going to watch table tennis yesterday but that's not why I showed up. I try to place an equal amount of value to all the tournaments I play.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Rory McIlroy's brilliant comeback to hecklers as he prepares for Olympics\n\nREAD MORE: Xander Schauffele has extra motivation for wanting to win Olympic gold again in Paris\n\nScheffler's remarkable season has been overshadowed by the success of his Team USA partner and defending Olympic champion Schauffele, who won The Open Championship earlier this month at Royal Troon after triumphing in the PGA Championship in May. \"I love seeing people like him (Schauffele) have success because he does it the right way - he works hard,\" Scheffler continued.\n\n\"He's not full of himself. We were playing a practice round today and I was actually thinking about it like, 'Man, Xander is the exact same today after winning tournaments as he was if he had lost the tournament by one'.\"\n\nGolf made its return to the Olympics at the 2016 Rio Games after a 112-year absence. However, Paris will mark the first time the Games will proceed without any major disruptions. The Brazil event saw several top players withdraw due to the Zika Virus, while the Tokyo Games were marred by Covid and delayed by a year.\n\n\"I think there's always been weird situations surrounding the Olympics - the first one with Zika virus, and last one with Covid being a factor. I think that certainly had an effect on the Games,\" Scheffler added.

If Scheffler can do so, he will become the second straight American golfer to win gold, joining Team USA teammate Xander Schauffele, who took home gold at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.\n\nHere's a look at Scheffler's scorecard from Day 1 of Olympic competition in Paris and how he fares against the rest of the Olympic field, including how to watch golf at the 2024 Paris Olympics:\n\nScheffler's score on each hole is listed below, as well as his under-par score for the round in parentheses\n\nHere are some of the notable players in the 60-player field for the 2024 Paris Olympics:\n\nScheffler will tee off 3:11 a.m. CT on Thursday, Aug. 1 in the first round of men's gold at the 2024 Paris Olympics. He will be paired with Rory McIlroy (Ireland) and Ludvig Aberg (Sweden).\n\nHere's the full schedule of competition at the 2024 Paris Olympics:\n\nGolf competition at the 2024 Paris Olympics, both men's and women's, will take place at Le Golf National in Guyancourt, France -- \"new town\" of Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines and the site of the 2018 Ryder Cup.\n\nLe Golf National consists of three courses, two of which are 18-hole courses. The course that will be used for the Olympics is the well-known Albatros course, which is considered one of the top courses in Europe. It has been the annual host for the French Open since it opened in 1991.\n\nGolf Channel will broadcast all golf competitions from the 2024 Paris Olympics at Le Golf National. You can also stream the competition on Peacock or on Fubo, which carries the NBCUniversal family of networks and provides a free trial to select users.\n\nWhile the 2024 Paris Olympics will be Scheffler's Olympic debut, it won't be his first time playing at the international level. The world No. 1 golfer was a Captain's Pick at the 2021 Ryder Cup at Whistling Straits in Sheboygan, Wisconsin and an automatic qualifier for the 2023 Ryder Cup team at Marco Simone Golf & Country Club in Italy.\n\nAt the 2021 Ryder Cup, Scheffler helped the United States to a 19-9 win over Europe with a 2-0-1 record (a win in the four-ball and singles portion of the event). Scheffler was only able to earn one point for the United States at the 2023 Ryder Cup, one in which they lost 16.5-11.5 to Europe in.\n\nScheffler heads to Paris with 12 career wins on the PGA Tour and two major championships -- both at The Masters -- on his resume.\n\nWith the win at Augusta National Golf Club in April at the 2024 Masters Tournament, Scheffler became one of 18 golfers to have won the Masters at least twice in their careers. Since then, Scheffler has finished in first place in three events, including beating Tom Kim in a playoff at the 2024 Travelers Championship.\n\nHere's a full breakdown of the events that Scheffler has won on the PGA Tour since joining in 2020:\n\nWe occasionally recommend interesting products and services.

Moving forward through crisis situations can be difficult but a recent incident involving PGA Tour professional Scottie Scheffler offers a master class in crisis management for organizations facing unexpected challenges.\n\nOn May 17 in Louisville, Kentucky, at the PGA Championship at Valhalla, Scheffler found himself in an unimaginable situation. Scheffler made his way to the course for his tee time just after an early-morning accident tragically took the life of a tournament volunteer. While the details are contested, he drove around cones to enter the main gate and ended up in a dispute with a Louisville Metro Police Department (LMPD) officer. Scheffler was then arrested on serious charges just hours before he was scheduled to play. For those who know his reputation, this was tough to imagine and could have quickly become the opening shot of a good man's downfall.

This is the OLYMPICS. These athletes have worked their entire lives to get here. Sure, they can have fun taking in the games, but when it's their turn to compete, it's time to lock in.\n\nOf course, Scottie Scheffler is not typical.\n\nThe PGA Tour superstar is much more soft-spoken and even-keeled. Even when getting arrested for something video proved he didn't do, Scheffler remained calm and understanding. That's how he became the No. 1 golfer in the world and why he remains in that spot.\n\nSo when photos of Scheffler and his fellow Olympians from the PGA Tour stating their goals for the Games emerged, the scariest sight wasn't Rory McIlory, Matthew Fitzpatrick or Shane Lowry declaring they wanted to win gold. It was Scheffler saying he wanted to \"have fun\".\n\nTypically, when Scheffler is having fun, the rest of the field is doomed.\n\nOh yeah, everyone else in the field is cooked.

Or, as the World No. 1 called it at his pre-Olympics press conference, \"the golf room where I just keep all my crap\".\n\nScheffler has won a staggering six times on the PGA Tour in 2024 -- the first player to accomplish the feat before July since Tiger Woods. Scheffler won four (of the eight) Signature Events, his second Masters, and the Players Championship -- the biggest money prize on the PGA Tour.\n\nAhead of his Olympics debut, the decorated 27-year-old cited two keys to his historic season, which also includes two runner-ups, a T8 at the PGA Championship, and a T7 at the Open Championship. Scheffler said he's prioritized reframing the negativity while keeping an even keel as the expectations have risen.\n\n\"I think mostly I'm proud of how I've been mentally,\" he told the media on Monday in Paris, where he enjoyed checking out table tennis and the Louvre. \"I think being in the spotlight can be challenging at times. I felt like last year was fairly challenging in a sense of the questions I was receiving in areas like this, seemed to have more of a negative connotation and this year they seemed to have a much more positive connotation.\"\n\nRunning parallel to Scheffler's unmatched success on the golf course has been unique off-course circumstances. He was arrested during the PGA Championship. He welcomed his first child weeks shortly after.\n\n\"I'm not trying to be any different,\" he said about his eventful 2024. \"I don't show up acting like the No. 1 player in the world, and I don't show up as anybody other than myself, and I just try to do my best to compete.\n\n\"I would say I'm the most proud of myself in the last couple years not being overly emotional with how my golf has been, whether it be too negative or too positive. If it was too negative, I would be probably a pretty miserable person to be around and if was too positive; if I loved myself too much, I would probably be a pretty tough person to be around as well.\"\n\nWhen it comes to the actual golf, the best ball-striker in the world cited his work on the greens (thanks, Rory McIlroy!) as his most notable area of improvement. Scheffler has gained 0.4 strokes on the field putting in 2024; still just 90th on the PGA Tour, but much better than 2023, when he lost -0.3 strokes on average.\n\n\"I think if you took a look at my statistics, statistically I think my putting has gotten better than last year and I think I still have a lot of room to improve,\" he said Monday. \"Based on pure statistics, I went from losing shots on the green to I think I'm positive now. Seeing those little results like that can be really great for your covered knowing you're working on the right things and working in the right direction.\"\n\nScheffler ranks first in strokes gained: total, first in approach, fourth in driving, and first in greens in regulation this season. When he makes his putts, he wins tournaments. When he struggles on the greens -- as he did at Royal Troon -- he merely hangs around the top 10.\n\n\"Sometimes the game is really just as simple as that, holing a couple more putts,\" he said. \"Definitely this year I've holed some putts in key moments. I've looked back at rounds like I had at the Players, holing key putts; like the Masters; making the putt to win at the Memorial. The margins out here are so small that sometimes you're a good break away from winning a tournament and a bad break away from losing one.\"\n\nThe Olympics men's golf competition (a standard 72-hole, lowest-score event) will take place from Aug. 1-3 at Le Golf National, near Versailles. Scheffler is one of four Team USA representatives in the 60-person field, along with Collin Morikawa, Wyndham Clark, and his competition for PGA Tour Player of the Year race, Xander Schauffele.\n\n\"I try not to think about it,\" Scheffler said about the end of year award. \"I've had a pretty good year and Xander has had a pretty about year as well. It's for people to vote on.

(Jack Gruber/USA Today Sports.)\n\nScottie Scheffler's surplus of wins lately has created some crowding.\n\nAll of the new hardware that goes with this historic run caused Scheffler to alter the living arrangements in his golf room.\n\n\"We were redoing the room as I was winning a bunch,\" he told Golf.com, \"and so we just kind of had to continue to adjust, which was a pretty fun thing to be able to do.\"\n\nHumblebrag.\n\nScheffler's trophy room is already filled to the brim with accomplishments, including six (!!!) wins on the PGA Tour this year. That's why he continues as the No. 1 player in the world, a spot he's held since 2022.\n\nSince all of these accomplishments have come fast, Scheffler's finally taking a moment to smell the roses a bit.\n\n\"I think one time this year I took like a trophy, I took my green jacket and the plaid jacket, and I think I held like the Players' trophy in one hand, and I had another trophy in the other hand and walked in the living room like, 'Sup, Mer,'\" he said.\n\nScheffler looks to add to his collection vying for a gold medal in the Paris Olympics. He credits just showing up as himself as a mentality to ensure that goal is achieved.\n\n\"At the end of the day, I'm just a golfer and I'm just out here trying to compete,\" Scheffler continued, sprinting back into humble mode. \"That's really all there is to it, and sometimes I'm good at it and sometimes I'm bad at it.

Team USA only gets to bring its top four players in the Official World Golf Ranking and that means superstars like Bryson DeChambeau, Brooks Koepka and Patrick Cantlay were left at home. Scottie Scheffler, Xander Schauffele, Collin Morikawa and Wyndham Clark will represent the United States at the 2024 Summer Game and Schauffele is the defending gold medalist.\n\nSchauffele bested Rory Sabbatini by a shot in Tokyo and now he's listed at +525 in the 2024 Paris Olympics golf odds. Scheffler is the +300 favorite, while Ireland's Rory McIlroy and Spain's Jon Rahm are both listed at +700 in the Olympics 2024 golf odds. Before locking in your 2024 Olympics Men's Golf picks or Team USA props, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.\n\nOur proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June 2020. In fact, the model is up more than $9,000 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament.\n\nThis same model has also nailed a whopping 13 majors entering the weekend, including the 2024 Masters -- its third Masters in a row -- and this year's PGA Championship and U.S. Open. Anyone who has followed it has seen massive returns.\n\nNow with the Olympics Men's Golf 2024 field set for Paris, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard.\n\nTop 2024 Team USA golf predictions for the Olympics\n\nOne surprise: Schauffele, the defending gold medalist and one of the top favorites, does not repeat as the champion this weekend. It's been a dominant season for American golf but all four members of Team USA will be at a strategic disadvantage this week. None of the four were on the 2018 Ryder Cup team that played at Le Golf National, while four members of Team Europe will be in the Olympic men's golf field and more than two dozen other players who have played the course competitively on the DP World Tour.\n\nSchauffele has won a pair of major championships this season and he's currently the No. 2 player in the Official World Golf Ranking following his win at the 2024 Open Championship. However, he'll have his work cut out against a field full of the world's top players that features a wealth of experience at Le Golf National.\n\nThe model has also examined where Scheffler finishes. The World No. 1 has built an impressive resume heading into his first Summer Olympics, winning the Masters twice to go along with six total victories this season. He has posted 14 top-10 finishes across 16 tournaments in 2024, picking up his latest win in the Memorial Tournament last month.\n\nScheffler leads the PGA Tour in total strokes gained, GIR percentage and scoring average, but his putting has been an issue at times this season. He ranks 90th in strokes gained from putting and is coming off a rough week on the greens at the Open Championship. Regardless, Scheffler is still widely considered the man to beat heading into his first appearance in the Olympics. The model just locked in its Scottie Scheffler Olympics picks here.\n\nHow to make 2024 Olympics Men's Golf picks\n\nThe model has revealed where every member of Team USA finishes and has identified four golfers with odds of 20-1 or longer to make a strong run at the title. Anyone who backs these longshots could hit it big. You can only see the model's picks here.\n\nWho will win the 2024 Olympic Men's Golf event, and which longshots will stun the golfing world? Check out the Olympic golf 2024 odds below and then visit SportsLine to see the projected Olympic golf leaderboard, all from the model that's nailed 13 golf majors, including the last three Masters,

Golf still trying to figure out where 5 rings fit among 4 majors", "body": "SAINT-QUENTIN-EN-YVELINES, France (AP) -- Perhaps one way to measure when golf has truly arrived as an Olympic sport is when players stopped getting asked how a gold medal would stack up against winning a major.\n\nNo one is entirely sure, including the one player at Le Golf National who would know.\n\n\"That's a great question for Xander Schauffele since he's the only man recently to have done both,\" said Jon Rahm, a two-time major champion from Spain playing in his first Olympics.\n\n\"It's a good question, but it's tricky,\" Schauffele said.\n\nHe won the gold medal in the Tokyo Games, at the time the pinnacle of his young career and extra meaningful because of his family. His father, Stefan, was invited to take part in Germany's decathlon training and was hit by a drunken driver on the way there, losing an eye.\n\nSchauffele now has two very important silver trophies to go with that gold medal -- the Wanamaker Trophy from winning the PGA Championship in May, the claret jug from his British Open title two weeks ago.\n\n\"Golf was in the Olympics, and then it was out of the Olympics,\" Schauffele said. \"So I think a lot of the kids were watching Tiger -- or if you're a little older, you were watching Jack or Arnie, the older legends of the game. You're watching them win majors.\n\n\"For me, it's very personal,\" he said. \"The relationship my dad and I have with golf, a lot of it surrounds his teachings of when he was trying to be an Olympian. Then the majors are what I grew up watching. They are two very different things to me.\"\n\nSchauffele also said, \"The gold medal, it's been marinating nicely.\"\n\nThe general consensus is to give it time. The men's competition starts Thursday on sunbaked Le Golf National, site of the French Open and more famously the 2018 Ryder Cup. It's the third Olympic golf competition since the sport was put back on the program in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nOne little known fact: Paris is the only host city to stage two Olympic golf competitions.\n\nThe first gold medal in golf went to Charles Sands in the 1900 Olympics, and odds are he didn't care all that much. Sands also competed in tennis, his primary sport, in those Paris Games without reaching the medal rounds. He beat 12 amateurs in golf, a sport he had taken up just five years earlier at St. Andrews Golf Club in New York.\n\nGolf was on the Olympic program for the St. Louis Games in 1904, and then it was gone until being resurrected in 2016.\n\nJustin Rose and Inbee Park won in Rio. Schauffele and Nelly Korda won in Tokyo. Gold medalists in gold have not lacked for star power, just meaning.\n\n\"I think as golf is in the Olympics for a longer period of time ... I don't know if anything will be able to sit alongside the majors. We have our four events a year that are the gold standard,\" Rory McIlroy said. \"But think this in time is going to be right up there amongst that.\"\n\nGolf is gaining traction, best measured by attendance. The top seven players in the world, starting with Scottie Scheffler and Schauffele at Nos. 1 and 2, are part of the 60-man field at Le Golf National.\n\nCollin Morikawa and Wyndham Clark, who have three majors between them over the last five years, were at the opening ceremony on Friday and have spent time at other events. It is not lost of them that so many Olympic athletes have worked four years for their biggest moment. Golf gets four big moments a year, plus the Olympics.\n\nFor Morikawa, seeing the other athletes compete this week gives him an even deeper appreciation. He was in the seven-man playoff for the bronze in Tokyo. There's that other small matter of being in the same group with Schauffele at seven tournaments since Tokyo.\n\n\"We hear Xander get announced on the tee as the reigning gold medalist. As a major champion, you hear it for a year. But this, you hear it for four. It's a pretty cool thing to have.\"\n\nScheffler and Schauffele are the leading two favorites -- one with a Masters green jacket to go along with six PGA Tour titles this year and the No. 1 ranking, the other a double major winner in 2024.\n\nMcIlroy has gone 10 years since winning his fourth major championship. He skirted around the issue by saying a gold medal would be his biggest feat in the last 10 years.\n\nBut it also depends on the country. Hideki Matsuyama was under enormous pressure in the Tokyo Games, held in 2021 without spectators because of the COVID-19 pandemic. He also was part of the seven-man playoff for the bronze. Matsuyama was the Masters champion that year.\n\nGreen jacket or gold medal?\n\n\"I think every single golf fan knows what the green jacket is,\" he said. \"But the gold medal, I think every single fan in Japan would know what the gold medal is in the Olympics. I think both are important, but I think the gold medal would have a big impact in Japan.\"\n\nThe home pressure -- and support -- this year falls to Matthieu Pavon of France. He wants to win a major, just like any golfer. But a week among other Olympians changed his mind.\n\n\"I always felt like major for golf is more important because we have not really grown up with the Olympics,\" he said. \"After a few days in the Olympic Village, the opening ceremony in Paris with all this crowd in front of the Eiffel Tower and all the great moments we spent the last few days, it really feels like a gold medal would be now ranked higher than a major for me.\"", "source": {"uri": "apnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AP NEWS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Golf_National",

However, there is a catch! The golfer was seen with his caddie Ted Scott, showcasing some exceptional tennis skills and pretending to be Team USA for tennis as well. So can the fans expect to see their favorite golfer ace another sport anytime soon? Well, maybe.\n\nIn a press conference with Men's Olympic Golf Competition, Scheffler was asked if he could be a multi-sport athlete in the Olympics. And to no one's surprise, the golfer said, \"I don't think so. But sometimes I have irrational self-confidence, and maybe if I really put my mind to it.\"\n\nFans know what his exceptional skills can do if the golfer really puts them to use. However, the 12-time PGA Tour winner isn't planning to trade his golf clubs for a tennis racket anytime soon, \"I don't think you'll be seeing me out playing tennis in the Olympics any time soon\".", "source": {"uri": "essentiallysports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EssentiallySports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ted Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024-06-11T205732Z_1109057164_MT1USATODAY23524593_RTRMADP_3_PGA-U-S-OPEN-PRACTICE-ROUND-496x315.jpg?class=watermark", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772658", "eventUri": "eng-9772658", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 110, "relevance": 1}

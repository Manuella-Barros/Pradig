I fully support Gibraltar FA making a complaint to UEFA about this behavior by some Spanish players in celebration of winning EURO2024.\n\n\"This cannot stand unchallenged. The Rock is ours.\"\n\nLeader of the Opposition Keith Azopardi publicly condemned the actions on social media via X.\n\n\"When two Madrid-born players urge the crowd to sing the political statement 'Gibraltar is Spanish,' this isn't football, celebration, or the signs of a New Spain,\" Mr Azopardi posted.\n\n\"As role models, it sends a clear message to young people that old Franco-style views that ignore our rights as a [Gibraltarian] people are OK. They aren't. That Rodri earns and Morata earned their habichuelas in England is beyond irony.\"\n\nJuan Jose Uceda, spokesman for cross-border workers' association Ascteg, called the incident \"shameful, outrageous, [and] out of control\".\n\nMr Uceda said the incident could \"endanger relations\" but said that this is \"nothing new\" and a \"bad side\" of Gibraltar and Spain's history.\n\nHe added that the actions made him feel \"worried and embarrassed\" for Rodri and the Spanish team.\n\nMr Uceda said Ascteg will continue doing their job and \"expect this to be forgotten\".\n\nThe GFA spokesperson added that this was not the first instance in which Spanish national team players have engaged in such chants, although previous occasions were away from official events and did not receive any sanctions from UEFA.\n\nDue to the chants taking place during an official celebration this incident has greater significance.\n\nUEFA regulates the actions of players, officials and members, who use insulting language and this could lead to a temporary suspension.

pair's actions and chants\n\nSpain's European Championship winning stars Rodri and Alvaro Morata are being investigated by UEFA following their actions in the team's trophy parade.\n\nThe two Spanish stars, who were key men in the country's triumph in Germany, are the centre of complaints from the Gibraltar FA over unacceptable chanting during the celebrations.\n\nDuring the jubilant scenes in Madrid, Rodri and allegedly Morata chanted 'It's Spanish, Gibraltar is Spanish' at the party, which has led to the complaints and subsequent investigation.\n\nIn statement, UEFA confirmed the two players are under investigation by stating;\n\n'A Uefa Ethics and Disciplinary Inspector is being appointed to evaluate a potential violation of the UEFA Disciplinary Regulations by the players Rodrigo Hern\u00e1ndez Cascante and \u00c1lvaro Morata in the context of conduct that occurred during the public presentation of the Uefa Euro 2024 trophy in Madrid on 15 July 2024.\n\nRodri and teammate Alvaro Morata are set to investigated by UEFA after chants at the parade\n\nThew two Spanish stars played key roles throughout the tournament in Germany\n\nMorata captained the team to their Euros victory, while Rodri was one of the stars of the finals\n\n'Further information regarding this matter will be made available in due course.'\n\nBoth Rodri and Morata played pivotal roles in Spain's Euro 2024 win, with the Manchester City man being named Player of the Tournament.\n\nWhile striker, who has just signed for AC Milan, captained the side to victory and scored one goal across the seven games in the tournament.\n\nHowever, following the chanting aimed at Gibraltar during Monday's celebrations, the FA of Gibraltar released a note condemning their behaviour.\n\n'The Gibraltar FA has noted the extremely provocative and insulting nature of the celebrations around the Spanish Men's national team winning Euro 2024.\n\nThe Association is this morning taking advice on the filing of a complaint to European Football's governing body, UEFA, in relation to the unacceptable chanting and songs, relating to Gibraltar, sung by Spain's Men's National Team players after winning Euro 2024.\n\nFootball has no place for behaviour of this nature.'\n\nGibraltar is situated at the Southern tip of Spain, but for the past 300 years has been an British overseas territory.\n\nSpain has long contested British sovereignty over Gibraltar, claiming that it should be part of Spain, but the UK has long maintained control over the are.\n\nRodri was named Player of the Tournament following his displays in the seven games\n\nThe disputes have led to tensions and incidents between Spanish and British vessels along both the sea and land boarder, with Britain's exit from the EU adding more complexity to the situation.\n\nThese disputes have meant that Gibraltar's national football team wasn't accepted by UEFA until 2013, and by FIFA until 2018.\n\nMorata's alleged chanting wasn't the only trouble that the skipper looked to have gotten himself into during the parade.\n\nHe was also caught on camera throwing a cup at a fan holding up a sign, during the bus ride through the city.",

Spain held their victory parade in the country's capital Madrid on Monday, at the city's Cibeles fountain.\n\nIn footage that was widely shared on social media, captain Morata started the chant: \"It's Spanish, Gibraltar is Spanish\", in reference to the peninsula at the southern tip of Spain, which is British territory.\n\nManchester City midfielder Rodri then took the microphone and joined in with the chant. Morata can be heard telling Rodri: \"Man, you play in England\". Gibraltar became a British territory in 1713 and has frequently rejected falling under Spanish sovereignty.\n\nThe Gibraltan FA issued an official complaint to UEFA earlier this week in response to the footage. UEFA have now acted by appointing an inspector to look into a potential violation of disciplinary regulations.\n\nA statement from the governing body read: \"A UEFA Ethics and Disciplinary Inspector is being appointed to evaluate a potential violation of the UEFA Disciplinary Regulations by the players Rodrigo Hern\u00e1ndez Cascante and \u00c1lvaro Morata in the context of conduct that occurred during the public presentation of the UEFA EURO 2024 trophy in Madrid on 15 July 2024. Further information regarding this matter will be made available in due course.\"\n\nWhen announcing their intention to submit a complaint, the Gibraltan FA branded the chants \"extremely provocative and insulting\". They have now welcomed the news that UEFA is looking into the incident.\n\nHAVE YOUR SAY! Who was your player of Euro 2024? Comment below.\n\n\"The Gibraltar FA welcomes the statement published by UEFA in relation to our letter dated 18th July 2024, confirming the appointment of an Ethics and Disciplinary Inspector to investigate the matter,\" a statement read.\n\n\"In this regard, the Gibraltar FA confirms that it submitted further evidence to UEFA yesterday in relation to the appalling and unacceptable behaviour of Shelbourne FC supporters at Europa Point Stadium and around Gibraltar.\"\n\nIt is unknown what manner of punishment Morata, Rodri and the Spanish FA would face if they are found guilty of breaching UEFA's regulations. The Spanish government still claims soverignty of the peninsula.\n\n\"Spain has repeatedly asked the United Kingdom to enter into negotiations. The continued de facto occupation by the British does not meet the requirements of international law for the acquisition of sovereignty,\" the Spanish foreign ministry says on its website.\n\n\"That is why Spain has always stressed that the occupation of the isthmus is illegal and contrary to international law and, therefore, has always demanded its unconditional return. Spain does not recognise the occupation of the isthmus or the fence as a border.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

that has been under British rule since the 18th century.\n\nRodri was seen chanting 'Gibraltar is Spanish' along with teenage sensational Lamine Yamal while Alvaro Morata later sang the same chant.\n\nAccording to a fresh report from Marca, Rodri and Morata face a UEFA ban following their chants about Gibraltar.\n\nThe EFA Ethics and Disciplinary Inspector has been appointed to review a potential breach of the UEFA Disciplinary Regulations by Rodri and Morata.\n\nA potential two-match ban is looming over the Spanish pair if UEFA decides to sanction them for their actions during their Euro 2024 celebrations.\n\nA potential punishment comes after Gibraltar officials hit out at Spain's chanting.\n\nA statement from the territory's government claimed 'several' Spanish players had chanted 'rancid remarks about Gibraltar'.\n\nIt added: \"This is a totally unnecessary mixing of sporting success with discriminatory political statements that are hugely offensive to Gibraltarians.\"\n\nGibraltar's chief minister Fabian Picardo also slammed Spain as he took to social media to make his feelings clear on the chanting.\n\n\"The Rock is OURS,\" he wrote.\n\n\"Mixing a sporting victory and the chant that glorifies the dictatorial politics of a mass murderer like Franco and his fascist regime's attempt to usurp a neighbouring territory, that is also a UEFA nation, is worse than disgusting.\n\n\"This cannot stand unchallenged.\"\n\nRodri and Morata were key players in Spain's Euros-winning campaign.\n\nThe Manchester City midfielder was named Player of the Tournament while the forward was the national team's captain.", "source": {"uri": "sportbible.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.sportbible.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Worry not, here's all the information you need to know:\n\nSocial media platforms are currently buzzing with a viral video featuring Spain players celebrating after their 2-1 victory against England in Euro 2024 finals.\n\nHowever, the highlight of the video which has grabbed everyone's attention is the chants that can be heard in the viral video. Still confused? Let me simplify it for you!\n\nDuring a victory celebration in Madrid, players from the Spain football team led crowds in chants of \"Gibraltar is Spanish\" and midfielder Rodri, who is now being harshly criticized was among those chanting.\n\nRodri who was named Player of the Tournament in Euro 2024 for his impressive performance is now receiving backlash and criticism from fans and experts both after he was seen chanting \"Gibraltar is Spanish\" alongside right-winger Lamine Yamal on stage.\n\nThe viral video also features team's captain, Alvaro Morata, who later led the crowds with the same chant. The incident took place when tens of thousands of Spanish fans gathered in Central Madrid on Monday.\n\nThe crowd who gathered to celebrate team's 2-1 triumph over England can be seen waving flags in the viral video. Fans who dressed in Spain's red and yellow, cheered as the players toured the city in an open-top bus.\n\nThe parade concluded in Cibeles square, where the European Championship trophy was presented.\n\nFor the curious, Gibraltar is a British enclave at Spain's southern tip, under British rule since the 18th Century. Though, Spain has long sought its return.\n\nGibraltar, a British Overseas Territory with a population of just over 34,000, was ceded to Britain by Spain in the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht and has been an important naval base.\n\nGibraltar has been a full UEFA member since 2013 and even competed in Euro 2024, finishing last in qualifying Group B with 0 points.\n\nAfter the chant video went viral, Gibraltar's Football Association lodged an official complaint with UEFA, calling the celebrations \"extremely provocative and insulting.\"\n\nAfter learning about the viral video, the Gibraltar FA condemned the team's behavior and states that they had \"noted the extremely provocative and insulting nature of the celebrations around the Spanish Men's national team winning Euro 2024,\" adding that \"football has no place for behavior of this nature.\"", "source": {"uri": "thesportsgrail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsGrail"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reena_choudhary@thesportsgrail.com", "name": "Reena Choudhary", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibraltar", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gibraltar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Gibraltar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodri_(footballer,_born_1996)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rodri (footballer, born 1996)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Argentina national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamine_Yamal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lamine Yamal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c1lvaro_Morata", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "\u00c1lvaro Morata"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_of_Utrecht", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peace of Utrecht"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibraltar_Football_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gibraltar Football Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Overseas_Territories", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British Overseas Territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Raj", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British Raj"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://thesportsgrail.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Spain.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9743381", "eventUri": "eng-9743381", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

'swift, effective' action following Spanish players' 'highly inflammatory' chants", "body": "The Gibraltar flag hangs next to UEFA flags during a futsal international competition in Gibraltar in 2021.\n\nThe Gibraltar FA has called on UEFA to take \"swift and effective action\" to address the \"deeply offensive\" and \"highly inflammatory\" conduct of two Spanish national team players who led chants of \"Gibraltar es espa\u00f1ol\" during celebrations in Madrid following Spain's Euro 2024 win against England.\n\nIn a letter to UEFA on Thursday, GFA president Michael Llamas and General Secretary Ivan Robba said the chants led by Rodri and team captain Alvaro Morata were met with \"anger, dismay and disappointment\" in Gibraltar and brought European football \"into disrepute\".\n\nThe two GFA officials said \"...the conduct in question is deeply offensive to Gibraltarians, who have repeatedly exercised their democratic rights to remain a British Overseas Territory.\"\n\n\"While Gibraltar has a border with Spain, and values its close cooperative relationship with Spain and the Spanish people, it is and remains a British Overseas Territory.\"\n\n\"The conduct is also deeply offensive to the Gibraltar FA since it implies we should not exist as an independent national member association of UEFA.\"\n\n\"In such circumstances, the conduct of the players was not only offensive, but also highly inflammatory.\"\n\n\"During a period of what should have been celebrations, the players have - unnecessarily and entirely gratuitously - brought politics into sport, seemingly for no reason other than to cause offence to the people of Gibraltar.\"\n\nIn the letter, Mr Llamas and Mr Robba said the events in Madrid on Monday had been widely circulated across the globe and had led to repercussions on the ground.\n\nThe said the GFA had received emails and phone calls \"of a harassing nature\" repeating the chant.\n\n\"The incitement has also been felt by Gibraltarians enjoying a summer fair across the border in the Spanish town of La Linea where they have been harassed, intimidated and aggressed to a chorus of the same chants some having to flee back to the safety of the border controls,\" the letter added.\n\nThe GFA said the conduct of the Spanish players was \"unlawful\" and in breach of UEFA's disciplinary regulations, which apply during every match and competition organised by UEFA, but also to the conduct of members of a national team during official celebrations following a victory in a UEFA competition.\n\n\"In each case, the player's conduct is not only not in the spirit of sportsmanship, indecent and insulting, but is actively discriminatory on political grounds and/or the grounds of national or ethnic origins,\" the letter said.\n\n\"The conduct appears to us to be a clear breach of Article 11, where both players have used a sporting event for non-sporting (highly political) purposes, as well as the clear prohibition on discrimination contained in Article 12.\"\n\n\"It, quite obviously, brings the game of football into disrepute.\"\n\nThe letter noted that UEFA statutes include the promotion of football in Europe \"in a spirit of peace, understanding and fair play, without any discrimination on account of politics, gender, religion, race or any other reason\".\n\n\"In such circumstances, we respectfully ask UEFA to take action in this matter and the Gibraltar FA invites UEFA to bring a formal complaint against both players,\" Mr Llamas and Mr Robba added.\n\n\"The Gibraltar FA is extremely disappointed by the conduct in question.\"\n\n\"As its statement of 16 July 2024 records, the chants used were not only unprovoked, but also extremely provocative and insulting in their nature.\"\n\n\"There is clearly no place in football for behaviour of this nature.\"\n\n\"We trust that UEFA will take swift and effective action commensurate with the seriousness of the conduct in question.\"", "source": {"uri": "chronicle.gi", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gibraltar Chronicle"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score":

Gibraltar chant", "body": "UEFA has confirmed it will appoint an inspector to \"evaluate a potential violation\" of its disciplinary regulations by two Spanish national players who led chants of \"Gibraltar es espa\u00f1ol\" during celebrations in Madrid following Spain's Euro 2024 win against England.\n\nThe decision comes after the Gibraltar FA called on UEFA to take \"swift and effective action\" against what it described as \"deeply offensive\" and \"highly inflammatory\" conduct by the Spanish players.\n\nIn a letter to UEFA on Thursday, GFA president Michael Llamas and General Secretary Ivan Robba said the chants led by Rodri and team captain Alvaro Morata had caused \"anger, dismay and disappointment\" in Gibraltar and brought European football \"into disrepute\".\n\nOn Friday, a spokesperson for UEFA told the Chronicle in an emailed response to questions that it would look into the complaint and decide what action if any to take.\n\n\"An UEFA Ethics and Disciplinary Inspector is being appointed to evaluate a potential violation of the UEFA Disciplinary Regulations by the players Mr Rodrigo Hern\u00e1ndez Cascante and Mr \u00c1lvaro Morata in the context of conduct that occurred during the public presentation of the 2024 UEFA European Championship trophy in Madrid on 15 July 2024,\" the UEFA spokesperson said.\n\n\"Further information regarding this matter will be made available in due course.\"\n\nIn the letter, Mr Llamas and Mr Robba said the events in Madrid on Monday had been widely circulated across the globe and had led to repercussions on the ground, including emails and phone calls to the GFA \"of a harassing nature\".\n\nOn Thursday night, visiting fans from Ireland supporting Shelbourne in their UEFA Conference League match against St Joseph's chanted \"Gibraltar espa\u00f1ol\" during the match.\n\nThere were also reports on Thursday of at least one violent incident at the La Linea fair in which two young people from Gibraltar were assaulted by a group shouting \"Gibraltar espa\u00f1ol\".\n\nIn its letter to UEFA, the GFA said the conduct of the Spanish players was \"unlawful\" and in breach of UEFA's disciplinary regulations, which apply during every match and competition organised by UEFA, but also to the conduct of members of a national team during official celebrations following a victory in a UEFA competition.\n\n\"In each case, the player's conduct is not only not in the spirit of sportsmanship, indecent and insulting, but is actively discriminatory on political grounds and/or the grounds of national or ethnic origins,\" the letter said.\n\nThe GFA said the players' conduct was \"unprovoked but also extremely provocative and insulting\", and \"quite obviously brings the game of football into disrepute.\"\n\n\"There is clearly no place in football for behaviour of this nature,\" Mr Llamas and Mr Robba said in the letter to UEFA.\n\n\"We trust that UEFA will take swift and effective action commensurate with the seriousness of the conduct in question.\"\n\nOn Friday, the GFA weclomed the statement from UEFA confirming the appointment of an Ethics and Disciplinary Inspector to investigate the matter.\n\n\"In this regard, the Gibraltar FA confirms that it submitted further evidence to UEFA yesterday in relation to the appalling and unacceptable behaviour of Shelbourne FC supporters at Europa Point Stadium and around Gibraltar,\" a GFA spokesperson said.", "source": {"uri": "chronicle.gi", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gibraltar Chronicle"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Rodri made a political reference whilst encouraging supporters to sing a chant about the British colony. The ban could be similar to Merih Demiral's after he was punished for a similar offence during Euro 2024.\n\nSpain stars Rodri and Alvaro Morata could be set to face a two-match ban from UEFA following comments they made about Gibraltar during their Euro 2024 trophy parade. The Spaniards celebrated their record fourth European Championship win after defeating England 2-1 thanks to goals from Nico Williams and Mikel Oyarzabal.\n\nDuring the party in the Spanish capital, the Manchester City star and Player of the Tournament took hold of the microphone to lead fans in a chant regarding Gibraltar's status as an English colony, with captain Morata also joining in. Now, following a complaint by the Gibraltar FA to Europe's governing body, it appears as though the two players at the centre of the controversy could be hit with a suspension.\n\nRodri and Morata Set For Ban UEFA are conducting an investigation into the incident\n\nAccording to a report from Marca, it is believed that the pair could be given a two-match ban from UEFA following the conclusion of their investigation. This is based on that being the exact sanction given to Turkey's Merih Demiral after using a political gesture to celebrate his second goal in his side's 2-1 win over Austria in their Euro 2024 round of 16 tie. The former Juventus defender broke multiple UEFA laws with his celebration, including violating the basic rules of decent conduct, using sports events for manifestations of a non-sporting nature and bringing the sport of football into disrepute.\n\nRelated Why UEFA Banned Merih Demiral at Euro 2024 But Not Jude Bellingham\n\nBellingham was handed a fine and a suspended ban, but Demiral could miss the rest of Euro 2024.\n\n1\n\nRodri and Morata's comments followed a similar sentiment, with the former chanting 'Gibraltar is Spanish,' poking fun at both the colony and the team he had just defeated in the Euro 2024 final, England, as 'the rock' is a British-owned territory. When his teammate reminded him that he played his club football in England, Rodri replied saying that he didn't care.\n\nThe Gibraltar FA condemned the comments, stating they have no place in football and confirming their intentions to lodge a complaint to UEFA.\n\nUEFA Release Statement On Rodri's Chant A decision is yet to be made\n\nAs the players anxiously await their fate, UEFA have confirmed that they are looking into the matter. They released a statement, saying:\n\n\"A Uefa Ethics and Disciplinary Inspector is being appointed to evaluate a potential violation of the Uefa Disciplinary Regulations by the players Rodrigo Hernandez Cascante and Alvaro Morata in the context of conduct that occurred during the public presentation of the Uefa Euro 2024 trophy in Madrid on 15 July 2024.

Championship trophy in Madrid on 15 July 2024,\" the UEFA spokesperson said.\n\n\"Further information regarding this matter will be made available in due course.\"\n\nIn its letter to UEFA, the GFA said the conduct of the Spanish players was \"unlawful\" and in breach of UEFA's disciplinary regulations, which apply during every match and competition organised by UEFA, but also to the conduct of members of a national team during official celebrations following a victory in a UEFA competition.\n\n\"In each case, the player's conduct is not only not in the spirit of sportsmanship, indecent and insulting, but is actively discriminatory on political grounds and/or the grounds of national or ethnic origins,\" the letter said.\n\nThe GFA said the players' conduct was \"unprovoked but also extremely provocative and insulting\", and \"quite obviously brings the game of football into disrepute.\"\n\n\"There is clearly no place in football for behaviour of this nature,\" Mr Llamas and Mr Robba said in the letter to UEFA.\n\n\"We trust that UEFA will take swift and effective action commensurate with the seriousness of the conduct in question.\"\n\nOn Friday, the GFA weclomed the statement from UEFA confirming the appointment of an Ethics and Disciplinary Inspector to investigate the matter.\n\n\"In this regard, the Gibraltar FA confirms that it submitted further evidence to UEFA yesterday in relation to the appalling and unacceptable behaviour of Shelbourne FC\n\nsupporters at Europa Point Stadium and around Gibraltar,\" a GFA spokesperson said.", "source": {"uri":

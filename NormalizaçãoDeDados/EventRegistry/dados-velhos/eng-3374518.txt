Grigor Dimitrov outlasted John Isner 7-6 (4), 7-6 (10) in the first men's semifinal. Nick Kyrgios beat David Ferrer 7-6 (3), 7-6 (4).\n\nHalep, seeking her first No. 1 ranking, has yet to drop a set in the tournament and appears to be peaking at just the right time.\n\n\"I think I played my best match on hardcourt so far,\" said Halep, who can become the first Romanian woman to be ranked No. 1. \"It felt great. I moved very well today. From the first point, I felt like I was going to play good tennis.\"\n\nThe final Sunday will be the first on American soil for Muguruza, who lost to Pliskova in last year's W&S semifinals after losing to Serena Williams in the 2015 finals. The Spaniard had lost six straight matches against Pliskova since winning their first in 2013.\n\n\"I was very precise with my shots,\" said Muguruza, who is 2-1 in her career against Halep, though the two haven't played since 2015. \"I wanted to be more aggressive and take my shots. I felt pretty good out there -- under control. Everything went my way.\"\n\nMuguruza won when Pliskova sailed a forehand long on the fifth match point. Pliskova, who played part of one match and all of another Friday after rain forced postponements Thursday, had 28 unforced errors to Muguruza's 13.\n\nMuguruza was coming off playing the tournament's longest match, a 2-hour, 45-minute three-set win over Svetlana Kuznetsova on Friday. That followed a 2-hour, 18-minute win over Madison Keys on Thursday, when she fought off three match points.\n\n\"I don't think I played my best tennis today,\" Pliskova said. \"I think the energy was pretty low from my side. Obviously, a tough schedule for me the last two days - three matches in about not even 24 hours.\n\n\"I think she played very solid, not missing much and obviously serving well. Everything started, I think, in the first game of the first set.\"\n\nMuguruza took charge early, breaking Pliskova in the first and last games of the first set.\n\nShe gained a second-set edge with a backhand winner on break point for a 4-2 lead before closing it out in 1 hour, 19 minutes.\n\nStephens, playing her fourth tournament since returning from January foot surgery, also was playing a third match in a span of 24 hours.\n\n\"That's never easy,\" she said. \"I'm going to go with that. I didn't play that badly. She was a little fresher. It was just not a great day.\"\n\nThe 11th-ranked Dimitrov, who lost in the last year's semifinal to eventual champion Marin Cilic, had just one double fault and finished with nine unforced errors to No. 19 Isner's 28 in the 2-hour, 3-minute match.\n\n\"Today was, I think, one of those matches that I really had to just be patient,\" Dimitrov said. \"I think that that was the key. I knew I'm not going to have that many rallies against John. I knew that he's going to serve big, bold serves. I just had to be very composed and use every opportunity that I had.\n\n\"It was just a few points that made the biggest difference for me. I'm just happy with the way I kept myself together throughout the whole match. Just remained calm in those tough moments. I mean, I know it's nerve-wracking from outside, but it's even tougher when you're in there and have to receive a serve that comes 141 mph.\"\n\nDimitrov's composure was the key, according to Isner.\n\n\"The difference was he was a lot more decisive at the big moments,\" Isner said. \"He was a little calmer as well -- a little more free-flowing in big moments. I thought he played a high-level match. He certainly is in good form. I played well enough to beat a lot of players today -- just not him.\"\n\nThe 23rd-ranked Kyrgios will be playing in his first ATP Masters 1000 final -- the highest-level final of his career.\n\n\"Obviously, I'm excited, but it's just another tennis match to me,\" the Australian said. \"I'll just go out and serve and whatever happens, happens. It'll be a tough match.\"\n\nKyrgios and Ferrer displayed remarkably efficient serving in their nightcap. They combined for six break points, converting none.\n\n\"He served really good,\" the 31st-ranked Ferrer said. \"I didn't have chance in the second tiebreak. In important moments with the second serve, he played aggressive.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T03:39:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.8470588326454163, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3374518", "time": "03:39:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3374518", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "302857", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "score": 4}, {"id": "310200", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Marin \u010cili\u0107"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marin_\u010cili\u0107", "score": 2}, {"id": "310203", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbi\u00f1e_Muguruza", "score": 5}, {"id": "310208", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "score": 3}, {"id": "310885", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Svetlana Kuznetsova"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svetlana_Kuznetsova", "score": 3}, {"id": "316782", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "John Isner"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Isner", "score": 5}, {"id": "316786", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Simona Halep"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simona_Halep", "score": 4}, {"id": "321518", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "David Ferrer"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ferrer", "score": 3}, {"id": "323035", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Glossary of tennis terms"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_tennis_terms", "score": 3}, {"id": "329704", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Hardcourt"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardcourt", "score": 3}, {"id": "333641", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Sloane Stephens"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sloane_Stephens", "score": 4}, {"id": "337716", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "ATP World Tour Masters 1000"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_World_Tour_Masters_1000", "score": 1}, {"id": "337721", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Madison Keys"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Keys", "score": 3}, {"id": "347055", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked players"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_players", "score": 5}, {"id": "350450", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Nick Kyrgios"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Kyrgios", "score": 4}, {"id": "357070", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Karol\u00edna Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karol\u00edna_Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1", "score": 4}, {"id": "374056", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Backhand"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backhand", "score": 2}, {"id": "405086", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Grigor Dimitrov"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigor_Dimitrov", "score": 3}, {"id": "420299", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "score": 3}], "image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4254638.1503198405!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/simona-halep.jpg", "timeCrawl": "03:39:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Simona Halep moves a victory away from world No.1 ranking", "originalArticle": null}

Very happy with this win.\"\n\nMuguruza advanced to Sunday's final against the winner of a later match between Romania's second-ranked Simona Halep and 151st-ranked US wildcard Sloane Stephens.\n\nHalep would overtake Pliskova and claim the world number one ranking for the first time in her career by winning the Cincinnati crown.\n\nPliskova had won six matches in a row over Muguruza since losing their first meeting in the first round of the 2013 French Open.\n\n\"I lost to her so many times, I figured out something was going wrong,\" Muguruza said.\n\n\"I worked hard on beating these kinds of opponents. I returned well. My shots were there. It was a gorgeous day.\"\n\nLast month, Muguruza won her second Grand Slam after the 2016 French Open and her fourth career title on the All-England grass.\n\nPliskova, last year's US Open runner-up, sought her fourth title of the year after Brisbane, Doha and Eastbourne. Serena Williams from 2014 and 2015 remains the only back-to-back Cincinnati women's winner.\n\nMuguruza, her left thigh bandaged, blasted a backhand winner on her fourth break point to take the opening game of the match and broke again on another backhand winner to take the first set after 36 minutes.\n\nPliskova was denied on three break points in the second set's opening game, the only ones she faced in the match, and Muguruza broke to 4-2 with another backhand winner.\n\nIn the final game, Pliskova saved four match before sending a forehand wide to surrender the break and the match after 79 minutes.\n\nWhile she can't do it this week, Muguruza would be in the hunt for the top ranking at the US Open, which starts on August 28.\n\n\"I'm definitely not thinking at all about number one,\" Muguruza said.\n\n\"It's not going to help me. It's going to hold me back. I'm thinking about how I'm playing and if I keep doing that maybe that's going to get me to number one.\"\n\nHalep, who won her 15th career title at Madrid in May, has not dropped a set this week.\n\nStephens is playing in only her fourth event since returning from a foot injury that required surgery in January. Her run ensures she will return to the Top 100 in Monday's world rankings.\n\nIn later men's semi-finals, Australia's Nick Kyrgios will face Spaniard David Ferrer and American John Isner will meet Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov.\n\nFerrer, 35, is the oldest Cincinnati semi-finalist since 1970 champion Ken Rosewall. He won his lone Masters crown in 2012 at Paris.\n\nNeither Kyrgios nor Dimitrov have ever reached an ATP Masters final while Isner is 0-3 in such matches.\n\nResults on Saturday from the WTA and ATP

Grigor Dimitrov outlasted John Isner 7-6 (4), 7-6 (10) in the first men's semifinal. Nick Kyrgios beat David Ferrer 7-6 (3), 7-6 (4).\n\nHalep, seeking her first No. 1 ranking, has yet to drop a set in the tournament and appears to be peaking at just the right time.\n\n\"I think I played my best match on hardcourt so far,\" said Halep, who can become the first Romanian woman to be ranked No. 1. \"It felt great. I moved very well today. From the first point, I felt like I was going to play good tennis.\"\n\nThe final Sunday will be the first on American soil for Muguruza, who lost to Pliskova in last year's W&S semifinals after losing to Serena Williams in the 2015 finals. The Spaniard had lost six straight matches against Pliskova since winning their first in 2013.\n\n\"I was very precise with my shots,\" said Muguruza, who is 2-1 in her career against Halep, though the two haven't played since 2015. \"I wanted to be more aggressive and take my shots. I felt pretty good out there - under control. Everything went my way.\"\n\nMuguruza won when Pliskova sailed a forehand long on the fifth match point. Pliskova, who played part of one match and all of another Friday after rain forced postponements Thursday, had 28 unforced errors to Muguruza's 13.\n\nMuguruza was coming off playing the tournament's longest match, a 2-hour, 45-minute three-set win over Svetlana Kuznetsova on Friday. That followed a 2-hour, 18-minute win over Madison Keys on Thursday, when she fought off three match points.\n\n\"I don't think I played my best tennis today,\" Pliskova said. \"I think the energy was pretty low from my side. Obviously, a tough schedule for me the last two days - three matches in about not even 24 hours.\n\n\"I think she played very solid, not missing much and obviously serving well. Everything started, I think, in the first game of the first set.\"\n\nMuguruza took charge early, breaking Pliskova in the first and last games of the first set.\n\nShe gained a second-set edge with a backhand winner on break point for a 4-2 lead before closing it out in 1 hour, 19 minutes.\n\nStephens, playing her fourth tournament since returning from January foot surgery, also was playing a third match in a span of 24 hours.\n\n\"That's never easy,\" she said. \"I'm going to go with that. I didn't play that badly. She was a little fresher. It was just not a great day.\"\n\nThe 11th-ranked Dimitrov, who lost in the last year's semifinal to eventual champion Marin Cilic, had just one double fault and finished with nine unforced errors to No. 19 Isner's 28 in the 2-hour, 3-minute match. The Bulgarian will play the winner of the semifinal between Nick Kyrgios, who knocked out second-ranked Rafael Nadal in straight sets in a Friday quarterfinal, and David Ferrer.\n\n\"Today was, I think, one of those matches that I really had to just be patient,\" Dimitrov said. \"I think that that was the key. I knew I'm not going to have that many rallies against John. I knew that he's going to serve big, bold serves. I just had to be very composed and use every opportunity that I had. I think in the end of the match, it was just a few points that made the biggest difference for me. I'm just happy obviously with the win, but I'm just happy with the way I kept myself together throughout the whole match. Just remained calm in those tough moments. I mean, I know it's nerve-wracking from outside, but it's even tougher when you're in there and have to receive a serve that comes 141 mph.\"\n\nDimitrov's composure was the key, according to Isner.\n\n\"The difference was he was a lot more decisive at the big moments,\" Isner said. \"He was a little calmer as well -- a little more free-flowing in big moments. I thought he played a high-level match. He certainly is in good form. I played well enough to beat a lot of players today -- just not him.\"\n\nKyrgios and Ferrer displayed remarkably efficient serving in their nightcap. They combined for six break points, converting none.", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T01:58:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.843137264251709, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3374518", "time": "01:58:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3374518", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "302857", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "score": 4}, {"id": "304425", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "score": 2}, {"id": "310200", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Marin \u010cili\u0107"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marin_\u010cili\u0107", "score": 2}, {"id": "310203", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbi\u00f1e_Muguruza", "score": 5}, {"id": "310208", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "score": 3}, {"id": "310885", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Svetlana Kuznetsova"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svetlana_Kuznetsova", "score": 3}, {"id": "316782", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "John Isner"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Isner", "score": 5}, {"id": "316786", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Simona Halep"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simona_Halep", "score": 4}, {"id": "321518", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "David Ferrer"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ferrer", "score": 3}, {"id": "323035", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Glossary of tennis terms"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_tennis_terms", "score": 3}, {"id": "329704", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Hardcourt"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardcourt", "score": 3}, {"id": "333641", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Sloane Stephens"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sloane_Stephens", "score": 4}, {"id": "337721", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Madison Keys"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Keys", "score": 3}, {"id": "347055", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked players"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_players", "score": 5}, {"id": "350450", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Nick Kyrgios"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Kyrgios", "score": 5}, {"id": "357070", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Karol\u00edna Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karol\u00edna_Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1", "score": 4}, {"id": "374056", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Backhand"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backhand", "score": 2}, {"id": "405086", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Grigor Dimitrov"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigor_Dimitrov", "score": 3}, {"id": "420299", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "score": 3}, {"id": "522769", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Georgi Dimitrov"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgi_Dimitrov", "score": 1}], "image": "http://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/2l4j9t/picture167866397/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/Cincinnati_Tennis_41777.jpg", "timeCrawl": "01:58:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Halep in line for No. 1 after Cincinnati semifinal win", "originalArticle": null}

Serena Williams from 2014 and 2015 remains the only back-to-back Cincinnati women's winner.\n\nMuguruza, her left thigh bandaged, blasted a backhand winner on her fourth break point to take the opening game of the match and broke again on another backhand winner to take the first set after 36 minutes.\n\nPliskova was denied on three break points in the second set's opening game, the only ones she faced in the match, and Muguruza broke to 4-2 with another backhand winner.\n\nIn the final game, Pliskova saved four match before sending a forehand wide to surrender the break and the match after 79 minutes.\n\nWhile she can't do it this week, Muguruza would be in the hunt for the top ranking at the US Open, which starts on August 28.\n\n\"I'm definitely not thinking at all about number one,\" Muguruza said. \"It's not going to help me. It's going to hold me back.

Her run ensures she will return to the top-100 in Monday's world rankings.\n\nIn later men's semi-finals, Australia's Nick Kyrgios will face Spaniard David Ferrer and American John Isner will meet Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov.\n\nFerrer, 35, is the oldest Cincinnati semi-finalist since 1970 champion Ken Rosewall.

I moved very well today. From the first point, I felt like I was going to play good tennis.\"\n\nThe final Sunday will be the first on American soil for Muguruza, who lost to Pliskova in last year's W&S semifinals. The Spaniard had lost six straight matches against Pliskova since winning their first in 2013.\n\n\"I was very precise with my shots,\" said Muguruza, who is 2-1 in her career against Halep, though the two haven't played since 2015. \"I wanted to be more aggressive and take my shots. I felt pretty good out there - under control. Everything went my way.\"\n\nMuguruza won when Pliskova sailed a forehand long on the fifth match point. Pliskova, who played part of one match and all of another Friday after rain forced postponements Thursday, had 28 unforced errors to Muguruza's 13.\n\nMuguruza was coming off playing the tournament's longest match, a 2-hour, 45-minute three-set win over Svetlana Kuznetsova on Friday. That followed a 2-hour, 18-minute win over Madison Keys on Thursday, when she fought off three match points.\n\n\"I don't think I played my best tennis today,\" Pliskova said. \"I think the energy was pretty low from my side. Obviously, a tough schedule for me the last two days -- three matches in about not even 24 hours.\n\n\"I think she played very solid, not missing much and obviously serving well. Everything started, I think, in the first game of the first set.\"\n\nMuguruza took charge early, breaking Pliskova in the first and last games of the first set.\n\nShe gained a second-set edge with a backhand winner on break point for a 4-2 lead before closing it out in 1 hour, 19 minutes.\n\nStephens, playing her fourth tournament since returning from January foot surgery, also was playing a third match in a span of 24 hours.\n\n\"That's never easy,\" she said. \"I'm going to go with that. I didn't play that badly. She was a little fresher. It was just not a great day.\"\n\nThe 11th-ranked Dimitrov, who lost in the last year's semifinal to eventual champion Marin Cilic, had just one double fault and finished with nine unforced errors to No. 19 Isner's 28 in the 2-hour, 3-minute match. The Bulgarian will play the winner of the semifinal between Nick Kyrgios, who knocked out second-ranked Rafael Nadal in straight sets in a Friday quarterfinal, and David Ferrer.\n\n\"Today was, I think, one of those matches that I really had to just be patient,\" Dimitrov said. \"I think that that was the key. I knew I'm not going to have that many rallies against John. I knew that he's going to serve big, bold serves. I just had to be very composed and use every opportunity that I had. I think in the end of the match, it was just a few points that made the biggest difference for me. I'm just happy obviously with the win, but I'm just happy with the way I kept myself together throughout the whole match. Just remained calm in those tough moments. I mean, I know it's nerve-wracking from outside, but it's even tougher when you're in there and have to receive a serve that comes 141 mph.\"\n\nDimitrov's composure was the key, according to Isner.\n\n\"The difference was he was a lot more decisive at the big moments,\" Isner said. \"He was a little calmer as well -- a little more free-flowing in big moments. I thought he played a high-level match. He certainly is in good form. I played well enough to beat a lot of players today -- just not him.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T23:59:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.8352941274642944, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3374518", "time": "23:59:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3374518", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mason"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "concepts": [{"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "194356", "label": {"eng": "Mason"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mason,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mason"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "302857", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "score": 4}, {"id": "304425", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "score": 2}, {"id": "310200", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Marin \u010cili\u0107"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marin_\u010cili\u0107", "score": 2}, {"id": "310203", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbi\u00f1e_Muguruza", "score": 5}, {"id": "310885", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Svetlana Kuznetsova"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svetlana_Kuznetsova", "score": 3}, {"id": "316782", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "John Isner"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Isner", "score": 5}, {"id": "316786", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Simona Halep"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simona_Halep", "score": 5}, {"id": "321518", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "David Ferrer"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ferrer", "score": 2}, {"id": "323035", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Glossary of tennis terms"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_tennis_terms", "score": 3}, {"id": "329704", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Hardcourt"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardcourt", "score": 3}, {"id": "333641", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Sloane Stephens"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sloane_Stephens", "score": 4}, {"id": "337721", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Madison Keys"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Keys", "score": 3}, {"id": "347055", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked players"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_players", "score": 5}, {"id": "350450", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Nick Kyrgios"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Kyrgios", "score": 2}, {"id": "357070", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Karol\u00edna Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karol\u00edna_Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1", "score": 4}, {"id": "374056", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Backhand"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backhand", "score": 2}, {"id": "405086", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Grigor Dimitrov"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigor_Dimitrov", "score": 3}, {"id": "420299", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "score": 3}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/idahostatejournal.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/e/55/e55cd0f7-379b-5a85-afbc-ac7a0e681367/59989226f0fc4.image.jpg?resize=512%2C341", "timeCrawl": "23:59:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Halep in line for No. 1 after Cincinnati semifinal win", "originalArticle": null}

If it's going to happen, great, but if not I will have more opportunities. Hopefully I can do it. I have the desire.\"\n\nHalep, who hasn't dropped a set all week, has already lost twice this year playing for the top ranking, falling in the French Open final against Jelena Ostapenko and the Wimbledon quarterfinal against Johanna Konta, each time after taking the first set.\n\n\"Maybe tomorrow is my turn,\" Halep said.\n\n\"I have to give my best and fight and if I win it's going to be really special. It's a great opportunity. But for sure it's going to be a tough match against a Grand Slam champion.\n\n\"It's a big challenge.

Very happy with this win.\"\n\n'A step forward'\n\nBulgaria's 11th-ranked Grigor Dimitrov dispatched 19th-ranked American John Isner 7-6 (7/4), 7-6 (12/10) to reach his first ATP Masters final, taking a dramatic final tie-breaker on his fourth match point.\n\n\"Patience. That's what it is,\" Dimitrov said. \"I knew where he was going to serve but I couldn't do much on the ball. I just remained focused and used every opportunity I had.\"\n\nDimitrov, who matched his best Grand Slam showing by reaching this year's Australian Open semifinals, seeks his third title of the season and sixth of his career Sunday against the winner of a later semifinal between Australia's Nick Kyrgios and Spain's David Ferrer.\n\n\"Tomorrow is going to be a step forward for me,\" Dimitrov said.\n\nHalep, who never faced a break point, smacked a forehand winner to break for a 4-1 lead and held twice, taking the first set on a service winner then cruising to victory in 54 minutes to book her chance at a 16th career title and second of the year after Madrid in May.\n\n\"For sure it's a great feeling I'm playing in the final,\" Halep said. \"I feel really good.

I returned well. My shots were there. It was a gorgeous day.\"\n\nMuguruza, her left thigh bandaged, broke in the first and last games of the opening set, denied Pliskova on three break points in the opening game of the second set, then

Very happy with this win.\"\n\nBulgaria's Dimitrov dispatched 19th-ranked American John Isner 7-6 (7/4), 7-6 (12/10) to reach his first ATP Masters final, taking a dramatic final tie-breaker on his fourth match point.\n\n\"Patience. That's what it is,\" Dimitrov said. \"I knew where he was going to serve but I couldn't do much on the ball. I just remained focused and used every opportunity I had.\"\n\nDimitrov, who matched his best Grand Slam showing by reaching this year's Australian Open semi-finals, seeks his third title of the season and sixth of his career Sunday against the winner of a later semi-final between Australia's Nick Kyrgios and Spain's David Ferrer.\n\n\"Tomorrow is going to be a step forward for me,\" Dimitrov said.\n\nMuguruza will play for her fifth career title Sunday against the winner of a later match between Romania's second-ranked Simona Halep and 151st-ranked US wildcard Sloane Stephens.\n\nHalep would overtake Pliskova and claim the world number one ranking for the first time by winning the crown at the last major US Open tuneup.\n\nPliskova, last year's US Open runner-up, had won six matches in a row over Muguruza since losing their first meeting at the 2013 French Open.\n\n\"I lost to her so many times, I figured out something was going wrong,\" Muguruza said. \"I worked hard on beating these kinds of opponents. I returned well. My shots were there. It was a gorgeous day.\"\n\nMuguruza, her left thigh bandaged, broke in the first and last games of the opening set, denied Pliskova on three break points in the opening game of the second set, then broke Pliskova's final two service games for the victory.\n\nPliskova, who won twice Friday after a rain postponement, said she felt drained once the match began.\n\n\"I just wasn't there today at all,\" Pliskova said. \"During the match the energy was pretty low. Three matches in 24 hours. Definitely not the best for me.\"\n\nNOT THINKING NO. 1\n\nMuguruza, the 2016 French Open winner, will be in the world number one hunt at the US Open, which starts on August 28.\n\n\"I'm definitely not thinking at all about number one,\" Muguruza said. \"It's not going to help me. It's going to hold me back. I'm thinking about how I'm playing and if I keep doing that maybe that's going to get me to number one.\"\n\nDimitrov, a champion at Brisbane and Sofia this year, jumped ahead 5-2 in the tie-break and took the first set when an Isner backhand went wide. In the second dramatic tie-breaker, Dimitrov denied Isner on three set points and finally capitalized when Isner netted a forehand.\n\nIsner, whose serve wasn't broken all week, fell to 12-2 in the past month after July title runs at Newport and Atlanta.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T21:21:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 2545, "textStart": 2536, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-28", "amb":

It is Halep's second time in the Cincinnati final after losing to Serena Williams in 2015.\n\nIf Halep beats Muguruza in the final she will ascend to the No. 1 ranking for the first time.\n\n\"I just want to go tomorrow and play my game,\" Halep said, repeating perhaps the most overused statement in women's tennis. \"If it's going to happen, great, but if not I will have more opportunities. Hopefully I can do it. I have the desire.\"\n\nIt will be her third opportunity this year to take the No. 1 ranking for the first time in her career.\n\n\"Maybe tomorrow is my turn,\" Halep said, providing more filler. \"I have to give my best and fight and if I win it's going to be really special. It's a great opportunity. But for sure it's going to be a tough match against a Grand Slam champion.\"\n\nThe Spaniard Muguruza on Saturday easily put out current No. 1 Karolina Pliskova 6-3, 6-2.\n\n\"To beat the player that is now No. 1, it's very good match always,\" Muguruza said. \"I felt pretty good out there and in control.

Photo from Instagram @karolinapliskova\n\nCINCINNATI, USA - Defending champion Karolina Pliskova won twice in one day for the third time this season, tightening her grip on the world number one ranking Friday, August 18, to reach the WTA and ATP Cincinnati Masters semi-finals.\n\nThe 25-year-old Czech, fighting to hold off Romania's Simona Halep atop the rankings, first ousted Italian qualifier Camila Giorgi 6-3, 4-6, 6-0 in one of 5 matches postponed from Thursday, August 17, due to rain.\n\nWith only two hours between matches, Pliskova defeated Denmark's fifth-ranked Caroline Wozniacki 6-2, 6-4 to book a Saturday semi-final against Wimbledon champion Garbine Muguruza.\n\n\"I feel pretty good,\" Pliskova said. \"I recover well, so definitely I will be ready for tomorrow.\"\n\nThe only one of 4 rivals who could have toppled Pliskova this week still with hope is second-ranked Halep, who ripped British seventh seed Johanna Konta 6-4, 7-6 (7/1) to book a semi-final date with US wildcard Sloane Stephens.\n\n\"Whatever comes I will just take it,\" said Pliskova. \"Even if I would be second coming to the US Open, it's still better than I was last year. So no pressure about being world number one.\"\n\nPliskova's two-in-one effort, matching feats on her way to Eastbourne and Doha titles, means Halep must capture the crown to swipe the top spot in Monday's rankings.\n\n\"Not always is it going this way,\" Pliskova said of her twin wins. \"It's just lucky that I always won both of them.\"\n\nHalep squandered five match points but dominated the tie-breaker for her first career victory in 4 tries over Konta.\n\n\"I gave everything I had. I did pretty well in the tie-breaker,\" said Halep, whose 4-2 record against Stephens includes a twin two weeks ago at Washington.\n\nUkraine's fourth-ranked Elina Svitolina lost her chance at number one when she fell 7-5, 6-4 to Germany's Julia Goerges, who then lost to Stephens 6-1, 7-6 (7/3).\n\nAlso doing double duty at the final major tuneup for the US Open was Spain's Rafael Nadal, assured of moving into the world number one ranking on Monday for the first time since July 2014.\n\nNadal beat compatriot Albert Ramos-Vinolas 7-6 (7/1), 6-2 to reach a quarter-final later against Australian Nick Kyrgios.\n\nKyrgios, ranked 23rd, outlasted Croatia's Ivo Karlovic 4-6, 7-6 (8/6), 6-3, while Austria's eighth-ranked Dominic Thiem was upset 6-3, 6-3 by Spaniard David Ferrer, who will face Nadal or Kyrgios in the semi-finals.\n\nAll my support to Barcelona\n\nBoth Nadal and Ramos-Vinolas wore black ribbons on their shirts in memory of victims of the Barcelona terror attack.\n\n\"What happened yesterday in Barcelona was, of course, terrible. Everyone is very, very sad. I don't have words to say, because when these kind of things happen, is difficult,\" Nadal said.\n\n\"All my support to Barcelona and especially to the people that are suffering a lot, for all the families of the victims. Just keep going and sorry for everything,\" he added.\n\nNadal, a 15-time Grand Slam champion who won his 10th French Open title in June, clinched dethroning injury-idled Andy Murray atop the rankings when Roger Federer withdrew from Cincinnati with a back injury.\n\nSixth-ranked Spaniard Muguruza ousted Russian eighth seed Svetlana Kuznetsova 6-2, 5-7, 7-5 in a matchup of two-time Grand Slam winners that lasted two hours, 45 minutes.\n\n\"It was one of the best matches of the year,\" Muguruza said. \"It was a battle.\"\n\nMuguruza displayed a black ribbon on her visor in memory of Barcelona victims.\n\n\"I had it on my mind,\" Muguruza said.\n\nPliskova is 6-1 all-time against Muguruza, dropping only the first meeting in the 2015 French Open first round.", "dateTime":

Hopefully I can do it. I have the desire,\" Halep said.\n\n\"I am so close. I really want that.\"\n\nBulgaria's 11th-ranked Grigor Dimitrov dispatched 19th-ranked American John Isner 7-6 (7/4), 7-6 (12/10) to reach his first ATP Masters final, against the later winner between Australian Nick Kyrgios and Spain's David Ferrer.\n\nHalep, who hasn't dropped a set all week, has already lost twice this year playing for the top ranking, falling in the French Open final against Jelena Ostapenko and the Wimbledon quarterfinal against Johanna Konta, each time after taking the first set.\n\n\"Maybe tomorrow is my turn,\" Halep said.\n\n\"I have to give my best and fight and if I win it's going to be really special. It's a great opportunity. But for sure it's going to be a tough match against a Grand Slam champion.\n\n\"It's a big challenge.

If not tomorrow, maybe next weeks,\" she said. \"I can keep hoping for that, but I don't want to do that, actually. I want to win it... it's going to be more special and nicer for me.\n\n\"My first goal was a Grand Slam title, and it's still the first goal. But now being very close, it's maybe the most important thing in this period.\"\n\nSerena Williams had been number one before her pregnancy break earlier this year. Germany's Angelique Kerber and Pliskova have held the spot since.\n\nSixth-ranked Spaniard Muguruza seeks her fifth career title at the last major US Open hardcourt tuneup. She is 2-1 against Halep with two hardcourt wins but lost their most recent meeting in 2015 on Stuttgart clay.\n\n\"I'm just happy to be in the final,\" said Muguruza. \"I was hoping to get it and my concentration was really good. Very happy with this win.\"\n\n- 'A step forward' -\n\nDimitrov won a dramatic final tie-breaker on his fourth match point.\n\n\"Patience. That's what it is,\" Dimitrov said. \"I knew where he was going to serve but I couldn't do much on the ball. I just remained focused and used every opportunity I had.\"\n\nDimitrov seeks his third title of the season and sixth of his career.\n\n\"Tomorrow is going to be a step forward for me,\" Dimitrov said.\n\nHalep never faced a break point and cruised in 54 minutes.\n\n\"I played my best match on hardcourts so far,\" Halep said.\n\nUS 151st-ranked wildcard Stephens was in only her fourth event since returning from a foot injury that sidelined her 11 months.\n\n- 'I figured out something' -\n\nPliskova, last year's US Open runner-up, had won six matches in a row over Muguruza since losing their first meeting at the 2013 French Open.\n\n\"I lost to her so many times, I figured out something was going wrong,\" Muguruza said. \"I worked hard on beating these kinds of opponents. I returned well. My shots were there. It was a gorgeous day.\"\n\nPliskova, who won twice Friday after a rain postponement, was drained, saying, \"I just wasn't there today at all.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T00:30:00Z", "extractedDates":

Simona Halep, who won her 15th career title earlier this year at Madrid, next faces either British 7th seed Johanna Konta or Slovakian 11th seed Dominika Cibulkova. Photo by Rob Carr/Getty Images North America/AFP\n\nCINCINNATI, USA - Second-ranked Simona Halep charged closer to taking the world number one ranking Thursday, August 17 (Friday Manila time), beating Latvian 15th seed Anastasija Sevastova 6-4, 6-3 to reach the WTA and ATP Cincinnati Masters quarterfinals.\n\nRomania's Halep, a French Open runner-up for the second time in June, can overtake top-ranked Czech defending champion Karolina Pliskova by winning the title in the final major tuneup for the US Open.\n\n\"To be number one in the world I think is a big thing,\" Halep said. \"If I deserve the place, for sure I will win it.\"\n\nPliskova, who faces Italian qualifier Camila Giorgi in a later 3rd-round match, must also fight off Ukraine's Elina Svitolina, who won her 5th WTA title of the year last week in Toronto to reach a career-high 4th in the rankings.\n\nSvitolina, who faces Germany's Julia Goerges later, beat Halep in the Toronto final for her 5th title of the year.\n\n\"I had a tough run,\" Halep said. \"I'm not playing my best tennis in this moment but I'm still winning. I win against the 15th player in the world playing not like I want and I'm really happy about it.\"\n\nHalep, who won her 15th career title earlier this year at Madrid, next faces either British 7th seed Johanna Konta or Slovakian 11th seed Dominika Cibulkova.\n\nSerena Williams, expected to give birth next month, had been atop the rankings after winning her 23rd career Grand Slam title at the Australian Open while pregnant.\n\nAlso reaching the quarterfinals was Wimbledon champion Garbine Muguruza. The 6th-ranked Spaniard saved 3 match points in downing 17th-ranked American Madison Keys 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (7/3).\n\nAfter a two-hour rain delay at 2-2 in the 3rd set, they exchanged breaks before Keys broke again in the 11th game to serve for the match.\n\nBut Keys, who improved to 3-0 against Muguruza with a Stanford semifinal win two weeks ago, squandered 3 match points with errant shots and sent a backhand long on break point to force a final tie-breaker which Muguruza led from start to finish.\n\n\"You never knew who was going to win until the last point,\" Muguruza said. \"I had match points against me so it was really hard. I battled back and I'm glad things went my way.\"\n\nMuguruza has a last-8 date with 8th seed Svetlana Kuznetsova. The 32-year-old Russian, a two-time Grand Slam champion, eliminated Spain's Carla Suarez Navarro 6-2, 6-4.\n\nSpaniard Rafael Nadal, the 15-time Grand Slam champion assured of returning to world number one next week, faces countryman Albert Ramos-Vinolas in a night match. Nadal could meet Australian Nick Kyrgios in Friday's quarterfinals.\n\nNadal was assured of advancing past injured Andy Murray for the top spot when Roger Federer withdrew from Cincinnati with a back injury.\n\nBulgaria's 11th-ranked Grigor Dimitrov won his first ATP match in six tries against Argentina's Juan Martin del Potro by 6-3, 7-5. Dimitrov's most recent setback had been in the first round this year at Rome.\n\n\"I lost 5 times against him. I know what to expect now,\" Dimitrov said. \"I really needed that match. There are still a few guys I haven't conquered yet but that will come in time.\"\n\nDimitrov next faces Japan's Yuichi Sugita, who rallied past Russian Karen Khachanov 6-7 (0/7), 6-3, 6-3. -

I felt great on court. Now I feel better, actually,\" Halep said afterward. \"I think the match from yesterday gave me a lot of confidence, and since yesterday I started to feel the game, to feel that I can hit the ball. So, today was much better. I moved very well today. I just feel good. That's why maybe I can play. I have no pressure. ... I could not (have wished for) No. 1 in the world when I started playing professional, because I was too far. So when I got to Top 10, I said that I can be there. But still, when Serena was playing, I didn't think too much about that. My first goal was a Grand Slam title, and it's still the first goal.\n\n\"But now being very close, it's maybe the most important thing in this period, the last three months, let's say.\"\n\nHalep double-faulted just once, won 10 of her 11 second-serve attempts and won points on 72 percent of her serves in the dominant performance.\n\nStephens proved herself worthy of a wildcard selection as she ended the week as the last American player standing in the WTA singles field. She went 4-1 on the week.\n\nTwo of Stephens' wins came Friday after her Thursday match was postponed due to rain.\n\n\"Yeah, I mean, three matches in 24 hours is never easy, so gonna go with that. I actually didn't think I played that badly. I think she's just a little bit fresher and just wasn't a great day,\" Stephens said. \"I think I'm in a good place, in a good position. I'm actually playing really well. I'm just happy that my foot is okay and that I can run and things are good.\n\n\"So I don't have much to complain about. I just gotta go out there and compete and just play the best that I can.\"\n\nWTA FINAL: MATCH NOTE\n\n* From the Western & Southern Open: A win by Halep would ensure that both the WTA and ATP World Tour would have a change in the No. 1 ranking on Monday. (Rafael Nadal is returning to the ATP's No. 1 position) In the history of tennis rankings, both tours have had No. 1 change hands on the same date just five times.\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T04:03:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.4627451002597809, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3374518", "time": "04:03:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3374518", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "67", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "304427", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "score": 2}, {"id": "306905", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Women's Tennis Association"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_Tennis_Association", "score": 4}, {"id": "310203", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbi\u00f1e_Muguruza", "score": 4}, {"id": "310208", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "score": 2}, {"id": "314175", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "score": 3}, {"id": "316786", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Simona Halep"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simona_Halep", "score": 4}, {"id": "321401", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Association of Tennis Professionals"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Tennis_Professionals", "score": 1}, {"id": "329704", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Hardcourt"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardcourt", "score": 3}, {"id": "333641", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Sloane Stephens"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sloane_Stephens", "score": 3}, {"id": "347055", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked players"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_players", "score": 3}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/cincinnati.png", "timeCrawl": "04:03:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Simona Halep to play Sunday for W&S Open title, WTA No. 1 ranking", "originalArticle": null}

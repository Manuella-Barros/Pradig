Fourteen parameters (i.e., curvature, drainage density, slope, roughness, rainfall, temperature, relative humidity, lineament density, land use and land cover, general soil types, geology, geomorphology, topographic position index (TPI), topographic wetness index (TWI)) were used in developing machine learning algorithms. Three machine learning algorithms (i.e., artificial neural network (ANN), logistic model tree (LMT), and logistic regression (LR)) were applied to identify groundwater potential zones. The best-fit model was selected based on the ROC curve. Representative concentration pathways (RCP) of 2.5, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5 climate scenarios of precipitation were used for modeling future climate change. Finally, future groundwater potential zones were identified for 2025, 2030, 2035, and 2040 based on the best machine learning model and future RCP models. According to findings, ANN shows better accuracy than the other two models (AUC: 0.875). The ANN model predicted that 23.10 percent of the land was in very high groundwater potential zones, whereas 33.50 percent was in extremely high groundwater potential zones. The study forecasts precipitation values under different climate change scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6, and RCP8.5) for 2025, 2030, 2035, and 2040 using an ANN model and shows spatial distribution maps for each scenario. Finally, sixteen scenarios were generated for future groundwater potential zones. Government officials may utilize the study's results to inform evidence-based choices on water management and planning at the national level.\n\nWater scarcity is increasing throughout the world due to the effects of increasing groundwater abstraction and climatic change. One of the most important resources on earth, groundwater accounts for around 34 percent of the world's freshwater supply. It is the primary water source and is regarded as less contaminated than other sources. A few years ago, groundwater was considered as a safe water supply. However, in recent years, the state of water has revealed that groundwater is extremely sensitive to inanition in many places around the world, particularly in developing countries. All waters found below the surface of the ground are referred to as groundwater, or subterranean water. In addition to being essential for human survival, groundwater also serves several practical functions in areas including agriculture, industry, and daily home usage. Rain or snowmelt that percolates through the soil or the pore spaces of surrounding rocks replenishes groundwater in a natural way. Groundwater is one of among the most crucial components of water supplies for human society. 26 percent of the world's renewable freshwater supplies come from groundwater. It provides water for homes, commercial, industrial, agricultural, and other development projects. The global effects of climate and weather change, prolonged drought conditions, and an absence of precipitation have all contributed to an alarming rise in demand for groundwater. The groundwater table quickly dropped due to excessive consumption, and the resource's sustainability was quickly depleted. However, ineffective groundwater management has had negative consequences, including a decline in water quality, sinking of water levels, poorer crop yields, etc.. Human activities have the capacity to bring pollutants into groundwater, which can have adverse effects on the water's quality and render it unfit for consumption. Several nations reliant on groundwater as a sustainable resource are apprehensive about the diminishing quality and quantity of water in the aquifer. Due to the economic and technological limitations in emerging economies, groundwater is frequently utilized without adequate treatment. Such activity poses a significant threat to human health because of exposure to fluoride, nitrates, and various other contaminants found in groundwater. Water resource modelling has become a powerful tool for management that is essential for comprehending hydrological data, describing groundwater systems, and forecasting how they will react to pollution and external stresses.\n\nGroundwater potential zone modeling is critical for sustainable water resource management since it helps to allocate this key resource more efficiently for agriculture, industry, and home usage. It permits the identification of locations appropriate for groundwater extraction while preserving the resource, guaranteeing long-term growth and resilience in the face of droughts or climate change. Traditional approaches for locating areas with high groundwater potential zone modeling rely heavily on expensive and time-consuming ground surveys. GIS and Remote sensing is a very useful tool for modeling groundwater water potential zones. Researchers have employed various geospatial techniques for modeling groundwater potential zones such as : the AHP method, the fuzzy logic, combination of GIS and fuzzy logic, hybrid multi-criteria approach in Google Earth Engine, AHP and Fuzzy logic based technique etc. Nowadays, the use of machine learning algorithms has increased a lot in the field of groundwater potential zone modeling. Machine learning (ML) algorithms outperform traditional approaches in groundwater potential zone modelling because of their ability to manage complex, non-linear interactions across varied datasets and adapt to changing hydrogeological circumstances. Unlike previous techniques, ML algorithms easily deal with non-linearity, making them crucial for mapping groundwater potential zones and improving decision-making in sustainable water resource management. The most appropriate ML algorithm is determined by dataset features, and comparison studies are critical for identifying the method that works best in a certain environment. Various machine learning algorithms such as the: artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm; function model; the decision tree; the greatest entropy and random forest (RF) models; and shannon entropy (SE) to Geographic Information Systems (GIS), decision tree, random forest (RF), deep learning, support vector machine learning model (SVM) etc. have been used over the years to detect the groundwater potential zones. ML techniques such as RF, and ANN excel in automating the modelling process, capturing complicated patterns, and making accurate predictions. They provide a data-driven strategy that identifies feature relevance for a better understanding of groundwater impacting elements. Due to its accuracy and low cost perspectives the use of ML alongside geospatial tools have become popular over the years in many developing countries especially in the South Asian countries. Ensemble Modelling Framework for groundwater level 2 prediction in Bihar, groundwater Arsenic and health risk prediction model using ML in Pakistan, mapping of groundwater productivity potential with ML algorithms in the provincial capital of Baluchistan, Pakistan, water quality analysis with the help of ML algorithms in Sri Lanka by shows the growing interest of ML algorithms in these countries to detect the groundwater modeling. Prediction of groundwater level changes has been done in several circumstances,. Furthermore, researchers predicted how various climate change scenarios might affect groundwater levels.\n\nBangladesh is one of the most over populated, polluted and disaster-prone countries in the world. Due to its riverine geography and tropical climate, Bangladesh is fortunate to have access to a considerably greater variety of water sources. Despite issues with arsenic, iron, manganese, and microbial pollution, groundwater is believed to be safer to drink than surface water. Groundwater is a major source of drinking water and irrigation for the people of Bangladesh. Groundwater is becoming a significant issue in Bangladesh. Day by day, groundwater is polluted by pathogens and agrochemicals. Furthermore, the groundwater in coastal locations is unsuitable for irrigation and drinking due to rising sea levels and saline soils. The nation experiences a severe water shortage throughout the year, particularly during the dry season, as a result of excessive groundwater extraction, unmanaged surface water contamination, the effects of disasters brought on by climate change, saline intrusion, etc.. Additionally, the amount of agricultural land is constantly declining, and the increase in impermeable surfaces caused by vegetation has only made matters worse. A sizeable population is hence regularly exposed to the risks caused by water shortages and poor water quality. Therefore, it is essential to recognize potential groundwater sources and manage them effectively. Groundwater mapping and zoning are important for sustainable water resource management. Mapping and zoning are essential in Bangladesh, where groundwater is vital to agriculture, drinking water, and industry. The approach helps discover high-potential groundwater sites for efficient and sustainable agriculture while limiting overexploitation in sensitive locations. Mapping helps manage water supplies in highly populated regions to fulfil household needs. Mapping and zoning are also necessary for informed decision-making due to climatic vulnerabilities, salt intrusion problems, and groundwater quality difficulties. Authorities may promote sustainable water usage, resilient urban development, and groundwater protection by identifying high-potential areas. Groundwater mapping and zoning strengthen communities, ecosystems, and enterprises that use groundwater.\n\nSeveral studies have been conducted in different regions of Bangladesh to identify the groundwater potential zone, including a comparison of the accuracy of the FR and SE model a AHP, and a GIS, among others. There has been an increase in the use of machine learning algorithms to identify potential groundwater zones in recent years. Conversely, climate change is a major problem in Bangladesh. However, there has been a dearth of studies comparing the efficacy of different machine learning models for pinpointing groundwater potential zones and the impact that future climate change (RCP2.5, RCP4.5, RCP6, and RCP8.5) may have on groundwater levels in Bangladesh. The ability of machine learning algorithms to predict future precipitation under climate change scenarios, thus, has a considerable impact. With this research, we want to fill in the blanks. The study's primary objectives are: a) locating areas with high potential for groundwater use three distinct machine learning models ANN, logistic regression (LR), and a logistic model tree (LMT), all of which are based on a total of fourteen variables; b) predicting potential changes in groundwater levels in the study region in response to numerous climate change scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6, and RCP8.5); and c) comparing three machine learning algorithms using the ROC curve to determine which model is the best match for our study area. The results of this study will be used to identify the regions of Bangladesh that are suffering groundwater shortage and to choose the most appropriate model for mapping groundwater potential zones. Inspiring them to use the required model to locate likely groundwater zones, it will aid scientists in understanding the possible consequences of climate change on groundwater levels and give important data for Bangladesh's decision-makers and managers.", "source": {"uri": "nature.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nature"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

About 9.5 million acre-feet was extracted in the this last water year, compared to the 17 million extracted in 2022.\n\nIn addition to that reduction, the 2023 water year, the eight wettest in the last five decades, allowed the state to recharge 4.1 million acre-feet to the state's aquifers, the majority of which (93%) took place in the San Joaquin Valley.\n\nState and local partner agencies were also able to use floodwaters to recharge more than 450,000 acre-feet of water into the groundwater supply.\n\n\"This success was made possible by proactive water management strategies that included swift regulatory streamlining measures and financial support from the state for infrastructure enhancements,\" DWR said in its semiannual groundwater conditions update.\n\nWhile encouraging, state officials said much work needs to be done to ensure California's groundwater levels are replenished and healthy moving forward.\n\nPrecipitation in California has significantly decreased over the last several decades and groundwater was \"routinely\" extracted at a rate that exceeded the amount that was replenished.\n\nGroundwater storage remains in a deficit of nearly 40 million-acre feet due to over-extraction over the past two decades.\n\n\"A single year, or even a few years, of heavy precipitation is not enough to refill the state's depleted groundwater basins,\" the report states.\n\nIn fact, officials said it would take at least five consecutive years of above-average water years, like 2023, to fill that gap.\n\nBut that goal is likely out of reach unless more is done to recover that underground water storage.\n\n\"California needs to replenish what nature provides by expanding groundwater recharge projects, upgrading water infrastructure, and modernizing our water distribution system ... to be able to move water during high flows to maximize storage,\" DWR said in a news release.\n\nGroundwater is a crucial part of the water equation for California. Nearly 85% of Californians depend on it for some portion of their water supply and extracting from the state's aquifers is critical when surface water supplies are lacking due to drought and lack of rainfall.\n\nIn addition to households, farms and businesses, the state's ecosystem is heavily dependent on groundwater to sustain plant life and animal communities.\n\nPaul Gosselin, DWR Deputy Director of Sustainable Water Management, said California is invested in \"preparing for weather extremes\" by making full use of wet years to store as much water as possible in preparation for inevitable dry years.\n\n\"The impressive recharge numbers in 2023 are the result of hard work by the local agencies combined with dedicated efforts from the state, but we must do more to be prepared to capture and store water when the wet years come,\" Gosselin said.\n\nTo read more about the ongoing infrastructure upgrades and developments that state is making to capture and replenish its water reserves, click here.", "source": {"uri": "ktla.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTLA 5"}, "authors": [{"uri": "travis_schlepp@ktla.com", "name": "Travis Schlepp", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundwater", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Groundwater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_resources", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Water resources"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Department_of_Water_Resources", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California Department of Water Resources"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquifer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aquifer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hydrology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wet season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Precipitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Joaquin_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Joaquin Valley"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_distribution_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Water distribution system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundwater_recharge", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Groundwater recharge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_water", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surface water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_weather", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extreme weather"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drought", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drought"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_supply", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Water supply"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources", "wgt": 40}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Water_Polo", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Water Polo", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Sanitary_Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Sanitary Engineering", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Water_Parks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Water Parks", "wgt": 24}], "image": "https://ktla.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/05/GettyImages-2130973456.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544171", "eventUri": "eng-9544171", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-01", "dateEnd": "-09-30", "textStart": 338, "textEnd": 356}], "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

Major achievements have been made in thedevelopment of new groundwater sampling and modellingtechniques.The natural condition of the groundwater is easily disturbedby drilling and sampling. The effects from borehole activitieswhich may bias the real character of the groundwater have beenidentified. The development of new sampling techniques hasimproved the representativeness of the groundwater samples. Inaddition, methods to judge the representativeness better havebeen developed.For modelling of the \u00c4sp\u00f6 site, standardgroundwater modelling codes based on thermodynamic laws havebeen applied. The many limitations of existing geochemicalmodels used at the \u00c4sp\u00f6 site and the need to decodethe complex groundwater information in terms of origin, mixingand reactions at site scale necessitated the development of anew modelling tool. This new modelling concept was named M3. InM3 modelling the assumption is that the groundwater chemistryis a result of mixing as well as water/rock reactions. The M3model compares the groundwater compositions from a site. Thesimilarities and differences of the groundwater compositionsare used to quantify the contribution from mixing and reactionson the measured data. In order to construct a reliable modelthe major components, stable isotopes and tritium are used.Initially, the method quantifies the contribution from the flowsystem. Subsequently, contributions from reactions arecalculated. The model differs from many other standard modelswhich primarily use reactions rather than mixing to determinethe groundwater evolution. The M3 code has been used for thefollowing type of modelling: calculate the mixing portions at\u00c4sp\u00f6, quantify the contribution from inorganic andorganic reactions such as biogenic decomposition and sulphatereduction, comparison of groundwaters at different sites inSweden and natural analogue modelling in Africa. Thegroundwaters at the \u00c4sp\u00f6 site have been calculated toconsist of a complex mixture of meteoric water, Baltic Seawater, glacial meltwater and brine water. This reflects presentand known historical groundwater flow situations which haveaffected the site.The major conclusions are that the groundwaters record thepresent and paleo effects but this signal can be easilyweakened by borehole activities such as drilling, boreholetesting and sampling.

Washington has been a frequent target of the Hong Kong government\u2019s rebuttal statements, including one issued last Friday to condemn \u201cunfounded smears\u201d made by the United States and some other Western countries over a court ruling in a landmark national security trial. But Secretary for Justice Paul Lam Ting-kwok, in a discussion over the new offence of foreign interference at a forum on Saturday, said he did not agree with the idea that the US was unfriendly. \u201cMany individuals in the United States might have some unfriendly words and deeds towards us, saying things that we feel are very inappropriate, but should this be a reason for us to call the United States an unfriendly country? I think it would be an irrational thing to say,\u201d he said. \u201cHong Kong is a very international city and we deal with all sides.\u201d He said the city needed to \u201cshow that we have the confidence and ability to stay in touch with the outside world, which we are all welcome to do\u201d. \u201cThis is the characteristic of Hong Kong and what we are good at.\u201d The minister added that the country\u2019s pursuit of national security was \u201crelative\u201d and not \u201cabsolute\u201d, while there was also a balance to strike between protecting safety and fostering development. \u201cAn absolute state of security would equate to locking yourself in with 10 doors in your house, so you can\u2019t get out, and instead end up like a frog in the bottom of a well. This is not the purpose of [safeguarding] security,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we are pursuing is a suitable door \u2026 The choice is our hands. We have to use our wisdom and judgment to decide when to open and close it.\u201d He also conceded that the sedition offence, a colonial-era crime that has been incorporated into new domestic security legislation, had prompted worries among regular residents that \u201cscolding [the government] harshly would be considered inciting hatred\u201d. The Safeguarding National Security Ordinance took effect in March as a domestic counterpart of the national security law Beijing imposed in 2020. It was also required under Article 23 of the city\u2019s mini-constitution, the Basic Law. Lam said whether a remark was seditious depended on the context, and a message full of hate might not be viewed by others as inciting hatred. Residents who cared about society should still criticise the government to help drive better policymaking, he said. Han Dayuan, a law professor at Beijing\u2019s Renmin University, in an earlier session at the forum also suggested the threshold for conviction was \u201cvery, very high\u201d for the offence of seditious intention. \u201cIt is in line with the rule of law principles for residents to put forward criticism and suggestions \u2013 including sharp criticism \u2013 out of the expectation that the government should do better. We should distinguish these [from the sedition offence],\u201d he said. The legal scholar said it was important to uphold judicial independence in proceedings of national security cases and respect the professional adjudication by Hong Kong judges, noting that \u201csocial consensus can be built up through the rule of law\u201d.", "summary": "Secretary for Justice Paul Lam points to need to show \u2018confidence and ability\u2019 in maintaining ties with the rest of the world.", "url": "https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3265912/irrational-call-us-unfriendly-country-hong-kong-justice-minister-paul-lam-says", "image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/06/08/216105e5-5b0c-4240-958e-2c2975a66300_14da7a58.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 12:46:22", "author": "Kahon Chan", "authors": ["Kahon Chan"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "cn", "sentiment": -0.014}

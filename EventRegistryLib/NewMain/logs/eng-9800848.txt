Weather experts predicted rainfall could reach 4-6 inches at Sedgefield Country Club.\n\nThe Tour announced Wednesday afternoon that fans would not be allowed on the property on Thursday due to dangerous weather conditions. That update said that play would continue as long as conditions allowed.\n\nHowever, there was a 90% chance of rain for Thursday with winds of 15 to 20 mph with gusts upwards of 35 mph.\n\nWith so much rain expected for Thursday, why did the PGA Tour only prevent fans from coming to the event? Why would they not postpone the round at that moment?\n\nSure, weather changes all the time -- tropical storms do change paths.\n\nNot this time, though -- Debby came barreling in and forced the PGA Tour to issue a statement at 5 a.m. on Thursday.\n\n\"The first round of the Wyndham Championship is delayed due to Tropical Storm Debby. The first tee time will not be before 3 p.m. ET Thursday,\" the PGA Tour communications team posted on X at 5 a.m. Thursday morning.\n\nSix hours later, they updated the public again to postpone the first round, stating, \"Updated first-round starting times will follow.\" They did not give a time, though.\n\nTheir article about the delay, which included all of these updates, stated that they would decide their next move at 6 p.m. ET.\n\nThese two statements are odd for a few reasons.\n\nThe first is that they refused to allow fans on the property because they knew the storm was on its way. Why did they not include the golf? The player's safety is important too.\n\nSecondly, at 5 a.m. this morning, it was evident that the rain was here to stay, but the PGA Tour officials chose to wait until 11 a.m. to make a final decision. This situation is just the latest instance in which they did not consider the weather, and it caused some delay.\n\nOf course, it is nearly impossible to control nature or predict what will happen, but if the conditions are too dangerous for fans to be there, why would professional athletes play?\n\nTropical Storm Debby was not a surprise. It came across Georgia and Florida last weekend with flood-like rains. Tour officials could have prepped better for the weather.\n\nThere is also an 80% chance of rain on Friday, so depending on how that pans out, the tournament may not start then.\n\nWill there be enough time for the PGA Tour to complete 72 holes by Sunday or even Monday?\n\nHow will this affect the FedEx Cup race? Many players rely on this week to help secure a spot inside that Top 70, and now there is a delay. What happens if they cannot play the event at all? Will they extend the Top 70 to a larger number so players close to that line can tee it up at the FedEx St. Jude Championship in Memphis?\n\nStay tuned for more news on the regular season finale for the PGA Tour.", "source": {"uri": "sbnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SB Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "savannah_leigh_richardson@sbnation.com", "name": "Savannah Leigh Richardson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyndham_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wyndham Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedgefield_Country_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sedgefield Country Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Jude_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St. Jude Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FedEx_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FedEx Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Memphis, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Memphis, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules_and_Etiquette", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules and Etiquette", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gLVFx6pWopJ_qeZGy327AJdBNjM=/0x0:6526x3263/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25564599/2165768074.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9800848", "eventUri": "eng-9800848", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-09", "textStart": 65, "textEnd": 73}], "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Depending on how the weather develops, the tournament could stretch into Monday or (gulp) even Tuesday.\n\nThe tropical storm moved into the Greensboro area on Thursday, as Round 1 was set to get underway. The tournament organizers initially planned on starting play later in the afternoon -- without fans -- but later decided to raincheck the opening round.\n\n\"This decision was a difficult one for us to make with our partners at the PGA TOUR, but everyone's safety is our top priority,\" said Tournament Director Bobby Powell. \"The most-recent forecast looks like the storm could clear our area sometime Friday.\"\n\nHeavy rains (4 to 6 inches) and strong gusts (up to 40 mph, per the PGA Tour's site) are expected throughout the day. Flash flooding warnings are in effect. Debby made landfall on U.S. shores as a Category 1 hurricane on Florida's Gulf Coast on Monday.\n\nThe Wyndham carries hefty stakes, up and down the 156-person field. Players in the top-70 (71 this year, because of Grayson Murray's passing) in the FedExCup standings after the Wyndham will qualify for the playoffs, which begin next Thursday, August 14, with the FedEx St. Jude Championship at TPC Southwind in Memphis.\n\nThe top 50 in the points standings after the St. Jude will progress to the BMW Championship in Denver. The top 30 after that event will compete in the TOUR Championship, at East Lake in Atlanta (Aug. 29-Sept. 1).\n\nQualification for the BMW also assures players PGA Tour membership cards through 2025 and automatic eligibility for the eight Signature Events. This is particularly important for somebody like Jordan Spieth; currently 63rd in the standings and secured for Memphis, but not Denver. Spieth's facing offseason wrist surgery, and both he and the PGA Tour would surely like him locked into next year's biggest events.\n\n\"There's going to be a tournament to win and that will be a focus,\" Spieth said at his pre-tournament press conference on Tuesday at Sedgefield CC. \"But you almost get to have double the excitement on some of the things, guys making the Playoffs, guys kind of getting in the top 125 or making a big push to where they can get their jobs back through the rest of the fall.\n\n\"There's a lot at stake here and I think this event will just continue to get better and better, which is good because it deserves to be.\"", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri":

We play through those types of conditions all the time.\"\n\nTackett added he was confident that the Wyndham Championship will be concluded by Monday at the latest.\n\nHe didn't rule out the possibility that it could be finished on Tuesday morning.", "source": {"uri": "golfmagic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Golfmagic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_smith@golfmagic.com", "name": "Ben Smith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyndham_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wyndham Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedgefield_Country_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sedgefield Country Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behind_closed_doors_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Behind closed doors (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Powell_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bobby Powell (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT&T_Pebble_Beach_Pro-Am", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RBC_Heritage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "RBC Heritage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Weather Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Referee"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Travel", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Touring", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Touring", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://cdn.golfmagic.com/styles/xl/s3/2024-08/2024-01-01T001857Z_1805554169_RC2CE1AEWD2P_RTRMADP_3_GOLF-PGATOUR-PIF.JPG?itok=omkvGvJp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9800848", "eventUri": "eng-9800848", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

The PGA Tour made the announcement at 11:30 a.m. via social media.\n\nOn Wednesday, officials said fans would not be able to attend Thursday's opening round because of the expected weather. On Thursday morning, it was announced that tee times would be delayed until 3 p.m.\n\nAccording to an update on the PGA Tour's website, meteorologist Stewart Williams said the rain \"began between 2:30-3 a.m. on Thursday. As of 8 a.m., two inches had already fallen at Sedgefield with sustained winds of 15-25 mph and gusts between 30-40 mph.\"\n\nNow, the tournament won't start until Friday morning, but at this point it's hard to tell how early the first-round tee times can begin on Friday.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe goal at every PGA Tour tournament is to get in 72 holes by Sunday evening. The last time the tournament had a Monday finish was in 2012 when Sunday's round was suspended by bad weather and Sergio Garcia won.\n\nKen Tackett of the PGA Tour said he didn't know exactly when the first round would start on Friday.\n\n\"It would be irresponsible to throw a number out there, but hopefully sometime (Friday) morning we can get round one going, and with that there's still hope to try to wrap things up and get things finished Sunday evening,\" Tackett said. \"Probably not about 6 p.m. The forecast for Saturday and Sunday is pretty good and then, if need be, we always will go into Monday to get 72 holes in.\"\n\nWilliams offered his assessment of what could happen overnight with more rain likely.\n\n\"Overnight tonight Debby will move up to the north and quickly accelerate away from us,\" said Williams, who lives in High Point. \"It could be some lingering showers first thing in the morning, but I'm anticipating the crew hopefully can get out there early tomorrow morning and get the process started of cleaning up the golf course.\"\n\nTournament director Bobby Powell said superintendent Chad Cromer and his staff will be ready to work on the course once the rain subsides.\n\n\"I know Chad Cromer and his staff have an incredible team in place,\" Powell said. \"I can't remember the exact year, but I know when we had one of these horrible thunderstorms overnight, we started on time at 6:50 the next morning and I remember literally seeing an army of leaf blowers going down because all the pine needles and everything, all the debris and leaves and everything that were washing in the fairways was a mess on every single hole and it was literally an army going out. It was a miracle that they started on time that year at 6:50 in the morning. So there will probably be similar situations like that (on Friday) whenever it is that we do start.\"\n\njdell@wsjournal.com\n\n336-727-4081\n\n@johndellWSJ\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.

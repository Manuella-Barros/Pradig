They are so, so strong. I think they probably could have selected two squads and still be competitive with both,\" Morgan said on Sky Sports. India are one-time T20 world Cup champions with their title coming in the inaugural 2007 edition when they defeated Pakistan in the final at Johannesburg.

In the last couple of years in a Chennai Super Kings shirt, batting in the middle order with the immense power he has and I think an extra string to his bow now is how he plays fast bowling. He has both six and four hitting options when he first comes in. So again, for different reasons, being a left hander and watching a young, exciting player coming through, I am looking forward to seeing him play. But I have India as strong favourites,\" he said. India have already defeated Ireland in their opening encounter and will play arch-rivals Pakistan on Sunday in a match where the toss has been delayed. If the match gets washed out, both teams will share a point apiece. After the match against the Men in Green, India will face hosts USA on June 12 and then Canada on June 15 to wrap up their group commitments.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/eoin-morgan-picks-india-to-win-t20-world-cup-2024-9381736/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/06/WC-16.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 14:31:56", "author": "Sports Desk", "authors": ["Sports Desk"], "language": "en", "catgory": "sports", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.186}

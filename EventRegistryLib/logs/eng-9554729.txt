Thursday, May 9, 2024.\n\nCity Comptroller Brad Lander on Thursday excoriated Mayor Eric Adams' 60-day shelter stay limit for migrants in a new report finding the policy has been implemented in a \"haphazard and arbitrary\" fashion, without proper guidelines or staffing.\n\nLander, during a May 9 news conference outside the Row Hotel migrant shelter, said that the policy did not live up to its own goals.\n\n\"This is not a policy designed or implemented to help families achieve stable housing and self-sufficiency and integrate into our city,\" Lander said. \"It was a policy designed to churn people through a system, to subject them to screening after screening, and to push them out of the shelter system with no regard for where they landed, with no regard for the impact on their kids' education.\"\n\nThe comptroller's report compiles the findings of an investigation into the 60-day rule launched on the same day in January when the first migrant families were evicted from shelter under the policy. The Adams administration first announced the rule last fall, following the enactment of a similar policy for single adults that gives them just 30 days in shelter.\n\nCity Council Member Alexa Aviles (D-Brooklyn), who chairs the Committee on Immigration, echoed that the 60-day rule is designed to push migrants out of shelter, rather than help them.\n\n\"This policy was simply made to push people out, to disregard their humanity to disregard their experience, but to make them so uncomfortable, that they would self-select to move on despite the real challenges that face them,\" Aviles said.\n\nCity Hall spokesperson Kayla Mamelak responded to the report in a statement, using the administration's frequent refrain that the policy has helped it bring down the city's shelter census -- which has exploded since the start of the migrant crisis over the past two years.\n\n\"Thirty-and-60-day notices are one tool in our very limited toolbox to help migrants to exit shelter because, as we have repeatedly said, New York City is long past its breaking point,\" she said.\n\nMamelak added that nearly half of the families given the notices have left the shelter system as well as over 50% of all migrants who have been in the city's care, \"without a single migrant family with children being forced to sleep on the street.\"\n\nThere are still 65,600 migrants in city shelters, out of the over 195,000 who have arrived in the five boroughs since spring 2022.\n\nAmong Lander's findings were that the administration has few written policies and procedures governing the 60-day rule, and that \"limited\" case management is available to migrants being pushed to leave shelter.\n\nFurthermore, the report uncovered that families with elementary school-aged children who reapply for shelter are not placed in city Department of Homeless Services (DHS) facilities -- where most migrant families have been housed thus far.\n\nThe report found the lack of written policies was evident in areas such as exemptions for pregnant migrants. While Mayor Adams had specifically pledged to give pregnant people in their third trimester and those with newborn children a reprieve from the shelter cap, Lander's office found that such a policy was \"not actually established.\"\n\n\"It was not written down, it was not promulgated, it was not given to the staff or contractors,\" Lander said.\n\nAdditionally, the report found, the city does not have written rules for reasonable accommodations to the shelter stay limit -- including who is eligible for accommodations; how migrants can request them; and how to flag those seeking them.\n\nLander's study also uncovered a lack of guidance around the transfer of migrant families' belongings and mail when they are booted from shelters.\n\nStaff were also not properly trained on how to execute the 60-day rule, Lander's office reported. And the notices of the limit handed to migrants themselves do not provide any information on the city's long-standing right-to-shelter policy or housing options, mail and personal belongings -- the report says.\n\nWhen it comes to case management, the administration has repeatedly said that it works \"intensively\" with migrants to secure more stable housing so they can exit the shelter system. But Lander's report found the city mainly focuses on getting migrants out of the city's care and does little to actually assist them in finding other housing once they leave.\n\n\"Our investigators found that there's very little case management of any sort,\" Lander said. \"What there essentially are, are repeated screenings to insist that you must have somewhere else to go over and over and over again.\"\n\nCity Hall contends that it does have clear written policies around pregnant migrants, reasonable accommodations and exit planning and that it trains staff in those areas. However, when pressed by amNewYork Metro, it did not immediately share the policies.\n\nAdditionally, the mayor's office said over 80% of children whose parents have had their notices come due have been able to stay in their original schools.\n\nThe comptroller's report also contains several recommendations for improving the 60-day policy, including eliminating it. Short of that, Lander advised that the city should establish clearer policies and procedures, beef up training and case management and better track migrant families who leave the system.", "source": {"uri": "amny.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "amNewYork"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ethan_stark_miller@amny.com", "name": "Ethan Stark-Miller", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Adams_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eric Adams (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Lander", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brad Lander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comptroller", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Comptroller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lander_County,_Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lander County, Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lander County, Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexa_Avil\u00e9s", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexa Avil\u00e9s"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Adams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Council", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boroughs_of_New_York_City", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boroughs of New York City"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_management_(mental_health)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Case management (mental health)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Hall", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City Hall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AM_New_York_Metro", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AM New York Metro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_accommodation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reasonable accommodation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rapid transit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society", "label": "dmoz/Society", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home", "label": "dmoz/Home", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.amny.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_0359-copy-2.jpg?w=1200&p=q", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554729", "eventUri": "eng-9554729", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 443, "textEnd": 448}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 223, "relevance": 1}

But that 60-day cap has come at a humanitarian cost and its consequences have been poorly tracked, according to an investigation by City Comptroller Brad Lander.\n\nThe city does not formally track whether the limits help migrants find stable housing, the investigation found. And despite the mayor's promise to offer \"intensive case management\" to help families plan their next steps, Lander said those services are lacking, focused mainly on driving families out of the shelter system and often away from New York City. The city does \"very little\" to help families find stable housing once they reach the limit, and may hurt migrants' ability to apply for work permits by booting them to a new address without tracking their location or forwarding their mail, Lander's report concluded.\n\nSince January, the administration has required migrant families with children to leave city shelters after 60 days -- part of an effort to cut costs by encouraging asylum seekers to find their own accommodations. But Lander, who began an investigation as soon as the policy took effect, said Thursday that the administration failed to keep its own promises as it implemented the policy \"in a haphazard and arbitrary way.\"\n\nAs of late April, the city had issued 60-day eviction notices to more than 10,200 families, affecting about 19,500 adults and 18,100 children. It has seemingly achieved its central goal -- 51% of families have left the shelter system entirely after receiving a notice, even though they are allowed to re-apply to stay in shelter. Another 40% moved to another shelter and 9% remained in the same shelter they began in, Lander's office found.\n\nThe Adams administration has credited the 60-day policy, along with a stricter 30-day cap for adult migrants, with helping the city cut more than $2 billion in expected spending on the migrant crisis between this year and the coming year. That \"prudent approach\" helped stave off the need for more painful budget cuts to services like police and early childhood programs, Adams said when announcing his latest spending plan in April.\n\nBut Lander, a progressive and frequent foil of the mayor's, also faults the administration for admitting that it evaluates the 60-day program only in terms of whether it drives down costs -- without studying whether the limits achieve another stated goal of helping migrants find permanent housing.\n\n\"The city does not track outcomes for families who are impacted by the 60-day notice unless they return and reapply for placement,\" Adams wrote in a February letter to Lander in response to the comptroller's questions.\n\nThe mayor's office had no immediate comment. Adams and his aides have repeatedly defended the city's response to what they call a fast-moving emergency, during which the city has gotten little help from the federal government.\n\nThe comptroller pointed to other flaws: the 60-day cap was implemented without any written policies to uphold some of the administration's promises, like exempting pregnant women in their third trimester or transferring migrants' belongings. And the eviction notices themselves do not inform migrants that they have a legal right to reapply for shelter or request an accommodation for a disability.\n\nLander's report also found what he called specific discrimination against families with elementary school-aged children. When those families apply for re-intake after hitting the 60-day limit, the city refuses to place them in shelters run by the Department of Homeless services, where the limits do not apply, all but ensuring that children's education will be disrupted by future moves. (The 60-day limit applies only in emergency shelters run by city agencies other than DHS, including Health + Hospitals and Housing Preservation and Development.)\n\n\"I found this really stunning,\" Lander said during a press conference outside the Row Hotel in Midtown, where some of the first eviction notices were issued in January. \"The administration offered no rationale whatsoever for that especially cruel and disruptive policy.\"\n\nLander called for the 60-day limit to be scrapped and replaced with a program that \"genuinely coordinates\" legal help and shelter placement for migrants. He was joined Thursday by representatives from the Legal Aid Society, which recently opposed Adams' attempts to curtail the city's right-to-shelter mandate; and Christine Quinn, the former City Council Speaker who now leads the shelter provider Win.\n\n\"You're uprooting children who have gone through the trauma of having to flee their country of origin,\" Quinn said. \"Every other time in history when we have seen an influx of immigrants to New York City, the city has done better.\"\n\nThe Adams administration reached a legal settlement in March over its request to amend the decades-old right-to-shelter rule. In the accord with Legal Aid, the city won the right to deny adult migrants a new shelter placement after 30 days, while keeping the shelter guarantee in place for unhoused people generally.", "source": {"uri": "crainsnewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Crain's New York Business"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nick_garber@crainsnewyork.com", "name": "Nick Garber", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Lander", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brad Lander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Adams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comptroller", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Comptroller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lander_County,_Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lander County, Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lander County, Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Adams_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eric Adams (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eviction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eviction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_seeker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asylum seeker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legal_Aid_Society", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Legal Aid Society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christine_Quinn", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christine Quinn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Council", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Legal aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midtown_Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midtown Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Midtown Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Animal_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Animal Welfare", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Large_Families", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Large Families", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Homeless", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Homeless", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family_Resources_and_Support", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family Resources and Support", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://s3-prod.crainsnewyork.com/styles/1024x512/s3/The%20Redbury%20Maialino%20%2030%20E30%208.57%20%281%29_1.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554729", "eventUri": "eng-9554729", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 219, "relevance": 1}

Donate today\n\nMayor Eric Adams' policy forcing migrant families out of local shelters after 60 days has been implemented in a \"haphazard\" way without adequate written guidelines, training, evaluation and social services, according to a new audit by the city comptroller.\n\nComptroller Brad Lander's inquiry found a dearth of \"intensive case management\" that the Adams administration had promised for departing migrants. Those services would help migrant families connect with work certification classes, legal help and other assistance, city officials had said.\n\nAuditors in Lander's office found those promises to be \"empty,\" based on a review of internal training documents. The results bolster claims from immigration and housing advocates who have complained for months that the city hasn't done enough to help recent arrivals.\n\n\"This is not a policy designed or implemented to help families achieve stable housing and self sufficiency and integrate into our city,\" Lander said on Thursday, referring to the 60-day limit on shelter stays for migrant families. \"It was a policy designed to churn people through a system ... and to push them out of the shelter system with no regard for where they landed, with no regard for the impact on their kids education, and with no regard for their actual path forward to stable housing, employment, and self-sufficiency.\"\n\nKayla Mamelak, a spokesperson for Adams, said the city has policies in place for some of the areas highlighted in the comptroller report, including for pregnant women and migrants with disabilities. She didn't immediately respond to a request to provide documentation of those policies.\n\n\"While several suggestions made in the comptroller's report are already part of our policy, any ideas on how to improve our herculean work are welcome and will be considered,\" Mamelak said in a statement. She also highlighted the administration's efforts to keep migrant families from sleeping on the street and echoed its longstanding calls for more federal aid and immigration reforms.\n\nAs of April 28, the city had handed out 60-day notices to 10,229 families, including 18,149 children, and most of them had left the shelter system entirely, according to Lander's report. City officials have said they do not track where migrants who leave shelter end up, citing privacy concerns and a lack of similar tracking for people who stay in the city's traditional shelters.\n\nThe report's findings repeat Lander's earlier broadsides against the administration's limits on shelter stays, which he and immigrant advocates have decried as unwarranted. It also criticizes city officials' touting of the limits as a cost-saving measure and points to additional costs incurred as a result of them.\n\nAccording to the comptroller's office, case workers connect migrants to city-funded transportation to other locations and set up appointments to apply for asylum. But they are not instructed to provide further assistance, such as directing migrants to help with work permits, housing aid or immigration legal benefits, the report found.\n\nThe comptroller also addressed what he called \"arbitrary\" and previously unknown rules that sometimes subject migrant families with elementary school-age children to frequent moves between shelters. When those families reapply for shelter after being forced to leave, they are denied placement in shelters operated by the city Department of Homeless Services, where families would be insulated from the shelter limits due to stricter state rules for traditional homeless shelters, the auditors wrote.\n\nLander renewed his calls for the Adams administration to eliminate the 60-day rule at a press conference on Thursday morning across the street from the Row Hotel, an emergency shelter in Midtown where the first migrant families were evicted under the stay limits. The report said the city should at least correct the \"critical shortcomings,\" providing more information about the policy to families and ramping up social services.\n\nAdams has staunchly defended the limits on shelter stays, which he announced last July for single adult migrants and expanded to migrant families in October. He initially billed the restrictions as a necessary measure to cut costs and nudge migrants to depart the city's strained shelter system.\n\nThe administration has credited the declining number of migrants in local shelters with helping slash the multibillion-dollar cost projections to care for the new arrivals. The mayor touted the success of his cost-trimming measures for migrants in his latest executive budget, released on April 24.\n\nIn January, shortly after evictions began for migrant families under the 60-day policy, the administration announced it would exempt pregnant women in their third trimester and families with newborns. The decision came after fierce outcry over the eviction of a migrant woman who was more than eight months pregnant on the first day the rule went into effect.\n\nBut the exemptions were never communicated in writing to city agencies or shelter providers, according to Lander's investigation. The city also lacks policies and training materials for transferring migrant families' belongings after they switch shelters and on \"reasonable accommodations\" for migrants with disabilities, the report found.\n\nThe report also said the eviction notices provided to migrant families do not advise them of their right to reapply for shelter after 60 days, exemptions to the rule, or their ability to request that their personal belongings be held after they're required to leave shelter.\n\nThe findings do not address single adult migrants, who are soon set to face stricter limits under a recent court settlement over the city's right-to-shelter policies. Single adult migrants will continue to be evicted from shelters after 30 or 60 days, depending on their age -- and now, unlike families, they will only be able to extend their stays under \"extenuating circumstances.\"\n\nWhile the exact details of how the city will determine those shelter extensions remain unclear, the criteria may include migrants' efforts to find jobs, apply for asylum and move out of shelter, according to the settlement agreement.\n\nCity officials have pledged that adult migrants facing potential evictions will see a case manager three times during each 30-day span where they're staying in shelter, according to Josh Goldfein, a senior staff attorney at the nonprofit Legal Aid Society who is monitoring the implementation of the settlement.\n\n\"If people haven't been provided with any assistance in doing [moving out of shelter], if they don't have access to the tools that they need to move out, then it's absolutely not fair to say to them, 'we don't think you did enough,'\" he said at the press conference on Thursday. \"We have to help people do what they want to do, which is again, to move out of shelter to support their families to live independently.\"", "source": {"uri": "gothamist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gothamist"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Lander", "type": "person",

As a result of the rule, the City has issued 60-day notices to 10,229 families with children -- affecting 19,497 adults and 18,149 children -- as of April 28.\n\nThe investigation found that the policy was haphazardly implemented, and that notices to families, training for staff, and written guidelines were all inadequate. For example, despite an announcement from City Hall that pregnant women in their last trimester and families with newborns would be exempted, no written policy to that effect was ever given to staff or contractors. Despite promises of \"intensive case management\" to assist families, investigators found that the City provides very limited case management services that do little to help asylum-seeking families achieve self-sufficiency. And the City specifically discriminated against families with elementary-school aged children in shelter placements, making it more likely their children's schooling would be disrupted.\n\n\"Back in January, the Adams Administration enacted a cruel policy of evicting families from shelter every 60 days with the empty promise of intensive case management -- as a result, City Hall has subjected over 37,000 people to repetitive screenings for shelter alternatives, disrupted families' efforts to obtain work authorization and legal status, and uprooted children from the schools where they made connections,\" said Comptroller Brad Lander. \"Beyond the cruelty of the policy, our investigation found significant management flaws in how City Hall is administering these evictions and how poorly they are tracking outcomes. Our City can do so much better.\"\n\nComptroller Lander announced the investigation on the first day that families were evicted and were told to re-apply for shelter in Humanitarian Emergency Response and Relief Centers (HERRCs). The Comptroller's office investigation found:\n\nIn a January 9 letter sent to City Hall that initiated the investigation, Comptroller Lander requested information about \"the protocols City agencies will use to implement\" the 60-day shelter limit and reassignment and inquired about \"the potentially harmful impacts of the policy on families seeking asylum, especially on children who may be displaced from their public school as a result of being transferred to a shelter far from their school.\"\n\nIn a letter response dated February 5, the Mayor stated that \"Shelter time limits, paired with intensive case management, are designed to help more households achieve self-sufficiency, find stable housing arrangements, and exit from the shelter system.\"\n\nDespite that promise, the Comptroller's investigation into the 60-day rule found that the promise of intensive case management was hollow. The documents implementing the policy disclose a single-minded focus on avoiding the City's legal obligations to provide shelter. While the rule has contributed to a reduction in the shelter population, it also served to destabilize families with children and increase barriers to work authorization and legal status.\n\nThe investigation report recommends:\n\nLander announced these finding and recommendations alongside a coalition of immigrant advocates, elected officials, shelter providers, and homeless rights organizations in front of the Row Hotel, where the first eviction notices took place in January.\n\nRead the investigation here.\n\n\"From the start, the Council has been clear that the Administration's 60-day shelter limit policy would be counterproductive and destabilizing for our new arrivals, and to our goal of helping them achieve self-sufficiency,\" said Council Speaker Adrienne Adams. \"As the policy has impacted increasing numbers of children and families, more and more students have had disrupted schooling as families are needlessly moved from location to location. This and the inhumane conditions at the Hall Street Complex in Brooklyn are among the many examples of why our city must improve its collaboration and planning with stakeholders to meet the needs of asylum seekers, longtime New Yorkers, and communities. We must support those seeking shelter and provide an opportunity for new arrivals to contribute to our economy. I thank Comptroller Lander's office for this investigation, the findings of which can help guide the Administration towards more effective policy solutions that prioritize the well-being of everyone in our city.\"\n\n\"The findings within Comptroller Lander's report should not be a surprise to anyone because the Adams administration designed 30-and-60-day shelter limits to be a bureaucratic nightmare,\" said Council Member Alexa Avil\u00e9s, Chair of the Committee on Immigration. \"This report concretizes the human suffering and chaos the Adams administration has chosen to deliver onto our newest neighbors. You cannot uproot, dislocate, and incarcerate your way to a coherent immigration agenda. I thank the Comptroller for his work on this report. The 30-and-60-day rule must end now.\"\n\n\"As the prime-sponsor of Intro 210, the Stop Shelter Evictions Act, I commend Comptroller Lander's continued commitment to highlighting the disastrous impacts of the 30- and 60-Day shelter evictions,\" said Council Member Shahana Hanif. These arbitrary caps undermine our efforts to provide immediate stability and set adults and families with children up for success as new New Yorkers. We've seen an uptick in street homelessness while many school-age children have altogether left the public school system. It is imperative that we advance this bill to allow our newest neighbors an opportunity to be self-sufficient. They should be armed with access to legal services and work authorizations, not shortsighted policies.\"\n\n\"People are not able to move forward with their lives because important mail containing life changing documents - such as their work authorizations, health insurance cards, asylum application receipts - is being withheld or discarded by shelter staff once they are evicted,\" said Power Malu, Executive Director of Artists, Athletes, Activists. \"All the appointments to our resource center to assist with filling out applications are wasted efforts and resources because this rule takes away their consistent mailing address. This fabricated chaos has been created by an administration that is squandering an opportunity to represent New York City as the stand up city we truly are. Instead, they have decided to move in the dark and blame their incompetency on human beings that are ready and eager to contribute socially, culturally, and economically to the fabric of our great city.\"\n\n\"It's wrong for Mayor Adams to deprive anyone without a home of safe and stable shelter,\" said Dave Giffen, Executive Director of the Coalition for the Homeless. \"The new arrivals who have come to our city want nothing more than the chance to build better lives for themselves and their families, and needless obstacles like the 60-day rule succeed only in making it more difficult to do so. These families and individuals have gone through unimaginable hardship to get here, and we should be putting out the welcome mat, not pulling out the rug from under them.\"\n\n\"It is cruel and counterproductive to push vulnerable, traumatized families out of stability at the same time the City is asking them to take every possible step to get on their feet and move on to shelter,\" said Joshua Goldfein, Staff Attorney at the Legal Aid Society. \"The City could save money by offering comprehensive case management services to help people achieve independence sooner and not casting them out to start again on an arbitrary schedule.\"\n\n\"Every New York family deserves a stable home and access to a quality education for their children,\" said Murad Awawdeh, President and CEO of the New York Immigration Coalition. \"This is especially important for recent arrivals, who fled violence and persecution in their home countries to be ultimately greeted by the instability of our shelter rules. By making families jump through bureaucratic hoops, Mayor Eric Adams is inflicting unnecessary harm on families seeking asylum with his arbitrary 60-day evictions, which requires families to relocate from shelters and schools every two months. It is far past time for the Mayor to invest in the success of recent arrivals - including their children's success in school - and recognize the evidence that shows that this effort will more quickly result in immigrants becoming self-sufficient New Yorkers contributing to our economy and culture. We must end the 60-day evictions, for the future of our newest neighbors and all of New York City.\"\n\n\"The 60-day rule is a cruel and illogical barrier for migrants who are only seeking safety, security, and stability,\" said Christine C. Quinn, President and CEO of Win. \"Bringing an end to the 60-day rule is not just a sound policy decision that will save the City money - it's a humane decision that will set countless families on the path toward permanent housing and financial independence. We commend the Comptroller for shining a light on the regressive impacts of the 60-day rule and look forward to continuing to work with leaders across the city and state to bring an end to this unjust policy.\"", "source": {"uri": "comptroller.nyc.gov", "dataType": "news", "title": "Office of the New York City Comptroller Brad Lander"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He says that, to his clients, the 60 days represent a stress they can't wait to leave behind.\n\n\"I had a great comment from a client which is, 'I can't wait until the day I stop living 60-day notice to 60-day notice and start living rent to rent,'\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comptroller", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Comptroller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Lander", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brad Lander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_seeker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asylum seeker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Adams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eviction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eviction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WCBS-TV", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WCBS-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Hall", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City Hall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jean-Jacques Rousseau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_bono", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro bono"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harvard University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia,_South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Columbia, South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Columbia, South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle_Choices", "label": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle Choices", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Apartment_Living/Roommates", "label": "dmoz/Home/Apartment Living/Roommates", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/01/06/049e9066-f5e8-419b-bc06-31ac29102785/thumbnail/1200x630/4af33f1a56c6480790991953e1d59a8f/keleshian-11p-pkg-asylu-wcbs8wf5-hi-res-still.jpg?v=218688c1357f974b9630d4fa8914721c", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554729", "eventUri": "eng-9554729", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-28", "textStart": 467, "textEnd": 475}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

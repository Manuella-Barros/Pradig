{"id": 231351074, "title": "Louis van Gaal gives verdict on whether Manchester United should sack Erik ten Hag", "text": "Louis van Gaal has told Manchester United to stick with Erik ten Hag - but admits his compatriot has caused some of his own problems. Ten Hag's future remains undecided as the Old Trafford hierarchy conduct their end-of-season review. The former Ajax manager, who was advised to snub the United job by Van Gaal in 2022, led the Red Devils to their worst-ever Premier League finish in the season just gone, slumping to eighth in the table. Their wretched campaign did end on a high, though, as Ten Hag's side pulled off an FA Cup final shock by beating bitter rivals Manchester City 2-1 at Wembley last month. That's left the United fan base divided over the Dutchman's future and now former boss Van Gaal, who knows what it's like to be sacked by the Red Devils after an FA Cup final win, has offered Ten Hag his backing. \"Of course (he shouldn't be sacked),\" Van Gaal told Sky Sports. \"But I needed also more time at Manchester United. I also won the FA Cup and before me for 20 years (no United manager) has got the FA Cup. \"Now Erik is winning the FA Cup and also first year qualifying for the Champions League so I don\u2019t think you have to sack him. He needs more time but I can also be more critical. He has not done it fantastically - you can give criticism - but he has also shown he is a good manager.\" Ten Hag blames United's drop-off on their horrendous injury record throughout the season, with key players such as Lisandro Martinez, Luke Shaw and Rasmus Hojlund among those to have endured lengthy layoffs on more than one occasion. News emerged before last month's final that Ratcliffe and co had already decided to sack Ten Hag and he gave a firm response post-match. Your turn! Should Manchester United sack Erik ten Hag? Join the debate in the comments section \"When you don't have the players available, then you can't perform, so simple as that,\" the 54-year-old argued. \"And if that is the opinion, it is no problem. Then I go anywhere else and I go and keep winning trophies.\" England manager Gareth Southgate is widely considered Ratcliffe's would-be pick to replace Ten Hag, although the European Championship is likely to complicate any move. Recently-axed Bayern Munich boss Thomas Tuchel also has admirers at Old Trafford. Join our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

We are simple people and will celebrate with kheer (local rice pudding) and whatever Allah gives us, we are happy!\" he said.\n\nSupporters and family members of Pakistani athlete Arshad Nadeem celebrate after his Olympic victory at Mian Channu in Khanewal district, Pakistan on August 9, 2024.\n\nShahid Saeed Mirza/AFP/Getty Images\n\nPeople danced to drums on the streets outside Nadeem's home, and his mother told local outlet Geo News: \"I am so happy, what can I tell you? I want to hug him and kiss him. He has made Pakistan's name proud, earned Pakistan a medal and made its flag fly proudly.\"\n\nNadeem shattered the Olympic record of 90.57 meters, set by Norway's Andreas Thorkildsen at Beijing 2008, with his second throw that almost made 93 meters.\n\nNadeem threw his arms into the air in celebration as the board confirmed the record-breaking throw, eliciting gasps of amazement from spectators.\n\n\"When I threw the javelin, I got the feel of it leaving my hand, and sensed it could be an Olympic record, inshallah (God willing),\" Nadeem said later.\n\nIn winning gold, Arshad defeated India's sporting hero and reigning world champion Neeraj Chopra, who took silver with a throw of 89.45, ahead of Grenada's Anderson Peters, who threw 88.54 meters for bronze.\n\nThe friendship between the top two medalists, Nadeem and Chopra, has defied the historic animosity between Pakistan and Indian sporting teams, and when the results were confirmed the two embraced each other, their flags wrapped around their shoulders.\n\nPakistan's Arshad Nadeem competes in the men's javelin throw final of the athletics event at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games at Stade de France in

his gold medal -- the country's first Olympic gold since its men's field hockey team won in Los Angeles in 1984.\n\nPakistan sports journalist Altamish Jiwa told CNN that Nadeem's gold was a \"humungous victory for all of Pakistan\" and one that had buoyed the nation's spirits.\n\n\"Nadeem has delivered the perfect gift which the nation has been waiting for quite some time, the feeling of triumph and collective joy which the country has been deprived of for many years, not just on the sporting front, but simply in everyday walk of life,\" Jiwa said.\n\nArshad Nadeem of Pakistan and

throw of 84.62 meters, then won silver in the 2023 world championships, and became the first athlete from Pakistan to reach the final of any track and field event at the Olympic Games.\n\nHe has previously spoken about his difficulties in competing on the world stage as he had no state-of-the-art grounds or training facilities in a country not known for its track and field athletes.\n\nNadeem once aspired to be a cricketer before picking up javelin in 2015, describing the decision as \"the best thing that happened\" to him.\n\n\"I wouldn't be in the Olympics otherwise,\" he said.\n\nCricket holds an unofficial but prominent position as the national sport of Pakistan, resulting in increased funding and support.\n\nNadeem's win has shifted some focus from cricket to athletics in Pakistan and has sparked discussion on social media over the lack of resources for athletes competing internationally.\n\nPakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif congratulated Nadeem on his achievement, commenting on X, \"You've made the whole nation proud young man.\"", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sophia_saifi@cnn.com",

We are simple people and will celebrate with kheer (local rice pudding) and whatever Allah gives us, we are happy!\" he said.\n\nPeople danced to drums on the streets outside Nadeem's home, and his mother told local outlet Geo News: \"I am so happy, what can I tell you? I want to hug him and kiss him. He has made Pakistan's name proud, earned Pakistan a medal and made its flag fly proudly.\"\n\nNadeem shattered the Olympic record of 90.57 meters, set by Norway's Andreas Thorkildsen at Beijing 2008, with his second throw that almost made 93 meters.\n\nNadeem threw his arms into the air in celebration as the board confirmed the record-breaking throw, eliciting gasps of amazement from spectators.\n\n\"When I threw the javelin, I got the feel of it leaving my hand, and sensed it could be an Olympic record, inshallah (God willing),\" Nadeem said later.\n\nIn winning gold, Arshad defeated India's sporting hero and reigning world champion Neeraj Chopra, who took silver with a throw of 89.45, ahead of Grenada's Anderson Peters, who threw 88.54 meters for bronze.\n\nThe friendship between the top two medalists, Nadeem and Chopra, has defied the historic animosity between Pakistan and Indian sporting teams, and when the results were confirmed the two embraced each other, their flags wrapped around their shoulders.\n\nPakistan is now waiting for the moment that Nadeem stands atop the podium to receive his gold medal -- the country's first Olympic gold since its men's field hockey team won in Los Angeles in 1984.\n\nPakistan sports journalist Altamish Jiwa told CNN that Nadeem's gold was a \"humungous victory for all of Pakistan\" and one that had buoyed the nation's spirits.\n\n\"Nadeem has delivered the perfect gift which the nation has been waiting for quite some time, the feeling of triumph and collective joy which the country has been deprived of for many years, not just on the sporting front, but simply in everyday walk of life,\" Jiwa said.\n\nNadeem finished fifth at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, with a throw of 84.62 meters, then won silver in the 2023 world championships, and became the first athlete from Pakistan to reach the final of any track and field event at the Olympic Games.\n\nHe has previously spoken about his difficulties in competing on the world stage as he had no state-of-the-art grounds or training facilities in a country not known for its track and field athletes.\n\nNadeem once aspired to be a cricketer before picking up javelin in 2015, describing the decision as \"the best thing that happened\" to him.\n\n\"I wouldn't be in the Olympics otherwise,\" he said.\n\nCricket holds an unofficial but prominent position as the national sport of Pakistan, resulting in increased funding and support.\n\nNadeem's win has shifted some focus from cricket to athletics in Pakistan and has sparked discussion on social media over the lack of resources for athletes competing internationally.\n\nPakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif congratulated Nadeem on his achievement, commenting on X, \"You've made the whole nation proud young man.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

With a record-breaking throw of 92.97 meters, Nadeem not only set a new Olympic benchmark but also became a symbol of national resilience and determination. His victory was celebrated across Pakistan, with social media ablaze and the nation's leaders, journalists, and citizens showering him with praise.\n\nAmong the many voices of admiration, prominent Pakistani lawyer and activist Jibran Nasir's words stood out. Nasir, known for his advocacy and outspokenness, took to social media to acknowledge Nadeem's extraordinary achievement while also critiquing the support -- or lack thereof -- that the athlete received from his home country.\n\n\"It is your achievement, your hard work, your win,\" Nasir emphasized, highlighting that Nadeem's success was a result of his relentless dedication and determination. Nasir pointed out that Nadeem had \"beaten the best in the world who are afforded the best training facilities by their countries,\" underlining the challenges Nadeem faced in his journey to the top.\n\nHis message was clear: Nadeem's triumph was his alone, achieved despite the systemic shortcomings that have long plagued Pakistan's sports infrastructure.\n\nIn a powerful statement, Nasir declared, \"You owe Pakistan nothing but Pakistan owes you a lot.\" This sentiment resonated with many Pakistanis, who recognize the immense obstacles their athletes often face, from inadequate training facilities to limited financial support.\n\nBorn in Mian Channu, a small town in Punjab, he grew up with limited access to world-class training facilities. Yet, his talent and hard work propelled him to the global stage, where he stunned the world with his monumental throw of 92.97 meters on his second attempt, breaking the previous Olympic record set by Denmark's Andreas Thorkildsen in Beijing in 2008. His dominance in the event was further evidenced by his final attempt, where he threw 91.79 meters, solidifying his position at the top.\n\nNadeem's gold medal is a historic first for Pakistan in multiple ways: it's the country's first individual gold medal in the Olympics, its first track and field medal, and only the second time a South Asian athlete has reached the podium in a track and field event. The last time Pakistan secured an Olympic gold was in 1984, when the men's hockey team triumphed in Los Angeles.\n\nThe impact of Nadeem's victory was felt far beyond the sports community. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was quick to congratulate the athlete, tweeting, \"Bravo Arshad. History made!\" He added, \"You've made the whole nation proud, young man.\" This sentiment was echoed by many, with government officials, politicians, journalists, and citizens alike expressing their joy and pride in Nadeem's accomplishment.\n\nNadeem's win was also celebrated across borders, with Indian fans and sports enthusiasts acknowledging his feat, despite the intense sporting rivalry between the two nations.

He also became Pakistan's first Olympic gold medallist since the 1992 Barcelona Olympics.\n\nThe previous Olympic record was held by Norway's Andreas Thorkildsen who set it with his throw of 90.57m during the 2008 Beijing games. Nadeem ended up beating India's Neeraj Chopra by a good enough margin as Neeraj's best throw in the event reached 89.45m. Nadeem ended the night with another magnificent throw that reached 91.79m.\n\nFollowing the gold-medal haul, Akhtar shared a video on his social media handle congratulating Nadeem.\n\n\"Out of nowhere, this son of a lion has won Pakistan a gold medal. What a man you are Arshad! You have achieved this on your own, with your own hard-work and calibre. Many congratulations to you Arshad, and the whole of Pakistan. The entire mood of the country has changed with 1 gold medal.

But I don't want to appear too ambitious. If I have crossed 90 once, my next attempt is to touch 92'.\n\n'From the beginning, I just tell myself to keep a simple approach, make small changes and hope for the best, and it has worked out for me.'\n\nYesterday's glory wasn't a given either; Nadeem had secured gold at the Commonwealth Games two years ago with a throw which cleared 90m but his form had cooled since that summer.\n\nHe's also undergone more than one surgeries in recent years as his quest for Olympic gold was threatened by injury.\n\nThe 27-year-old claimed had the silver medal at the 2023 World Championships but went one better in Paris after a performance few in the Stade de France - or Pakistan - will ever forget.\n\nBut from the moment the javelin left his hand at 70mph, the attempt seemed an enormous one and the huge crowd at the Stade de France held its breath collectively as the projectile hung in the Paris air.\n\nThe throw, despite falling a few metres short of the world record, went down as the sixth longest of all time.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arshad_Nadeem", "type":

They compete at the highest level and do their best to improve their own performance and they also respect and admire each other,\" professor and political activist Taimur Rahman wrote on X.\n\nPakistanis, of course, are thrilled. They can't wait for the next Arshadabad, Arshad Papad, Arshad flyover to be built. But for now they revel in his success. For many, it was the \"greatest night in the history of Pakistan Olympics (in the 21st century).\"\n\nThe Pakistan People's Party-led Sindh government and Governor Kamran Tessori announced cash prizes totalling Rs 51 million for the athlete on Friday, Dawn reported. The Sindh government is also set to open a training academy in his name. Meanwhile, actor Ali Zafar announced a reward of Rs 1 million for Nadeem.\n\nBefore Thursday, only two Pakistani athletes had ever won individual medals: Mohammad Bashir's bronze in wrestling in 1960 and Hussain Shah's bronze in boxing in 1988.\n\nMany commentators and journalists like Abbas Nasir were quick to point out that he managed to bring \"gold glory\" to Pakistan all on his own, largely unsupported.\n\n\"Rich countries spend hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars in creating an Olympic-level athlete. Pakistan gets a gold out of the sheer determination of one man and the support of his family and community. The whole world should be in awe,\" political anthropologist Arsalan Khan said in a post on X.\n\nOn social media, Pakistan's cricketers, politicians, and celebrities are effusive in their congratulations for Nadeem.\n\n\"His persistence and perseverance have made him and the nation proud,\" former Prime Minister Imran Khan said in a statement shared on his X account. Pakistan's white ball captain Babar Azam congratulated Nadeem on his \"incredible achievement\".\n\nFans, however, were quick to point out that he did it with little support from the government.\n\nIn March, Nadeem had to approach the media to get a new javelin since he did not have money to buy one. It was only then that the government imported one for him. He had been using his old javelin for eight years.\n\n\"Pakistan's entire survival is a long continuous story of many Arshad Nadeems. People who give back to this place not because of, but despite the system which failed them,\" scholar Hamd Nawaz said in one post.\n\nOn social media, memes of Nadeem throwing both Pakistan's Chief of Army Staff Asim Munir and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif have started doing the rounds.\n\nAlso read: Coaches, doctors 'at fault', Vinesh a winner -- uncle Mahavir Phogat on wrestler's Olympic heartbreak\n\nThe third of seven siblings, Nadeem grew up in a small village near Mian Channu city in Pakistan Punjab, some 300 kilometres from Lahore.\n\n\"It would be a lucky day for the family if we ate anything more than lentils or vegetables,\" his brother Shahid told Al Jazeera in a phone interview.\n\nIn Paris, with the world's attention on him, Nadeem spoke about how he had wanted to be a cricketer but his brothers persuaded him to take up athletics.\n\n\"Many often ask me why even on track, I run as if I am fast bowling. I always wanted to be a cricketer, but many told me that it takes years and resources to be established. I decided to focus on javelin,\" he said in a press conference.\n\nIn 2014, when Nadeem first travelled to Lahore to participate in a youth festival, a friend suggested that he attend the athletics trials for the Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority. There was no looking back.\n\nBack in Nadeem's village, a host of people prayed in front of the TV that his father had set up for the match. Dawn reported people playing dhol in front of Nadeem's house, and his mother sharing sweets among those gathered.

We are proud of him,\" said Nadeem's 35-year-old brother, Muhammad Azeem. Men danced to the celebratory beat of a drum and others clapped and chanted slogans as it became clear he had won.\n\nThe women, meanwhile, sat crowded around a small TV inside Nadeem's home.\n\n|\"He had promised me that he would play well, go abroad, win a medal, and make Pakistan proud,\" his mother Raziah Parveen said straightforwardly. |\n\nDespite practising with rickety equipment and with little access to the gyms and training grounds his international competitors have, Nadeem had given Pakistan its first Olympic gold medal in 32 years.\n\n- First drawn to cricket - \"He belongs to Mian Channu.

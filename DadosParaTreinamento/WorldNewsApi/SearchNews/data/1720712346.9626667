{"id": 232012528, "title": "Records of Pompeii\u2019s survivors discovered", "text": "According to most modern accounts, the story pretty much ends there: Both cities were wiped out, their people frozen in time. It only picks up with the rediscovery of the cities and the excavations that started in earnest in the 1740s. But recent research has shifted the narrative. The story of the eruption of Mount Vesuvius is no longer one about annihilation; it also includes the stories of those who survived the eruption and went on to rebuild their lives. The search for survivors and their stories has dominated the past decade of my archaeological fieldwork, as I\u2019ve tried to figure out who might have escaped the eruption. Some of my findings are featured in an episode of the new PBS documentary, \u201cPompeii: The New Dig.\u201d Making it out alive Pompeii and Herculaneum were two wealthy cities on the coast of Italy just south of Naples. Pompeii was a community of about 30,000 people that hosted thriving industry and active political and financial networks. Herculaneum, with a population of about 5,000, had an active fishing fleet and a number of marble workshops. Both economies supported the villas of wealthy Romans in the surrounding countryside. In popular culture, the eruption is usually depicted as an apocalyptic event with no survivors: In episodes of the TV series \u201cDoctor Who\u201d and \u201cLoki,\u201d everyone in Pompeii and Herculaneum dies. But the evidence that people could have escaped was always there. The eruption itself continued for over 18 hours. The human remains found in each city account for only a fraction of their populations, and many objects you might have expected to have remained and be preserved in ash are missing: Carts and horses are gone from stables, ships missing from docks, and strongboxes cleaned out of money and jewelry. All of this suggests that many \u2013 if not most \u2013 of the people in the cities could have escaped if they fled early enough. Some archaeologists have always assumed that some people escaped. But searching for them has never been a priority. So I created a methodology to determine if survivors could be found. I took Roman names unique to Pompeii or Herculaneum \u2013 such as Numerius Popidius and Aulus Umbricius \u2013 and searched for people with those names who lived in surrounding communities in the period after the eruption. I also looked for additional evidence, such as improved infrastructure in neighboring communities to accommodate migrants. After eight years of scouring databases of tens of thousands of Roman inscriptions on places ranging from walls to tombstones, I found evidence of over 200 survivors in 12 cities. These municipalities are primarily in the general area of Pompeii. But they tended to be north of Mount Vesuvius, outside the zone of the greatest destruction. It seems as though most survivors stayed as close as they could to Pompeii. They preferred to settle with other survivors, and they relied on social and economic networks from their original cities as they resettled. Some migrants prosper Some of the families that escaped apparently went on to thrive in their new communities. The Caltilius family resettled in Ostia \u2013 what was then a major port city to the north of Pompeii, 18 miles from Rome. There, they founded a temple to the Egyptian deity Serapis. Serapis, who wore a basket of grain on his head to symbolize the bounty of the earth, was popular in harbor cities like Ostia dominated by the grain trade. Those cities also built a grand, expensive tomb complex decorated with inscriptions and large portraits of family members. Members of the Caltilius family married into another family of escapees, the Munatiuses. Together, they created a wealthy, successful extended family.", "summary": "<img src=\"https://www.rawstory.com/media-library/vivid-gladiator-fresco-discovered-at-pompeii.jpg?id=24839191&width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C1\"/><br/><br/><p><a href=\"https://www.routledge.com/Pliny-and-the-Eruption-of-Vesuvius/Foss/p/book/9781032225418\">On Aug. 24</a>, in A.D. 79, Mount Vesuvius erupted, shooting over 3 cubic miles of debris up to 20 miles (32.1 kilometers) in the air.

His best average at this point with the Los Angeles Angels was .319 during his rookie season in 2018.\n\nThe Dodgers have won 10 of 12. During that stretch, Ohtani has gone 15 of 47 with four home runs and 11 RBIs. That includes three hits and two RBIs in Saturday's game.\n\n\"I think with Shohei it just speaks to how comfortable he feels here with the Dodgers. How excited he is to play winning baseball,\" Roberts said. \"I think that the way he's been received, the way he's melded with our ballclub and how much the fans have embraced him, he feels it.\n\nI do believe that it translates into performance. I think he's having as much fun as he's ever had, and the play shows.\"\n\nOhtani does have 179 career home runs in the majors. He surpassed Hideki Matsui for most by a Japanese-born player earlier this month.

During that stretch, Ohtani has gone 15 of 47 with four home runs and 11 RBIs. That includes three hits and two RBIs in Saturday's game.\n\n'I think with Shohei it just speaks to how comfortable he feels here with the Dodgers.

He got a car.\"\n\nAfter Ohtani officially set the record, Roberts congratulated the two-way star and thanked him for the gift:\n\n\"Tonight, he passed me for the Japanese-born Dodger home run record,\" Roberts said as he stormed out of the clubhouse during Ohtani's postgame press conference. \"I just want to say congratulations and thank you very much. This is my car. The difference is Joe's [Kelly] car doesn't fit in my office. This car fits on my desk.\"\n\nThe toy Porsche that Ohtani gifted Roberts was a playful reference to the 29-year-old giving Joe Kelly's wife, Ashley, a real Porsche after the right-hander agreed to give up his No. 17 when he joined the Dodgers.\n\nAshley started an \"Ohtake17\" campaign on social media, offering to donate her husband's number if Ohtani signed with the Dodgers.\n\nEarlier this season, Ohtani broke the MLB record for most home runs hit by a Japanese-born player. It previously belonged to Hideki Matsui, who hit 175 home runs in his career during the regular season.", "source": {"uri": "s22927.pcdn.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dodger Blue"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_borelli@s22927.pcdn.co", "name": "Matt Borelli", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Roberts_(pitcher)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dave Roberts (pitcher)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Porsche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLB.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MLB.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideki_Matsui", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hideki Matsui"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Car_Rentals", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Car Rentals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Kit_Cars_and_Replicas", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Kit Cars and Replicas", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Image_Galleries", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Image Galleries", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Retail", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Retail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://dodgerblue-com.exactdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Shohei-Ohtani-66.jpg?strip=all&lossy=1&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540048", "eventUri": "eng-9540048", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 231, "relevance": 1}

Dodgers manager Dave Roberts hoped he might get a similar gift from Ohtani, but things did not work out quite as well for Roberts as he probably hoped.\n\nRoberts recently joked to Ohtani that he needed a new car, which the Japanese superstar was happy to help with. But instead of a six-figure sports car, Roberts received a tiny toy car with which he can play, as reported by the LA Times' Mike DiGiovanna.\n\n\"He did buy me a car,\" Roberts said. \"And I guess I didn't specify what type of car [I wanted]. So Shohei did bring in a nice little Porsche for me, so I can't say he never gave me anything.\"\n\nOhtani, for his part, said this may be just the beginning of his pranks.\n\n\"He said he wanted a car -- he got a car,\" Ohtani said. \"I'm glad he's happy. ... I like to make people laugh. I'm hoping I can do more of these.\"\n\nBefore Dave Roberts was a manager, he was a player. Roberts, who started his career in Cleveland, played for the Dodgers from 2002 to 2004, during which time he hit seven of his 23 career home runs. For nearly two decades, that mark of seven sat as a record for a Japanese-born Dodgers player. But when Ohtani signed his $700 million contract with the team in the winter, everyone could see Roberts' days as that record-holder were numbered.\n\nIn his six seasons with the Los Angeles Angels, Ohtani hit no fewer than seven home runs, and the only season in which his home run total was in single digits was when he played 44 games in a COVID-shortened year. Ohtani did get off to a relatively slow start with the Dodgers, though, as he had not hit a home run and had batting splits of .242 AVG / .297 OBP / .333 SLG / .631 OPS through his first eight games.\n\nIn Game 9, on April 3 against the San Francisco Giants, things clicked. Ohtani smashed a ball to right field for his first home run as a Dodger before pulling one just inside the foul pole against the Chicago Cubs in the very next game.\n\nOhtani tied Roberts' record of seven home runs back on April 26 with a homer amid boos from Toronto Blue Jays fans. And on Saturday, more than week after tying Roberts' record, Ohtani broke it with a blast to right field. Roberts and Ohtani both laughed as Ohtani trotted around the bases before high-fiving when they met on the steps of the Dodgers' dugout.\n\nAfter the game, Ohtani admitted he was \"relieved\" to have broken the record.\n\nThe Dodgers hope Ohtani will break many more records wearing Dodger Blue over the next decade, but more importantly, win a few World Series championships along the way.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "preston_byers@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Preston Byers", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Roberts_(pitcher)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dave Roberts (pitcher)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Kelly_(pitcher)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Kelly (pitcher)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Angels", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Angels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "On-base percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dugout_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dugout (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Blue Jays"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Image_Galleries", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Image Galleries", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Shohei-Ohtani-pulls-hilarious-Porsche-prank-on-Dave-Roberts-after-latest-home-run-feat.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540048", "eventUri": "eng-9540048", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-03", "textStart": 1890, "textEnd": 1897}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-26", "textStart": 2169, "textEnd": 2177}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 225, "relevance": 1}

(Roberts was born on a U.S. military base in Okinawa.)\n\nAfter Ohtani passed Hideki Matsui on April 21 for the most homers in MLB history by a Japanese-born player with his 176th, he deadpanned that he now had his sights set on Roberts' record.\n\nIn their back-and-forth with reporters since then, Ohtani and Roberts were both asked about the possibility of the slugger giving his manager a gift to commemorate the historic occasion. Roberts suggested a new car might be appropriate.\n\nBefore Saturday's game against the Atlanta Braves - with the pair tied at seven homers apiece - Roberts got the car.\n\nLater that evening, Ohtani got the record.\n\nHis solo shot in the bottom of the third inning off the Braves' Bryce Elder was his eighth of the season. And the torch was officially passed.\n\n\"He said he wanted a car,\" Ohtani said through translator Will Ireton. \"I'm glad he's happy. He got a car.\"\n\nSo what was the significance of the Porsche?\n\nIn this meticulously detailed timeline from MLB.com, we're reminded that when Ohtani signed with the Dodgers, reliever Joe Kelly had Ohtani's preferred jersey No. 17.\n\nAs a thank you gift for giving up his number, Kelly and his wife Ashley received a brand new Porsche courtesy of his new teammate.\n\nSo even though no one could blame Roberts for trying, he had to settle for a miniature version instead.\n\n\"I just want to say congratulations and thank you very much,\" Roberts said, the toy car in his hand after the game. \"This is my car. The difference is Joe's car doesn't fit in my office. This car fits on my desk.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Shohei Ohtani gives Dave Roberts toy Porsche before breaking HR mark", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steve_gardner@aol.com", "name": "Steve Gardner", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Roberts_(pitcher)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dave Roberts (pitcher)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Porsche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideki_Matsui", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hideki Matsui"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Kelly_(pitcher)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Kelly (pitcher)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLB.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MLB.com"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines_and_E-zines", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines and E-zines", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Toys_and_Games", "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Toys and Games", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Kit_Cars_and_Replicas", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Kit Cars and Replicas", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Image_Galleries", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Image Galleries", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/qVIipFq5Ev0M9Dvlm3UDbA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_usatoday_us_articles_590/3c9c6626e576c8b1272794257fc6edc3", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540048", "eventUri": "eng-9540048", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-21", "textStart": 613, "textEnd": 621}], "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 220, "relevance": 1}

He arrived knowing his next home run would be a meaningful one. The \"history\" at stake was more of the fun-fact variety, but the Los Angeles Dodgers star saw an opportunity.\n\nNo Japanese-born player in Dodgers history had more home runs for the franchise than Dave Roberts, Ohtani's new manager. Roberts, the former speedy outfielder slugged seven long balls in his 1,043 at-bats with Los Angeles. The fact delighted Ohtani so much that as the designated hitter completed his first month with his new club, he'd bring up his pursuit of that mark in conversation. Roberts added to the fun, goading his new superstar and making a quip whenever Ohtani hit one to the warning track this past week. Roberts openly pondered the gifts he'd receive when Ohtani inevitably broke the mark.\n\n\"I need a new car,\" Roberts said, alluding to the $700 million man's sponsorship deal with Porsche.\n\nSo Ohtani brought him a car, sort of. He was stoic as he strode into his manager's office before Saturday's game against the Atlanta Braves and then revealed the gift: a mauve toy Porsche Taycan. It was the same model car that Ohtani had gifted Joe Kelly's wife, Ashley, back in December for the rights to the No. 17 (though Kelly received an actual car as a gift).\n\n\"He did buy me a car,\" Roberts said in his reveal Saturday. \"And I guess I didn't specify what type of car. So Shohei did bring in a nice little Porsche for me, so I can't say he never gave me anything.\"\n\nOf all the presents Roberts has ever received from a player, this gift, he said, \"is probably at the top (of the list).\"\n\nThen, Ohtani went and broke the record by hitting his eighth home run in his second at-bat of the night (and his 136th at-bat as a Dodger), sending a Bryce Elder fastball into the right-field seats. As Ohtani rounded third base, he motioned to the dugout as if to apologize. Roberts beamed.\n\nThe Dodgers rolled again, taking their 10th win in their last 12 contests in an 11-2 beatdown against their fellow National League power. As Ohtani spoke after the game, Roberts busted out of the clubhouse, toy car in hand. The two laughed their way through recounting the prank.\n\n\"He said he wanted a car,\" Ohtani said through interpreter Will Ireton. \"I'm glad he's happy. He got a car.\"\n\nAsked if Roberts could get a car that actually, you know, drives, Ohtani laughed again.\n\n\"If we win the World Series, I'll think about it,\" Ohtani said.\n\nThe moment of levity reflected a growing reality amongst Dodgers officials, who have raved about how accessible their new superstar has become in the wake of Ippei Mizuhara's firing. The former interpreter, who has been charged with stealing at least $16 million from Ohtani's accounts to pay off gambling debts, has long served as Ohtani's intermediary and de facto manager. A week after Mizuhara's firing, Roberts said a \"barrier\" had been removed from his club and Ohtani.\n\n\"I think that Shohei is having as much fun as he's had in baseball,\" Roberts said this week. He's engaged with teammates, talking through scouting reports and engaging in typical banter in the dugout.

The game featured a series of homers from the Dodgers offense, including one by Japanese sensation Shohei Ohtani.\n\nIn the third inning, Ohtani hit his eighth homer of the season, setting a new record for the most home runs by a Japanese-born player in Dodgers history. The record was previously held by the Dodgers current manager Dave Roberts having hit seven homers for the franchise from 2002 to 2004.\n\nRoberts was born in Okinawa, Japan to an American father and a Japanese mother. Before Ohtani broke his record, the Dodgers manager joked that the two-way superstar should buy him a Porsche when he broke his record.\n\nShohei Ohtani did buy a Porsche for Roberts, which turned out to be a toy model catching the skipper off-guard.\n\n\"He said he wanted a car and I'm glad he was happy that he got a car,\" Ohtani said through interpreter Will Ireton. \"I like to make people laugh and I'm hoping to do more of these.\"\n\nDuring Shohei Ohtani's post-game interview, Dave Roberts congratulated him for breaking the record while also showcasing the toy Porsche.\n\n\"I've received different gifts from players but this is right at the top for sure,\" Roberts said (via AP News).\n\nHowever, in December 2023, Shohei Ohtani gave a real Porsche to Ashley Kelly, Joe Kelly's wife as a thank-you gesture. Dodgers pitcher Joe Kelly gave up his No. 17 jersey to Ohtani, which had been previously promised by Kelly's wife on social media.\n\nDave Roberts notices some similarities between Shohei Ohtani and Barry Bonds\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers designated hitter Shohei Ohtani, boasting three All-Stars, two AL MVPs, two Silver Slugger awards and numerous other achievements, is considered a future all-time great.\n\nRecently talking about Ohtani, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts pointed out some things about the 29-year-old similar to all-time legend Barry Bonds.\n\nAccording to Bob Nightengale of USA Today, Roberts said:\n\n\"I'm not saying that Ohtani is Barry (Bonds), but when I played against Barry, it was like he was always looming. Ohtani is just like that. I can't imagine the stress it puts on opposing teams knowing that he's looming. He's always there.

He arrived knowing his next home run would be a meaningful one. The \"history\" at stake was more of the fun-fact variety, but the Los Angeles Dodgers star saw an opportunity.\n\nNo Japanese-born player in Dodgers history had more home runs for the franchise than Dave Roberts, Ohtani's new manager. Roberts, the former speedy outfielder slugged seven long balls in his 1,043 at-bats with Los Angeles. The fact delighted Ohtani so much that as the designated hitter completed his first month with his new club, he'd bring up his pursuit of that mark in conversation. Roberts added to the fun, goading his new superstar and making a quip whenever Ohtani hit one to the warning track this past week. Roberts openly pondered the gifts he'd receive when Ohtani inevitably broke the mark.\n\n\"I need a new car,\" Roberts said, alluding to the $700 million man's sponsorship deal with Porsche.\n\nSo Ohtani brought him a car, sort of. He was stoic as he strode into his manager's office before Saturday's game against the Atlanta Braves and then revealed the gift: a mauve toy Porsche Panamera. It was the same model car that Ohtani had gifted Joe Kelly's wife, Ashley, back in December for the rights to the No. 17 (though Kelly received an actual car as a gift).\n\n\"He did buy me a car,\" Roberts said in his reveal Saturday. \"And I guess I didn't specify what type of car. So Shohei did bring in a nice little Porsche for me, so I can't say he never gave me anything.\"\n\nOf all the presents Roberts has ever received from a player, this gift, he said, \"is probably at the top (of the list).\"\n\nThen, Ohtani went and broke the record by hitting his eighth home run in his second at-bat of the night (and his 136th at-bat as a Dodger), sending a Bryce Elder fastball into the right-field seats. As Ohtani rounded third base, he motioned to the dugout as if to apologize. Roberts beamed.\n\nThe Dodgers rolled again, taking their 10th win in their last 12 contests in an 11-2 beatdown against their fellow National League power. As Ohtani spoke after the game, Roberts busted out of the clubhouse, toy car in hand. The two laughed their way through recounting the prank.\n\n\"He said he wanted a car,\" Ohtani said through interpreter Will Ireton. \"I'm glad he's happy. He got a car.\"\n\nAsked if Roberts could get a car that actually, you know, drives, Ohtani laughed again.\n\n\"If we win the World Series, I'll think about it,\" Ohtani said.\n\nThe moment of levity reflected a growing reality amongst Dodgers officials, who have raved about how accessible their new superstar has become in the wake of Ippei Mizuhara's firing. The former interpreter, who has been charged with stealing at least $16 million from Ohtani's accounts to pay off gambling debts, has long served as Ohtani's intermediary and de facto manager. A week after Mizuhara's firing, Roberts said a \"barrier\" had been removed from his club and Ohtani.\n\n\"I think that Shohei is having as much fun as he's had in baseball,\" Roberts said this week. He's engaged with teammates, talking through scouting reports and engaging in typical banter in the dugout. He's publicly raved about his new environment, saying he's \"impressed\" by how quickly the Dodgers have turned the corner after a middling start. Ohtani showed flashes of his personality during his six years with the Los Angeles Angels but his comfort level within a month of calling Dodger Stadium home has been noteworthy.\n\nHis play has been energized. Through Saturday, he's hitting .345 with a 1.044 OPS.\n\n\"He understands and appreciates the magnitude of every game, every play,\" Roberts said. \"So I think that's something that excites him, and just being around this environment of people with that same mind experience, I think he's thriving, I really do.\"\n\nSo too, have his pranks, like his spoof with his manager.\n\n\"I like to make people laugh,\" Ohtani said. \"I'm hoping I can do more of these.\"", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fabian_ardaya@theathletic.com", "name": "Fabian Ardaya", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Roberts_(pitcher)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dave Roberts (pitcher)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Porsche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warning_track", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warning track"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Designated hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Kelly_(pitcher)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Kelly (pitcher)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dugout_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dugout (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Angels", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Angels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodger_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dodger Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scout (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines_and_E-zines", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines and E-zines", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Kit_Cars_and_Replicas", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Kit Cars and Replicas", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Image_Galleries", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Image Galleries", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/05/04224331/AP24126097097058-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540048", "eventUri": "eng-9540048", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

(Roberts was born on a U.S. military base in Okinawa.)\n\nAfter Ohtani passed Hideki Matsui on April 21 for the most homers in MLB history by a Japanese-born player with his 176th, he deadpanned that he now had his sights set on Roberts' record.\n\nIn their back-and-forth with reporters since then, Ohtani and Roberts were both asked about the possibility of the slugger giving his manager a gift to commemorate the historic occasion. Roberts suggested a new car might be appropriate.\n\nBefore Saturday's game against the Atlanta Braves - with the pair tied at seven homers apiece - Roberts got the car.\n\nLater that evening, Ohtani got the record.\n\nHis solo shot in the bottom of the third inning off the Braves' Bryce Elder was his eighth of the season. And the torch was officially passed.\n\n\"He said he wanted a car,\" Ohtani said through translator Will Ireton. \"I'm glad he's happy. He got a car.\"\n\nSo what was the significance of the Porsche?\n\nIn this meticulously detailed timeline from MLB.com, we're reminded that when Ohtani signed with the Dodgers, reliever Joe Kelly had Ohtani's preferred jersey No. 17.\n\nAs a thank you gift for giving up his number, Kelly and his wife Ashley received a brand new Porsche courtesy of his new teammate.\n\nSo even though no one could blame Roberts for trying, he had to settle for a miniature version instead.\n\n\"I just want to say congratulations and thank you very much,\" Roberts said, the toy car in his hand after the game. \"This is my car.

That he could also lead in runs scored (he has led his league three times) with Shohei Ohtani, Freddie Freeman and Will Smith batting behind him is certainly conceivable.\n\nBut how is the player batting in front of two-time MVP Ohtani (who led the majors in OPS and the American League in home runs last season) leading the majors in walks?\n\n\"That's a great question,\" Dodgers president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman said.\n\n\"I don't think it is intentional that pitchers want to walk him. I think he has a really good eye coupled with really good bat-to-ball skills so he can spoil some really good pitches and buy himself another pitch and then they don't execute.\"\n\nBetts said he was unaware of his walk total. But it didn't make sense to him either that pitchers were putting him on base so frequently with Ohtani looming on deck.\n\n\"That sounds weird. That sounds really weird,\" Betts said. \"I didn't know (that he led the majors in walks). ... It's just being the best I can be, trying to get a good pitch to hit. That's only right now. It's just a month in. A lot of things change obviously. But right now it's helping us win ballgames.\"\n\nBetts' willingness to take so many walks is just another facet of an MVP-caliber start to his season, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. And Roberts doesn't think Ohtani's presence behind him in the lineup is a factor one way or the other, saying that is \"overplayed\" in discussing lineup construction.\n\n\"Because the pitchers, certainly in Mookie Betts' case, are going to attack him and try to get him out the best way they can, regardless of who's hitting behind him,\" Roberts said. \"So for Mookie to value the on-base, controlling the strike zone, which we talk about, speaks to when it's in the strike zone, he's getting hits. And when it's not, he'll take his walk.\n\n\"A couple things (are factors in his walk total). He posts. He plays every day. He's at the top of the order, and he just conducts professional at-bats. And that's a perfect recipe for an MVP-type player.\"\n\nPORSCHE PLAN\n\nAs Shohei Ohtani neared his franchise record for the most home runs hit by a Japanese-born player, Roberts joked that Ohtani should gift him a Porsche when he breaks the record - as Ohtani gifted Joe Kelly's wife for her support in getting uniform number 17 (previously Joe Kelly's number).\n\nOhtani tied Roberts when he hit his seventh home run of the season last weekend in Toronto and Saturday he presented Roberts with a brand new Porsche.\n\n\"It's on my desk as we speak,\" Roberts said.\n\nThe gift was a miniature, toy version of a Porsche Taycan.\n\n\"So I can't say he never gave me anything,\" Roberts said.\n\nRight-hander Blake Treinen has completed his rehab assignment with Triple-A Oklahoma City and joined the Dodgers for the weekend series against the Atlanta Braves. Roberts said it looks \"promising\" that Treinen could be activated from the Injured List on Sunday.\n\nTreinen has not pitched in a major-league game since Sept. 2022. He underwent shoulder surgery that November and missed all of the 2023 season (though he made three appearances in the minor leagues on a rehab assignment). He was set to open the season on the Dodgers' active roster this spring but was struck by a line drive during a Cactus League game in the final days of spring training.\n\nALSO\n\nOutfielder Jason Heyward took batting practice on the field with the team during Saturday's pre-game workout. It was Heyward's first time hitting on the field since he went on the IL with a lower back strain. He hasn't played since March 30.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBraves (LHP Max Fried, 2-0, 4.02 ERA) at Dodgers (LHP James Paxton, 3-0, 3.51 ERA), Sunday, 1:10 p.m. PT, SportsNet LA, 570 AM", "source": {"uri":

This has nothing to do with October.\n\nYet make no mistake, the Dodgers' weekend sweep of the Atlanta Braves at a rollicking Dodger Stadium was a fair predictor of an entirely different sort of October.\n\nAn October with Shohei Ohtani.\n\nGoodness, the imagination soars, like a 464-foot blast into the lunging grasps of the pavilion partiers.\n\nMy, the possibilities seem endless, like a 412-foot rocket that disappears over the center-field fence.\n\nOhtani authored both moments during Sunday's 5-1 sweeping victory, once again leaving witnesses searching for adjectives.\n\n\"He just keeps doing things that we haven't seen before,\" said Dodgers manager Dave Roberts.\n\nLeading this team to its first full-season title in 36 years would qualify as something else few have seen before, wouldn't it?\n\nHeavens, the potential is enormous.\n\nOhtani, who was elsewhere while the Dodgers were failing in 10 of their previous 11 postseasons, filled his first playoff atmosphere here with ohhs and ahhs and oh yeahs.\n\nOhh, he wrecked the pitching staff of the team with baseball's best record for eight hits in 12 at-bats with three home runs and six RBIs in the three games.\n\nAhh, he had a game-tying single in extra innings on Friday, a tone-setting homer on Saturday, and two homers among his four hits on Sunday.\n\nOh yeah, he signed with the Dodgers this winter because he wanted to experience the sort of playoff setting that eluded him during six years in Anaheim, so it only figures he would soak it all in.\n\nI asked him after Sunday's game if he could feel the big-game atmosphere.\n\n\"Yeah, very much so,\" he said through interpreter Will Ireton.\n\nHe was asked what it feels like to hit a ball 464 feet, the longest Dodgers homer this season, a leadoff shot in the eighth inning that landed deep in the left-center field seats.\n\n\"Slug is part of my game,\" Ohtani said. \"So being able to express that in a game situation like that ... is important as well.\"\n\n\"That's deep, people don't hit the ball out there,\" said Roberts when asked about those traveling 464 feet.\n\nEqually as deep is a Dodgers roster dotted with key new players who do not bear the dark stain of postseasons past.\n\nThis Dodger team has a new pitcher, James Paxson, who is now 4-0 with a 3.06 ERA after throwing five strong innings Sunday.\n\nPaxson has a 3.46 postseason ERA in three starts for the New York Yankees, so he understands the importance of this weekend's furor.\n\n\"We played really well,\" he said. \"We showed how well we can play against a really good team.\"\n\nThis Dodgers team also has a new outfielder, Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez , who hit his eighth homer Sunday and has equaled Ohtani's 25 RBIs.\n\nHern\u00e1ndez has two homers in four postseason games, so he also seems suited for the big stage.\n\n\"With our offense, every game is winnable,\" Roberts said.\n\nWith Ohtani in the middle of it all, every game this weekend felt like a victory from the first pitch to Randy Newman. The Dodgers outscored the Braves 20-6 and trailed for only brief spells in what amounted to a three-day fiesta capped by Sunday's Cinco de Mayo roars.\n\n\"I saw signs of postseason ... it was good to see our guys play to the level and energy that the fans had this series,\" Roberts said.\n\nOhtani said the feeling was contagious.\n\n\"I just feel like we're overall playing really well, so that's really helping me have quality at-bats and just feeling good overall,\" he said.\n\nThe scary part for opponents is that both of his Sunday home runs were essentially opposite-field hits, which means his bat has discovered its mojo.\n\n\"When I feel confident that I can hit in that direction, then I know I can cover other pitches really well,\" Ohtani said.\n\nPaxson explained that in human terms.\n\n\"He's awesome,\" the pitcher said with a gasp. \"So much power.\"\n\nThe Dodgers could have used that power last October when they were swept by the Arizona Diamondbacks in a series in which they never led.\n\nThe Dodgers could have used that slug two postseasons ago when they couldn't score in a four-game loss to the San Diego Padres.\n\nAnd, yes, certainly, they will need every bit of Ohtani this fall if they once again meet the Braves. They are 3-1 against Atlanta during their postseason run, but it is the Braves who delivered the most recent blow with a four-games-to-two triumph in the 2021 National League Championship Series.\n\nIt's far too early to be forecasting a rematch. It's way too reckless to be celebrating a May sweep.\n\nYet as this weekend proved, it's not too early to start believing.\n\nFor the last 11 years, the Dodgers didn't have anyone like Shohei Ohtani.", "source": {"uri": "miamiherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Miami Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bill_plaschke@miamiherald.com", "name": "Bill Plaschke", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodger_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dodger Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadoff_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leadoff hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra_innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extra innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaheim,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anaheim, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Anaheim, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teoscar_Hern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F\u00e9lix_Hern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "F\u00e9lix Hern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Diamondbacks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Diamondbacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/brqigv/picture288338920/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/b84ca897-f1ae-45df-a6f0-2d74ecf3a5b2", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540048", "eventUri": "eng-9540048", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

The Los Angeles Dodgers swept the Atlanta Braves at Dodgers Stadium. Shohei Ohtani was the star of the series. He went 8-for-12, scoring five runs, six RBIs and three home runs in three games.\n\nOhtani went into MVP mode in the last game, going 4-for-4 against Ronald Acuna Jr.-led Braves. His three RBIs and two runs helped the Dodgers win 5-1. However, his two homers against the Braves' lefty pitchers were the game's highlights.\n\nLHPs Max Fried and A.J.

His remaining stats (25 RBIs, 30 runs and seven steals) are also noteworthy.\n\nHe passed manager Dave Roberts (7) for most home runs for the Dodgers by a Japanese player. He is the leader of MLB's all-time home run-scorer as a Japan-born player, passing MLB legend Hideki Matsui (175).\n\nShohei Ohtani is focusing on bringing his best for the Dodgers\n\nIn his post-game interview on 6th May with Sportsnet LA, Ohtani spoke about his contribution to the LA Dodgers' victory against the Braves.\n\n\"It's just really riding on the momentum and lead off of that,\" Ohtani said through his interpreter Will Ireton. \"It is my first time facing him [Max Fried], so it was just really trying to feel him out, but most importantly just making sure that I am swinging and getting my best swings.\"\n\n\"I am just swinging at pitches I am supposed to. So, it's a good sign that the ball is going in that direction.\"\n\nEntering Monday, the Dodgers are the NL West leader with a 23-13 record, followed by San Deigo Padres (18-19).

The Dodgers outscored the Braves 20-6 and trailed for only brief spells in what amounted to a three-day fiesta capped by Sunday's Cinco de Mayo roars.\n\n\"I saw signs of postseason ... it was good to see our guys play to the level and energy that the fans had this series,\" Roberts said.\n\nOhtani said the feeling was contagious.\n\n\"I just feel like we're overall playing really well, so that's really helping me have quality at-bats and just feeling good overall,\" he said.\n\nThe scary part for opponents is that both of his Sunday home runs were essentially opposite-field hits, which means his bat has discovered its mojo.\n\n\"When I feel confident that I can hit in that direction, then I know I can cover other pitches really well,\" Ohtani said.\n\nPaxson explained that in human terms.\n\n\"He's awesome,\" the pitcher said with a gasp. \"So much power.\"\n\nThe Dodgers could have used that power last October when they were swept by the Arizona Diamondbacks in a series in which they never led.\n\nThe Dodgers could have used that slug two postseasons ago when they couldn't score in a four-game loss to the San Diego Padres.\n\nAnd, yes, certainly, they will need every bit of Ohtani this fall if they once again meet the Braves. They are 3-1 against Atlanta during their postseason run, but it is the Braves who delivered the most recent blow with a four-games-to-two triumph in the 2021 National League Championship Series.\n\nIt's far too early to be forecasting a rematch. It's way too reckless to be celebrating a May sweep.\n\nYet as this weekend proved, it's not too early to start believing.\n\nFor the last 11 years, the Dodgers didn't have anyone like Shohei Ohtani.", "source": {"uri": "todayheadline.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "TodayHeadline"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodger_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dodger Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadoff_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leadoff hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra_innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extra innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaheim,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anaheim, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Anaheim, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teoscar_Hern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F\u00e9lix_Hern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "F\u00e9lix Hern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Diamondbacks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Diamondbacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2.wp.com/todayheadline.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/urlhttps3A2F2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com2Fe32F4b2Fca6c771147989b8a7a6b56f723bd2Fbraves-dodgers-baseball-40208-1024x538.jpg?ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540048", "eventUri": "eng-9540048", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

Mandatory Credit: Kiyoshi Mio-USA TODAY Sports\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani dazzled on Sunday with an epic day at the plate.\n\nThe two-way superstar mashed two home runs, including one that went over 460 feet! The Dodgers swept the Atlanta Braves, one of the top contenders in the National League, and Ohtani's offensive production was a crucial reason why.\n\nOhtani's first home run clubbed on the day kept his hot streak going. The two-time American League Most Valuable Player has hit homers in back-to-back games.\n\nThen, Ohtani went and mashed one again. This time, it went even further. Ohtani blasted one 464 feet into the seats at Dodger Stadium! It was quite the epic blast, and everyone watching knew it off the bat.\n\nOhtani tends to play at this elite level, so it's no surprise to see him do well. But it's sure as heck fun to watch. Ohtani is one of the best players in baseball today, if not the very best, due to his outstanding strengths.

This can't be confused with October. This has nothing to do with October.\n\nGoodness, the imagination soars, like a 464-foot blast into the lunging grasps of the pavilion partiers.\n\nMy, the possibilities seem endless, like a 412-foot rocket that disappears over the center-field fence.\n\nOhtani authored both moments during Sunday's 5-1 sweeping victory, once again leaving witnesses searching for adjectives.\n\nRead more: Shohei Ohtani hits two homers as Dodgers sweep the Braves\n\n\"He just keeps doing things that we haven't seen before,\" said Dodgers manager Dave Roberts.\n\nLeading this team to its first full-season title in 36 years would qualify as something else few have seen before, wouldn't it?\n\nHeavens, the potential is enormous.\n\nOhtani, who was elsewhere while the Dodgers were failing in 10 of their previous 11 postseasons, filled his first playoff atmosphere here with ohhs and ahhs and oh yeahs.\n\nOhh, he wrecked the pitching staff of the team with baseball's best record for eight hits in 12 at-bats with three home runs and six RBIs in the three games.\n\nAhh, he had a game-tying single in extra innings on Friday, a tone-setting homer on Saturday, and two homers among his four hits on Sunday.\n\nOh yeah, he signed with the Dodgers this winter because he wanted to experience the sort of playoff setting that eluded him during six years in Anaheim, so it only figures he would soak it all in.\n\nI asked him after Sunday's game if he could feel the big-game atmosphere.\n\n\"Yeah, very much so,\" he said through interpreter Will Ireton.\n\nHe was asked what it feels like to hit a ball 464 feet, the longest Dodgers homer this season, a leadoff shot in the eighth inning that landed deep in the left-center field seats.\n\n\"Slug is part of my game,\" Ohtani said. \"So being able to express that in a game situation like that ... is important as well.\"\n\n\"That's deep, people don't hit the ball out there,\" said Roberts when asked about those traveling 464 feet.\n\nEqually as deep is a Dodgers roster dotted with key new players who do not bear the dark stain of postseasons past.\n\nThis Dodger team has a new pitcher, James Paxson, who is now 4-0 with a 3.06 ERA after throwing five strong innings Sunday.\n\nPaxson has a 3.46 postseason ERA in three starts for the New York Yankees, so he understands the importance of this weekend's furor.\n\nRead more: Dodgers closer Evan Phillips put on 15-day injured list\n\n\"We played really well,\" he said. \"We showed how well we can play against a really good team.\"\n\nThis Dodgers team also has a new outfielder, Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez , who hit his eighth homer Sunday and has equaled Ohtani's 25 RBIs.\n\nHern\u00e1ndez has two homers in four postseason games, so he also seems suited for the big stage.\n\n\"With our offense, every game is winnable,\" Roberts said.\n\nWith Ohtani in the middle of it all, every game this weekend felt like a victory from the first pitch to Randy Newman. The Dodgers outscored the Braves 20-6 and trailed for only brief spells in what amounted to a three-day fiesta capped by Sunday's Cinco de Mayo roars.\n\n\"I saw signs of postseason ... it was good to see our guys play to the level and energy that the fans had this series,\" Roberts said.\n\nOhtani said the feeling was contagious.\n\n\"I just feel like we're overall playing really well, so that's really helping me have quality at-bats and just feeling good overall,\" he said.\n\nThe scary part for opponents is that both of his Sunday home runs were essentially opposite-field hits, which means his bat has discovered its mojo.\n\n\"When I feel confident that I can hit in that direction, then I know I can cover other pitches really well,\" Ohtani said.\n\nPaxson explained that in human terms.\n\n\"He's awesome,\" the pitcher said with a gasp. \"So much power.\"\n\nThe Dodgers could have used that power last October when they were swept by the Arizona Diamondbacks in a series in which they never led.\n\nThe Dodgers could have used that slug two postseasons ago when they couldn't score in a four-game loss to the San Diego Padres.\n\nAnd, yes, certainly, they will need every bit of Ohtani this fall if they once again meet the Braves. They are 3-1 against Atlanta during their postseason run, but it is the Braves who delivered the most recent blow with a four-games-to-two triumph in the 2021 National League Championship Series.\n\nIt's far too early to be forecasting a rematch. It's way too reckless to be celebrating a May sweep.\n\nYet as this weekend proved, it's not too early to start believing.\n\nFor the last 11 years, the Dodgers didn't have anyone like Shohei Ohtani.\n\nNow they do, and anything is possible.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra_innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extra innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadoff_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leadoff hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaheim,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anaheim, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Anaheim, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teoscar_Hern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F\u00e9lix_Hern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "F\u00e9lix Hern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Diamondbacks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Diamondbacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/la_times_articles_853/ba9660540697a6a26a9b500ac806b96d", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540048", "eventUri": "eng-9540048", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

He also has never posted more hits (52), runs (30), total bases (98) or notched a better batting average (.364), on-base percentage (.426) or slugging percentage (.685) through 35 contests in his career.\n\nThe Dodgers gave Ohtani a 10-year, $700 million contract in free agency last offseason in hopes he'd continue to be the two-way superstar\n\nOhtani won't pitch until next year, but he already might be worth the Dodgers' investment solely from his offensive production so far.\n\nOhtani and the Dodgers return to the field Monday to begin a three-game series against the Miami Marlins, who own the second-fewest wins in the National League with a 10-26 record.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_dierberger@si.com", "name": "Tom Dierberger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra-base_hit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extra-base hit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Center fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Double (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_bases", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Total bases"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "On-base percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3484,h_1959,x_0,y_361/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si-temp/01hx5j2m2h61pq1xr6pj", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540048", "eventUri": "eng-9540048", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

This can't be confused with October. This has nothing to do with October.\n\nYet make no mistake, the Dodgers' weekend sweep of the Atlanta Braves at a rollicking Dodger Stadium was a fair predictor of an entirely different sort of October.\n\nAn October with Shohei Ohtani.\n\nGoodness, the imagination soars, like a 464-foot blast into the lunging grasps of the pavilion partiers.\n\nMy, the possibilities seem endless, like a 412-foot rocket that disappears over the center-field fence.\n\nOhtani authored both moments during Sunday's 5-1 sweeping victory, once again leaving witnesses searching for adjectives.\n\n\"He just keeps doing things that we haven't seen before,\" said Dodgers manager Dave Roberts.\n\nLeading this team to its first full-season title in 36 years would qualify as something else few have seen before, wouldn't it?\n\nHeavens, the potential is enormous.\n\nOhtani, who was elsewhere while the Dodgers were failing in 10 of their previous 11 postseasons, filled his first playoff atmosphere here with ohhs and ahhs and oh yeahs.\n\nOhhh, he wrecked the pitching staff of the team with baseball's best record for eight hits in 12 at-bats with three home runs and six RBIs in the three games.\n\nAhhh, he had a game-tying single in extra innings on Friday, a tone-setting homer on Saturday, and two homers among his four hits on Sunday.\n\nOh yeah, he signed with the Dodgers this winter because he wanted to experience the sort of playoff setting that eluded him during six years in Anaheim, so it only figures he would soak it all in.\n\nI asked him after Sunday's game if he could feel the big-game atmosphere.\n\n\"Yeah, very much so,\" he said through interpreter Will Ireton.\n\nHe was asked what it feels like to hit a ball 464 feet, the longest Dodger homer this season, a leadoff shot in the eighth inning that landed deep in the left-center field seats.\n\n\"Slug is part of my game,\" Ohtani said. \"So being able to express that in a game situation like that ... is important as well.\"\n\n\"That's deep, people don't hit the ball out there,\" said Roberts when asked about those traveling 464 feet.\n\nEqually as deep is a Dodgers roster dotted with key new players who do not bear the dark stain of postseasons past.\n\nThis Dodger team has a new pitcher, James Paxson, who is now 4-0 with a 3.06 ERA after throwing five strong innings Sunday.\n\nPaxson has a 3.46 postseason ERA in three starts for the New York Yankees, so he understands the importance of this weekend's furor.\n\n\"We played really well,\" he said. \"We showed how well we can play against a really good team.\"\n\nThis Dodgers team also has a new outfielder, Teoscar Hernandez, who hit his eighth homer Sunday and has equaled Ohtani's 25 RBIs.\n\nHernandez has two homers in four postseason games, so he also seems suited for the big stage.\n\n\"With our offense, every game is winnable,\" said Roberts.\n\nWith Ohtani in the middle of it all, every game this weekend felt like a victory from the first pitch to Randy Newman. The Dodgers outscored the Braves 20-6 and trailed for only brief spells in what amounted to a three-day fiesta capped by Sunday's Cinco de Mayo roars.\n\n\"I saw signs of postseason ... it was good to see our guys play to the level and energy that the fans had this series,\" said Roberts.\n\nOhtani said the feeling was contagious.\n\n\"I just feel like we're overall playing really well, so that's really helping me have quality at-bats and just feeling good overall,\" he said.\n\nThe scary part for opponents is that both of his Sunday home runs were essentially opposite-field hits, which means his bat has discovered its mojo.\n\n\"When I feel confident that I can hit in that direction, then I know I can cover other pitches really well,\" said Ohtani.\n\nPaxson explained that in human terms.\n\n\"He's awesome,\" the pitcher said with a gasp. \"So much power.\"\n\nThe Dodgers could have used that power last October when they were swept by the Arizona Diamondbacks in a series in which they never led.\n\nThe Dodgers could have used that slug two postseasons ago when they couldn't score in a four-game loss to the San Diego Padres.\n\nAnd, yes, certainly, they will need every bit of Ohtani this fall if they once again meet the Braves. They are 3-1 against Atlanta during their postseason run, but it is the Braves who delivered the most recent blow with a four-games-to-two triumph in the 2021 National League Championship Series.\n\nIt's far too early to be forecasting a rematch. It's way too reckless to be celebrating a May sweep.\n\nYet as this weekend proved, it's not too early to start believing.\n\nFor the last 11 years, the Dodgers didn't have anyone like Shohei Ohtani.", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodger_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dodger Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadoff_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leadoff hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra_innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extra innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaheim,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anaheim, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Anaheim, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teoscar_Hern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F\u00e9lix_Hern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "F\u00e9lix Hern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Diamondbacks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Diamondbacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/355bca9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7996x4498+0+417/resize/1200x675!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe3%2F4b%2Fca6c771147989b8a7a6b56f723bd%2Fbraves-dodgers-baseball-40208.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540048", "eventUri": "eng-9540048", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Shotime produced a multi-home run game against Atlanta as LA took game 3 of the series 5-1.\n\nShohei Ohtani reflected on the series win and his offensive production in the post-game interview with Kirsten Watson of Sportsnet LA. When asked about his back-to-back home run games, Ohtani said:\n\n\"It's just really riding on the momentum and lead off of that. \"\n\nKirsten asked Ohtani about how he read the play by an in-form Max Fried as he raked in three of his four hits against the Braves starting pitcher. He replied:\n\n\"It is my first time facing him, so it was just really trying to feel him out, but most importantly just making sure that I am swinging and getting my best swings.\"\n\nShohei Ohtani also reflected on his third-longest home run, which he smashed in the bottom of the eighth inning against A.J. Minter:\n\n\"I am just swinging at pitches I am supposed to. So, its a good sign that the ball is going in that direction.\"\n\nFinally, Shotime reflected on the overall team production after the LA Dodgers won their fourth straight regular season of the season:\n\n\"It's a really good sign that we are able to play our best baseball against a really good team, so looking forward to continuing that.\"\n\nTake a look at the complete on-field post-game reflection by Shohei Ohtani here:\n\nIt was not just the Dodgers offense and defense, but the amazing output by the bullpen in all three games of the series against a strong Braves unit.

He recorded two singles and totaled three RBIs as part of his 4 for 4 performance.\n\nShortstop Mookie Betts walked to lead off the bottom of the first. Ohtani then walked to the plate. Braves starter Max Fried missed the strike zone with a fastball to start the exchange.\n\nHe then earned a 1-2 lead in the count. He threw two curveballs to end the exchange. The latter, a 74.6-mph offering, dropped near the middle of the strike zone.\n\nOhtani belted that ball 104.3 mph to center field for his ninth homer of the season.\n\nHe singled in his next two at-bats, including a leadoff hit in the sixth. Outfielder Teoscar Hernandez hit a 406-foot, two-run homer two at-bats later for a 4-0 Dodgers lead.\n\nDesignated hitter Marcell Ozuna hit a 373-foot solo shot in the top of the seventh for the Braves' lone run.\n\nOhtani returned for his second homer in the eighth. The Braves brought in relief pitcher A.J. Minter to replace Fried for that exchange. Minter tossed a 93.8-mph fastball right down the middle, resulting in the 464-foot bomb.\n\nDodgers relief pitcher Michael Grove retired the Braves in order in the next inning to end the game. Starter James Paxton allowed five hits and one run over 6 2/3 innings to improve for 4-0 this season.\n\nFried allowed four hits and four runs over seven innings to drop to 2-1. Ozuna went 2 for 4 with an RBI and run scored for the Braves.\n\nOhtani is now hitting an MLB-best .364. He also leads the league with 52 hits, 14 doubles and 98 total bases. His 10 home runs are tied with Baltimore Orioles shortstop Gunnar Henderson for the most in baseball.\n\nThe Dodgers (23-13) sit in first place in the National League West, 5.5 games in front of the second-place San Diego Padres (18-19).

However, it's still early, and things can change throughout the season.\n\nBraves designated hitter Marcell Ozuna shares the NL lead with 10 homers. However, he trails Ohtani in every other major category other than RBI.\n\nMeanwhile, Philadelphia Phillies third baseman Alec Bohm is the only one close to Ohtani in batting average, sporting a .360 mark. The next-closest is Dodgers teammate Mookie Betts at .352.\n\nIf Ohtani continues to clobber these types of homers while also hitting for contact, not only could he win MVP, but Los Angeles could be lifting hardware in October.

I don't know if he did this or did that,\" Rose said. \"I don't know if Ohtani loves to gamble or not; I guess his interpreter liked to gamble.\"\n\nRose believes prosecution could force Mizuhari to \"sing like a canary\", which could reveal even more information about the scandal.

In the last half-decade, gambling has become almost irrevocably intertwined with the sport, as promotions and more continue to blur the lines.\n\nRose said he understands why some players might be drawn to break the rules:\n\n\"I can see the temptations for players based on how easy it is. You can go to the ballpark now and go up to a window at the ballpark and bet on the game. No bookmakers are involved. It's all legal, which I don't know if it's good or bad for the game.

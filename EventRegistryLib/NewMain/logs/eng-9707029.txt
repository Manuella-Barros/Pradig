The parade, which kicked off from Marine Drive, ended at the Wankhede Stadium.\n\nAn ocean of humanity greeted the victory parade in South Mumbai's Marine Drive as thousands of passionate fans gathered to catch a glimpse of their favourite stars, bringing the traffic to a complete standstill.\n\nThe open bus parade, which was delayed by more than a couple of hours, started from the National Centre for Performing Arts (NCPA) in Nariman Point post 7:30pm and went till the Wankhede Stadium.\n\nThe distance is covered usually in five minutes but it took more than one-and-a-half-hour as the players savoured the evening of their lives all drenched, not in rain but unadulterated love from their die-hard fans.\n\nRohit Sharma thanked Mumbai for the turnout, \"The huge turnout of fans to welcome the Indian cricket team shows they were as desperate for this T20 World Cup title as the players,\" he said.\n\nOutgoing coach Rahul Dravid expressed his gratitude, stating, \"I am going to miss this love. What I saw on the streets tonight, I won't forget it.\"\n\nVirat Kohli reflected on the emotional impact of the victory, saying, \"I couldn't connect with the emotions of seniors who cried after the 2011 World Cup triumph, but now I do.\" He also observed, \"This is the first time in 15 years that I have seen Rohit show so much emotion.\"\n\n\"When we were climbing those steps (at Kensington Oval) he was crying and I was crying,\" Kohli added.\n\nIndia pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah expressed, \"What I saw today, I have never seen anything like this before,\" following the parade.\n\nThen there was Hardik Pandya, who probably found organic acceptance, after a stellar T20 World Cup campaign as he was the first to lift the trophy and show it to the fans.\n\nThe once jeered 'Mumbai Indian' was the cheered 'Indian' in Mumbai.\n\nThe 'Maximum City' was ready to shower 'Maximum Love' for the colourful 'Baroda Bomber', who has made Mumbai his home.\n\nHe craved for validation and unconditional love and Mumbai was now ready to embrace him once again.\n\nBCCI office-bearers presented Team India with a cheque of Rs 125 crores. The BCCI had announced the prize money for the team after the T20 World Cup.\n\nDuring the parade, both Rohit and Kohli lifted the World Cup together on the bus as fans applauded them. The mood in the Indian camp was euphoric as they soaked in the celebrations from the fans.\n\nIt was a special moment for the 37-year-old Rohit, who is a Mumbaikar and a huge fan favourite in the city.\n\nIn 2007, Rohit Sharma was the youngest member of the Mahendra Singh Dhoni's epoch-making squad and now at 37, for him to lead his T20 World Champion Indian cricket team on a victory parade must have given him a sense of deja vu.\n\nHe is now the oldest member of this current team, 'been there and done that' and even as the faces around him changed in more than one-and-a-half decades, the now-retired Indian T20 skipper remained a constant for all these years.\n\nAs the bus passed through the sea of human, his mind must have travelled back to that September morning in 2007 when Mumbai was as drenched as it was on Thursday evening.\n\nChants of \"Mumbaicha Raja Kaun? Rohit Sharma\" (Who's the King of Mumbai? Rohit Sharma) reverberated through the roads.\n\nDravid was also seen applauding the fans, while many players had covered themselves with the national flag and were enjoying the scenes. Plenty of security personnel were present with the bus for safety reasons.\n\nThe Wankhede Stadium was thrown open to fans, who filled the stands within minutes to celebrate the Indian cricket team's title triumph last Saturday.", "source": {"uri": "newindianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New Indian Express"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wankhede_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wankhede Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardik_Pandya", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hardik Pandya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasprit_Bumrah", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jasprit Bumrah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensington_Oval", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kensington Oval"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_Control_for_Cricket_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Board of Control for Cricket in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Dravid", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Dravid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vadodara", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vadodara"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vadodara"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MS Dhoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flag of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media.assettype.com/newindianexpress%2F2024-07%2F612f4418-4a04-4c7d-a406-1f0fbfc87b3f%2FNew_Project__83_.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9707029", "eventUri": "eng-9707029", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

The Indian team led by Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli had a gala time in Mumbai, specifically at the packed Marine Drive and Wankhede Stadium where the fans gathered in numbers to get a glimpse of the stars.\n\nThe Indian team took an open-bus parade through the Marine Drive and then celebrated with dance, and music inside the iconic Wankhede where India had won their ODI World Cup title in 2011 under the captaincy of MS Dhoni.\n\nThe likes of Rahul Dravid, Rohit Sharma and Suryakumar Yadav let it loose, while senior batter Virat Kohli was seen in his usual energetic aura. The Indian team had returned home early morning fro Barbados and had landed in New Delhi. After meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the team had flown out to Mumbai where celebrations were planned.\n\nHere are the top 10 moments from Team India's celebrations in Mumbai.\n\nTeam India landed in Mumbai via the Vistara flight from New Delhi. The flight had a special call sign - UK1845 - which included the jersey numbers of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma who retired from T20Is after India's title win.\n\nThe World Champions received a Water Salute in the Mumbai airport, a ceremony which is performed as a symbol of respect and honour for the aircraft and its crew.\n\nTeam India asked Hardik Pandya to lead the Indian team out of the airport. With his swanky sunglasses and swagger, Pandya lifted the T20 World Cup trophy in one hand and walked out of the airport amidst massive chants.\n\nThe Marine Drive came to a standstill as fans gathered in numbers for India's open-bus parade. Mumbai Police were forced to issue a traffic advisory to the citizens ahead of Team India's celebrations. The police wrote on Twitter that citizens are requested to avoid commuting towards Marine Drive.\n\nFans climbed trees and traffic signals to get a closer look at the victorious Indian team. The T20 World Cup champions celebrated their win with an open-bus parade at the Marine Drive in Mumbai.\n\nRahul Dravid and Virat Kohli were in jubilant mood in Mumbai's open bus parade. Dravid, who quite reserved in general let it loose during India's trophy celebrations.\n\nTEAM DANCES TO CHAK DE INDIA\n\nVirat Kohli and Rohit Sharma led the celebration inside the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai as India danced to the tunes of Chak de India on Thursday.\n\nAn emotional Virat Kohli spoke about his most cherished memory in his T20I career at the Wankhede Stadium. Virat Kohli shared his heartfelt sentiments and said that he was in tears alongside Rohit Sharma after India's T20 World Cup win in Barbados.\n\n\"Rohit and I, we've been trying this for so long. We always wanted to win a World Cup. Bringing the trophy back to Wankhede is a very special feeling. We have been playing for the last 15 years and this is the first time I've seen Rohit so emotional - he was crying, I was crying, a hug between both of us - I will never forget that day,\" Kohli said.\n\nHardik Pandya was in tears as outgoing captain Rohit Sharma credited Hardik Pandya for bowling a superb last over in the final of the T20 World Cup 2024. Pandya was emotional after listening to Sharma's speech at the Wankhede Stadium.\n\nRohit said that Pandya's ability to remain cool and calm helped India dismiss David Miller, who the side considered as one of the most dangerous players in the world.\n\n\"Mumbai never disappoints. We got a solid reception. On behalf of the team, we would like to thank the fans. I am very very happy and relieved,\" One of the most applauded moments was when the Indian skipper praised his deputy, Hardik Pandya, for his crucial performance in the final over of the T20 World Cup.\n\n\"Hats off to him to bowl that last over. No matter how many runs you need, there's always so much pressure to bowl that over. Hats off to him,\" said the skipper, prompting chants of \"Hardik! Hardik!\" from the crowd.

Thousands of passionate fans gathered to catch a glimpse of their favorite stars, transforming the streets into a sea of cheering supporters.\n\nThe open bus parade, which started from Nariman Point's National Centre for Performing Arts (NCPA) after a delay, commenced around 7:30 pm and proceeded towards Wankhede Stadium. Normally a five-minute journey, the parade took over an hour and a half as players soaked in the overwhelming love and adulation from their devoted fans, rather than rain.\n\nAlso read: T20 WC champions' victory parade: Internet stunned as fan spotted on tree close to Team India's bus (WATCH)\n\nAt Wankhede Stadium, following their T20 World Cup victory, the team sang the National Anthem. BCCI officials presented Team India with a Rs 125 crore cheque, prompting fans to erupt in singing Vande Mataram. The celebrations included an impromptu dance by Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, and others, adding to the festive atmosphere.\n\nT20 World Cup trophy belongs to the nation: Rohit Sharma\n\nFor Rohit Sharma, who was the youngest member of Mahendra Singh Dhoni's iconic 2007 squad and now leads the T20 World Champion Indian cricket team at 37, the victory parade must have evoked a strong sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. As the oldest member of the current team, he has been a constant presence over the past fifteen years, witnessing changes around him while maintaining his leadership role.\n\nAmid chants of \"Mumbaicha Raja, Rohit Sharma\" (\"Who's the King of Mumbai? Rohit Sharma\"), the bus journey through the throngs surely brought back memories of Mumbai's rainy September morning in 2007, marking another memorable milestone in his illustrious career.\n\n\"This (crowd) tells that the desperation we had to win was similar to the desperation which the fans had. The win has brought smiles on faces of crores of people. This is a special team and this trophy belongs to the nation,\" Rohit said while addressing the fans inside the stadium.\n\nNever seen Rohit so emotional in 15 years: Virat Kohli\n\nMeanwhile, Virat Kohli, addressing the packed audience at Wankhede during the team's felicitation ceremony, shared that he had never seen Rohit Sharma so emotional in their 15-year association. He recalled the moment Rohit hugged him, tears in his eyes, after the T20 World Cup victory.\n\n\"This is the first time in 15 years that I have seen Rohit show so much emotion. When we were climbing those steps (at Kensington Oval) he was crying and I was crying,\" Kohli said during the ceremony after a memorable open bus victory parade.\n\nAt the same venue years ago, a 21-year-old Kohli had expressed that it was only fitting to lift the maestro Sachin Tendulkar on their shoulders after he had carried the weight of Indian cricket for 21 years.\n\nNow at 35, standing once more on the revered turf, Kohli, who recently announced his retirement from the shortest format after clinching the trophy, expressed his hope that he and his captain had shouldered the responsibility well for 15 years and successfully brought the Cup home.\n\n\"I hope we (Rohit and I) have carried the burden and no better to bring it (trophy) back here (Wankhede),\" said Kohli, who knew during the innings break of the final that this was his last game.\n\nAs the youngest member of the class of 2011, he witnessed Sachin Tendulkar, Harbhajan Singh, and Yuvraj Singh overcome with emotion, their tears flowing freely. At that time, perhaps he didn't fully grasp where all that emotion came from. But now, he does.\n\n\"I couldn't connect with the emotions of the senior players who cried that night but now I do,\" said Indian cricket team's current elder statesman.\n\nRedemption for Hardik Pandya\n\nHardik Pandya found genuine acceptance following his stellar T20 World Cup campaign, notably being the first to lift the trophy and proudly display it to the fans.\n\nOnce scorned as a \"Mumbai Indian,\" he was now embraced by Mumbai as simply \"Indian.\" The city's fervent passion overflowed for the charismatic \"Baroda Bomber,\" now a beloved resident who has found a home in Mumbai.\n\nSeeking validation and unconditional support, Pandya found Mumbai ready to embrace him once more, perhaps seeing the rainfall as a collective apology for earlier criticisms during the IPL season.\n\nThe players soaked in the frenzy and nationwide euphoria, a testament to the country's deep affection for its cricketers, sometimes even surpassing its love for the sport itself.\n\nFans eagerly awaited a glimpse of Virat Kohli, reminiscent of the lines penned by Majrooh Sultanpuri, \"Bekararon ki Dawa Ek Nazar, Ek Nazar,\" capturing the sentiments of those who had traveled from Virar to Thane and beyond just to witness the celebrations.\n\nThe King did not disappoint. Leading the way, he joined the skipper, Suryakumar Yadav, and Axar Patel in a lively dance to the beats of Nashik Dholwalas at Wankhede Stadium upon their arrival, further elevating the jubilant atmosphere.\n\nEarlier, the Indian team departed from New Delhi around 3:42 pm after a breakfast meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, having returned from Barbados in the early hours.\n\nAt Wankhede Stadium, gates were quickly opened for eager fans who filled the stands within minutes to celebrate the team's victorious championship.\n\nUpon landing at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport's Terminal 2, their aircraft received the traditional 'Water Salute'.\n\nExiting the airport amidst a sea of fans and media who had been waiting for several hours, the players were greeted with overwhelming enthusiasm.\n\nAlso read: BCCI presents 'Namo 1' Champions jersey to PM Modi after his meeting with T20 WC-winning team; pic goes viral\n\nDespite intermittent rain, high humidity, and logistical challenges, thousands of fans remained glued to their seats at the stadium, entertained by a DJ playing songs spanning various genres. At one point, it resembled a festive rain-dance party as Wankhede's speakers blared hits like the Vengaboys' \"To Brazil\" and the unofficial sports anthem of the country, \"Chak de India\".\n\nWankhede Stadium soon reverberated with familiar chants of 'Sachin... Sachin' and 'Mumbaicha Raja, Rohit Sharma!', followed by resounding cries of 'India... India', marking the vibrant celebration of the team's success.", "source": {"uri": "newsable.asianetnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asianet News Network Pvt Ltd"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The two-hour open bus parade, which was delayed by two hours, started from the National Centre for Performing Arts (NCPA) in Nariman Point at 7:30pm and went till the Wankhede Stadium.\n\nThe distance is covered usually in five minutes but it took more than an hour as the players savoured the evening of their lives all drenched -- not in rain but unadulterated love from their die-hard fans. In 2007, Rohit Sharma was the youngest member of the Mahendra Singh Dhoni's epoch-making squad and now at 37, for him to lead his T20 World Champion Indian cricket team on a victory parade must have given him a sense of deja vu.\n\nHe is now the oldest member of this current team, 'been there and done that' and even as the faces around him changed in more than one-and-a-half decades, the now-retired Indian T20 skipper remained a constant for all these years.\n\nAs the bus passed through the sea of human, his mind must have travelled back to that September morning in 2007 when Mumbai was as drenched as it was on Thursday evening.\n\nChants of \"Mumbaicha Raja Kaun? Rohit Sharma\" (Who's the King of Mumbai? Rohit Sharma) reverberated through the roads.\n\n\"This (crowd) tells that the desperation we had to win was similar to the desperation which the fans had. The win has brought smiles on faces of crores of people. This is a special team and this trophy belongs to the nation,\" Rohit said while addressing the fans inside the stadium.\n\nThen there was Hardik Pandya, who probably found organic acceptance, after a stellar T20 World Cup campaign as he was the first to lift the trophy and show it to the fans.\n\nThe once jeered 'Mumbai Indian' was the cheered 'Indian' in Mumbai. The 'Maximum City' was ready to shower 'Maximum Love' for the colourful 'Baroda Bomber', who has made Mumbai his home.\n\nHe craved for validation and unconditional love and Mumbaikar were now ready to embrace him.\n\nMay be the those drops from the heaven were Mumbai's collective apology for being boorish towards Pandya.\n\nThe players lapped up, the frenzy, mass euphoria for a nation that loves its cricketers way more than the game itself.\n\nA glimpse of Virat Kohli was what many would have longed for.\n\n'Bekararon ki Dawa Ek Nazar, Ek Nazar', Majrooh Sultanpuri would have penned for all those who have travelled from Virar to Thane to just feel the pulse.\n\nThe King didn't disappointed. In fact, he pulled skipper along with Suryakumar Yadav and Axar Patel to dance to the beats of famous Nashik Dholwalas at Wankhede.\n\nEarlier, the Indian team could only fly from New Delhi around 3:42 pm after a breakfast meeting with the Indian PM Narendra Modi, having returned from Barbados in the wee hours of morning.\n\nThe Wankhede Stadium here was thrown open to fans, who filled up the stands within minutes to celebrate the team's title triumph.\n\nAfter landing in the city, their aircraft got the famous 'Water Salute' at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport's Terminal 2.\n\nThe players walked out of the airport with a sea of fans and media waiting for them for several hours.\n\nMeanwhile, as the gates closed amid intermittent rain, extreme humidity and chaos of several thousand people remained fixated to their seats despite lack of arrangement for food and water.\n\nThe DJ kept entertaining fans with songs of all genres and at one instance it felt like Wankhede was hosting a rain-dance party with the stadium's speakers blurting out Vengaboys' party hit 'To Brazil' and country's unofficial sports anthem \"Chak de India\".\n\nSoon after, Wankhede came alive with its customary chants of 'Sachin...

But it was a completely different scenario at the streets of 'Maximum City' when Mumbai halted to salute Team India's Victory Parade.\n\nAn ocean of humanity greeted the victory parade of the T20 World Cup winning Indian team in South Mumbai's Marine Drive as thousands of passionate fans gathered to catch a glimpse of their favourite stars, bringing the traffic to a complete standstill. The two-hour open bus parade, which was delayed by two hours, started from the National Centre for Performing Arts (NCPA) in Nariman Point at 7:30pm and went till the Wankhede Stadium.\n\nThe distance is covered usually in five minutes but it took more than an hour as the players savoured the evening of their lives all drenched -- not in rain but unadulterated love from their die-hard fans. In 2007, Rohit Sharma was the youngest member of the Mahendra Singh Dhoni's epoch-making squad and now at 37, for him to lead his T20 World Champion Indian cricket team on a victory parade must have given him a sense of deja vu.\n\nHe is now the oldest member of this current team, 'been there and done that' and even as the faces around him changed in more than one-and-a-half decades, the now-retired Indian T20 skipper remained a constant for all these years.\n\nAs the bus passed through the sea of human, his mind must have travelled back to that September morning in 2007 when Mumbai was as drenched as it was on Thursday evening.\n\nChants of \"Mumbaicha Raja Kaun? Rohit Sharma\" (Who's the King of Mumbai? Rohit Sharma) reverberated through the roads.\n\n\"This (crowd) tells that the desperation we had to win was similar to the desperation which the fans had. The win has brought smiles on faces of crores of people. This is a special team and this trophy belongs to the nation,\" Rohit said while addressing the fans inside the stadium.\n\nThen there was Hardik Pandya, who probably found organic acceptance, after a stellar T20 World Cup campaign as he was the first to lift the trophy and show it to the fans.\n\nThe once jeered 'Mumbai Indian' was the cheered 'Indian' in Mumbai. The 'Maximum City' was ready to shower 'Maximum Love' for the colourful 'Baroda Bomber', who has made Mumbai his home.\n\nHe craved for validation and unconditional love and Mumbaikar were now ready to embrace him.\n\nMay be the those drops from the heaven were Mumbai's collective apology for being boorish towards Pandya.\n\nThe players lapped up, the frenzy, mass euphoria for a nation that loves its cricketers way more than the game itself.\n\nA glimpse of Virat Kohli was what many would have longed for.\n\n'Bekararon ki Dawa Ek Nazar, Ek Nazar', Majrooh Sultanpuri would have penned for all those who have travelled from Virar to Thane to just feel the pulse.\n\nThe King didn't disappoint. In fact, he pulled skipper along with Suryakumar Yadav and Axar Patel to dance to the beats of famous Nashik Dholwalas at Wankhede.\n\nEarlier, the Indian team could only fly from New Delhi around 3:42 pm after a breakfast meeting with the Indian PM Narendra Modi, having returned from Barbados in the wee hours of morning.\n\nThe Wankhede Stadium here was thrown open to fans, who filled up the stands within minutes to celebrate the team's title triumph.\n\nAfter landing in the city, their aircraft got the famous Water Salute at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport's Terminal 2.\n\nThe players walked out of the airport with a sea of fans and media waiting for them for several hours.\n\nMeanwhile, as the gates closed amid intermittent rain, extreme humidity and chaos of several thousand people remained fixated to their seats despite lack of arrangement for food and water.\n\nThe DJ kept entertaining fans with songs of all genres and at one instance it felt like Wankhede was hosting a rain-dance party with the speakers blurting out country's unofficial sports anthem \"Chak de India\".", "source": {"uri": "moneycontrol.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The 'Maximum City' was ready to shower 'Maximum Love' for the colourful 'Baroda Bomber', who has made Mumbai his home.\n\nHe craved for validation and unconditional love and Mumbaikar were now ready to embrace him.\n\nMay be the those drops from the heaven were Mumbai's collective apology for being boorish towards Pandya.\n\nThe players lapped up, the frenzy, mass euphoria for a nation that loves its", "source": {"uri": "english.metrovaartha.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "metrovaartha.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Centre_for_the_Performing_Arts_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Centre for the Performing Arts (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wankhede_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wankhede Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Drive,_Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marine Drive, Mumbai"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nariman_Point", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nariman Point"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nariman Point"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MS Dhoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardik_Pandya", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hardik Pandya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vadodara", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vadodara"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vadodara"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Advaita_Vedanta", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Advaita Vedanta", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://media.assettype.com/metrovaartha-en%2F2024-07%2F9e25fbf9-8886-46ae-9af0-a1789fa3fd42%2Fmv8_04_07_2024_21_59_19.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9707029", "eventUri": "eng-9707029", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

AP\n\nThe Indian cricket team landed from Barbados in the early hours of Thursday morning to monsoon showers, heavy security deployment and received a euphoric reception. Team India clinched their first ICC title in 11 years on Saturday and first World Cup trophy since 2011. It was also India's second T20 World Cup triumph after 2007.\n\nTeam India victory celebration: As it happened\n\nThe day involved meet and greets with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, fans, officials, an open-bus parade in Mumbai and a ceremony at the Wankhede Stadium.\n\nThe team were unable to head back home immediately after the title win due to a shutdown forced by Hurricane Beryl in Barbados. They were held up in their hotel before the BCCI secretary Jay Shah made arrangements for a special charter flight.\n\nThe Air India special charter flight AIC24WC \u00e2\u20ac\" Air India Champions 24 World Cup \u00e2\u20ac\" which left Barbados around 4:50am local time on Wednesday arrived in Delhi at 6am (IST) on Thursday after a 16-hour non-stop journey.\n\nHeavy security was deployed to keep the crowd in check at the Indira Gandhi International airport but that did little to dampen the spirits as fans cheered enthusiastically holding up posters of Virat Kohli, captain Rohit Sharma and outgoing head coach Rahul Dravid.\n\nThe players trickled out in ones and twos after completing immigration formalities.\n\nTired but excited, they acknowledged the waiting fans by waving at them and flashing warm smiles.\n\nSuryakumar Yadav, who took the sensational match-winning catch of David Miller in the final, was the most animated in responding to the cheering.\n\nRishabh Pant, who returned to international cricket after a life-threatening car accident, saluted the gathered crowd, while pacer Mohammed Siraj blew flying kisses in their direction.\n\nRohit Sharma and Player of the Final Virat Kohli, both of whom retired from T20Is at the end of India's campaign, were among the last to come out of the VIP exit.\n\nRohit raised the coveted trophy for the fans to catch a glimpse before boarding the bus. Kohli, on his part, gave a thumbs up to acknowledge the support.\n\nIn their excitement to see their heroes in person, some fans claimed that they had been waiting outside the airport since last night.\n\n\"We have been here since last night. It was very important for us to win this World Cup after losing the ODI World Cup last year,\" a group of fans said.\n\nTwo buses were stationed outside the T3 Terminal to ferry the players to ITC Maurya Sheraton, where they were greeted by dhol and traditional Bhangra dancers.\n\nMost of them, including Rohit, all-rounder Hardik Pandya, Suryakumar Yadav and Rishabh Pant, shook a leg with the assembled dancers, giving them a memory of a lifetime.\n\nEven the on-duty security personnel had smiles on their faces as the players let their hair down after the long journey, shook hands with everyone who wanted to and moved into their rooms after cutting a cake that was kept ready for them.\n\nAll of this unfolded amid expected media frenzy. A brief while later, they left to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi at his residence .\n\nAt 7 Lok Kalyan Marg, Indian cricket team members, wearing jerseys that said \"Champions\", posed alongside PM Modi at his residence with the T20 World Cup trophy in hands.\n\nThe Indian team were accompanied by BCCI secretary Jay Shah and president Roger Binny for the ceremony. The duo presented the Prime Minister with a special \"Namo 1\" jersey in India colours.\n\nIn the over an hour long stay, the team shared their feelings and how they fought back from tough situations while speaking with PM Modi.\n\nPM Modi asked Rohit how the pitch tasted after the skipper was seen chewing a piece of the turf. Kohli, who had struggled for runs going into the final, was asked what was his thought process going into the final. Axar Patel was asked how he felt when he was promoted up the order against South Africa.\n\nWankhede, Marine Drive witness another night of frenzied celebrations\n\nThe Indian team landed at Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport at 5.28 pm, with Rohit and the rest of the team along with support staff and BCCI officials boarding a special Air Vistara flight UK 1845 that departed from the national capital at 3.42 pm.\n\nWhat made their arrival in the 'Maximum City' even more special was the fact that the aircraft they arrived in received a special water salute at the airport, with a team of airport ground staff guiding the plane towards the terminal in a set of three vehicles, one of which had an individual waving the tricolour.\n\nMumbai's iconic Marine Drive, meanwhile, was chock-a-block even before the Men in Blue had left the airport, and it took more than an hour for the players and support staff to leave the airport.\n\nAs a result, unlike the previous victory parade that was accorded to MS Dhoni and his team after their triumph in the inaugural edition of the T20 World Cup in 2007, Rohit and Co's parade and subsequent felicitation at the Wankhede Stadium took place after sunset.\n\nMarine Drive live up to its nickname of the 'Queen's Necklace' as it looked spectacular with its bright lights against the backdrop of the Mumbai skyline and the black abyss that was the Arabian Sea.\n\nThe open-top bus carrying the Indian players and support staff as well as top BCCI officials such as BCCI secretary Jay Shah and vice-president Rajeev Shukla \u00e2\u20ac\" all of whom were clad in blue jerseys \u00e2\u20ac\" moved at a snail's pace through the packed Marine Drive, with the highlight of the parade being skipper Rohit and fellow batting stalwart Kohli raising the trophy in celebration at the front of the bus.\n\nThe players were then greeted with massive roar at the Wankhede Stadium that was packed to the rafters \u00e2\u20ac\" the kind of turnout that one would normally witness for matches. Emotional speeches from Rohit, Kohli, Player of the Tournament Jasprit Bumrah as well as outgoing head coach Rahul Dravid were followed by the team finally receiving the cheque of Rs 125 crore from the board.\n\nTeam India then performed a lap of honour around the Wankhede with the trophy, similar to the scenes after India's triumph over Sri Lanka in the final of the 2011 World Cup, with Rohit, Kohli and the rest of the players breaking into impromptu jigs .", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

However, their departure was delayed due to Hurricane Beryl and they finally managed to leave the island nation on Wednesday night through a special Air India flight arranged by the BCCI. The flight landed in New Delhi on Thursday (July 4) morning.\n\nA huge number of fans waited for the Indian team outside the airport as well as the team hotel in the national capital. The Indian team met Prime Minister Narendra Modi at his residence in Delhi and gifted him a special jersey before leaving for Mumbai to attend the victory parade.\n\nEven before the Indian team could reach Marine drive for the victory parade, thousands of fans swarmed the venue to catch a glimpse of the World Cup winners. The parade, however, was delayed by more than two hours as the team arrived late in Mumbai.\n\nHowever, the delay did not affect the fans much as they waited desperately for their heroes. The parade finally began around 7:30 pm and the atmosphere became electric in no time. The fans went crazy as soon as they saw the Indian team on the open-top bus.\n\nThe players were seen waving to the fans before Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli gave them a moment to savour. The India batting superstars lifted the trophy together in front of the ecstatic fans during the parade. Both Kohli and Rohit have announced their retirement from T20Is after the World Cup victory.\n\nThe victory parade will end at the Wankhede Stadium where the BCCI will facilitate the players. The remarkable win in the ninth edition of the T20 World Cup ended India's long wait for the World Cup trophy and the jubilant celebrations from the fans and the team just show how desperate they were for this victory especially after the heartbreak in the ODI World Cup last year.\n\nIndia had suffered a heartbreaking defeat in the final of the World Cup last year before finally making amends in the T20 World Cup. It is India's first World Cup across formats since the victory in the 2011 World Cup.", "source": {"uri": "cricketaddictor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketAddictor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_Control_for_Cricket_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Board of Control for Cricket in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_India", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Air India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbados", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wankhede_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wankhede Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20 International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing_List_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing List Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://static.cricketaddictor.com/images/2024/Virat%20Kohli%20Rohit%20Sharma.jpg?q=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9707029", "eventUri": "eng-9707029", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 513, "textEnd": 519}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

The victory parade began at the Marine Drive and ended at the Wankhede Stadium. Inside the stadium, the BCCI had scheduled a felicitation event for the winning Indian team.\n\nBefore the felicitation event, the Indian team decided to parade the trophy around the stadium. And as soon as the players reached the fence, Rohit Sharma started dancing and dragged Virat Kohli as well, as the two veterans pulled off some bhangra steps. After seeing the senior pros dancing their heart out, the other members of the Indian team joined the celebrations as well, much to the delight of the jampacked stadium.\n\nEarlier in the day, India landed in New Delhi and met Prime Minister Narendra Modi before leaving for Mumbai. Their flight was late but it did not compel the fans from leaving the venue as they waited patiently to catch a glimpse of the World Cup winners.\n\nThe parade finally began after a delay of more than two hours and the atmosphere was electric. The players and the fans matched each other's energy during the parade as they celebrated the memorable triumph together.\n\nLast week, India defeated South Africa in the final of the ICC T20 World Cup 2024 to clinch the trophy. The victory ended India's long wait for the World Cup across formats. India had not won the World Cup in any format since winning the 2011 World Cup at home.\n\nIn the final, India registered a miraculous win over the Proteas. The Men in Blue were looking set to suffer another heartbreaking defeat as South Africa had raced away to 151/4 after 16 overs while chasing 177. With only 26 runs needed from the last four overs, the game was South Africa's to lose. However, India's bowlers came up with a stunning effort to restrict South Africa to 169/8 and powered India to a memorable win.", "source": {"uri": "cricketaddictor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketAddictor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wankhede_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wankhede Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_Control_for_Cricket_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Board of Control for Cricket in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Africa national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://static.cricketaddictor.com/images/2024/Rohit%20Sharma%20Virat%20Kohli%20Dance.jpg?q=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9707029", "eventUri": "eng-9707029", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 195, "textEnd": 201}], "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

The team has made us proud by winning the World Cup,\" said a fan, who claimed to have waited outside Delhi's international airport since 4:30am in the morning, referring to India's last World Cup triumph which came back in 2011.\n\nThe Air India special charter flight AIC24WC -- Air India Champions 24 World Cup -- arrived in Delhi at 6am (IST) on Thursday after a non-stop journey.\n\nHeavy security was deployed to keep the crowd in check at the airport in Delhi but that did little to dampen the spirits as fans cheered enthusiastically, holding up posters of star batter Virat Kohli, Rohit and outgoing head coach Rahul Dravid.\n\nThe players acknowledged the waiting fans by waving at them and flashing warm smiles.\n\nSuryakumar Yadav, who took the sensational match-winning catch of David Miller in the final, was the most animated in responding to the cheering.\n\nRishabh Pant, who returned to international cricket at the just-concluded event after a life-threatening car accident two years ago, saluted the gathered crowd, while pacer Mohammed Siraj blew flying kisses in their direction.\n\nRohit raised the coveted trophy for the fans to catch a glimpse before boarding the bus. Kohli, on his part, gave a thumbs up to acknowledge the support.\n\nTwo buses ferried the players to ITC Maurya Sheraton, where they were greeted by dhol and traditional Bhangra dancers.\n\nMost of them, including Rohit, all-rounder Hardik Pandya, Suryakumar and Pant, shook a leg with the assembled dancers, giving them a memory that would last a lifetime.\n\nEven the on-duty security personnel had smiles on their faces as the players let their hair down, shook hands with everyone who wanted to and moved into their rooms after cutting yet another cake, this time in the shape of the trophy they had brought back.\n\nAll of this unfolded amid expected media frenzy. A brief while later, they left to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi at his official residence. Accompanied by BCCI President Roger Binny and secretary Jay Shah, the squad, including outgoing head coach Rahul Dravid, spent close to two hours at the 7, Lok Kalyan Marg residence of the Prime Minister before heading back to the hotel.\n\n\"An excellent meeting with our Champions! Hosted the World Cup winning team at 7, LKM and had a memorable conversation on their experiences through the tournament,\" Modi posted on 'X' along with pictures from the meet.\n\nFollowing the meeting with Modi, the cricketers left the national capital aboard an afternoon flight and landed in Mumbai well past 5pm for a victory parade from Nariman Point to the Wankhede Stadium that was supposed to have begun by that time.\n\nIf anyone thought the wait would frustrate the fans, they were to be proved wrong and how.\n\nThe Nariman Point, from where the Wankhede stadium is barely two kilometers away, began teeming with people quite early in the afternoon. The wait kept getting longer, but the crowd, instead of thinning, began to build up.\n\nVery soon, the Mumbai Police had to issue an advisory asking people to avoid the Marine Drive stretch due to the sea of humanity that had taken over every available inch on the road.\n\nThe players finally arrived atop the open bus and though the exhaustion of the day was beginning to catch up with them, the momentum had still not left their bodies.\n\nRohit and Virat, in a display of brotherhood, lifted the coveted trophy together and raised it for the fans, sporting wide grins. Their teammates, some of them draped in the tri-colour, danced and also clicked pictures.\n\nThey were startled for a second when a fan who had climbed atop a tree after perhaps failing to find a spot on the road, suddenly showed up in front of them as the bus kept moving.\n\nIt took over two hours to cover the distance and reach Wankhede, where there was another round of dancing, this time to the Nashik dhol.\n\nOnce inside, a packed stadium awaited them where they took turns to revisit their emotions before and after the seven-run win over South Africa, recalling the moments when it seemed the Proteas might just deny them.\n\nOutgoing coach Rahul Dravid had lost his voice by the time his turn came, perhaps after all the screaming to show his appreciation for the fans' energy during the bus ride.\n\n\"I am going to miss this love. What I saw on streets tonight, I won' forget it,\" he said in a scratchy voice that desperately needed a soothing throat lozenge.

The parade, a jubilant affair, culminated in a heartfelt felicitation ceremony at Wankhede Stadium organized by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).\n\nThe highlight of the ceremony was the presentation of a staggering Rs 125 crore cheque to the victorious team, underscoring their historic achievement in clinching the T20 World Cup title. Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, the stalwarts of Indian cricket, expressed their gratitude to the fans and reminisced about the journey that led to this triumph.\n\nThe ceremony at Wankhede Stadium, where legends like Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma expressed gratitude amidst thunderous applause, resonated deeply. \"This victory is not just ours; it belongs to every Indian who believed in us,\" Kohli's heartfelt words echoed the sentiments of a nation united in cricketing glory.\n\nAs the celebrations continued, Maharashtra Chief Minister, Eknath Shinde, welcomed Mumbai's cricketing stars at the state assembly, underscoring the team's role as ambassadors of hope and inspiration. Security measures were meticulously enforced, ensuring safety amidst the overwhelming surge of fans flocking to landmarks like Churchgate and local railway stations.\n\n\"This victory parade is a testament to our resilience and spirit,\" remarked a passionate fan at Marine Drive, encapsulating the profound impact of India's triumph beyond the boundaries of the cricket pitch.\n\nIn the aftermath of this historic win, as echoes of the national anthem reverberated across Mumbai's skyline, Team India's T20 World Cup victory stands as not just a sporting achievement but a resounding affirmation of unity, determination, and the unbreakable bond between a team and its nation.\n\nEarlier,in a spectacle of joyous pandemonium, Mumbai witnessed scenes of jubilation that rivaled any Bollywood blockbuster. The city, adorned in hues of blue and teeming with euphoric fans, became the epicenter of celebration as the victorious Indian cricket team paraded through its bustling streets.\n\nThe journey commenced from Nariman Point, where rain-soaked pavements couldn't dampen the spirits of thousands who gathered to catch a glimpse of their cricketing idols. Amidst chants of \"India, India\" and a sea of fluttering tricolor flags, an open-top bus slowly made its way along the iconic Marine Drive, carrying heroes whose feats had ignited a nation's pride.\n\nFor hours, the parade transformed the cityscape into a tapestry of emotions -- awe, excitement, and unbridled joy painted on the faces of young and old alike.

Axed from the squad in 2011, he wasn't part of India's World Cup celebration at the iconic Wankhede Stadium, but 13 years later, was back in his home ground to bask in the glory of India's 2024 T20 World Cup triumph. By the time Rohit retires and walks away from the game, he will be known by many things - 'Hitman', the only batter to smash three ODI double-centuries, one of India's greatest white-ball openers, but the one title he would cherish the most is - World Cup winning captain of India.\n\nRohit was all smiles on a busy day for Team India upon their arrival in the country in the early hours on Thursday, but as engaging and heartwarming each one of the activities was, nothing could top what transpired when the team reached the Wankhede Stadium after a victory march from Marine Drive. The India captain was asked to come up on the stage and reflect on the crowning moment of his career but was hijacked by the Mumbai crowd, which erupted in cheers, forcing Rohit to pause his speech momentarily.\n\nAlso Read: Team India's Arrival and Victory Parade Highlights\n\nBefore Rohit could answer, the Wankhede faithful went up in unison and cheered on for a good 30-odd seconds before an overwhelmed Rohit urged the crowd to let him speak. Slowly the words came out of his mouth in addressal, for the first time since India lifted the T20 World Cup in Barbados after beating South Africa on Saturday.\n\n\"Firstly... since we came to India, it's been wonderful. The reception we've received here tells you the kind of enthusiasm people had for this trophy. Yes, of course, it means so much for us but it's for the entire nation. Along with all the players who have represented the country, I think the people who've been wanting us to win the trophy, it [trophy] belongs to them,\" Rohit said while dedicating the World Cup win to the entire nation of India.\n\nWatch the clip below:\n\nTeam India arrived in Delhi at 6:00 AM following a 16-hour flight from Barbados. From there, the players headed to ITC Maurya, where they cut cakes and got some well-deserved rest. Around two hours later, the team proceeded to visit PM Narendra Modi at his residence where everyone had breakfast. They then departed for Mumbai and arrived at Nariman Point at approximately 7:30 PM, marking the commencement of the open-bus road show.\n\nBut the one thing that remained constant throughout the day was the turnout of the fans. Be it airport, hotel or Marine Drive, fans turned up in numbers. So while it could have been every bit taxing and tiring for Rohit and his team, going by the captain's gratitude towards them, it could well be worth every minute.\n\n\"Look, it's been only 3-4 days since the final. We just arrived this morning. Honestly, it was a wonderful experience and a great honour to meet Mr. Narendra Modi in the morning with the team. We all know how passionate he is about the sport so again bringing this World Cup to this country means the world to us,\" added Rohit.\n\n\"Obviously, Mumbai never disappoints when it comes to celebrating the trophy. We got a solid reception and on behalf of the team, BCCI, I would like to thank the fans, the entire nation, the people who supported the game, watched it and along with us for the last 13 years they are the ones who have been wanting this trophy to come back. Finally it's here I am happy and relieved.\"", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wankhede_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wankhede Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Drive,_Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marine Drive, Mumbai"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Century (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_overs_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Limited overs cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "One Day International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbados", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITC_Hotels", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ITC Hotels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_Control_for_Cricket_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Board of Control for Cricket in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nariman_Point", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nariman Point"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nariman Point"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2024/07/04/1600x900/INDIA-CRICKET-WC-T20-2024-33_1720114292932_1720114314949.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9707029", "eventUri": "eng-9707029", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

The open-top bus parade was a spectacle of joy and pride. Fans lined the streets, their flashlights creating a mesmerizing visual as the bus slowly made its way along the 1.5-kilometer route. The atmosphere was electric, with chants of victory and patriotism echoing through the crowd. Despite a slight delay due to the team's flight and the bustling activity at the airport, the parade was a resounding success, with Marine Drive packed with jubilant supporters.\n\nThe parade culminated at the iconic Wankhede Stadium, where a grand felicitation event awaited the team. The stadium was filled to capacity, with fans and dignitaries eager to honor the team's outstanding achievement. The players, adorned with their medals and the championship trophy, received a hero's welcome. Speeches, cheers, and applause filled the air as the team was celebrated for their hard-fought victory. This event marked a momentous occasion in Indian cricket, bringing immense pride and joy to millions of supporters across the country.\n\nFollowing the grand entrance, the audience was treated to inspiring speeches from Indian captain Rohit Sharma, star batter Virat Kohli, and fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah. Each player shared their thoughts on the journey to victory, expressing gratitude to the fans for their unwavering support. Their words resonated with the crowd, highlighting the unity and determination that drove the team to success.\n\nIn a significant moment during the ceremony, BCCI officials presented the Indian team with a cheque of INR 125 crore. This gesture was a recognition of the team's hard work and triumph in the T20 World Cup. The presentation of the cheque was met with loud cheers and applause, symbolizing the immense pride and joy of the nation.\n\nThe ceremony concluded with the Indian team taking a victory lap around Wankhede Stadium to the tunes of 'Vande Mataram.' This moment brought back nostalgic memories for many fans, reminiscent of the 2011 ODI World Cup when Wankhede sang the same song during the second innings of the match. The victory lap was a fitting end to the celebration, allowing the players to personally thank the fans for their unwavering support and share the joyous moment with them", "source": {"uri": "crickettimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketTimes.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "akshat_gaur@crickettimes.com", "name": "Akshat Gaur", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wankhede_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wankhede Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasprit_Bumrah", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jasprit Bumrah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_Control_for_Cricket_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Board of Control for Cricket in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://crickettimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Indian-team-recieve-INR-125-crore-cheque-from-BCCI-officials.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9707029", "eventUri": "eng-9707029", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.6470588235294117, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, the two elder statesmen of the Indian team, articulated the feelings of players to the scores of fans across the country when they told the huge gathering how happy and proud they were feeling after bringing the trophy back home.\n\n\"This trophy is for the entire nation, along with all the players that have represented the country,\" said India captain Rohit Sharma as he along with his teammates was accorded grand felicitations by a jam-packed Wankhede Stadium at a function organised by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on Thursday. The BCCI handed over to the team and the support staff a cheque of Rs 125 crore that it had announced as a reward for their victory.\n\n\"Since the time we have come to India, it has been wonderful. The reception we have got has been wonderful. The trophy belongs to everyone, to the players, the support staff, the BCCI officials, along with the people who have wanted us to win the World Cup, this trophy belongs to them,\" said Rohit as he expressed his emotions and his teammates at the Wankhede Stadium.\n\nThe stadium was packed to the rafters since 3 pm as they waited for the team to arrive from Delhi, travel from the Mumbai airport to Nariman Point for a victory parade over an open-top bus along the Marine Drive, crawling through a sea of humanity which delayed the function by a couple of hours.\n\nNeither the players nor the waiting crowd was bothered by the delay despite first being roasted by the afternoon sun and then soaked by a drizzle. While the crowd cheered them on, the players ran into the crowd, danced along with the supporters, cheered each other, and thanked the fans as they expressed their delight at being able to watch the demigods.\n\n\"Bringing this World Cup to the country means a lot to us. We got a solid reception, along with BCCI and my teammates, I thank the fans for their support,\" said Rohit saying every World Cup triumph is different and the last three that have come during his career were each special in its own way.\n\n\"To bring the World Cup to the venue where India won the 2011 ODI World Cup is very special for us. I would not single out some particular players but all of them played their role in this victory,\" said Rohit, who hailed his teammates Suryakumar Yadav, for his sensational catch off David Miller in the final at Bridgetown, Barbados, and Hardik Pandya for bowling that final over that sealed victory for India. Rohit's praise for Hardik at the Wankhede was special considering the kind of things they had to face after the allrounder from Gujarat had replaced the local boy as captain of the IPL side Mumbai Indians.\n\nBumrah, once in a generation player, says Kohli\n\nWhile Rohit Sharma had words of praise for Surya and Hardik, Virat Kohli, who like Rohit has announced his retirement from T20I cricket, expressed some special words for Jasprit Bumrah for how the pacer extricated the Indian team from difficult situations on several occasions during the World Cup.\n\nHe agreed that Bumrah should be declared a \"national treasure\" for the way he saved the team from difficult situations during the World Cup. Bumrah was declared the Player of the Tournament for his heroics and received a special round of applause from the crowd as Kohli urged them on.\n\n\"At one time I also felt that 'man is it going to slip away again'. But what happened in those five overs, two of which were bowled by Jasprit Bumrah was truly, truly special. What I would like everyone is to applaud a guy who brought us back into games, again and again in this tournament,\" said Kohli.\n\n\"We want him to continue playing for India as long as he can. He is once in a generation player,\" said Kohli of Bumrah. He also made a special mention of head coach Rahul Dravid and the support staff for helping and guiding the team to triumph.\n\nBumrah on his part said that having his toddler son along with him at the Kensington Oval made it special for him, laughing off suggestions that he may have to encounter a petition signed by a billion people urging him not to quit the game.\n\nWhile there were numerous moments for the fans to score in their memory for eternity, three would find a place in everyone's favourite moments of the evening.\n\nTop-most of those cherished moments will be when Rohit Sharma walked hand-in-hand with Virat Kohli to the crowd near the stands as if saying thanks on their behalf as they retire from the game's shortest format.\n\nThe second moment that will stay forever in people's minds will be Hardik Pandya getting cheered vociferously at the same ground where Mumbaikars booed him as captain of Mumbai Indians. And then there was the iconic moment of all the players dancing together as they went on a lap of honour around the stadium, reminding people of the similar scenes at the same venue in 2011 when Kohli was among those who lifted Sachin Tendulkar on their shoulder around the ground.\n\nOn Thursday, there were no such scenes even though the two oldest members of the team and the most loved ones were retiring from this format of the game. However, there was no doubt in the minds of the gathered about the yeomen service both of them have rendered to the country.", "source": {"uri": "socialnews.xyz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Social News XYZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wankhede_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wankhede Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_Control_for_Cricket_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Board of Control for Cricket in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Miller_(South_African_cricketer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Miller (South African cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suryakumar_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suryakumar Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardik_Pandya", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hardik Pandya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasprit_Bumrah", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jasprit Bumrah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgetown", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bridgetown"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bridgetown"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gujarat"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gujarat"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensington_Oval", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kensington Oval"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20 International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Dravid", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Dravid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sachin Tendulkar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://boxoffice.socialnews.xyz/get_ians_img.php.jpg?url=Amid+blaring+music+and+overflowing+emotions%2C+BCCI+fetes+T20+Champions+on+a+magical+night+at+Wankhede", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9707029", "eventUri": "eng-9707029", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 8, "textEnd": 14}], "sentiment": 0.6000000000000001, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

slogans of 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' and 'Vande Mataram'.\n\nAn ocean of people greeted the victory parade of the T20 World Cup winning Indian team in South Mumbai's Marine Drive as thousands of passionate fans gathered to catch a glimpse of their favourite stars, bringing the traffic to a complete standstill.\n\nThe open bus parade, which was delayed by more than a couple of hours, started from the

who helped end India's 11-year wait for an ICC Trophy.\n\nFollowing the celebrations, the Board of Control for Cricket in India organised the function at the stadium where they will hand over the

The special flight organised by BCCI secretary Jay Shah, one of the several board officials to eventually take off from the Bridgetown airport, also carried members of the media contingent from the tournament.\n\nThe Indian players came out of the airport in ones and twos after completing immigration formalities. Anticipating a grand welcome despite the arduous 16-hour journey, Suryakumar Yadav, who took the sensational match-winning catch of David Miller in the final, was all animated in responding to the cheering.\n\nRishabh Pant, who returned to international cricket at the just-concluded event after a near-fatal car accident, saluted the gathered crowd, while pacer Mohammed Siraj blew flying kisses in their direction. Captain Rohit Sharma and Player of the Final, Virat Kohli, both of whom retired from T20Is at the end of India's campaign, were among the last to come out of the VIP exit.\n\nRohit raised the coveted trophy for the fans to catch a glimpse before boarding the bus. Kohli, on his part, gave a thumbs up to acknowledge the support.\n\nGrand welcome for Team India\n\nThe streets leading to the Indira Gandhi International Airport were cordoned off on one side to ensure smooth passage to the victorious outfit, but that did little to dampen the spirits as fans cheered enthusiastically holding up posters of star batter Virat Kohli, skipper Rohit Sharma and outgoing head coach Rahul Dravid.\n\nThe team along with their families and the support staff arrived in two buses at the ITC Maurya Sheraton, where they were greeted by dhol and traditional Bhangra dancers. Most of the Indian players, including Rohit, all-rounder Hardik Pandya, Suryakumar and Pant, shook a leg with the assembled dancers, even as some of the on-duty security personnel, hotel staff couldn't stop themselves from seeking selfies from a few cricketers, who also obliged generously.\n\nA 3-tier cake infused with the colours of the Indian jersey was prepared at the hotel. The cake was cut by Rohit, Virat, and head coach Rahul Dravid before they left to meet PM Narendra Modi.\n\nAccording to one of the chefs, different kinds of homemade truffles, assorted chocolate-coated nuts, and a variety of savory treats, including edible chocolate balls, bats, wickets and pitches were also prepared for the Indian team.\n\nAfter a couple of hours at the hotel, the team members left to meet PM Modi at his official residence 7 Lok Kalyan Marg, continuing a hectic schedule that awaited them through the day. They spent close to two hours interacting with the Prime Minister, who congratulated them for their stunning victory and later hosted them for breakfast.\n\n\"An excellent meeting with our Champions! Hosted the World Cup winning team at 7, LKM and had a memorable conversation on their experiences through the tournament,\" PM Modi posted on his social media handle.\n\nAfter the meeting, the players left for the hotel briefly before proceeding to the IGI airport for their next flight to Mumbai, where the winning outfit participated in an open bus victory parade that was followed by a felicitation ceremony at the iconic Wankhede Stadium.\n\nMadness in Mumbai\n\nTeam India's Vistara flight from Delhi to Mumbai was accorded a 'water salute' in celebration of the T20 World Cup victory as it touched down the City of Dreams after a Guard of Honour at the airside, and cars escorted the team aircraft to the airport terminal stand. Once the team alighted from the plane, they walked through the Tricolour draped aerobridge, and all the team-members were greeted with a floral cascade showered on them in the arrival corridor.\n\nA celebratory cake-cutting ceremony followed at the airport terminal even as thousands of excited fans lined up on the 1 km picturesque Marine Drive route from Nariman Point to Wankhede Stadium near Churchgate in anticipation of the team's arrival for the Victory Parade planned on the route.\n\nIn a repeat of the road show held in the city 17 years ago when Mahendra Singh Dhoni's team had beaten arch-rivals Pakistan in the final of the inaugural 2007 World T20 in South Africa, Rohit Sharma's world champion outfit on Thursday was also celebrated by a similar victory parade from Marine Drive to the Wankhede Stadium in an open bus.\n\nCrowds at Churchgate and other railway stations began to swell in the afternoon as fans started gathering at south Mumbai to catch a glimpse of the World Cup heroes. The bus also has a picture of the elated Indian team after they won the T20 World Cup trophy in the West Indies.\n\nThe Wankhede Stadium was thrown open to fans, who filled up the stands within minutes to celebrate the Indian team's title triumph last Saturday. The iconic stadium which witnessed India's last ODI World Cup triumph in 2011 had its stands filled to the brim by passionate fans as thousand others waited outside the gates which were closed around 5:00pm. The heavy shower in Mumbai could hardly deter the enthusiasm of the crowd.\n\nChants of 'Mumbai cha raja Rohit Sharma' were heard across the stadium welcoming the 37-year-old Rohit, a local boy and a crowd favourite in the city.\n\nSignalling his grand return to Mumbai, Hardik Pandya, the India vice-captain and also the captain of the city's IPL franchise, emerged from the airport with the World Cup trophy in his hands. The crowd erupted in joy as the players began their parade on the streets of Mumbai.\n\nFlanked by BCCI secretary Jay Shah, president Roger Binny, treasurer Ashish Shelar, vice president Rajeev Shukla, Team India players took turns to hold the trophy and wave the Tricolour. Fans were seen taking pictures of the champions on the bus with some enthusiasts even climbing on trees to get a closer look of the heroes.\n\nThe decibel levels rose once Rohit and Virat raised the World Cup trophy together from the open bus. Both the senior pros along with Ravindra Jadeja announced their retirement from the shortest format after the tournament. Unlike his usual self, head coach Rahul Dravid was also at his animated best, acknowledging the love and support from the crowd.\n\nAnd once the bus reached the Wankhede amid loud cheers from the jam-packed crowd, the players walked into the ground, with Rohit dragging Kohli towards the stands as the duo pulled off some bhangra steps and the rest of the team joined in.\n\n\"Since the time we have come to India it's been wonderful. This trophy means a lot to us (players) but it's for the entire nation. It was a wonderful experience to meet PM Modi with the team. On behalf of the team, fans, I want to thank the entire nation. This is a special team, I am so lucky to lead this team,\" Rohit said at the Wankhede.\n\nCalling the team his family, outgoing head coach Rahul Dravid said, \"This team is like a family. Incredible what the boys have done. They showed a 'Never Say Die' attitude. Fantastically led by Rohit Sharma.\"\n\nKohli thanked the fans for the incredible support throughout his career as he recalled the emotional moment when he and Rohit, draped in the Tricolor celebrated India's win together. \"A big thank you to all the fans. It has been something that I will never forget. After the game, I knew it was time for me to quit. The only goal is Indian cricket and the Indian flag.\"\n\nThe event culminated with the BCCI office-bearers presenting the team with a cheque of Rs 125 crores as board secretary had earlier promised after the World Cup triumph.", "source": {"uri": "thestatesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Statesman"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma",

misrepresented or glorified as the 'Spirit of Mumbai.'\n\nOn Thursday, a majority of those who were stuck in terrible traffic jam would not have minded it.\n\nAfter all, it was for cricket, another passion of a Mumbaikar as Rohit Sharma's victorious batch of 2024 \"brought the metropolis to a standstill\" in a style similar to Mahendra Singh Dhoni's men famously did 17 years ago.\n\nWhile 'Dhoni's Dashers' 25-km long bus parade in 2007 had attracted lakh of fans, Thursday saw an enormous crowd concentrated in the two-kilometre radius around the Wankhede Stadium.\n\nTeam India victory parade updates | Indian team feted at Wankhede after open-bus parade\n\nDelayed\n\nThe squad's arrival from New Delhi, after meeting the Prime Minister, was delayed by almost two hours and by the time the team bus got out of the Mumbai airport, the evening traffic had peaked.\n\nIt led to a commotion and a corridor being created for the bus.\n\nPM Modi hosts T20 World Cup-winning Indian cricket teamEarly birds\n\nAt the other end of the Maximum City, the fans had thronged in and around the Wankhede Stadium more than six hours before the expected start of the victory parade.\n\nWhile it was announced that the Wankhede gates would open at 4 p.m., huge queues outside the various gates meant the security forces had to advance the opening to around 3.30 p.m.\n\nWith little arrangements in place, it led to a crowding at every staircase entrance.\n\nThough a grievous incident was averted, soon after the gates were locked, abandoned footwear were witnessed at various staircases.\n\nBut once they were inside, the spectators were kept entertained by a DJ.\n\nMeanwhile, on the Marine Drive, the police struggled to manage a huge crowd, estimated to be over two lakh.\n\nBut once the victory parade -- with a 1.7km distance to cover -- finally started at 7.38 p.m., the wait through a heated afternoon and a wet evening was worth it as the fans went wild with cheers for India's second T20 World Cup trophy.\n\nAnd when the cavalcade entered the Wankhede two hours hence, the 25,000-plus turnout at the 'Big W' that had sat patiently, with little to eat or drink, rejoiced along with the Men in Blue.\n\nWorth the wait\n\nOn this day, a 17-year-wait for a T20 World Cup seemed nothing for ardent cricket fans in comparison to a six to eight-hour ordeal to celebrate with their cricketing stars!\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type":

Dhoni's team which won the 2011 ODI World Cup at this same venue. \"I was 21-22 at that time and did not realise why the senior players were getting so emotional. After winning this World Cup, I have realised how special this is,\" said Kohli, who said he had instantly realised that it was time for him to say goodbye to the format and make way for youngsters.\n\nIt was Thursday evening, and the streets were alive with jubilation, for the Indian cricket team, fresh from their T20 World Cup triumph, was set to parade through Marine Drive.\n\nAs the open-top bus began its journey from the National Centre for the Performing Arts (NCPA), a sea of fans in blue jerseys stretched out along Marine Drive, chanting patriotic slogans. \"Bharat Mata Ki Jai,\" \"Jitega Bhai Jitega, India Jitega,\" and \"Vande Mataram\" echoed through the evening air, mingling with the calls of street vendors and the honks of vehicles.\n\nThe sheer volume of people created a stampede-like situation at several points. Mumbai Police, however, had anticipated the fervour and had deployed a large number of personnel along the route, ensuring the safety of the crowd. Their vigilance paid off as they averted any major incidents, though a few people fell ill and had to be hospitalised.\n\nA heartwarming moment emerged amidst the chaos, captured and shared by the Mumbai Police on X (formerly Twitter). As an ambulance made its way through the congested Marine Drive, the crowd, in a remarkable display of empathy and discipline, cleared a path. \"Siren Bajta gaya, Rasta banta gaya,\" read the caption of the post by Mumbai Police, celebrating the spirit of the cricket fans.\n\nAs the bus inched closer to Wankhede Stadium, the epicentre of Mumbai cricket, the atmosphere grew denser with excitement. Policemen, both uniformed and in plain clothes, stood vigilant, frisking fans entering the stadium and maintaining order. The Western Railway, anticipating the rush, had announced extra services from Churchgate to Borivali to ease the commute for the fans, while more than 400 Railway Protection Force and Government Railway Police personnel were stationed at Churchgate station.\n\nHowever, the Central Railway's Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus wasn't as fortunate, experiencing significant delays and adding to the chaos.

Never mind the jetlag from their long flight from Barbados to New Delhi and the long day, when the tasha dhol started beating in the stand, Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, led the Indian team players into a carefree dance.\n\nTeam India reached the Wankhede Stadium to a raucous reception as the packed crowd gave them a reception to remember, as they had done to Kapil's Devils in 1983, M S Dhoni's young brigade in 2007 for winning the inaugural World T20 in 2007 and Sachin Tendulkar & Co after lifting the 2011 World Cup.\n\nThe crowd had waited for five hours for their champions to arrive. Rain or lack of basic facilities didn't dampen their spirits, such was the enthusiasm over India's 2024 T20 World Cup win. Dancing all along they were following the victory parade on the giants screens, as the open top bus of the Indian team slowly made its way to the stadium.\n\nWhen the first player, Suryakumar Yadav, made an appearance on the balcony, a deafening roar rang around the stadium.\n\nThe most poignant moment was when Hardik Pandya joined Surya in the gallery. Booed all through the IPL, it was a moment to savour for him as the crowd broke into a spontaneous applause. He was their hero after his match-turning wicket of Heinrich Klaasen in the final, and bowling the final over had given him redemption.\n\nOne by one, the rest of the players came out to soak in the adulation.\n\nBut the man the Mumbai crowd was waiting for, Rohit Sharma, trooped out right at the end to a roar he will remember all his life.\n\nSensing the celebratory mood, even the rain gods smiled to stay away for the duration of the event.\n\nWhen the captain was called on to the stage, he couldn't utter a word for a long time as the crowd let him know what this victory meant to them. All evening the fans had been chanting, \"Mumbai ka Raja kaun, Rohit Sharma, Rohit Sharma\". Now, with their hero right in fron of them, they took it a notch higher.\n\nFinally when the crowd settled down, Rohit said:\n\n\"On behalf of my team and the BCCI, I would like to thank the fans! Ever since we have reached India, we have seen how much it means to them. For the last 11 years, they have wanted the trophy back in India! As desperate as we were to win the trophy, the fans were a bit more desperate. This team is special and I am lucky to have the chance to captain this unit.\"\n\nWhen he mentioned Suryakumar's catch (off David Miller in the last over), chants of Surya, Surya rang around the stands. \"It was written,\" said Rohit on the catch, pointing skywards.\n\n\"When the pressure is there, those catches need to be taken and all the moments of training come into your mind. And at that moment it was a brilliant effort from him to take the catch!\" said Rohit. \"I am blessed to have this team, who at any given time have stood up to the challenges.\"\n\nBatting legend and coach Rahul Dravid said the recepton that his team has received shows how India makes cricket brilliant while adding how it was the perfect way to end his innings.\n\n\"This is a fantastic note to sign off on. I am going to miss all this love. What we have been seeing today and what I have heard since the win shows how India makes cricket brilliant!\" said Dravid.\n\nVirat Kohli's arrival had the crowd cheering him by his nickname, \"Cheeku, Cheeku\". Like Rohit, it also took him some time to be heard as the crowd showed him their appreciation.\n\n\"Since we came back what has happened is phenomenal! I remember when I won that World Cup as well. I couldn't connect with the emotions of the senior players back then. I was 22, 23. But now, it's a different feeling. Now, to be in this position. We both (Rohit) have been trying for so long. The only aim was to carry the team for so long,\" said Kohli.\n\n\"This is the first time I've seen Rohit show so much emotion on the field. When I was walking up the steps, I was crying, he was crying and we hugged. That is a special moment. The Indian flag is what we play for,\" Kohli added.\n\nEveryone bowed in respect when player of the tournament, Jasprit Bumrah, stepped on to the stage.\n\n\"It feels amazing. This ground is really special in my life. As a kid, I came here to play cricket and what I saw today, I will never forget that,\" the Mumbai Indians and India star said about his connection with the ground.\n\nThe evening came to a close with the team taking a lap of honour while throwing signed tennis balls into the crowd. The lucky few got their hands of a precious momentos. The others just soaked in the moment.\n\nIf you ever wanted to truly understand what makes Indian cricket tick, you just had to be there on a wet, humid evening at the Wankhede. It was the stuff that dreams are made of; dreams that someday in the future may turn into trophies themselves.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MS Dhoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suryakumar_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suryakumar Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardik_Pandya", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hardik Pandya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wankhede_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wankhede Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sachin Tendulkar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbados", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Miller_(South_African_cricketer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Miller (South African cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_Control_for_Cricket_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Board of Control for Cricket in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Dravid", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Dravid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caught", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caught"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Klaasen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heinrich Klaasen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasprit_Bumrah", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jasprit Bumrah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flag of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2024/07/04/1600x900/Players-of-the-T20-World-Cup-winning-team-acknowle_1720116142743.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9707029", "eventUri": "eng-9707029", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

Scary as well.\"\n\nJournalist Rajdeep Sardesai posted a video showing massive crowding at Wankhede stadium gate and Churchgate in general on the day of Team India's victory parade held to celebrate the team's historic ICC T20 Men's International Cricket World Cup win. Following the roadshow or victory parade in an open bus, the world champion T20 team will also be felicitated at the Wankhede team.\n\nThe BCCI had announced that entry to the Wankhede stadium would be free of cost. However, it would be on a first-come-first serve basis. The fans started thronging the gates of Wankhede from early afternoon to ensure they do not miss the felicitation event.\n\nHowever, it also led to a huge crowd outside Wankhede Stadium and Mumbai's Marine Drive as fans reached the iconic promenade in huge numbers for the T20 International Cricket World Cup winning team India's victory parade on Thursday (July 4). The senior journalist asked in his hard-hitting post, \"When will we learn crowd management? Have a road show, please get crowd control right! Scary as well.\"\n\nHowever, netizens were quick to counter Rajdeep's post and shared the video showing the massive crowd at Mumbai's Marine Drive giving way to an ambulance.\n\n\"I think @CPMumbaiPolice should invite Rajdeep for a lecture on crowd management. He's an expert. Journalists love to lecture everyone despite having managed nothing in life. They have opinions on how the Army should handle terrorists, how the PM should run the government and more,\" replied a netizen.\n\n\"This is called passion. Enough policemen are deputed to manage it. Enjoy the moment Rajdeep. We are #T20WorldChampion and welcoming our team.\"\n\nEarlier, a heart-warming video showed the massive crowd at Mumbai's Marine Drive giving way to an ambulance. The video showed an ambulance passing from Marine Drive, which was crowded with people with hardly any place to stand.

This comparison has highlighted Rohit's profound reverence for the symbol of their hard-earned success.

Later, they gathered at the Wankhede Stadium for a felicitation ceremony where Rohit and his boys were handed the prize money.\n\nIn an interaction with reporters in Barbados after the World Cup victory, BCCI secretary Jay Shah revealed it was a collective decision of the office bearers to reward the side for ending the long wait for the title.\n\n\"We last won the title in 2007 and won it after nearly 17 years. The decision on the prize money was collectively taken by the BCCI office bearers. We were the No.1 ranked side across formats two months ago.

Francis Lawrence, who has worked on all but the first \"Hunger Games\" movie, will return as director.\n\nThe first four \"Hunger Games\" books have sold more than 100 million copies and been translated into dozens of languages. Collins had seemingly ended the series after the 2010 publication of \"Mockingjay,\" writing in 2015 that it was \"time to move on to other lands.\" But four years later, she stunned readers and the publishing world when she revealed she was working on what became \"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes,\" released in 2020 and set 64 years before the first book.\n\nCollins has drawn upon Greek mythology and the Roman gladiator games for her earlier \"Hunger Games\" books. But for the upcoming novel, she cites the Scottish Enlightenment philosopher David Hume.\n\n\"With 'Sunrise on the Reaping,' I was inspired by David Hume's idea of implicit submission and, in his words, 'the easiness with which the many are governed by the few,'\" Collins said in a statement. \"The story also lent itself to a deeper dive into the use of propaganda and the power of those who control the narrative. The question 'Real or not real?' seems more pressing to me every day.\"\n\nThe \"Hunger Games\" movies are a multibillion dollar franchise for Lionsgate. Jennifer Lawrence portrayed heroine Katniss Everdeen in the film versions of \"The Hunger Games,\" \"Catching Fire\" and \"Mockingjay,\" the last of which came out in two installments. Other featured actors have included Philip Seymour Hoffman, Josh Hutcherson, Stanley Tucci and Donald Sutherland.\n\n\"Suzanne Collins is a master storyteller and our creative north star,\" Lionsgate chair Adam Fogelson said in a statement. \"We couldn't be more fortunate than to be guided and trusted by a collaborator whose talent and imagination are so consistently brilliant.\"\n\nThe film version of \"Songbirds and Snakes,\" starring Tom Blyth and Rachel Zegler, came out last year.

It will arrive in bookstores on March 18, 2025 and takes place 40 years after The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes.\n\n\"With 'Sunrise on the Reaping,' I was inspired by David Hume's idea of implicit submission and, in his words, 'the easiness with which the many are governed by the few,'\" Collins explained. \"The story also lent itself to a deeper dive into the use of propaganda and the power of those who control the narrative. The question 'Real or not real?' seems more pressing to me every day.\"\n\nFans of the hit franchise wasted no time speculating that this book is likely setting the stage for another movie and, unsurprisingly, Lionsgate has just shared plans for The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping to be released in theaters on November 20, 2026.\n\nSet during the Second Quarter Quell, it seems the idea is to explore the Games that Haymitch Abernathy (played by Woody Harrelson in the original trilogy) was part of. This places it 24 years before the events of The Hunger Games.\n\nFrancis Lawrence, who directed 2013's The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, 2014's The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1, 2015's The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2, and 2023's The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes, is in talks to direct the film.\n\n\"Suzanne Collins is a master storyteller and our creative north star,\" said Lionsgate Motion Picture Group's Adam Fogelson. \"We couldn't be more fortunate than to be guided and trusted by a collaborator whose talent and imagination are so consistently brilliant. We know Hunger Games fans worldwide will be spellbound by where Suzanne has focused this next extraordinary story.\"\n\n\"The Second Quarter Quell is legendary and looms large over the history of the Games, even into the time of Katniss Everdeen a quarter-century later. Like fans around the globe, we are eagerly anticipating this exciting return to Panem.\"\n\nCollins added, \"From the beginning, Lionsgate has been a wonderful home and partner for the Hunger Games franchise, and I'm very excited to be collaborating with Adam and the team as we bring this next story to theaters in 2026.\"\n\nThere are surely those who will say Collins is simply writing books to turn into movies at this stage, but The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes novel was a hit and the movie grossed a solid $337.4 million worldwide.", "source": {"uri": "sffgazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SFFGazette.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzanne_Collins", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Suzanne Collins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Hunger Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionsgate", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lionsgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_adaptation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Film adaptation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games:_Mockingjay,_Part_1_(soundtrack)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1 (soundtrack)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games:_Catching_Fire_\u2013_Original_Motion_Picture_Soundtrack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Hunger Games: Catching Fire \u2013 Original Motion Picture Soundtrack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ballad_of_Songbirds_and_Snakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Lawrence", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Francis Lawrence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilogy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trilogy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Harrelson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Woody Harrelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Propaganda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games:_The_Ballad_of_Songbirds_&_Snakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katniss_Everdeen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Katniss Everdeen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mockingjay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mockingjay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storytelling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Storytelling"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://sffgazette.com/images/articles/banners/8148.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9630046", "eventUri": "eng-9630046", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-03-", "textStart": 362, "textEnd": 370}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-11-", "textStart": 1071, "textEnd": 1082}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 225, "relevance": 1}

His wish has come true as Collins is returning to the iconic franchise with another novel: Sunrise of the Reaping.\n\nThe Associated Press is reporting that Collins is writing a fifth Hunger Games novel. It will be published on March 18, 2025. Per the report, this story will take place 24 years before the original Hunger Games novel and 40 years after the events of The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes. It will begin with \"the reaping of the Fiftieth Hunger Games.\"\n\nWhile past installments in the franchise pulled from Greek mythology and Roman gladiator games, Collins has found new inspiration. She cited the Scottish Enlightenment philosopher David Hume as an inspiration to The Associated Press.\n\n\"With Sunrise on the Reaping, I was inspired by David Hume's idea of implicit submission and, in his words, 'the easiness with which many are governed by the few,'\" Collins said in a statement to The Associated Press. \"The story also lent itself to a deeper dive into the use of propaganda and the power of those who control the narrative. The question 'Real or not real?' seems more pressing to me every day.\"\n\nWhat does this mean for a Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes sequel?\n\nThe Associated Press report notes that film rights for Sunrise on the Reaping haven't been announced. Collins' last four novels were all adapted across five total films by Lionsgate. They have grossed over $3.2 billion worldwide.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the latest film, Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, was the lowest-grossing film of the series. Based on Collins' 2020 novel, the film took place 64 years before the events of the first novel.\n\nDespite franchise veteran Francis Lawrence returning to direct and young stars such as Rachel Zegler and Tom Blyth, the film didn't catch on at the box office. The film grossed just $337 million during its theatrical run.\n\nThis was a far cry from the previous four films. The first film in the franchise grossed nearly $700 million. Catching Fire made $865 million, Mockingjay Part 1 made $755 million, and Mockingjay Part 2 made $653 million.\n\nSo, an adaptation of Sunrise on the Reaping is far from a guarantee. But given Lionsgate's track record, it's more likely going to happen than not.\n\nWhat does this mean for Tom Blyth and Rachel Zegler? Blyth played a younger version of Coriolanus Snow in Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes. In ClutchPoints' interview with him, he expressed interest in seeing Snow become Head Gamemaker. Sunrise on the Reaping takes place 40 years after Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, so maybe that's the right timeline to see this come to fruition.\n\nThe Hunger Games franchise\n\nSuzanne Collins kicked off the Hunger Games franchise in 2008 with the novel of the same name. She was previously known for writing the Underland Chronicles series.\n\nTwo sequel Hunger Games novels would follow, Catching Fire and Mockingjay. Nearly a decade later, Collins returned to the series to write the prequel novel, The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_korpan@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Andrew Korpan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzanne_Collins", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Suzanne Collins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Hunger Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballad", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ballad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games:_The_Ballad_of_Songbirds_&_Snakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Blyth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tom Blyth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hume", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Hume"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Zegler", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rachel Zegler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ballad_of_Songbirds_and_Snakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionsgate", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lionsgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mythology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greek mythology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladiator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gladiator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Age of Enlightenment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Propaganda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Underland_Chronicles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Underland Chronicles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catching_Fire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catching Fire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mockingjay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mockingjay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Lawrence", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Francis Lawrence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_office", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Box office"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theory_and_Criticism", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theory and Criticism", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Suzanne-Collins-major-Hunger-Games-update-hints-at-future-Songbirds-and-Snakes-sequel.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9630046", "eventUri": "eng-9630046", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-03-", "textStart": 532, "textEnd": 540}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

The new book begins with the reaping of the Fiftieth Hunger Games, set 24 years before the original \"Hunger Games\" novel, which came out in 2008, and 40 years after Collins' most recent book, \"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes.\"\n\nLionsgate, which has released film adaptations of all four previous \"Hunger Games\" books, announced later on Thursday that \"Sunrise on the Reaping\" will open in theaters on Nov. 20, 2026.

Collins had seemingly ended the series after the 2010 publication of \"Mockingjay,\" writing in 2015 that it was \"time to move on to other lands.\" But four years later, she stunned readers and the publishing world when she revealed she was working on what became \"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes,\" released in 2020 and set 64 years before the first book.\n\nCollins has drawn upon Greek mythology and the Roman gladiator games for her earlier \"Hunger Games\" books. But for the upcoming novel, she cites the Scottish Enlightenment philosopher David Hume.\n\n\"With 'Sunrise on the Reaping,' I was inspired by David Hume's idea of implicit submission and, in his words, 'the easiness with which the many are governed by the few,'\" Collins said in a statement. \"The story also lent itself to a deeper dive into the use of propaganda and the power of those who control the narrative. The question 'Real or not real?' seems more pressing to me every day.\"\n\nThe \"Hunger Games\" movies are a multibillion dollar franchise for Lionsgate. Jennifer Lawrence portrayed heroine Katniss Everdeen in the film versions of \"The Hunger Games,\" \"Catching Fire\" and \"Mockingjay,\" the last of which came out in two installments. Other featured actors have included Philip Seymour Hoffman, Josh Hutcherson, Stanley Tucci and Donald Sutherland.\n\n\"Suzanne Collins is a master storyteller and our creative north star,\" Lionsgate chair Adam Fogelson said in a statement. \"We couldn't be more fortunate than to be guided and trusted by a collaborator whose talent and imagination are so consistently brilliant.\"\n\nThe film version of \"Songbirds and Snakes,\" starring Tom Blyth and Rachel Zegler, came out last year. This fall, a \"Hunger Games\" stage production is scheduled to debut in London.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The latter film was released last year and took place over 60 years before The Hunger Games, following a young Coriolanus Snow as he worked his way through the 10th Hunger Games as a mentor to District 12's female tribute, shaping him into the evil tyrant he would become.\n\nActor Tom Blyth recently spoke about the potential of playing Snow again in another prequel-era story, even if Snow were merely a supporting character instead of the main one.

The story is set 24 years before the events of the original book and begins on the morning of the reaping for the 50th Hunger Games, the publisher said. The original novel and film depicted the 74th Hunger Games.\n\nIn the series, the reaping is the event in which participants for the Hunger Games, or \"tributes,\" are selected.\n\nJust hours after the book was announced, Lionsgate confirmed it's adapting \"Sunrise on the Reaping\" into a feature film, which will hit theaters in 2026. Francis Lawrence is in talks to direct after helming every movie in the series other than the 2012 original.\n\nCollins said in a statement her book was inspired \"by David Hume's idea of implicit submission and, in his words, 'the easiness with which the many are governed by the few.'\"\n\nShe added that the novel will offer a \"deeper dive into the use of propaganda and the power of those who control the narrative,\" adding, \"The question 'Real or not real?' seems more pressing to me every day.\"\n\nThis will be the first new \"Hunger Games\" novel since 2020's \"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes,\" a prequel set 64 years before the first book. It followed a young Coriolanus Snow, who later becomes the evil President Snow in the original series, and the plot centered around the 10th Hunger Games.\n\n\"The Hunger Games\" is set in a dystopian future where representatives from each district in the nation of Panem are forced to compete in a fight to the death every year. The original novels were published from 2008 to 2010, and from 2012 to 2015, Jennifer Lawrence starred in the blockbuster movie adaptations.\n\n5 things to know about 'Hunger Games' prequel book 'Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes'\n\nIn November, Lionsgate resurrected the movie series with an adaptation of \"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes\" starring Rachel Zegler and Tom Blyth. The film franchise has grossed over $3 billion.\n\nIs the new 'Hunger Games' a sequel to 'The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes'?\n\nAlthough some fans were anticipating a direct sequel to \"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes,\" \"Sunrise on the Reaping\" will instead be set 40 years later.\n\nThe original novels established that the winner of the 50th Hunger Games, the subject of the new book, was Haymitch Abernathy, played in the films by Woody Harrelson. This Hunger Games consisted of twice the number of tributes as usual.\n\nReview: 'Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes' is the best 'Hunger Games' movie of them all\n\n\"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes\" director Francis Lawrence told Entertainment Weekly last year he would be interested in directing a movie about how Haymitch won his Hunger Games. \"If Suzanne has another thematic idea that she feels fits into the world of Panem -- whether that's with new people (or) familiar characters (like) Finnick, Haymitch, whoever -- I'd be really interested in looking at it and being a part of it,\" Lawrence said.\n\nOn Thursday, Zegler reshared a 2021 post on X where she suggested Collins should write a trilogy about the origin of Haymitch Abernathy. \"You're welcome guys,\" Zegler wrote.\n\nWhen will the next 'Hunger Games' be released?\n\nThe \"Sunrise on the Reaping\" book will be published on March 18, 2025, while the film adaptation will hit theaters on Nov. 20, 2026.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Hunger Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ballad_of_Songbirds_and_Snakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionsgate", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lionsgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Lawrence", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Francis Lawrence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Feature film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholastic_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scholastic Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_adaptation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Film adaptation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolanus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coriolanus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lawrence", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Lawrence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystopia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dystopia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ballad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockbuster_(entertainment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blockbuster (entertainment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Propaganda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Blyth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Blyth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Zegler", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rachel Zegler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_series", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Film series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilogy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trilogy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Harrelson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Woody Harrelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Weekly"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2023/11/18/USAT/71626920007-bo-catchingfire-112513.JPG?auto=webp&crop=6143,3457,x0,y319&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9630046", "eventUri": "eng-9630046", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-03-", "textStart": 3257, "textEnd": 3265}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-11-", "textStart": 3320, "textEnd": 3327}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

If you buy something through this post, the publisher may get a share of the sale.\n\nIt's a big day for fans of The Hunger Games as Lionsgate has announced a film adaptation of Sunrise on the Reaping, the next Hunger Games prequel novel by author Suzanne Collins.\n\nLionsgate confirmed the film adaptation of Sunrise on the Reaping releases on November 20, 2026. Nina Jacobson and Brad Simpson, producers on the previous Hunger Games films, have returned for the next installment, while Francis Lawrence, who directed four of the five Hunger Games films beginning with Catching Fire, is in talks to direct.\n\nSunrise on the Reaping (A Hunger Games Novel) Release: March 18, 2025. Buy On Amazon\u2197\n\n\"Suzanne Collins is a master storyteller and our creative north star,\" Lionsgate Motion Picture Group chair Adam Fogelson said. \"We couldn't be more fortunate than to be guided and trusted by a collaborator whose talent and imagination are so consistently brilliant. We know Hunger Games fans worldwide will be spellbound by where Suzanne has focused this next extraordinary story. The Second Quarter Quell is legendary and looms large over the history of the Games, even into the time of Katniss Everdeen a quarter-century later. Like fans around the globe, we are eagerly anticipating this exciting return to Panem.\"\n\nSunrise on the Reaping is another prequel in Collins' dystopian series, set 40 years after The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes but 24 years before the events of the original Hunger Games novel. It begins on the morning of the Reaping of the Fiftieth Hunger Games (aka the Second Quarter Quell). Fans of the franchise will remember this is the year Hunger Games character Haymitch Abernathy won.\n\nWhile it seems like a quickfire film adaptation of the next Hunger Games novel just hours after it was announced, Lionsgate had said in late 2015 that it was interested in making Hunger Games prequel films.\n\nTo that end, last year Lionsgate released a film version of Collins' 2020 prequel novel The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, starring Rachel Zegler and Tom Blyth. The film was a hit for Lionsgate, grossing $337.4 million at the global box office.\n\n\"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes rushes through a rich story that needs more time for its characters' conflicts and manipulations to feel earned,\" we wrote in our review of The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes.\n\nTaylor is a Reporter at IGN.

The new book begins with the reaping of the Fiftieth Hunger Games, set 24 years before the original \"Hunger Games\" novel, which came out in 2008, and 40 years after Collins' most recent book, \"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes.\"\n\nCollins has drawn upon Greek mythology and the Roman gladiator games for her earlier \"Hunger Games\" books.

The question 'Real or not real?' seems more pressing to me every day.\"\n\nFilm rights have not yet been announced. All four previous books have been adapted into movies, a multibillion dollar franchise for Lionsgate that featured Jennifer Lawrence portraying heroine Katniss Everdeen in the film versions of \"The Hunger Games,\" \"Catching Fire\" and \"Mockingjay,\" the last of which came out in two installments.\n\nThe first four \"Hunger Games\" books have sold more than 100 million copies and been translated into dozens of languages. Collins had seemingly ended the series after the 2010 publication of \"Mockingjay,\" writing in 2015 that it was \"time to move on to other lands.\" But four years later, she stunned readers and the publishing world when she revealed she was working on what became \"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes,\" released in 2020 and set 64 years before the first book.\n\nThe film version of \"Songbirds and Snakes,\" starring Tom Blyth and Rachel Zegler, came out last year.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The new book begins with the reaping of the Fiftieth Hunger Games, set 24 years before the original \"Hunger Games\" novel, which came out in 2008, and 40 years after Collins' most recent book, \"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes.\"\n\nCollins has drawn upon Greek mythology and the Roman gladiator games for her earlier \"Hunger Games\" books. But for the upcoming novel, she cites the Scottish Enlightenment philosopher David Hume.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The question 'Real or not real?' seems more pressing to me every day.\"\n\nFilm rights have not yet been announced. All four previous books have been adapted into movies, a multibillion dollar franchise for Lionsgate that featured Jennifer Lawrence portraying heroine Katniss Everdeen in the film versions of \"The Hunger Games,\" \"Catching Fire\" and \"Mockingjay,\" the last of which came out in two installments.\n\nThe first four \"Hunger Games\" books have sold more than 100 million copies and been translated into dozens of languages. Collins had seemingly ended the series after the 2010 publication of \"Mockingjay,\" writing in 2015 that it was \"time to move on to other lands.\" But four years later, she stunned readers and the publishing world when she revealed she was working on what became \"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes,\" released in 2020 and set 64 years before the first book.\n\nThe film version of \"Songbirds and Snakes,\" starring Tom Blyth and Rachel Zegler, came out last year.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Lionsgate announced that a new Hunger Games prequel movie, The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping, will arrive in 2026. The feature film news comes hours after Suzanne Collins revealed that her next Hunger Games novel, Sunrise on the Reaping, will be released in 2025.\n\nFrancis Lawrence, the director of four Hunger Games films, is in talks to direct. Color Force's Nina Jacobson and Brad Simpson will produce Sunrise on the Reaping.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\n\"From the beginning, Lionsgate has been a wonderful home and partner for the Hunger Games franchise, and I'm very excited to be collaborating with Adam and the team as we bring this next story to theaters in 2026,\" Suzanne Collins said in a statement.\n\nThe Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping will be set 24 years before the events of The Hunger Games. The story begins in Panem on the morning of the reaping for the 50th Hunger Games, better known as the Second Quarter Quell. Two boys and two girls from each district compete in the Quarter Quell. The 48 tributes are twice the amount that compete in a normal Hunger Games.\n\nHaymitch Abernathy of District 12 won the Second Quarter Quell. Years later, Haymitch mentored District 12's Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark to victory in the 74th Hunger Games. Woody Harrelson starred as Haymitch in the feature films.\n\nSunrise on the Reaping becomes the sixth film in the Hunger Games franchise. The first four films starred Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen, the girl from District 12 who won the Hunger Games and became one of the leading forces in the uprising against the Capitol. Released from 2012 to 2015, the first four Hunger Games films combined to gross nearly $3 billion at the worldwide box office.\n\nIn November 2023, Lionsgate released the fifth movie in the franchise, The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes. The prequel starred Tom Blyth as Coriolanus Snow. Years before becoming president of Panem, Snow mentored Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler) from District 12 ahead of the 10th Hunger Games. The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes grossed over $337 million on a budget of $100 million.\n\nThe Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping will be published on March 18, 2025. The movie will premiere in theaters on November 20, 2026.\n\nEditors' Recommendations Jurassic World 4 cast: Which actors will appear in new movie?

The new book begins with the reaping of the Fiftieth Hunger Games, set 24 years before the original \"Hunger Games\" novel, which came out in 2008, and 40 years after Collins' most recent book, \"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes.\"\n\nCollins has drawn upon Greek mythology and the Roman gladiator games for her earlier \"Hunger Games\" books. But for the upcoming novel, she cites the Scottish Enlightenment philosopher David Hume.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The question 'Real or not real?' seems more pressing to me every day.\"\n\nFilm rights have not yet been announced. All four previous books have been adapted into movies, a multibillion dollar franchise for Lionsgate that featured Jennifer Lawrence portraying heroine Katniss Everdeen in the film versions of \"The Hunger Games,\" \"Catching Fire\" and \"Mockingjay,\" the last of which came out in two installments.\n\nThe first four \"Hunger Games\" books have sold more than 100 million copies and been translated into dozens of languages. Collins had seemingly ended the series after the 2010 publication of \"Mockingjay,\" writing in 2015 that it was \"time to move on to other lands.\" But four years later, she stunned readers and the publishing world when she revealed she was working on what became \"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes,\" released in 2020 and set 64 years before the first book.\n\nThe film version of \"Songbirds and Snakes,\" starring Tom Blyth and Rachel Zegler, came out last year.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The story is set 24 years before the events of the original book and begins on the morning of the reaping for the 50th Hunger Games, the publisher said. The original novel and film depicted the 74th Hunger Games.\n\nIn the series, the reaping is the event in which participants for the Hunger Games, or \"tributes,\" are selected.\n\nJust hours after the book was announced, Lionsgate confirmed it's adapting \"Sunrise on the Reaping\" into a feature film, which will hit theaters in 2026. Francis Lawrence is in talks to direct after helming every movie in the series other than the 2012 original.\n\nCollins said in a statement her book was inspired \"by David Hume's idea of implicit submission and, in his words, 'the easiness with which the many are governed by the few.'\"\n\nShe added that the novel will offer a \"deeper dive into the use of propaganda and the power of those who control the narrative,\" adding, \"The question 'Real or not real?' seems more pressing to me every day.\"\n\nThis will be the first new \"Hunger Games\" novel since 2020's \"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes,\" a prequel set 64 years before the first book. It followed a young Coriolanus Snow, who later becomes the evil President Snow in the original series, and the plot centered around the 10th Hunger Games.\n\n\"The Hunger Games\" is set in a dystopian future where representatives from each district in the nation of Panem are forced to compete in a fight to the death every year. The original novels were published from 2008 to 2010, and from 2012 to 2015, Jennifer Lawrence starred in the blockbuster movie adaptations.\n\n5 things to know about 'Hunger Games' prequel book 'Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes'\n\nIn November, Lionsgate resurrected the movie series with an adaptation of \"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes\" starring Rachel Zegler and Tom Blyth.

The book will be set during the events of Haymitch's Hunger Games. It is not yet known if the prequel will be adapted into a movie.\n\nThe Hunger Games series is set to continue with a new book titled Sunrise on the Reaping. The multimedia franchise is based on the young adult novel series of the same name by Suzanne Collins. It kicked off with the trilogy The Hunger Games, Catching Fire, and Mockingjay, which were published between 2008 and 2010. Those titles were adapted into a quartet of movies, with Mockingjay split into two movies in a similar vein to the split-up finales of the Harry Potter and Twilight movies, released once a year between 2012 and 2015.\n\nHalf a decade after the film series ended, Collins released the prequel book The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes in 2020. The story, which followed the younger years of Panem's President Coriolanus Snow, was adapted into a movie in 2023 starring Tom Blyth in the lead role, which was originated onscreen by Donald Sutherland. Now, the new prequel Sunrise on the Reaping is set to extend the franchise on the page, and while many announcements about the book are yet to come, quite a few details are already known.\n\nRelated\n\nAll 5 Hunger Games Movies, Ranked Worst To Best\n\nWhich is the best Hunger Games movie? From the grime of the first Katniss installment to Snow's prequel, we rank all five entries in the franchise.\n\nSunrise On The Reaping's Release Date\n\nThe New Hunger Games Book Comes Half A Decade After The Last One\n\nThe Associated Press announcement of the new novel revealed that Sunrise on the Reaping will be published on March 18, 2025. This is almost exactly five years after the publication of The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, which was released on May 19, 2020. It is also nearly a decade and a half after the last of the original Hunger Games books, Mockingjay, was published on August 24, 2010.\n\nSunrise On The Reaping Story & Title: What Is It About?\n\nThe New Book Will Also Be A Prequel To The Hunger Games\n\nCollins has not yet revealed which characters will be central to the story of her new novel. However, she revealed quite a few details about the setting and inspiration for Sunrise on the Reaping. This includes the fact that it is another prequel to The Hunger Games, though it is not set directly after the events of 2020's The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes. It will take place roughly 40 years after that prequel and 24 years before the original Hunger Games novel.\n\nCollins will use the story to examine the nature of propaganda...\n\nThe novel will kick off with the Reaping for the Fiftieth Hunger Games, presumably following the goings-on of the games as well. Although this timeline has not been covered before in the novels, as the most recent Quarter Quell before Katniss' second Hunger Games, it has previously been mentioned in the original trilogy. Drawing inspiration from philosopher David Hume, Collins will use the story to examine the nature of propaganda, who holds the power to control the narrative and establish truth, and the \"easiness with which the many are governed by the few.\"\n\nWhich Hunger Games Characters Can Return In Sunrise On The Reaping\n\nHaymitch Abernathy Will Almost Certainly Return, Among Others\n\nClose\n\nAlthough no returning characters have been officially confirmed for Sunrise on the Reaping, quite a bit is already known about the Fiftieth Hunger Games. For instance, it has already been revealed in the original trilogy that the gimmick for the second Quarter Quell is that twice as many tributes were sought in the Reaping, resulting in 48 competitors entering the arena. Two of the competitors from District 12 were Katniss' future mentor Haymitch Abernathy and a female tribute named Maysilee Donner.\n\nHaymitch was the winner of the Fiftieth Hunger Games, though his use of the arena's force field to defeat his final opponent embarrassed The Capitol, resulting in the murders of his mother, brother, and girlfriend.\n\nIt seems more or less certain that Haymitch and Maysilee will be in the book, as well as an older Coriolanus Snow, who was President of Panem by that point in the storyline. However, there are quite a few other characters who are the right age to possibly appear and who have not been confirmed to have died before the Fiftieth Hunger Games. This includes Hunger Games host Caesar Flickerman, Snow's cousin Tigris, Tenth Hunger Games victor Lucy Gray Baird, District 13 leader President Coin, and older former victors seen in Catching Fire including Mags, Beetee, and Wiress.\n\nRelated\n\nHow Old The Hunger Games Cast Was Compared To Their Characters\n\nThe Hunger Games cast features the likes of Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, and Liam Hemsworth - how old were the main actors during filming?\n\nNone of the tributes from the original Hunger Games, including Katniss, Gale, and Peeta, were alive during the time of the Fiftieth Hunger Games, so they are unlikely to appear in Sunrise on the Reaping. There are also quite a few characters who were alive during that time but are unlikely to appear, as they would have probably been children or teenagers, but not ones who participated in the Hunger Games. This includes District 12's escort Effie Trinket, gamemaker Seneca Crane, Capitol stylist Cinna, and Katniss' mother and father.\n\nWill Sunrise On The Reaping Become A Movie?\n\nEvery Hunger Games Novel Has Been Adapted So Far\n\nThe Box Office Performance of the Hunger Games Movies\n\nTitle\n\nBudget\n\nBox Office\n\nThe Hunger Games (2012)\n\n$78 million\n\n$695.2 million\n\nCatching Fire (2013)\n\n~$130 million\n\n$865 million\n\nMockingjay - Part 1 (2014)\n\n~$125 million\n\n$755.4 million\n\nMockingjay - Part 2 (2015)\n\n$160 million\n\n$661.4 million\n\nThe Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes (2023)\n\n$100 million\n\n$337.4 million\n\nSo far, the film rights for the new Hunger Games novel have not yet been announced. However, a film adaptation of Sunrise on the Reaping seems entirely likely, as every previous novel in the series has been adapted to the big screen. While Songbirds and Snakes was the lowest-grossing movie in the franchise by far, followed by the second most recent title, Mockingjay - Part 2, both movies still performed solidly at the box office, which could indicate that a new movie would work well if it had a tidier budget like the original 2012 movie.\n\nSource: Associated Press\n\nThe Hunger Games\n\n$52 $55 Save $3\n\nThe Hunger Games is a multi-movie franchise starring Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen.

The question 'Real or not real?' seems more pressing to me every day.\"\n\nFilm rights have not yet been announced. All four previous books have been adapted into movies, a multibillion dollar franchise for Lionsgate that featured Jennifer Lawrence portraying heroine Katniss Everdeen in the film versions of \"The Hunger Games,\" \"Catching Fire\" and \"Mockingjay,\" the last of which came out in two installments.\n\nThe first four \"Hunger Games\" books have sold more than 100 million copies and been translated into dozens of languages. Collins had seemingly ended the series after the 2010 publication of \"Mockingjay,\" writing in 2015 that it was \"time to move on to other lands.\" But four years later, she stunned readers and the publishing world when she revealed she was working on what became \"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes,\" released in 2020 and set 64 years before the first book.\n\nThe film version of \"Songbirds and Snakes,\" starring Tom Blyth and Rachel Zegler, came out last year.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The upcoming novel starts at the reaping of the 50th Hunger Games, revealing more about Haymitch's past.\n\nSuzanne Collins has secretly been working on a new The Hunger Games prequel novel, Sunrise on the Reaping, and its story is one that fans have requested for years. The popular young adult dystopian book series started with the original trilogy -- The Hunger Games, Catching Fire, and Mockingjay -- which revolved around Katniss Everdeen, a teenage girl who volunteered to replace her sister as the District 12 female tribute at the 74th Hunger Games. Following the trilogy's success and the subsequent Hunger Games movie adaptations, Collins brought readers back to the world of Panem with The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes.\n\nSunrise on the Reaping will be released on March 18, 2025.\n\nMany were surprised to learn that the first Hunger Games tale Collins explored after Mockingjay was Coriolanus Snow's origins. However, once The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes was published, it soon became clear why the villain's story had to be told and how intriguing it truly was. After the prequel was released and the film adaptation premiered, many wondered if the author would continue writing one-off novels and speculated which narrative Collins could (and should) explore. Thankfully, Collins seemingly listened to fans and is now debuting Sunrise on the Reaping, which revolves around one of the best Hunger Games characters.\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\nSunrise On The Reaping Is Set 40 Years After The Ballad Of Songbirds & Snakes\n\nSunrise On The Reaping Takes Place 24 Years Before The First Hunger Games Book\n\nClose\n\nSunrise on the Reaping will chronicle the Second Quarter Quell, the Games Haymitch Abernathy won when he was 16 years old. Haymitch's time in the arena was occasionally mentioned during the original Hunger Games trilogy, so, readers know some information about that time in Katniss and Peeta's mentor's life. Since the Second Quarter Quell was the 50th Hunger Games, Sunrise on the Reaping takes place 40 years after The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, which featured Lucy Gray Baird winning the 10th Hunger Games.\n\nHunger Games Book\n\nTimeline\n\nRelease Date\n\nThe Hunger Games\n\n74th Hunger Games\n\nSeptember 14, 2008\n\nCatching Fire\n\n75th Hunger Games (Third Quarter Quell)\n\nSeptember 1, 2009\n\nMockingjay\n\nThe Second Rebellion\n\nAugust 24, 2010\n\nThe Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes\n\n10th Hunger Games\n\nMay 19, 2020\n\nSunrise on the Reaping\n\n50th Hunger Games (Second Quarter Quell)\n\nMarch 18, 2025\n\nThe upcoming Hunger Games book is also set 24 years before Haymitch mentored Katniss and Peeta during the 74th Hunger Games. As fans will recall, when the District 12 tributes meet Haymitch for the first time, he's a helpless drunk who has resigned himself to believing Katniss and Peeta would die, so, there was no use helping them. Of course, over time, he began to see their potential, but readers will learn more about why Haymitch turned out the way he did once Sunrise on the Reaping is published.\n\nRelated\n\n12 Biggest Ways The Ballad Of Songbirds & Snakes Connects To The Hunger Games\n\nThe Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes serves as a prequel to the first four Hunger Games movies and contains plenty of connections to the other films.\n\nWhat We Know About The Hunger Games Era Sunrise On The Reaping Is Set In\n\nThe Upcoming Hunger Games Novel Begins The Morning Of The Second Quarter Quell's Reaping\n\nAs of the writing of this article, all that is officially known about Sunrise on the Reaping is that it starts on the morning of the reaping for the 50th Hunger Games. However, a handful of other details about this era are known, thanks to previous books. The 50th Games was also the Second Quarter Quell, which designated that each district offer up twice the amount of tributes, meaning that four children would represent each district instead of two. So, in total, Haymitch's Hunger Games featured 48 tributes, and Woody Harrelson's character in the Hunger Games movies outlasted them all.\n\nThe Hunger Games\n\nThe Hunger Games is a multi-movie franchise starring Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen. The films are based on the young adult dystopian book series by author Suzanne Collins. The first film was released in 2012, followed by Catching Fire in 2013, Mockingjay Part 1 in 2014, and Mockingjay Part 2 in 2015. In 2023, the fifth film in the series was released, The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes.\n\nCreated by Suzanne Collins\n\nCast Jennifer Lawrence , Josh Hutcherson , Liam Hemsworth , Elizabeth Banks ,

Now that Collins has revealed that her next book in the franchise will arrive in 2025, Lionsgate has quickly announced that the film adaptation of The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping will arrive in 2026.\n\nSunrise on the Reaping will take place 40 years after The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes during the events of the 50th Hunger Games, which are also called the Second Quarter Quell. This follows Collins' tradition of focusing on the winners from District 12. Haymitch Abernathy, who was played by Woody Harrelson in the first four movies, was the victor of the Second Quarter Quell. Haymitch's win came 24 years before he mentored Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark to their unprecedented co-victory at the 74th Hunger Games. The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes' Lucy Gray Baird is the only other winner from District 12 who we know about.\n\n\"The Second Quarter Quell is legendary and looms large over the history of the Games, even into the time of Katniss Everdeen a quarter-century later,\" said Lionsgate's Adam Fogelson via The Hollywood Reporter. \"Like fans around the globe, we are eagerly anticipating this exciting return to Panem.\"\n\nFrancis Lawrence, who has directed every Hunger Games movie except the first one, is in negotiations to helm the new film.

Breaking Down Their Powers & Differences\n\nSummary\n\nGet ready for a new Hunger Games book and movie, likely based on Haymitch's 50th Games during the Second Quarter Quell. Author Suzanne Collins is set to release \"Sunrise on the Reaping\" in 2025, exploring the 50th Hunger Games with Haymitch Abernathy. Fans can expect a potential success with a Haymitch prequel as the 50th Games is an event filled with intrigue and nostalgia for the franchise.\n\nGet ready to return to the arena because another The Hunger Games prequel movie is all but guaranteed. The franchise's future has been in question since the release of the The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, which was set 64 years before the events of Katniss' story. While there has undoubtedly been a demand for movies, there were no more Hunger Games books to adapt, and it was unclear whether there ever would be.\n\nOf course, the world of The Hunger Games leaves a lot of room for exploration. Katniss was first reaped for the 74th Hunger Games, and it was following the 75th Games -- the Quarter Quell -- that she escaped the arena and began her war against the Capitol. The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes explored the 10th Hunger Games, which saw a young President Coriolanus Snow participate as one of the first batch of mentors. This leaves 72 unexplored Hunger Games, but author Suzanne Collins is checking another bloody event off this list.\n\nRelated\n\nNew Hunger Games Novel Releasing In 2025, Timeline Teases Original Trilogy Character's Return\n\nA new novel in The Hunger Games series is coming out in 2025, as writer Suzanne Collins returns with another entry in the dystopian universe.\n\nAnother Hunger Games Book Is On The Way (Which Means A Movie Probably Is Too)\n\nThe Next Hunger Games Book Is Likely To Picked Up By Lionsgate\n\nCollins has announced that she has a Hunger Games book in the works (via Variety), which will be set 40 years after the events of The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes. Titled Sunrise on the Reaping, Collins has explained that the prequel was inspired by Scottish philosopher David Hume's ideas about \"implicit submission\" and 'the easiness with which the many are governed by the few.\" The author said nothing about whether this book, which will be released on March 18, 2025, will be adapted into a movie -- though this is inevitable.\n\nWhile the film rights for Sunrise on the Reaping have yet to be announced, it can be assumed that this is part of a larger plan for the franchise.\n\nIt can be no coincidence that Collins is releasing a new book so soon after the 2023 release of the Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes movie. While the film rights for Sunrise on the Reaping have yet to be announced, it can be assumed that this is part of a larger plan for the franchise. Hunger Games and Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes director Francis Lawrence has already teased that he would be eager to make more movies set in Panem, but only if Collins writes a book first. Now that these criteria have been met, it seems we need only to sit back and wait.\n\nSunrise On The Reaping Will Be Set During Haymitch's 50th Hunger Games\n\nA Haymitch Hunger Games Prequel Movie Has Been Highly Requested\n\nClose\n\nAnother reason a Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping book is inevitable is that it will feature a highly marketable character. The teased placement of the upcoming book within the timeline is 40 years after Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, which indicates that the story will surround the 50th Hunger Games -- AKA, the Second Quarter Quell. This just happens to be when Haymitch Abernathy was crowned victor. As a fan-favorite character, a Sunrise on the Reaping movie would be a shoo-in. In fact, Lionsgate would be foolish not to jump on the opportunity.\n\nSunrise on the Reaping will be the perfect capper for the Hunger Games franchise since Haymitch is the last of District 12's four victors to get a screen adaptation. The first winner from the coal-minding District was Lucy Gray Baird, whose story was explored in The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes. The last was Katniss and Peeta, who obviously had their stories told in the central Hunger Games books and movies. Now, Haymitch, the second District 12 victor, is finally getting his chance in the sun(rise). Without a movie following his story, the Hunger Games film franchise would be incomplete.\n\nDistrict 12 had the fewest victors of on District in The Hunger Games.\n\nA Sunrise On The Reaping Movie Has The Potential To Be More Successful Than Ballad Of Songbirds & Snakes\n\nA Haymitch Prequel Is Likely To Be More Successful Than President Snow's\n\nThe Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes was an excellent book, and the perspective of Coriolanus Snow was invaluable to the overarching themes of The Hunger Games. The movie was a fairly done adaptation, too. However, the prequel film didn't perform as well as its franchise predecessors since it was a spinoff that movie audiences hadn't really asked for. Ever since the conclusion of The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, fans have been begging for spinoffs that followed Haymitch's Hunger Games, meaning the hype leading up to a potential Sunrise on the Reaping book will be massive.\n\nThe 50th Hunger Games is an event that is simply begging to be seen on the big screen, and it seems like Hunger Games fans won't have to wait much longer for this to happen.\n\nHaymitch isn't the only reason that the 50th Hunger Games has been a point of fascination. The Second Quarter Quell required four tributes from each District -- two boys and two girls -- which means that there were twice as many kids battling to the death. Moreover, they were placed in an astounding beauty arena full of rolling green hills, colorful flowers, and fluffy clouds. However, the meadows and forests were as poisonous as they were beautiful. It's an event that is simply begging to be seen on the big screen, and it seems like Hunger Games fans won't have to wait much longer for this to happen.\n\nThe Hunger Games\n\nThe Hunger Games is a multi-movie franchise starring Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen. The films are based on the young adult dystopian book series by author Suzanne Collins. The first film was released in 2012, followed by Catching Fire in 2013, Mockingjay Part 1 in 2014, and Mockingjay Part 2 in 2015. In 2023, the fifth film in the series was released, The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes.\n\nCreated by Suzanne Collins\n\nFirst Film The Hunger Games\n\nCast Jennifer Lawrence , Josh Hutcherson , Liam

Thought to be the only living victor from District 12 (before the first prequel book, The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, called that into question) Haymitch's Games were particularly memorable -- and brutal -- because of the special rules made for that Quarter Quell.\n\nIn the 50th Games, the amount of tributes reaped from each district were doubled, meaning two boys and two girls per district -- 48 tributes in total. Young Haymitch ultimately won by discovering a flaw in the arena's construction -- leading the Capitol to punish his unexpected victory by killing his family and closest friends.\n\n\"With Sunrise on the Reaping, I was inspired by David Hume's idea of implicit submission and, in his words, 'the easiness with which the many are governed by the few,'\" Collins said in a statement to the Associated Press. \"The story also lent itself to a deeper dive into the use of propaganda and the power of those who control the narrative. The question 'Real or not real?' seems more pressing to me every day.\"\n\nThe same day, it was announced that, like the books before it, Sunrise on the Reaping will be adapted into a feature film.

The new book begins with the reaping of the Fiftieth Hunger Games, set 24 years before the original \"Hunger Games\" novel, which came out in 2008, and 40 years after Collins' most recent book, \"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes.\"\n\nCollins has drawn upon Greek mythology and the Roman gladiator games for her earlier \"Hunger Games\" books. But for the upcoming novel, she cites the Scottish Enlightenment philosopher David Hume.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The question 'Real or not real?' seems more pressing to me every day.\"\n\nFilm rights have not yet been announced. All four previous books have been adapted into movies, a multibillion dollar franchise for Lionsgate that featured Jennifer Lawrence portraying heroine Katniss Everdeen in the film versions of \"The Hunger Games,\" \"Catching Fire\" and \"Mockingjay,\" the last of which came out in two installments.\n\nThe first four \"Hunger Games\" books have sold more than 100 million copies and been translated into dozens of languages. Collins had seemingly ended the series after the 2010 publication of \"Mockingjay,\" writing in 2015 that it was \"time to move on to other lands.\" But four years later, she stunned readers and the publishing world when she revealed she was working on what became \"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes,\" released in 2020 and set 64 years before the first book.\n\nThe film version of \"Songbirds and Snakes,\" starring Tom Blyth and Rachel Zegler, came out last year.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Shortly after, a film adaptation of the new book has been announced. Lionsgate will again adapt one of Collins' books and it's coming shortly after it is released.\n\nWhen is the Sunrise of the Reaping film coming out?\n\nLionsgate announced that a film adaptation of Sunrise on the Reaping is coming on November 20, 2026. That is just a year and a half after the novel will be released on March 18, 2025.\n\nThis is the fastest one of Collins' novels has been adapted after release. The first Hunger Games film came in 2012 -- almost four years after the novel was published. Catching Fire and Mockingjay came out in 2009 and 2010, respectively, with their film counterparts coming in 2013, 2014, and 2015 (Mockingjay was split into two films).\n\nNina Jacobson and Brad Simpson are returning to produce the Sunrise on the Reaping film under their Color Force banner. Jacobson has produced all five films in the franchise. Simpson joined the franchise in Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes.\n\nAdditionally, Francis Lawrence is in talks to direct the film. He has directed all four Hunger Games films since Catching Fire (Gary Ross directed the first film).\n\nWhat Suzanne Collins, Lionsgate have to say\n\n\"Suzanne Collins is a master storyteller and our creative north star,\" Lionsgate Motion Picture Group chair Adam Fogelson said in a statement. \"We couldn't be more fortunate than to be guided and trusted by a collaborator whose talent and imagination are so consistently brilliant.\n\n\"We know Hunger Games fans worldwide will be spellbound by where Suzanne has focused this next extraordinary story. The Second Quarter Quell is legendary and looms large over the history of the Games, even into the time of Katniss Everdeen a quarter-century later. Like fans around the globe, we are eagerly anticipating this exciting return to Panem,\" Fogelson continued.\n\nIn her statement, Collins similarly praised Lionsgate as a collaborator.\n\n\"From the beginning, Lionsgate has been a wonderful home and partner for the Hunger Games franchise, and I'm very excited to be collaborating with Adam and the team as we bring this next story to theaters in 2026,\" she said.\n\nWhat is Sunrise of the Reaping about?\n\nPer the press release, Sunrise on the Reaping \"will revisit the world of Panem 24 years before the events of The Hunger Games, starting on the morning of the reaping of the 50th Hunger Games, also known as the Second Quarter Quell.\"\n\nThe Hunger Games franchise\n\nThe decision to quickly green-light a Sunrise on the Reaping film adaption is both surprising and risky. After all, the Hunger Games is coming off a disappointing box office run of Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes.\n\nWhile the first four Hunger Games films were hits, grossing nearly $3 billion on their own, Songbirds and Snakes was a miss. It grossed just $327 million during its theatrical run. That is by far the lowest total in the franchise (Mockingjay Part 2 was next closest with $646 million).\n\nTom Blyth led the film as a young Coriolanus Snow. Donald Sutherland previously played the part in the Hunger Games films. Rachel Zegler also starred in the film as Lucy Gray Baird.\n\nJosh Andr\u00e9s Rivera, Viola Davis, Peter Dinklage, Jason Schwartzman, and Hunter Schafer also starred in the film.

Suzanne Collins and Scholastic have announced a new Hunger Games prequel book will arrive on shelves next year. And Sunrise on the Reaping will take fans back to a period that impacted the original trilogy. The novel focuses on one of the most consequential battle royales in Panem's history. It's set during the Second Quarter Quell, the supersized Hunger Games won by a young Haymitch Abernathy. Here's what we know about this Haymitch-centric Hunger Games novel coming in 2025.\n\nOn March 18, 2025, fans will get a full account of the Fiftieth Hunger Games. That's one of the most important Games ever. That's when Haymitch became a victor in name only. The new Hunger Games book, set 24 years before the original novel (and four decades after The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes), will start in the same way. It begins on the morning of the Games' reaping.\n\n\"Suzanne Collins has done it again, bringing us back to the world of Panem in order to ask us important questions about our own world,\" said Ellie Berger, President, Scholastic Trade, in the book's official announcement. \"Sunrise on the Reaping is a remarkable book, bringing new complexity, perspective, and revelations to a piece of the Hunger Games story that readers have longed to know more about.\"\n\nIn the release, Collins shared the inspiration behind her new entry into the Hunger Games world. \"With Sunrise on the Reaping, I was inspired by David Hume's idea of implicit submission and, in his words, 'the easiness with which the many are governed by the few,'\" she said. \"The story also lent itself to a deeper dive into the use of propaganda and the power of those who control the narrative. The question 'Real or not real?' seems more pressing to me every day.\"\n\nThere's no word yet on this new Haymitch Hungers Games book getting its own film. It would be shocking, though, if Lionsgate didn't ultimately adapt this book as it has Collins' four previous installments. The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes got its own movie just three years after the book's release. And this story, which will include Haymitch, should have even more appeal to fans of the original Hunger Games trilogy.\n\nAs mentioned, the new Haymitch-centric Hunger Games book will release on March 18, 2025.

Nina Jacobson and Brad Simpson, producers on the previous Hunger Games films, have returned for the next installment, while Francis Lawrence, who directed four of the five Hunger Games films beginning with Catching Fire, is in talks to direct.\n\n\"Suzanne Collins is a master storyteller and our creative north star,\" Lionsgate Motion Picture Group chair Adam Fogelson said. \"We couldn't be more fortunate than to be guided and trusted by a collaborator whose talent and imagination are so consistently brilliant. We know Hunger Games fans worldwide will be spellbound by where Suzanne has focused this next extraordinary story. The Second Quarter Quell is legendary and looms large over the history of the Games, even into the time of Katniss Everdeen a quarter-century later. Like fans around the globe, we are eagerly anticipating this exciting return to Panem.\"\n\nSunrise on the Reaping is another prequel in Collins' dystopian series, set 40 years after The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes but 24 years before the events of the original Hunger Games novel. It begins on the morning of the Reaping of the Fiftieth Hunger Games (aka the Second Quarter Quell). Fans of the franchise will remember this is the year Hunger Games character Haymitch Abernathy won.\n\nWhile it seems like a quickfire film adaptation of the next Hunger Games novel just hours after it was announced, Lionsgate had said in late 2015 that it was interested in making Hunger Games prequel films.\n\nTo that end, last year Lionsgate released a film version of Collins' 2020 prequel novel The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, starring Rachel Zegler and Tom Blyth. The film was a hit for Lionsgate, grossing $337.4 million at the global box office.\n\n\"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes rushes through a rich story that needs more time for its characters' conflicts and manipulations to feel earned,\" we wrote in our review of The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes.", "source": {"uri": "ign.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IGN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionsgate", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionsgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzanne_Collins", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Suzanne Collins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Hunger Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_adaptation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Film adaptation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Simpson_(producer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brad Simpson (producer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catching_Fire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catching Fire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nina_Jacobson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nina Jacobson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Lawrence", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Francis Lawrence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ballad_of_Songbirds_and_Snakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katniss_Everdeen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Katniss Everdeen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystopia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dystopia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games:_The_Ballad_of_Songbirds_&_Snakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Blyth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Blyth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Zegler", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rachel Zegler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_office", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Box office"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "label": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/06/pastedgraphic-1-1717687998451.png?width=1280", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9630046", "eventUri": "eng-9630046", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-11-", "textStart": 258, "textEnd": 269}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

Lionsgate couldn't wait another second to make a movie about it.\n\nNot only are fans of The Hunger Games getting an all-new novel from Suzanne Collins in 2025, but that book will be a movie soon after. Lionsgate announced today that they are already in development on a new Hunger Games movie based on The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping. The book will follow the events of The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes, which adapted into a film in 2023 with Rachel Zegler in the lead role. Collins's book will have about a year to get fans excited, as Lionsgate's statement says the movie adaptation will be in theaters in late 2026.\n\nIn Sunrise on the Reaping, the 50th Hunger Games will serve as the focus of the story. Collins says she was inspired by the works of philosopher David Hume and his examination of propaganda and control.\n\n\"With Sunrise on the Reaping, I was inspired by David Hume's idea of implicit submission and, in his words, 'the easiness with which the many are governed by the few,'\" Collins said in a statement. \"The story also lent itself to a deeper dive into the use of propaganda and the power of those who control the narrative. The question 'Real or not real?' seems more pressing to me every day.\"\n\nIt's hardly a surprise Lionsgate is putting out another Hunger Games film. Even before there were new books to adapt, they were reportedly toying with taking the property into TV. It is one of a number of franchises that Lionsgate has been keen to make more and more of, with other notable examples being Twilight, RED, and John Wick.\n\nAccording to the statement from Lionsgate, \"The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping will revisit the world of Panem 24 years before the events ofThe Hunger Games, starting on the morning of the reaping of the 50th Hunger Games, also known as the Second Quarter Quell.\"\n\nFrancis Lawrence, who has directed every Hunger Games film since Catching Fire, is in talks to return for Sunrise on the Reaping.\n\nFranchise producer Nina Jacobson, alongside her producing partner Brad Simpson, will return to produce The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping under their Color Force banner. It will be the sixth outing for Color Force since bringing the franchise to Lionsgate in 2012.\n\nThe Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping will be released in theaters in North America beginning on November 20, 2026.", "source": {"uri": "comicbook.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Comicbook"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionsgate", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionsgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzanne_Collins", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Suzanne Collins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Hunger Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_adaptation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Film adaptation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Zegler", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rachel Zegler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hume", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Hume"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ballad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Propaganda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Simpson_(producer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brad Simpson (producer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twilight_(novel_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twilight (novel series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_Force", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Color Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catching_Fire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catching Fire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nina_Jacobson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nina Jacobson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wick", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Wick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Lawrence", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Francis Lawrence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Record producer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2024/06/06/69b8ebc3-8e15-4f51-8800-4ac1dfa6066e/hunger-games-sunrise-on-the-reaping-logo.jpg?width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9630046", "eventUri": "eng-9630046", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-11-", "textStart": 2398, "textEnd": 2409}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

Author Suzanne Collins revealed a new Hunger Games prequel, titled Sunrise on the Reaping, is on the way. Mere hours later, Lionsgate confirmed a film adaptation is already in the works.\n\nThe film is scheduled to premiere on Nov. 20, 2026, just a year and a half after the book comes out on March 18, 2025. Like 2024's The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, Sunrise on the Reaping will center on a pivotal Hunger Games from well before Katniss Everdeen's time. According to summaries from Scholastic and posts from The Hunger Games' social media accounts, the Games in question will be the 50th, otherwise known as the Second Quarter Quell.\n\nHunger Games fans will immediately recognize the Second Quarter Quell as being the Games won by Haymitch Abernathy, Katniss and Peeta's mentor. The novel Catching Fire features a sequence where Katniss and Peeta watch the Quarter Quell, but that scene didn't make it to the screen.\n\nDetails about who is directing and starring in Sunrise on the Reaping have yet to come out, but a statement from Collins provides a deeper idea of the themes fans can expect from both.\n\n\"With Sunrise on the Reaping, I was inspired by David Hume's idea of implicit submission and, in his words, 'the easiness with which the many are governed by the few,'\" Collins said in a statement. \"The story also lent itself to a deeper dive into the use of propaganda and the power of those who control the narrative.

The new novel will depict the 50th Hunger Games, a.k.a. the Second Quarter Quell, meaning it takes place 24 years before Katniss Everdeen volunteered for the 74th Hunger Games in the first novel. In fact, as the title indicates, the new book will open at daybreak on the day of reaping (selection of tributes) for the Second Quarter Quell, which involves twice as many tributes as a typical Hunger Games competition.\n\nScholastic's announcement doesn't highlight this, but astute fans of the series will remember the Second Quarter Quell was the tournament in which Katniss' mentor Haymitch Abernathy (played by Woody Harrelson in the film adaptations) participated.\n\nShortly after Scholastic's announcement, Lionsgate joined in to say that they are already planning to adapt Sunrise on the Reaping into a feature film.\n\nWant more movie news?

In 2020, Collins returned to her world of Panem with the prequel novel The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, which explained the origin of Coriolanus Snow.\n\nThe Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes was then turned into a successful movie last year, starring Rachel Zegler as Lucy Gray Baird and Tom Blyth as the young Snow.

The new book begins with the reaping of the Fiftieth Hunger Games, set 24 years before the original \"Hunger Games\" novel, which came out in 2008, and 40 years after Collins' most recent book, \"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes.\"\n\nCollins has drawn upon Greek mythology and the Roman gladiator games for her earlier \"Hunger Games\" books.

(Also Read: Avengers 5 director, cast and release date: Everything we know so far about the new MCU installment)\n\nSuzanne Collins, author of The Hunger Games, is writing a new book called Sunrise on the Reaping, which will be released in 2025. An adaptation of the book is slated for release in theatres on November 20, 2026. Francis Lawrence, who directed every Hunger Games installment since Catching Fire in 2013, is in talks to direct the film.\n\nSunrise on the Reaping will revisit the world of Panem 24 years before the events in the Hunger Games trilogy and 40 years after the events of The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes. The story will start on the morning of the reaping of the 50th Hunger Games, the Second Quarter Quell. Haymitch Abernathy, portrayed by Woody Harrelson in the films, will be the story's centre. Haymitch later mentors Jennifer Lawrence's Katniss and Josh Hutcherson's Peeta in the 74th Hunger Games.\n\nIn a statement, Adam Fogelson, chairman of Lionsgate said, \"Suzanne Collins is a master storyteller and our creative north star. We couldn't be more fortunate than to be guided and trusted by a collaborator whose talent and imagination are so consistently brilliant. The Second Quarter Quell is legendary and looms large over the history of the Games, even into the time of Katniss Everdeen a quarter-century later.\"\n\nThe Hunger Games film franchise has made more than $3.3 billion at the box office worldwide, with Catching Fire being the highest-grossing film with $865 million. The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes didn't live up to the original saga but managed to turn a profit due to its budget. That film was focused on a young Coriolanus Snow, who later became Panem's tyrannical leader.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Hunger Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ballad_of_Songbirds_and_Snakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzanne_Collins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suzanne Collins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catching_Fire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catching Fire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katniss_Everdeen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Katniss Everdeen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Lawrence", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Francis Lawrence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Harrelson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Woody Harrelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionsgate", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lionsgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolanus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coriolanus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_series", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Film series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peeta_Mellark", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peeta Mellark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lawrence", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Lawrence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_office", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Box office"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/06/06/1600x900/Hunger_Games_prequel_1717690466579_1717690477624.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9630046", "eventUri": "eng-9630046", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-11-", "textStart": 577, "textEnd": 588}], "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

Not even one year out from the release of The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes, the first entry in the dystopian movie franchise since 2015, Lionsgate has announced that a sixth film is already on its way.\n\nJust like Ballad was based on a standalone prequel novel from author and creator Suzanne Collins, so is this new movie -- titled The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping. They really didn't waste time on adapting this one either. Collins announced the book's existence on June 6... Just a few hours later, the screen adaptation was handed a release date!\n\nSo what do we know as dawn breaks on Sunrise on the Reaping? Here's everything already revealed about your next return trip to Panem.\n\nIn short, this one's about Haymitch. As hardcore Hunger Gamers will know, before he was mentor to Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark, Haymitch was the winner of the 50th Hunger Games, the Second Quarter Quell games. As we saw in Catching Fire, based around the 75th Hunger Games, the Quarter Quells are always unusual and unique to make them a greater celebratory spectacle.\n\nSo, just to clarify the math, Sunrise on the Reaping will be set 24 years before the original Hunger Games begins and 40 years after the events of Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes. Get ready to follow a young Haymitch Abernathy from the day of the reaping to his dark victory, making him the first winner from District 12 until Katniss and Peeta.\n\nJust as you would expect, Collins has teased that the new book/film will tap into the kind of timely topics that have always underpinned the franchise:\n\n\"I was inspired by David Hume's idea of implicit submission and, in his words, 'the easiness with which the many are governed by the few,\" Collins has revealed. \"The story also lent itself to a deeper dive into the use of propaganda and the power of those who control the narrative. The question 'Real or not real?' seems more pressing to me every day.\"\n\nAt this point, it's too early for there to be any concrete casting intel, but the fact that Haymitch will be the main character means that we know they're looking for a young actor to take over from Woody Harrelson in the role. What's more, there's the potential for Harrelson himself to appear as the present-day Haymitch, perhaps for a cameo or wraparound narrative.\n\nAs for who will be behind the camera, don't all pass out at once but it looks like director Francis Lawrence could return once more to helm this next installment in the series. Lawrence (no relation to former leading lady Jennifer) has directed every single Hunger Games film except the first one, helmed by Gary Ross. Deadline reports that Lawrence is only in talks at present, though, so it's possible he may pass on the project and hand the reins of the franchise to a fresh pair of hands.\n\nI told you they weren't waiting around with this one. While Sunrise on the Reaping the book is set to hit shelves on March 18, 2025, Sunrise the Reaping the movie is set to hit screens on Nov. 20, 2026 -- just a year and three-quarters later. For comparison, it took over three years for 2020 book Ballad to be translated into a film.\n\nEven so, Lionsgate has still got a couple of years before its premiere so the studio has plenty of time to take care with the scripting, the casting, and the other aspects of pre-production in order to make sure this one clears the high bar set by the previous offerings of the saga. The same might not be true of the poor saps in these films, but Hunger Games fans never lose.", "source": {"uri": "wegotthiscovered.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "We Got This Covered"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christian_bone@wegotthiscovered.com", "name": "Christian Bone", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzanne_Collins", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Suzanne Collins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Hunger Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ballad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionsgate", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lionsgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peeta_Mellark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peeta Mellark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katniss_Everdeen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Katniss Everdeen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystopia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dystopia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_adaptation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Film adaptation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catching_Fire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catching Fire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hume", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Hume"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Lawrence", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Francis Lawrence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Harrelson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Woody Harrelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Propaganda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deadline Hollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cameo appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Ross", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gary Ross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-production", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pre-production"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Screenplay"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/The-Hunger-Games-1.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9630046", "eventUri": "eng-9630046", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 522, "textEnd": 528}, {"amb": false, "date": "2018-03-", "textStart": 2950, "textEnd": 2958}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-11-", "textStart": 3021, "textEnd": 3028}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

This new Hunger Games book comes after five years since Scholastic first launched Collins' Coriolanus Snow-centered prequel.\n\n\"With Sunrise on the Reaping, I was inspired by David Hume's idea of implicit submission and, in his words, 'the easiness with which the many are governed by the few.'\" Collins said in a statement via press release. \"The story also lent itself to a deeper dive into the use of propaganda and the power of those who control the narrative.

The character was originally portrayed by Woody Harrelson in the film franchise. Unlike The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes, fans already have an idea of what to expect from the upcoming prequel novel since 2009's Catching Fire had mentioned key details about how Haymitch won his game, which featured 48 tributes rather than 24, while Katniss and Peeta were preparing for their own Quarter Quell.\n\nThe novel's initial synopsis reads, \"Sunrise on the Reaping will revisit the world of Panem twenty-four years before the events of The Hunger Games, starting on the morning of the reaping of the Fiftieth Hunger Games, also known as the Second Quarter Quell.\"\n\nThe upcoming novel will potentially explore more about Haymitch's origins, including his life in District 12.

Scholastic announced Sunrise on the Reaping will land on March 18, 2025. It will be the fifth installment in the wildly popular Hunger Games franchise. This new novel will actually follow The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, and take place 40 years later. This time around, the 50th Hunger Games will serve as the focus of the story. Collins was inspired by the works of philosopjher David Hume and his focuses on propoganda and control. (That's a topic not too unfamiliar to the series as information flow and its control served as the backbone of the original trilogy.) Still both Scholastic and the author have to be thrilled to be adding to a franchise with a massive existing fanbase.\n\n\"With 'Sunrise on the Reaping,' I was inspired by David Hume's idea of implicit submission and, in his words, 'the easiness with which the many are governed by the few,'\" Collins said in a statement. \"The story also lent itself to a deeper dive into the use of propaganda and the power of those who control the narrative. The question 'Real or not real?' seems more pressing to me every day.\"\n\nAs of the time of writing, there have been no confirmed film rights. However, the previous entries in The Hunger Games franchise have all been adapted by Lionsgate. Last year's entry, The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes was one of the big surprises of 2023's box office. Safe to say, the movie studio is probably already monitoring the release of Sunrise on the Reaping and what possibilities exist for it on the big screen after the prequel's recent performance.\n\nWhat About Other Hunger Games Spinoffs?\n\nWhile last year's effort, The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, translated quite well to the screen, fans have been wondering about some more recent corners of the franchise to explore. It's no secret that there are viewers who would love nothing more than to learn about beloved characters from that first book series. Scroll through social media at any point here and you'll see calls for more books about Haymitch Abernathy's expeirence in the 50th Hunger Games. Even more prevalent are calls for more Finnick Odair after his trials in the 65th Hunger Games.\n\nWhile Collins hasn't really said her peace on those ideas, she's the one holding the pen. Franchise director Francis Lawrence defers to her judgement on such matters. The filmmaker spoke to Entertainment Weekly about the possibility of more Hunger Games spinoffs and he's open to the idea. That's all well and good, but you need Collins to actually provide a road map for such an endeavor and the director is very confident in her ideas and shape for the series overall.\n\n\"I liked being part of the series originally because the stories are great,\" Lawrence told the outlet. \"But what was always gratifying was that they were always about something. Suzanne always writes from a thematic foundation. The original ones were all about the consequences of war. [Songbirds and Snakes is] about the state of nature.\"\n\n\"That's what makes them feel rich and not superficial, and I think it's why they've stood the test of time, honestly... If Suzanne has another thematic idea that she feels fits into the world of Panem -- whether that's with new people [or] familiar characters [like] Finnick, Haymitch, whoever -- I'd be really interested in looking at it and being a part of it,\" the director observered. \"But I don't have any pull of just going, 'I would love to do Finnick's games.' He's a great character, but what's the thematic underpinnings that make it worth telling and relevant?\"\n\nDo you want a Sunrise on the Reaping movie?

The new book begins with the reaping of the Fiftieth Hunger Games, set 24 years before the original \"Hunger Games\" novel, which came out in 2008, and 40 years after Collins' most recent book, \"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes.\"\n\nCollins has drawn upon Greek mythology and the Roman gladiator games for her earlier \"Hunger Games\" books. But for the upcoming novel, she cites the Scottish Enlightenment philosopher David Hume.\n\nPeople are also reading...

All four previous books have been adapted into movies, a multibillion dollar franchise for Lionsgate that featured Jennifer Lawrence portraying heroine Katniss Everdeen in the film versions of \"The Hunger Games,\" \"Catching Fire\" and \"Mockingjay,\" the last of which came out in two installments.\n\nThe first four \"Hunger Games\" books have sold more than 100 million copies and been translated into dozens of languages. Collins had seemingly ended the series after the 2010 publication of \"Mockingjay,\" writing in 2015 that it was \"time to move on to other lands.\" But four years later, she stunned readers and the publishing world when she revealed she was working on what became \"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes,\" released in 2020 and set 64 years before the first book.\n\nThe film version of \"Songbirds and Snakes,\" starring Tom Blyth and Rachel Zegler, came out last year.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The same could be said for all sorts of projects dropping in the year to come, and another piece of the puzzle has fallen into place, thanks to The Hunger Games author Suzanne Collins announcing the next prequel novel, Sunrise on the Reaping.\n\nAs the book itself is set for a March 18, 2025 release date, there's already a film adaptation in the works, complete with when to expect the next Hunger Games movie in theaters. What's more, there's also some clues about what the sequel to The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes might be about. And there's a good chance that a handful of familiar faces will play prominent roles in this new blast from the past.\n\nPer a press release from Lionsgate, Sunset on the Reaping will be on bookshelves staring March 18, 2025; with the cinematic adaptation scheduled for debut on November 20, 2026. Franchise stalwart Francis Lawrence is returning to direct once again, marking his fifth directing stint with The Hunger Games overall. A\n\nThis time, there's no suggestion on who will be adapting the film's screenplay, but anyone who's read The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes review on CinemaBlend would know that this prospect is rather welcomed. Even if the new prequel, titled Sunrise on the Reaping, jumps 40 years past Songbirds and Snakes' ambiguous ending, and right into the 50th Hunger Games.\n\nIn her statement teasing the book's contents to AP News, Suzanne Collins provided more of what fans should expect from this new Hunger Games prequel. Those details read as follows:\n\nWhile the story is a bit vague at the moment, other than it starts on the morning of this infamous day in Panem history, an overall picture is starting to emerge based on the breadcrumbs Collins has left her fans. Starting with the fact that the novel's setting against the 50th Hunger Games, also known as the Second Quarter Quell, means that we'll probably run into none other than future Tribute mentor Haymitch Abernathy.\n\nPlayed by Woody Harrelson in The Hunger Games trilogy, we just might get to see further into the tragic past that shaped him into the embittered man we saw at the start of Jennifer Lawrence's adventures as Katniss Everdeen. Especially because this Second Quarter Quell saw him as the victor, and we all know what happens to people who win The Hunger Games over time.\n\nSunrise on the Reaping's early details also hint to some further interesting prospects of note. More specifically, the theme of propaganda taking priority in this new Hunger Games story means that we might see the further ascendance of an older Coriolanus Snow. The importance of optics and public relations could also show us his further development after the events of The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, and the state that Panem is in as a result of that unknown history.\n\nAlso, wherever there's propaganda, there's cameras. And wherever there's cameras in Panem, there's a fine chance that a Flickerman will be on hand to gladhand the audience. Though the question will be if Sunrise on the Reaping will depict the later reign of Jason Schwartzman's Lucky Flickerman in that arena, or if we'll see Stanley Tucci's Caesar start to take his place in history.\n\nAs you can see, the absence of plot details makes the next Hunger Games prequel a rather intriguing enigma. But from where I'm standing, that's a good thing; especially with the longer than expected time jump in installments. Much like the 2024 movie Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, an established franchise is getting an expansion to its lore that still leaves room for some backfilling, should the audience crave it in the long run.\n\nSunrise on the Reaping will be available on shelves starting March 18, 2025; with the film version currently set to bow on November 20, 2026. In the meantime, The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is currently streaming through the Starz library. Should you not have a direct subscription to that platform, it can easily be added to a Prime Video subscription.", "source": {"uri": "cinemablend.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CINEMABLEND"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_reyes@cinemablend.com", "name": "Mike Reyes", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzanne_Collins", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Suzanne Collins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Hunger Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ballad_of_Songbirds_and_Snakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionsgate", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lionsgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Lawrence", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Francis Lawrence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games:_The_Ballad_of_Songbirds_&_Snakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Harrelson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Woody Harrelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lawrence", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Lawrence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Screenplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_adaptation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Film adaptation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Propaganda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_the_Planet_of_the_Apes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starz", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Starz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolanus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coriolanus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Tucci", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Tucci"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katniss_Everdeen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Katniss Everdeen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Schwartzman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jason Schwartzman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Julius Caesar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZdMYhkwvtTXbhKkktSiEYQ-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9630046", "eventUri": "eng-9630046", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-03-", "textStart": 377, "textEnd": 385, "freq": 3}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-11-", "textStart": 914, "textEnd": 925, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

He was played by Woody Harrelson, opposite Jennifer Lawrence's Katniss and Josh Hutcherson's Peeta, in the original quartet of movies.\n\nOther than the time period, we don't know too much else about the book so far, but Collins has given us some hints about the themes explored in the novel. \"With Sunrise on the Reaping, I was inspired by David Hume's idea of implicit submission and, in his words, 'the easiness with which the many are governed by the few,'\" she told the AP. \"The story also lent itself to a deeper dive into the use of propaganda and the power of those who control the narrative.

The 50th Hunger Games, known as the Second Quarter Quell, featured 4 tributes per district as a reminder of rebellion consequences. The protagonist of the new novel remains a mystery, leaving fans to wonder who will take center stage in the next Panem adventure.\n\nReturn to Panem once more as Hunger Games author, Suzanne Collins announced another book that's scheduled to come out in 2025. Sunrise on the Reaping is the name of the second prequel and takes place 40 years after The Ballads of Songbirds and Snakes. However, unlike the first sequel, it's still unknown if a film adaptation will also be produced.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that the fifth Hunger Games installment will take place during the 50th Hunger Games, also known as the Second Quarter Quell. According to Collins, she teased that unlike previous titles, which took inspiration from Greek mythology and culture, this story took inspiration from Scottish Enlightenment philosopher David Hume.\n\n\"With 'Sunrise on the Reaping,' I was inspired by David Hume's idea of implicit submission and, in his words, 'the easiness with which the many are governed by the few,'\" said Collins. \"The story also lent itself to a deeper dive into the use of propaganda and the power of those who control the narrative. The question 'Real or not real?' seems more pressing to me every day.\"\n\nAs of writing, film rights for the book have not yet been announced. So it's still unknown who will star in it. However, franchise producer, Nina Jacobson told Collider that they're interested in releasing more movies based on the popular YA dystopia. At the same time, the plot for the book is still under wraps, aside from the timeline of the events.\n\nThe Hunger Games books were first released in 2008 and the first film adaptation entered theaters in 2012. In 2020, Collins released The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, and its film adaptation was released 3 years later. The prequel followed the events of the 10th Hunger Games, featuring a young President Snow, played by Tom Blyth, and District 12's first victor, Lucy Gray Baird, played by Rachel Zegler. The film earned over $337 million at the box office and received an average critics score of 63 percent on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nWhat do we know about the 50th Hunger Games?\n\nThe 50th Hunger Games took place 14 years before Katniss volunteered as Tribute in the first novel. According to Catching Fire, the Quarter Quell happens every 25 years since the first game, as a way to remind the districts about the rebellion. Due to this, the rules regarding tributes change, and the changes have a special reminder attached to them. During the 50th Hunger Games, 4 children per district were sent to the games as it was a reminder that \"two rebels died for each Capitol citizen.\"\n\nThe 50th Hunger Games was when Haymitch Abernathy from District 12 was sent in as tribute and won. He took advantage of the arena's force field to defeat his last opponent. According to the third book, Mockingjay, it was his actions in the games that led to his entire family and girlfriend's deaths as President Snow believed that his stunt was \"an act of defiance.\"\n\nIt is unknown if Haymitch will be the main character in the upcoming novel.

The new book begins with the reaping of the Fiftieth Hunger Games, set 24 years before the original \"Hunger Games\" novel, which came out in 2008, and 40 years after Collins' most recent book, \"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes.\"\n\nCollins has drawn upon Greek mythology and the Roman gladiator games for her earlier \"Hunger Games\" books. But for the upcoming novel, she cites the Scottish Enlightenment philosopher David Hume.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Collins had seemingly ended the series after the 2010 publication of \"Mockingjay,\" writing in 2015 that it was \"time to move on to other lands.\" But four years later, she stunned readers and the publishing world when she revealed she was working on what became \"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes,\" released in 2020 and set 64 years before the first book.\n\nThe film version of \"Songbirds and Snakes,\" starring Tom Blyth and Rachel Zegler, came out last year.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

If you buy something through this post, the publisher may get a share of the sale.\n\nA new \"Hunger Games\" by Suzanne Collins has been announced. The upcoming novel, titled \"Sunrise on the Reaping,\" will be released next year on March 18, 2025. According to publisher Scholastic, it will start on the morning of the reaping of the Fiftieth Hunger Games, also known as the Second Quarter Quell.\n\nAs reported by the Associated Press, the fifth volume in Collins' dystopian series will be a prequel set 40 years after the events of \"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes\", and 24 years before the events of the original \"Hunger Games\" novel.\n\nThe \"Hunger Games\" series, originally adapted into four successful films starring Jennifer Lawrence, has earned a remarkable $3.3 billion worldwide, solidifying its status as the 20th highest-grossing film franchise.\n\nPrequel, \"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes\" was also adapted as a film in 2023, featuring Rachel Zegler and Tom Blyth and earning $337.4 million globally.\n\nIn our review of the 2023 film we said, \"It works as a faithful adaptation of Suzanne Collins' prequel novel, yet falls flat when it comes to depicting the maze of interpersonal manipulation and emotions that make up its main characters' ultimately doomed relationship.\"\n\n\"Actors Tom Blyth and Rachel Zegler are brilliant additions to the franchise with equally magnetic takes on their very different characters, but aren't given enough time to fully flesh them out.\"\n\nThere are no official announcements regarding film rights for the \"Sunrise on the Reaping\". But, the novel could potentially follow in the footsteps of its predecessors and become a major motion picture.\n\nAuthor Suzanne Collins has shared her inspiration for the new novel with AP, citing David Hume's concept of implicit submission and the dynamics between rulers and the ruled.\n\n\"The story also lent itself to a deeper dive into the use of propaganda and the power of those who control the narrative. The question 'Real or not real?' seems more pressing to me every day.\"\n\n\"Sunrise on the Reaping\" will be set set during the Second Quarter Quell, which was won by Haymitch Abernathy. Haymitch was portrayed by Woody Harrelson in the 2012 film \"The Hunger Games\".\n\nIf you're looking to catch up before the release of \"Sunrise on the Reaping\" next year, check out our guides on How to Read the Hunger Games Books in Order and How to Watch the Hunger Games Movies in Chronological Order.\n\nFor even more book news this month, consider IGN's top picks for the best sci-fi fantasy novels in June, including Service Model by Adrian Tchaikovsky, Running Close to the Wind by Alexandra Rowland, Moonbound by Robin Sloan, and more.\n\nHunger Games Box Set See paperback and hardcover options.

First, a new novel in the popular young adult fiction series was announced, and then a movie adaption of that fifth book was confirmed shortly after. The odds are very much in this fanbase's favor right now.\n\n\"Sunrise on the Reaping\" by author Suzanne Collins will launch in novel form on March 18, 2025, and the movie version will follow some 20 months later as it's scheduled to hit theaters on November 20, 2026. Naturally, the movie will adopt the same title as its source material, and will be released as \"The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping.\"\n\nBeyond a single social media post confirming the big screen adaptation and its release date, nothing else is known about \"The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping\" movie. There's no cast information, and it hasn't been announced if longtime franchise helmer Francis Lawrence will return in the director's chair (though based on a 2023 interview with Variety, it would appear very likely).\n\nThere's little known about the movie, but we have a few extra tidbits regarding the novel, and we can logically assume these details will carry over. According to publisher Scholastic, \"Sunrise on the Reaping will revisit the world of Panem twenty-four years before the events of The Hunger Games, starting on the morning of the reaping of the Fiftieth Hunger Games, also known as the Second Quarter Quell.\"\n\nDedicated fans will know that the 50th Hunger Games was won by a certain Haymitch Abernathy (portrayed by Woody Harrelson in the movies), which suggests the gruff District 12 resident (and mentor to Katniss Everdeen) could be the story's star. Fans have been requesting a book/movie focused on Haymitch's games for years. However, \"Catching Fire\" does explain how he managed to win his games, which could mean that Collins opts to tell the story from a different perspective instead.\n\nEither way, a return to Panem will be greatly welcomed by fans and general audiences alike. The most recent movie in the franchise, \"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbird & Snakes\", was a prequel that explored the early years of ruthless ruler President Snow (played by Tom Blyth), and he could also feature in \"Sunrise on the Reaping\" as the story will be set during his tyrannical reign. Whether Blyth would return for the next \"Hunger Games\" movie hasn't been confirmed at this stage.\n\nExpect further details to trickle out over the month ahead, though it's likely that casting details won't be formally announced until the novel has been released to ensure eager readers aren't spoiled of any surprises. The movie's production date may be scheduled for after March 2025 for that same reason.\n\nIf this new trip to the dystopian world of Panem has you in the mood to rewatch the previous entries in the franchise, here's how to watch \"The Hunger Games\" movies.", "source": {"uri": "tomsguide.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tom's Guide"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rory_mellon@tomsguide.com", "name": "Rory Mellon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Hunger Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_adult_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Young adult fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzanne_Collins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suzanne Collins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_adaptation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Film adaptation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Lawrence", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Francis Lawrence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Harrelson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Woody Harrelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholastic_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scholastic Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Blyth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Blyth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catching_Fire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catching Fire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katniss_Everdeen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Katniss Everdeen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystopia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dystopia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prequel"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Movies", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/phR2VEtNHrrp25QGdBn4hC-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9630046", "eventUri": "eng-9630046", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-03-", "textStart": 353, "textEnd": 361}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-11-", "textStart": 461, "textEnd": 472}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

It came at the tail end of the decade-defining young adult novel craze, and while the books weren't the most sophisticated, their film adaptations brought the industry closer to prestige than ever. The Hunger Games and its sequels felt like \"real\" movies: aesthetically and narratively complex, and featuring a caliber of actors few expected to see in YA dystopia.\n\nWhen the franchise made a surprising comeback last year with The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, it reaffirmed just how much potential it still had. The fans who'd grown up with the series all seemed to want more, and with a new book on the horizon, the Hollywood powers that be clearly feel the same.\n\nHunger Games author Suzanne Collins has announced she's working on a new prequel. Set to debut in March 2025, the novel -- Sunrise on the Reaping -- will follow one of the saga's most infamous Games. Sunrise takes place 40 years after The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, and is set to depict the 50th annual Hunger Games, also known as the Second Quarter Quell. Katniss' mentor, Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson in the original trilogy), famously won that year, coming out victorious against 47 other Tributes. It was among the bloodiest Games in history, so Sunrise is poised to deliver some gruesome spectacle alongside Haymitch's origin story.\n\nLionsgate has adapted every Hunger Games novel thus far, and the studio isn't wasting any time with Sunrise. It's teaming up with director Francis Lawrence for an adaptation of the novel, which will hit theaters in 2026.\n\n\"With Sunrise on the Reaping, I was inspired by David Hume's idea of implicit submission and, in his words, 'the easiness with which the many are governed by the few,'\" Collins told the Associated Press. \"The story also lent itself to a deeper dive into the use of propaganda and the power of those who control the narrative. The question 'Real or not real?' seems more pressing to me every day.\"\n\nSongbirds and Snakes traced the origins of that propaganda machine, and served as a quasi-origin story for President Coriolanus Snow. Before he became the tyrant of the original trilogy, Snow was a Games mentor. He introduced the pageantry and stakes that turned a gruesome, gritty punishment into pure spectacle, and while Songbirds and Snakes only showed us the beginning of his influence, it will be on full display in Sunrise on the Reaping.\n\nLionsgate is clearly all-in on the idea, and if Sunrise can match the success of its predecessors, it may set the tone for even more prequels. While audiences are growing wary of IP cash grabs, Songbirds and Snakes was a financial success, suggesting fans are hungry for even more stories set in the world of Panem. As long as Collins and Lionsgate treat the stories with care, we could see a beloved teen sensation make a major comeback.", "source": {"uri": "inverse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inverse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Hunger Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ballad_of_Songbirds_and_Snakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_adult_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Young adult fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzanne_Collins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suzanne Collins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystopia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dystopia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_culture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Popular culture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_adaptation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Film adaptation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionsgate", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lionsgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katniss_Everdeen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Katniss Everdeen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Lawrence", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Francis Lawrence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilogy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trilogy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Harrelson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Woody Harrelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_story", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Origin story"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Propaganda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolanus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coriolanus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hume", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Hume"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intellectual property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2024/6/6/085a5c04/futuristic-cyborg-religion-control.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9630046", "eventUri": "eng-9630046", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

Suzanne Collins Is Releasing a New Prequel Set During the 50th Games", "body": "Suzanne Collins surprised The Hunger Games fans by announcing another book in the series. Sunrise on the Reaping will officially expand the bestselling series next year and delve deeper into one of its most interesting characters.\n\nSince the series started in 2005 with the release of The Hunger Games, it has quickly grown to become one of the bestselling Young Adult book series of all time. The series is set in the fictional world of Panem, where society is divided into 13 districts ruled by the wealthy and oppressive Capitol. While the districts suffer from poverty and famine, they are dissuaded from starting a rebellion by the construction of The Hunger Games after the last uprising.\n\nEvery year, each district must offer a boy and girl to compete in a competition where they fight to the death as a reminder of the Capitol's power and hold over them. However, when Katniss Everdeen enters the competition, her unintentional act of rebellion has far-reaching implications for all of Panem.\n\nGiven that the original trilogy starts with the 74th Hunger Games, there has always been room to expand the series by exploring past competitions and victors. Collins grasped this opportunity once before with her prequel The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, which takes viewers back to the 10th Hunger Games, where Coriolanus Snow serves as a mentor. Now, she's going back in time again with Sunrise on the Reaping.\n\nOn May 6, Collins dropped the surprise announcement via Scholastic that another Hunger Games prequel is on the way. Scholastic dropped the temporary cover of Sunrise on the Reaping, revealing the book will be released on March 18, 2025. It is already available for pre-order for fans who want to ensure they'll be the first to get their hands on the new book.\n\nThe official synopsis for Sunrise on the Reaping reads:\n\nSunrise on the Reaping will revisit the world of Panem twenty-four years before the events of The Hunger Games, starting on the morning of the reaping of the Fiftieth Hunger Games, also known as the Second Quarter Quell.\n\nAlthough no characters have been officially announced, readers familiar with The Hunger Games will know exactly who could appear in this story: Haymitch Abernathy. In the series, Haymitch is the sole living Hunger Games victor from District 12 and is chosen to mentor Katniss and Peeta Mellark. While he initially appears to be a callous, unsympathetic alcoholic, he eventually becomes Katniss' biggest ally and a key figure in the rebellion. However, he has lingering trauma from his time in the arena. Throughout the course of the series, he and other former victors slowly revealed his experience.\n\nHaymitch was one of four tributes reaped for the Second Quarter Quell when he was 16. To commemorate the milestone, the Capitol switched up the 50th Hunger Games, requiring each district to double its number of tributes. Haymitch survived by forming an alliance with one of his fellow District 12 tributes, Maysilee Donner, and finding an unconventional way to utilize the force field at the end of the arena. However, using the arena to his advantage was seen as an act of rebellion since he didn't win the traditional way, leading to President Snow killing his entire family and girlfriend.\n\nGiven that Sunrise on the Reaping focuses on the 50th Hunger Games, many assume Haymitch will be the lead protagonist. Even if he's not the main focus, he is sure to be featured in the book as the Games' ultimate victor. Other characters expected to make an appearance or receive a mention are President Snow and long-time Hunger Games host Caesar Flickerman. Haymitch's District 12 ally, Maysilee, is also likely to appear. However, Haymitch and Maysilee are the only known tributes who participated in the Fiftieth Hunger Games, leaving the other 46 tributes unknown.\n\nSunrise on the Reaping may also introduce Haymitch's family, as he mentioned having a mother, brother, and girlfriend when he was reaped, though their names are unknown. The book could go in a lot of different directions as there is still much unknown about Haymitch's past, his family, and the fellow tributes and Capitol workers behind the 50th Hunger Games. Like its predecessors, it is also expected to hold some political and social commentary. In a statement, Collins revealed her inspiration for the book came from Scottish Enlightenment philosopher David Hume, especially his thoughts on submission.

But, the novel could potentially follow in the footsteps of its predecessors and become a major motion picture.\n\nAuthor Suzanne Collins has shared her inspiration for the new novel with AP, citing David Hume's concept of implicit submission and the dynamics between rulers and the ruled.\n\n\"I explored the themes of propaganda and narrative control,\" she explained, emphasizing the relevance of the question \"Real or not real?\" in today's world.\n\nIf you're looking to catch up on \"The Hunger Games\" before the release of \"Sunrise on the Reaping\" next year, check out our guides on How to Read the Hunger Games Books in Order and How to Watch the Hunger Games Movies in Chronological Order.\n\nFor even more book news this month, consider IGN's top picks for the best sci-fi fantasy novels in June, including Service Model by Adrian Tchaikovsky, Running Close to the Wind by Alexandra Rowland, Moonbound by Robin Sloan, and more.", "source": {"uri": "ign.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IGN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzanne_Collins", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Suzanne Collins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Hunger Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ballad_of_Songbirds_and_Snakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Blyth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tom Blyth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Zegler", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rachel Zegler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystopia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dystopia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholastic_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scholastic Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_series", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Film series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lawrence", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Lawrence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_adaptation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Film adaptation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Tchaikovsky", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Tchaikovsky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fantasy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Science fantasy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IGN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Propaganda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Film"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Murder-Mystery_and_Deduction", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Murder-Mystery and Deduction", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2015/02/08/jlawrence-blogjpg-56e54b1280wjpg-294cac.jpg?width=1280", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9630046", "eventUri": "eng-9630046", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-03-", "textStart": 143, "textEnd": 151}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

The winner of those games (spoiler) was Haymitch Abernathy from District 12, who is played by Woody Harrelson in the original trilogy of films.\n\n\"Suzanne Collins is a master storyteller and our creative north star,\" Lionsgate Motion Picture Group chair Adam Fogelson said in a statement. \"We couldn't be more fortunate than to be guided and trusted by a collaborator whose talent and imagination are so consistently brilliant. We know 'Hunger Games' fans worldwide will be spellbound by where Suzanne has focused this next extraordinary story. The Second Quarter Quell is legendary and looms large over the history of the Games, even into the time of Katniss Everdeen a quarter-century later. Like fans around the globe, we are eagerly anticipating this exciting return to Panem.\"\n\n\"From the beginning, Lionsgate has been a wonderful home and partner for the 'Hunger Games' franchise, and I'm very excited to be collaborating with Adam and the team as we bring this next story to theaters in 2026,\" Collins said in a statement.\n\nMeredith Wieck and Scott O'Brien will oversee the production on behalf of the studio. Patricia Laucella and Phil Strina oversaw the rights for the book for Lionsgate. Collins was represented by Jason Dravis from The Dravis Agency and Diane Golden and Sarah Lerner from the law firm Katz Golden Lerner LLP.\n\n\"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes\" starred Tom Blyth, Rachel Zegler, Viola Davis, and Peter Dinklage, and the film grossed $337 million worldwide, well below what the original films made, but still a strong showing for a prequel film.", "source": {"uri": "indiewire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IndieWire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brian_welk@indiewire.com", "name": "Brian Welk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionsgate", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionsgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzanne_Collins", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Suzanne Collins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Hunger Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Simpson_(producer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brad Simpson (producer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_Force", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Color Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catching_Fire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catching Fire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nina_Jacobson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nina Jacobson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Lawrence", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Francis Lawrence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilogy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trilogy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Film producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholastic_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scholastic Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_adaptation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Film adaptation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ballad_of_Songbirds_and_Snakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Harrelson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Woody Harrelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Blyth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Blyth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Zegler", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rachel Zegler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katniss_Everdeen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Katniss Everdeen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Dinklage", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peter Dinklage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viola_Davis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Viola Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MV5BOWI1OTMyZGUtYzVmMy00YTZkLWI2ZTEtNDZhOWIzYmRlY2ExXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg?w=650", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9630046", "eventUri": "eng-9630046", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-11-", "textStart": 343, "textEnd": 354}, {"amb": false, "date": "2018-03-", "textStart": 411, "textEnd": 419}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

When The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes film released in November 2023, fans believed that was a final farewell to the Hunger Games saga. At the time, a sequel to the movie wasn't in the works. However, the series' author Suzanne Collins has more dystopian mayhem up her sleeve. She recently announced a new novel in the series, titled Sunrise on the Reaping, will be released next year.\n\nSunrise on the Reaping, the fifth book in the Hunger Games franchise, is set to release on March 18, 2025. According to the Associated Press, the upcoming novel will take place 40 years after the most recent adaptation, The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes. Specifically, it'll start on the dawn of the the Second Quarter Quell, the game that Haymitch Abernathy -- played by Woody Harrelson in the films -- won 24 years before the trilogy started.\n\nThis announcement is a win for Haymitch fans (including Lucy Gray's own Rachel Zegler), who've been wondering how he succeeded through the annual games since Catching Fire. He was first introduced in the original Hunger Games novel as Katniss and Peeta's mentor; however, much of his origin story wasn't fully fleshed out in the films.\n\nWhile Haymitch will serve as the focus, Collins also noted a certain historic figure inspired her to write the upcoming novel. \"With Sunrise on the Reaping, I was inspired by David Hume's idea of implicit submission and, in his words, 'the easiness with which the many are governed by the few,'\" Collins told the AP. \"The story also lent itself to a deeper dive into the use of propaganda and the power of those who control the narrative.

Not only that -- although far from surprising -- a film adaptation is already set to follow in November 2026. The book will take place 24 years before The Hunger Games and 40 years before the series' fourth book, The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes. (A so-so film adaptation took to theaters last fall.) Beyond that, plot details remain vague, unless you count Collins' utterly pretentious author's statement as informative.\n\n\"With Sunrise on the Reaping, I was inspired by David Hume's idea of implicit submission and, in his words, 'the easiness with which the many are governed by the few,''' she wrote alongside the book reveal. \"The story also lent itself to a deeper dive into the use of propaganda and the power of those who control the narrative. The question 'Real or not real?' seems more pressing to me every day.\"\n\nIt's hard to know who the target audience is for The Hunger Games these days, considering it's nostalgic for millennials and Gen Z alike. But It's hard to imagine that any fan's ears perk up when they see the name \"David Hume.\" The Scottish philosopher wrote about the concept of \"implicit submission\" in 1758, so many years before the release of the first Hunger Games book that one shouldn't bother doing the math. However inspiring Hume was or even remains to be, his relevance to the modern reader is most likely minimal.\n\nAll of this is not to suggest that what Collins said is obtuse; it is simply and utterly obnoxious. And if that's the direction she wants to go for with Sunrise on the Reaping, so be it.

Haymitch, who like all victors went on to become a mentor to tributes from his district, was played by Woody Harrelson in the Hunger Games adaptations.\n\nThe Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping film will follow The Ballad of Songbirds and Snake prequel movie and will mark the sixth Hunger Games movie from Color Force since bringing the franchise to Lionsgate.\n\nLionsgate in 2012 debuted the first of four blockbuster movies based on the Hunger Games novels, which starred Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen. The studio's adaptation of the original book by Collins saw Katniss and fellow District 12 tribute Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) as they were sent to the Capitol to fight for survival.\n\nThe Hunger Games franchise and its portrayal of a dystopian future version of America also starred Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson and Elizabeth Banks. Francis Lawrence has directed four earlier films in the Hunger Games franchise, and every film since Catching Fire.\n\nLionsgate's blockbuster Hunger Games franchise also helped make YA postapocalyptic fiction a hot property in Hollywood, paving the way for other movie series like The Maze Runner and Divergent. Lionsgate has also already rolled out theme park attractions, experiences and live events around the franchise, including The World of the Hunger Games at the Motiongate Dubai theme park and a major stage production set to debut in London.\n\n\"From the beginning, Lionsgate has been a wonderful home and partner for the Hunger Games franchise, and I'm very excited to be collaborating with Adam and the team as we bring this next story to theaters in 2026,\" Collins said in her own statement.\n\nMeredith Wieck and Scott O'Brien will oversee the production for Lionsgate. Patricia Laucella and Phil Strina oversaw the rights for the book for Lionsgate. Collins was represented by Jason Dravis from The Dravis Agency and Diane Golden and Sarah Lerner from the law firm Katz Golden Lerner LLP.", "source": {"uri": "hollywoodreporter.com", "dataType":

The series seemed over when Mockingjay came out in 2010, but then Collins surprised readers with the announcement of The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, which arrived in 2020.\n\nAnd she's going back to the arena again. The Associated Press has the announcement that Sunrise on the Reaping is due next year. This book falls between the two known parts of the series' timeline, 40 years after Songbirds and 24 years before The Hunger Games. It's set as the reaping begins for the 50th Games, which is also the second Quarter Quell.\n\nIf you remember Catching Fire, yes, that means it's like Katniss's second trip to the arena, and had a super-fun special twist. (The Quells celebrate the way the Capitol crushed the Districts' rebellion.) For this go-round, there were twice as many tributes. And a familiar name was the victor of this particular set of Games: Haymitch Abernathy, who was played by Woody Harrelson in the films. In Catching Fire, Katniss and Peeta watch a tape of Haymitch's year, and it's not pretty. But it does act as a pretty solid outline for what to expect from the new book.\n\nSunrise on the Reaping draws on a new, somewhat surprising source: the work of Scottish philosopher David Hume. In a statement, Collins said, \"I was inspired by David Hume's idea of implicit submission and, in his words, 'the easiness with which the many are governed by the few.' The story also lent itself to a deeper dive into the use of propaganda and the power of those who control the narrative. The question 'Real or not real?' seems more pressing to me every day.\"\n\nIt feels inevitable that this novel will also become a movie, but no film rights have been announced. Sunrise on the Reaping will be on shelves March 18, 2025.", "source": {"uri": "reactormag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reactor"}, "authors": [{"uri": "molly_templeton@reactormag.com", "name": "Molly Templeton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzanne_Collins", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Suzanne Collins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Hunger Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ballad_of_Songbirds_and_Snakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catching_Fire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catching Fire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mockingjay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mockingjay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Novel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katniss_Everdeen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Katniss Everdeen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Records", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peeta_Mellark", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peeta Mellark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hume", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Hume"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Harrelson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Woody Harrelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philosophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Propaganda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://reactormag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/woody-harrelson-hunger-games.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9630046", "eventUri": "eng-9630046", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-03-", "textStart": 1896, "textEnd": 1904}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

The big screen take of the next prequel, The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping, will hit screens on Nov. 20, 2026 and the franchise filmmaker of the last four movies, Francis Lawrence, is in talks to return to direct.\n\nIn addition Hunger Games producer Nina Jacobson, alongside her producing partner Brad Simpson, is returning to produce the next prequel under their Color Force banner. It reps Color Force's sixth outing since bringing the series to Lionsgate in 2012.\n\nWhile the previous prequel, The Hungers: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes, was set 64 years before the events of the original trilogy, The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping is set 24 years before that trio of Jennifer Lawrence films in the world of Panem, commencing on the morning of the reaping of the 50th Hunger Games, also known as the Second Quarter Quell. Those games are an important event in the canon as the victor was Haymitch Abernathy, the only winner from District 12 before Lawrence' Katniss Everdeen and Josh Hutcherson's Peeta Mellark's tie win. Haymitch continues on to become a mentor, a character in the original movies played by Woody Harrelson.\n\nIn a statement yesterday, Collins, said, \"With Sunrise on the Reaping, I was inspired by David Hume's idea of implicit submission and, in his words, 'the easiness with which the many are governed by the few...The story also lent itself to a deeper dive into the use of propaganda and the power of those who control the narrative. The question 'Real or not real?' seems more pressing to me every day.\"\n\nThe author adds today, \"From the beginning, Lionsgate has been a wonderful home and partner for the Hunger Games franchise, and I'm very excited to be collaborating with Adam and the team as we bring this next story to theaters in 2026.\"\n\n\"Suzanne Collins is a master storyteller and our creative north star,\" beamed Lionsgate Motion Picture Group Chair Adam Fogelson. \"We couldn't be more fortunate than to be guided and trusted by a collaborator whose talent and imagination are so consistently brilliant. We know Hunger Games fans worldwide will be spellbound by where Suzanne has focused this next extraordinary story. The Second Quarter Quell is legendary and looms large over the history of the Games, even into the time of Katniss Everdeen a quarter-century later. Like fans around the globe, we are eagerly anticipating this exciting return to Panem.\"\n\nMeredith Wieck and Scott O'Brien will oversee the production on behalf of Lionsgate. Patricia Laucella and Phil Strina oversaw the rights for the book for Lionsgate. Collins was represented by Jason Dravis from The Dravis Agency and Diane Golden and Sarah Lerner from the law firm Katz Golden Lerner LLP. Sunrise on the Reaping will be published by Scholastic simultaneously in print, digital, and audio formats in the US, Canada, the UK and Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand on March 18, 2025.\n\nThe only other wide release on Nov. 20, 2026 is an untitled Warner Bros/New Line movie.\n\nThe Hunger Games books have sold more than 100M copies around the globe in print and digital with foreign publishing rights sold in 54 languages. All four movies have reaped more than $3.3 billion at the worldwide box office. Lionsgate has branched out the property to include theme park attractions, experiences, and live events, including The World of the Hunger Games at the Motiongate Dubai theme park and a major stage production set to debut in London from Olivier Award-winning playwright Conor McPherson (\"Girl from the North Country\") and directed by Matthew Dunster (\"2:22 -- A Ghost Story,\" \"Hangmen,\" \"The

The book, set to be released in March 2025, will take readers back to the early days of Panem, 24 years before Katniss Everdeen's stand against the Capitol.\n\nThe prequel will focus on the events surrounding the 50th Hunger Games, also known as the Second Quarter Quell. For those unfamiliar, the Quarter Quells are special editions of the Games held every 25 years, featuring new rules designed to keep the districts in line. The Second Quarter Quell is crucial to Hunger Games lore. It shaped the lives of key characters like Haymitch Abernathy and President Snow.\n\nLionsgate, the studio behind the previous five films, set a release date set for November 2026. Francis Lawrence directed the previous four films and is in talks to return. The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes was a bigger hit than Lionsgate was expecting for the Rachel Zegler prequel, and with Collins penning another entry into the series, another movie felt inevitable.\n\nInterestingly, Collins seems to be taking a page out of our current political environment, as she suggested in a statement.\n\n\"With Sunrise on the Reaping, I was inspired by David Hume's idea of implicit submission and, in his words, 'the easiness with which the many are governed by the few.

The book will be released in March 2025, and the film in November 2026.\n\nNo one should be surprised that another installment in The Hunger Games is coming out. The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes book sold pretty well and was critically well-received. The movie did exceptionally well finding an audience outside of existing fans despite seeming like it would be completely unapproachable. While at CinemaCon this year, Lionsgate hinted that another movie could be on the way, but it wasn't clear if that meant another book was also on the way. It seems that we are indeed getting both. According to a press release sent out by Lionsgate, The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping book will be released on March 18, 2025, while the movie adaptation has snagged a November 20, 2026 release date. A November release worked out really well for the film last time, so it isn't surprising that they want to do it again. Producer Nina Jacobson, alongside her producing partner Brad Simpson, will produce the film, and Francis Lawrence is in talks to direct it. Jacobson and Simpson have produced all six films while Lawrence has directed the last four; don't fix what isn't broken. There currently isn't a cast set for the film.\n\n\"Suzanne Collins is a master storyteller and our creative north star,\" said Fogelson. \"We couldn't be more fortunate than to be guided and trusted by a collaborator whose talent and imagination are so consistently brilliant. We know Hunger Games fans worldwide will be spellbound by where Suzanne has focused this next extraordinary story. The Second Quarter Quell is legendary and looms large over the history of the Games, even into the time of Katniss Everdeen a quarter-century later. Like fans around the globe, we are eagerly anticipating this exciting return to Panem.\"\n\n\"From the beginning, Lionsgate has been a wonderful home and partner for the Hunger Games franchise, and I'm very excited to be collaborating with Adam and the team as we bring this next story to theaters in 2026,\" said Suzanne Collins.\n\nSo this is another prequel film, this time focusing on the character of Hamish, played by Woody Harrelson in the original slate of films. We're not going to say, \"Who asked for this?\" because it turns out the star of the previous film in the franchise, Rachel Zegler, did, in fact, ask for this in 2021 and is collecting her laurels today on social media.", "source": {"uri": "bleedingcool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleeding Cool"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kaitlyn_booth@bleedingcool.com", "name": "Kaitlyn Booth", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Hunger Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionsgate", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lionsgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ballad_of_Songbirds_and_Snakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nina_Jacobson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nina Jacobson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Lawrence", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Francis Lawrence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Simpson_(producer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brad Simpson (producer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzanne_Collins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suzanne Collins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storytelling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Storytelling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Film producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_adaptation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Film adaptation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Zegler", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rachel Zegler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katniss_Everdeen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Katniss Everdeen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Harrelson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Woody Harrelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prequel"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theory_and_Criticism", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theory and Criticism", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://bleedingcool.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/pastedGraphic_1-2000x1125.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9630046", "eventUri": "eng-9630046", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-03-", "textStart": 781, "textEnd": 789}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-11-", "textStart": 838, "textEnd": 849}], "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Since fans were introduced to Katniss Everdeen during the 74th games, Sunrise on the Reaping takes place nearly 25 years before the Mockingjay changes Panem.\n\n\"The Second Quarter Quell is legendary and looms large over the history of the Games, even into the time of Katniss Everdeen a quarter-century later,\" Lionsgate's Adam Fogelson said, per The Hollywood Reporter. \"Like fans around the globe, we are eagerly anticipating this exciting return to Panem.\"\n\nSome fans were already speculating over a prequel story about Haymitch Abernathy, Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark's mentor, who also won the 50th Hunger Games. Since Sunrise on the Reaping is the Second Quarter Quell, many pointed out that the book and movie will likely explore Haymitch's backstory.\n\nLionsgate confirmed that the film's theatrical release is scheduled for November 26, 2026.\n\nSuzanne's publisher, Scholastic, announced that the book will hit shelves on March 18, 2025.\n\nSince news of the film and the book were announced on June 6, 2024, cast details have not been revealed. However, many already know that original cast members Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks and more likely will not return because this story is set more than two decades before their characters were introduced.", "source": {"uri": "hollywoodlife.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hollywood Life"}, "authors": [{"uri": "elisabeth_mcgowan@hollywoodlife.com", "name": "Elisabeth McGowan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Hunger Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionsgate", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lionsgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katniss_Everdeen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Katniss Everdeen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ballad_of_Songbirds_and_Snakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Life", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood Life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzanne_Collins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suzanne Collins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mockingjay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mockingjay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Hollywood Reporter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peeta_Mellark", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peeta Mellark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Banks", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth Banks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liam_Hemsworth", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liam Hemsworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Harrelson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Woody Harrelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lawrence", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Lawrence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hutcherson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hutcherson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholastic_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scholastic Corporation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/hunger-games-featured.jpg?quality=100&w=620", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9630046", "eventUri": "eng-9630046", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-03-", "textStart": 1597, "textEnd": 1605}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

The dystopian story follows Katniss Everdeen's (Jennifer Lawrence) life in a post-apocalyptic nation called Panem where children are forced to compete in a televised fight to the death called the Hunger Games. The trilogy helped make Lawrence an A-list movie star and her red carpet chemistry with co-stars Liam Hemsworth and Josh Hutcherson fueled popularity both for the stars and their franchises. The films were nominated for hundreds of awards and won dozens, including People's Choice Awards, MTV Movie Awards and Grammy Awards. \"The Hunger Games\" was named one of Publishers Weekly's \"Best Books of the Year\" and was a New York Times Notable Children's Book in 2008.

Not only has it been confirmed that author Suzanne Collins is continuing the franchise with a brand new prequel novel, but Lionsgate has also announced that the forthcoming book will be turned into a movie. Titled \"Sunrise on the Reaping,\" the book is due to hit shelves in 2025, with the movie dated for 2026. Most crucially, this new story will fill in the history of a character fans have wanted to know more about for a long time. Namely, Haymitch Abernathy.\n\nAccording to a press release, the book will hit shelves on March 18, 2025. Lionsgate wasted precisely zero time in getting the rights to the film locked up. Francis Lawrence, who has directed every entry in the franchise save for the original, is in talks to return for this latest installment. That makes every bit of sense given the success of last year's \"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes.\" The prequel, which told the origin story of Coriolanus Snow, pulled in $327 million worldwide, reigniting the wildly popular YA series. Adam Fogelson, chairman of Lionsgate's motion picture group, had this to say about it:\n\n\"Suzanne Collins is a master storyteller and our creative north star. We couldn't be more fortunate than to be guided and trusted by a collaborator whose talent and imagination are so consistently brilliant. The Second Quarter Quell is legendary and looms large over the history of the Games, even into the time of Katniss Everdeen a quarter-century later.\"\n\nThere is no word yet on casting, but Woody Harrelson portrayed Haymitch in the original trilogy. However, since this is a prequel, Lionsgate will need to find a new actor to portray the younger version of the character who went on to win the 50th annual Hunger Games. Meanwhile, franchise producer Nina Jacobson, alongside her producing partner Brad Simpson, will return to produce the film.", "source": {"uri": "slashfilm.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Slashfilm"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionsgate", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionsgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzanne_Collins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suzanne Collins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Hunger Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games:_The_Ballad_of_Songbirds_&_Snakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Lawrence", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Francis Lawrence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Simpson_(producer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brad Simpson (producer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katniss_Everdeen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Katniss Everdeen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nina_Jacobson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nina Jacobson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilogy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trilogy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Harrelson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Woody Harrelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storytelling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Storytelling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Record producer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/new-hunger-games-movie-will-explore-the-origin-of-another-familiar-character/l-intro-1717692132.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9630046", "eventUri": "eng-9630046", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-03-", "textStart": 561, "textEnd": 569}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

The victors soon learned, however, that every single thing in this deceptive paradise was poisonous (including the water and even the air), the butterflies had stingers, and the mountain was actually a deadly volcano.

However, we also can recognize when we're wrong, such as when we previously expressed skepticism toward the prospect of The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes -- another prequel about the surprisingly sympathetic youth that led to a monster in one Coriolanus Snow. That book and the 2023 film it spawned provided a surprisingly credible and affecting portrait of how the choices we make in life can have devastating consequences.\n\nIt's also interesting to note that the commercial appeal of prequels are going be tested again. Indeed, a recent and sudden conventional wisdom spread throughout the industry last month after the frustrating box office failure of a genuinely fantastic and daring prequel like Furiosa. \"Prequel stories are rarely compelling, because the ending is predetermined,\" goes the newly current thinking. That rationalization seems all the more odd when one remembers last year's final blockbuster, Wonka, was a prequel to one of the most beloved children's films of all-time, complete with a major recasting.\n\nMeanwhile The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes played and played with small week-on-week drops. That leggy performance led to a global haul of $337 million. It was down from the franchise's height of popularity during Jennifer Lawrence's tenure, but it was more than profitable against a $100 million budget (something we cannot so far say about most of summer 2024's output so far). Hence a Haymitch Abernathy movie.\n\nThe reasons for Furiosa's unfortunate underperformance remain a bit more elusive, but it seems Collins and Lionsgate are confident they can continue to make prequels that are accessible and interesting to readers and moviegoers despite the fans knowing how the story ends. And to be fair, they did it once already.\n\nOne of the reasons Songbirds & Snakes played so well for its audience is that it was not a prequel besotted with populating the frame with \"easter eggs\" and nudges to the audience like many recent Star Wars properties, nor perhaps was it swinging for the fences like Furiosa. Instead it returned to its world for a story that was familiar for those who enjoyed the original Hunger Games movies while shrewdly shifting the focus, even if ever so slightly. While there is indeed a Hunger Games in that film, like the title promises, the 10th annual Hunger Games is more a pretext for a story about the vanities and the self-delusions a person can cultivate to rationalize their success (and eventually normalize heinosu actions). The film follows a young Snow (Tom Blyth) who reluctantly is forced to be complicit in the ritual sacrifice of children, including the beguiling Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler). Still, the actual Hunger Games battle royale comprises a tiny portion of the movie.\n\nMore than half the film is about essaying Snow's youthful mistakes and handful of virtues, and the film continues for nearly an hour more after Lucy Gray Baird is crowned the unlikely champion of the Games. Her victory, in fact, would hardly qualify for action movie spectacle. Rather the picture follows the pair of would-be lovers for months after the Games, all the way through the final decisions that lead to Snow fully aligning himself with the Capitol's tyranny.

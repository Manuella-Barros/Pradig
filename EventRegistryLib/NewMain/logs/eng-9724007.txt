The couple, who have been sharing stunning photos and videos of their trip on social media, fell victim to a theft in Florence, Italy. Their belongings, valued at approximately Rs 10 lakh, including their passports, wallets, and all their shopping, were stolen from their parked car.\n\nA Joyful Trip Turned Sour\n\nThe trip had been an incredible experience for the couple until this unfortunate incident. As per Vivek Dahiya, the couple had just arrived in Florence and were eager to explore the beautiful city. They planned to stay for a day and decided to check out a property they liked for their stay. They left all their belongings in their car, parked outside the property. However, when they returned, they were shocked to find that their car had been broken into and their belongings stolen.\n\n\"Everything about this trip has been incredible, except for this incident.

Although we tried calling our embassy till late evening it was too late since it was closed.\n\nPlea for Help\n\nThe couple is slated for India but are in desperate need of assistance. Another thing noted by Vivek was that \"we happen to be close to Florence but in a small town there. But these people (hotel staff) have been kind enough though without any money how do we go about getting hold of our embassy? There will be a requirement for us to have temporary passports which will need great assistance from your side so that you can take us back home.\"\n\nSocial Media Update\n\nLater on Instagram Divyanka let her fans know they were safe but lost most things important to them. So far, there is no word on whether this has been resolved. The TV couple's holiday has taken a sad twist and for them to come back home safely they now have to depend on the embassy.", "source": {"uri": "deccanchronicle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deccan Chronicle"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bhavana_sharma@deccanchronicle.com", "name": "Bhavana Sharma", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Passport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florence"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florence"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivek_Dahiya", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vivek Dahiya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivek_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vivek (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divyanka_Tripathi_Dahiya", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Divyanka Tripathi Dahiya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomatic_mission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diplomatic mission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2024/07/11/1823281-divyankatripathiandvivekdahiya.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724007", "eventUri": "eng-9724007", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

They are in the process of getting an FIR registered and are awaiting help from the Indian Embassy, Tripathi told PTI over the phone from Florence on Thursday.\n\nThe incident took place on Wednesday afternoon (local time). But it was already evening by the time they realised they had been looted, the \"Yeh Hai Mohabbatein\" actor added.\n\n\"We were inside the hotel property. We were hungry and the hotel knew that we had stuff inside the car... We were checking into the hotel the same day. They told us we can leave our things in the car while we had our food. We thought it was all safe since it's a resort property and not on the street,\" Tripathi said.\n\nThe resort is about half an hour away from Florence.\n\nAccording to the actor, either her husband and she were followed or incidents like this happen regularly.\n\n\"The thieves broke the window, took all the stuff that was in the rear seat... whatever we had brought from India -- passports, cards, cash, everything is gone. I was stunned. The hotel people are helping us. The property didn't have CCTV, so we made a video and took photos for proof,\" Tripathi said.\n\nAfter 6 pm, she claimed, no one can get a report filed anywhere in Italy. \"So if anything happens between 6 pm to 9 am, you can't do anything about it. We are going to the police station to file the report, we are hoping thereafter things get easier and we manage to get in touch with somebody from the Indian Embassy,\" she said.\n\n\"We are avid travellers... We are hopeful that we come back with better memories. We are 'pareshan', we are penniless, but we are keeping our spirits high. The situation is not great but we are smiling,\" Tripathi said.

Known for sharing glimpses of their romantic escapades on social media, the couple's joyous trip took a nightmarish turn when they fell victim to a theft that left them stranded without their passports, money, and other valuables.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn an interview with the TOI, Vivek Dahiya revealed the distressing details of their ordeal. The couple had just arrived in Florence, Italy, planning to enjoy a day exploring the city's renowned cultural landmarks. Unfortunately, their plans were abruptly halted when they discovered that their car, parked outside the property they were interested in, had been broken into. Vivek recounted, \"Everything about this trip has been incredible, except for this incident. We arrived in Florence yesterday and planned to stay for a day. We went to check out a property we liked for our stay and left all our belongings in a car parked outside. However, when we returned to get our stuff, we were shocked to find that the car had been broken into, and our passports, wallets, money, shopping, and all our valuable items were gone.\"\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAlso READ: Anant Ambani Radhika Merchant Wedding Live Updates: Radhika and Anant radiate joy during colourful Haldi ceremony\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe thieves made off with belongings worth approximately \u20b910 lakh, including their passports and all the shopping they had acquired during their trip. In a cruel twist, the thieves left behind some old clothes and food items, further emphasizing the thoroughness of the theft.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe couple's immediate reaction was to seek help from the local authorities. However, they were met with a lack of assistance. The local police, citing the absence of CCTV cameras in the area where the theft occurred, dismissed their case. This bureaucratic hurdle left Divyanka and Vivek in a state of despair. Vivek elaborated, \"We reached out to the local police but found no help. They dismissed our case, saying that without CCTV cameras in that specific area, they can't help us.\"\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWith no money and no identification, Divyanka and Vivek found themselves in a small town near Florence, relying on the kindness of the hotel staff who provided them with temporary relief. Despite this support, the couple was left in a precarious situation, unable to access any funds or secure the necessary documentation to return to India.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTheir attempts to reach the Indian embassy for assistance were also met with challenges, as their initial contact with the embassy was unsuccessful due to it being closed for the day. The urgency of their situation became evident as they made a public plea for help. Vivek stated, \"We require temporary passports and substantial help from the embassy to get back to India, as we have nothing with us.\"\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis incident underscores the vulnerabilities travelers can face, even in the most picturesque settings. Divyanka and Vivek's unfortunate experience highlights the importance of vigilant security measures and the need for prompt and effective assistance from local authorities and embassies in times of crisis.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs they navigate this challenging period, their fans and followers hope for their swift and safe return to India. The couple's ordeal serves as a stark reminder of the unpredictable nature of travel and the paramount importance of safety and preparedness.", "source": {"uri": "moneycontrol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MoneyControl"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivek_Dahiya", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vivek Dahiya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divyanka_Tripathi_Dahiya", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Divyanka Tripathi Dahiya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Passport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivek_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vivek (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Florence"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florence"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Romance film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-circuit_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Closed-circuit television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomatic_mission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diplomatic mission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Relief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bureaucracy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Gay_Men", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Gay Men", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Preparation", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Left-Handed_Products", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Left-Handed Products", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2024/07/20240711085645_FotoJet-2024-07-11T142638.426-770x433.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724007", "eventUri": "eng-9724007", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 0, "relevance": 1}

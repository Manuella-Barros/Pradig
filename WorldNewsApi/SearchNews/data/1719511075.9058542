The Manchester United captain, it seemed, was handing the trophy to Diogo Dalot, who was stood directly next to him, to raise aloft, ahead of him passing it to the next person and so forth. Instead, Fernandes instructed it to go to the very end of the line. Stood at the end of it was Erik ten Hag, who had the trophy placed into his hands by Willy Kambwala and Andre Onana, who were stood to Ten Hag's right. As it reached Kambwala, Jonny Evans pointed towards the United boss, ensuring he was next to clasp his hands on the trophy.

Once he had a firm grip of one its handles and its base, he followed Fernandes' lead, gave it a kiss and raised it into the air. It was his second experience of hoisting a piece of silverware aloft on the Wembley balcony. The biggest question now is: will it be his last? Ineos are yet to communicate a decision on the Dutchman's future, meaning it remains to be seen if he will lead United into a third term next season or not. Sir Jim Ratcliffe, making his way through the mixed zone on his way to the United dressing room, refused to answer a question put to him about Ten Hag's future. A national newspaper story on Friday claimed that Ratcliffe's mind is already made up. If United are planning to pull the trigger on Ten Hag, expect a mixed response. While a lot of supporters are still behind the Dutchman, even more so after Saturday's heroics at Wembley, there are some who cannot look past the club's eighth-placed finish in the Premier League this term. Of course, it is impossible to ignore the fact United recorded their lowest-ever finish in the Premier League era this term. That eighth-placed finish will always be associated with Ten Hag. But so too are two trophies. Saturday's 2-1 triumph over Manchester City marked a second major honour in as many seasons for the 54-year-old, who came out fighting in his post-match press conference. \"Two trophies in two years is not bad, three finals in two years is not bad,\" he said. \"We have to keep going. \"I'm not satisfied with it, we have to do better and if they don't want me any more then I go somewhere else to win trophies because that is what I did my whole career.\" Ten Hag was brought to United in April 2022 to win silverware and he has delivered a domestic cup in each of his first two seasons in charge, with this season's FA Cup triumph arguably an upgrade on last season's Carabao Cup success. United, of course, are also expected to compete for the Premier League title year after year and challenge for the Champions League. Both of those aspirations were over before Christmas this season. However, when you account for the injury crisis United faced throughout the season, it was hardly surprising that a title charge failed to manifest itself, was it? Furthermore, were United ever realistically expected to compete for the title this season? You'd be brave to argue yes. Ten Hag, despite being questioned tactically at various stages this season, has still managed to deliver another trophy, halting City's hopes of achieving the double in the process. Regardless of what happens next, he will always be fondly remembered for that. But as United's supporters celebrated at the East End of Wembley, with eyes focused on what was happening on the pitch, Ten Hag was being embraced by his players, both before and after introducing himself to the trophy. Lisandro Martinez almost swiped him off his feet as the full-time whistle blew, Luke Shaw gave him a bear hug and countless others engaged with him, grinning from ear to ear in the process. All of those interactions were signs of a dressing room that is still firmly behind its manager. United's players have often spoken glowingly of Ten Hag, with many echoing his frustrations at the club's injury crisis being the reason for this season's demise. The players' decision to to pass the FA Cup to him ahead of having their own embrace with the most famous trophy in club football spoke volumes about the respect they have for him. It is a bond that Ineos need to think carefully about possibly breaking.", "summary": "Erik ten Hag led Man United to their 13th FA Cup triumph at Wembley on Saturday, overseeing a 2-1 win over Manchester City.", "url": "https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-uniteds-fa-cup-trophy-29241466", "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article29241608.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2154124927.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 15:00:00", "author": "George Smith", "authors": ["George Smith"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.01}

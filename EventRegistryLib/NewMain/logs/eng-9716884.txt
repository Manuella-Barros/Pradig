Fans looking to watch can do so through FuboTV or DirecTV Stream, both of which offer a free trial. SlingTV doesn't offer a free trial but does have other promotional offers available.\n\nIn the first meeting between these two, Argentina pulled out a 2-0 victory. Argentina then got a 1-0 win over Chile and a 2-0 victory over Peru to close out the Group Stage. The quarterfinal contest against Ecuador was the first time Argentina allowed a goal at Copa America 2024, and the equalizer that came in the 90'+1' led to the match heading to penalties, which Argentina won 4-2.\n\nCanada responded to the opening match loss with a 1-0 win over Peru and a 0-0 draw with Chile to reach the quarterfinals. In a match against Venezuela, Canada jumped on top early, but surrendered a goal in the second half. In penalties, Canada would squeak out a 4-3 win to advance for a rematch with Argentina.\n\nThe winner of this match faces the winner of Colombia vs. Uruguay in the final.\n\nJesse Marsch says he didn't need success with Canada to prove his coaching ability\n\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Having led Canada to the semifinals of the Copa America, coach Jesse Marsch said he didn't need success to prove his ability after he was fired by Leeds and overlooked by the U.S. Soccer Federation.\n\n\"I felt how strongly they wanted me here, and I'm at a point in my life where I don't need all the other bull----,\" Marsch said during a news conference ahead of Tuesday's match against Argentina.\n\nHe laughed as Monday's news conference was being simultaneously translated.\n\n\"I don't know how you say that in Spanish, OK?\" he explained with a grin.\n\nMarsch took over Leeds in February 2022 from Marcelo Bielsa with the team two points above the relegation zone and led it to a 17th-place finish, three points above the drop. He was fired a year later with the team in 17th, above the relegation zone on goal difference, and Leeds finished 19th and went down to the second tier League Championship.\n\nHe interviewed with the USSF last year before Gregg Berhalter was rehired, and Canada gave the 50-year-old Marsch its national team job in May. While Canada advanced in its first Copa America appearance, the host U.S. was eliminated in the group stage.\n\n\"I never doubted my ability as a coach,\" Marsh said. \"What I've always doubted in this business is how do you find the right people to work with? And so the best thing about where I'm at right now is it feels home to me. It feels like I'm working with a group of players that I think value the things that I bring. I value the things that they're about.\"\n\nCanada had not reached the World Cup since 1986 when it qualified for the 2022 tournament under coach John Herdman. It went 0-3 in Qatar. Herdman left in August to coach Toronto in Major League Soccer after saying the Canada Soccer Association did not provide the national team with the necessary financial support and resources.\n\nMarsch was hired after Peter Augruso replaced Charmaine Crooks as CSA president.\n\n\"I think the Canadian Soccer Association is a humble but professional organization and that the new leadership is fantastic,\" Marsch said. \"The people in the country have been 100% behind us in what we're doing with this team and you could take out the victories and the successes that we've had at this tournament. From day one, I've felt that. It's the reason I came. It's because I felt how strongly they wanted me here.\"\n\nMarsch's first two games were a pair of friendlies in Europe, a 4-0 loss at the Netherlands and a 0-0 draw at France.\n\nCanada opened the Copa America with a 2-0 loss to defending champion Argentina, beat Peru 1-0 for its first win over a South American team in 24 years and advanced to the knockout rounds with a 0-0 draw against Chile.\n\nCanada won its quarterfinal against Venezuela 4-3 on penalty kicks after a 1-1 tie.\n\n\"I want to do things I want to do,\" Marsch said. \"I want to get back to loving the game that I love, and this team has helped me finding that, and I'm very thankful for that.\"\n\nA standout college player at Princeton, Marsch made two appearances for the U.S. and was an assistant to Bob Bradley with the national team in 2010-11.\n\nHe coached Montreal (2011-12) and the New York Red Bulls (2015-18) in Major League Soccer, then moved up to coaching sister teams, Red Bull Salzburg in Austria (2019-21) and RB Leipzig in the Bundesliga, which fired him in December 2021 midway through his first season.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this article.", "source": {"uri": "masslive.com",

I want to get back to loving the game that I love, and this team has helped me find that, and I'm very thankful for that.\"\n\nAfter Gregg Berhalter's contract expired as the USMNT's manager in December 2022, Marsch interviewed for the vacant head-coaching job before the team eventually ended up bringing Berhalter back on a new contract.\n\nMarsch, this past May, blasted the USMNT and the United States Soccer Federation for his experience in their interview process, saying, \"I wasn't treated very well.\"\n\nAnd Berhalter's future with the USMNT already hangs in the balance again after the team disastrously failed to advance past the group stages at the Copa America -- becoming the first host nation to be eliminated in the group stages in tournament history.\n\nThe USSF is evaluating Berhalter's future and will make a decision by midweek, according to multiple reports.\n\nMeanwhile, Marsch, 50, has the USMNT's neighbors up north playing some of the best soccer they've ever played and has certainly seemed to move on from his USMNT disappointment.\n\nWhile the nation that spurned him finds itself in disarray, Marsch has Canada where the USMNT believes it belongs itself.\n\n\"I never doubted my ability as a coach,\" Marsch said. \"What I've always doubted in this business is, how do you find the right people to work with? The best thing about where I'm at right now is that it feels like home to me. It feels like I'm working with a group of players that value the things that I bring.

It's the reason I came, because I felt how strongly they wanted me here.\"\n\nCanada lost to Argentina before beating Peru and drawing Chile in the group stages, scoring just one goal between the three games.\n\nThey finished second in Group A, and subsequently beat Venezuela in penalties last Friday to book their spot in the semifinal.\n\nIt'll be a rematch of Canada's Copa America opener, when they fell 2-0 to Lionel Messi and Argentina.\n\n\"We didn't do well enough with Messi last match,\" Marsch said. \"He was able to run free at our goalkeeper too much. We won't man-mark him, but he's certainly an emphasis of how we will defend.\"\n\nThough he's a Racine, Wis. native, Marsch has a lot of history in New Jersey, where Tuesday's clash will take place.\n\nHe rose to prominence over three years in charge of the Red Bulls in MLS, and before that was an assistant at Princeton -- where he played collegiately.\n\nAfter the Red Bulls, Marsch became an assistant manager at RB Leipzig in Germany, managed Red Bull Salzburg in Austria for two years, returned to RB Leipzig as manager for a year and then managed Leeds in England for a year before being fired in February 2023.\n\n\"To coach in the Copa America Final here in New Jersey, where I went to university, where I coached the New York Red Bulls, where a lot of my mentors and people that have had a big effect on me personally and professionally, to see them this week, to know they're gonna be at the match, to be here at this historic site, is special,\" Marsch said.\n\n\"My mind is wrapped totally around giving our team a chance. Not just to have a special experience, but a real special victory.\"", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The American endured a mixed spell at Leeds United after taking over from Marcelo Bielsa in February 2022.\n\nHe led the Whites to Premier League survival but was sacked a year later following a poor run of form. Marsch left United in 17th position, above the drop zone on goal difference.\n\nDespite being interviewed for the U.S. Soccer Federation last year, Marsch was overlooked for the national job and the USSF rehired Gregg Berhalter. But Canada handed Marsch an opportunity to reignite his management career, appointing him their new head coach.\n\nRead more:European club primed to test Leeds United's transfer resolve with bid for midfielder\n\nMarsch has steered Canada to the Copa America semi-finals on their debut in the tournament. They will face Argentina in the last four of the competition - just weeks after Marsch called for them to be fined. Marsch went off on a furious rant about the 2022 World Cup champions following their opening match in Group A last month. Second half goals from Julian Alvarez and Laurato Martinez condemned Canada to a 2-0 defeat, with Marsch taking issue with La Albiceleste coming out late for the second half of the tussle.\n\nSpeaking at his pre-match press conference ahead of their forthcoming clash with Argentina, Marsch said: \"I never doubted my ability as a coach. What I've always doubted in this business is how do you find the right people to work with? And so the best thing about where I'm at right now is it feels home to me. It feels like I'm working with a group of players that I think value the things that I bring. I value the things that they're about.\"\n\nMarsch insists his team will not man-mark Argentina captain Lionel Messi in the tie. Messi was involved in both of Argentina's goals in their group stage win over Canada.\n\n\"We didn't do well enough with Messi last match, he was able to run free at our goalkeeper too much,\" admitted Marsch. \"We won't man-mark, but we will certainly place an emphasis on how to defend him.\n\n\"How to keep track of him will be really important, and the things that make it difficult for him like limiting his space is our number one thing. We don't want him to run free at our backline like last game. But we all know he's the greatest player to ever play the game, the respect we have for him and certainly the stadium will reflect that, but it's always a privilege to play against a player like him.\"", "source": {"uri": "leeds-live.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "leedslive"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dom_howson@leeds-live.co.uk", "name": "Dom Howson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Marsch", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jesse Marsch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Leeds United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Soccer_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Soccer Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregg_Berhalter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gregg Berhalter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_difference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goal difference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcelo_Bielsa", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marcelo Bielsa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Argentina national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marking_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marking (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i2-prod.leeds-live.co.uk/incoming/article29502103.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_GettyImages-2160822037.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716884", "eventUri": "eng-9716884", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

This sport of yours can be a funny thing sometimes.\n\nWhen Leeds United sacked Jesse Marsch last February, there wasn't a person on the planet who thought the American's next team would be the Canadian men's national team. Pardon me, his official job title is, of course, 'MLS Canada men's national team head coach.'\n\nLast summer, when John Herdman stepped down from the CanMNT job, there wasn't a person in this country who thought any accomplished manager would want to deal with the bullshit that came with working for Canada Soccer.\n\nOh, how quickly things can change.\n\nSince taking the CanMNT job in May, Marsch has led Canada against the Netherlands, France, Argentina, Peru, Chile and Venezuela. Two losses and just one regulation win have come in his first six matches, but never once did Canada look out of place against opposition that previous Canadian teams would have been dramatically overwhelmed by. And now, Marsch has Canada in a Copa Am\u00e9rica semi-final.\n\n\"The reason I came is because I felt how strongly they wanted me here. And I'm at a point in my life where I don't need all the other bullshit,\" Marsch said on Monday, and then laughed as the press room nervously wrote down his words. \"I don't know how you write that in Spanish.\"\n\nRelated Read: Toronto FC coach John Herdman says Canada Soccer wasn't ready for CanMNT to be at 2022 World Cup\n\nMarsch has made no secret about his feelings towards U.S. Soccer. He felt disrespected in the interview process last year. The USSF then re-hired Gregg Berhalter as USMNT head coach.\n\nNaturally, Marsch has been compared to Berhalter a lot this month, with the USMNT becoming the first ever Copa Am\u00e9rica hosts to crash out in the group stage. Marsch has insisted that there's no ill will towards U.S. Soccer and he wants to see the program succeed, but that all his energy and focus is on his current team, who have reached once unimaginable heights in Marsch's two months at the helm.\n\nThe idea of someone seeing Canadian soccer as a place without 'all the other bullshit' once seemed unimaginable too. And while it's only been less than half a year, under the guidance of new CEO Kevin Blue, this is a new federation and in Marsch, Blue found a coach that knows how to effectively use the autonomy that he demands.\n\n\"I never doubted my ability as a coach. What I've always doubted in this business is how do you find the right people to work with,\" Marsch said. \"The best thing about where I'm at right now is it feels [like] home to me.\n\n\"I want to do things I want to do. I want to get back to loving the game that I love and this team has helped me find that and I'm very thankful for that.\n\n\"I'm working with a group of players that value the things that I bring. I value the things that they're about. I think the Canadian Soccer Association is a humble but professional organization and the new leadership is fantastic. The people in the country have been 100 percent behind me and us and what we're doing with this team.\"\n\nRelated Read: Argentina head coach Lionel Scaloni sees Canada as 'a very good team that's made it hard for everyone'\n\nFor the Wisconsin native, Tuesday's semi-final brings Marsch back to familiar stomping grounds. The 50-year-old went to Princeton University and returned to coach the men's soccer team after a 13 year playing career in MLS. He then coached the New York Red Bulls in nearby Harrison before crossing the pond to manage Red Bull clubs in Austria and Germany.\n\n\"I was at the 1994 World Cup semi-final: Bulgaria against Italy at the old stadium here in the Meadowlands,\" Marsch said, before laughing at the realization that Cyle Larin, who joined Marsch on the podium for Monday's press conference, was born in 1995.\n\n\"This was a dream of mine just to go to the semi-finals of the World Cup. Now to coach in the Copa Am\u00e9rica semi-final here in New Jersey, where I went to University, where I coached the New York Red Bulls, where a lot of my mentors and people that have had a big effect on me personally and professionally live and to see them this week, to know that they're going to be at the match here at this historic site, even in a new stadium, is special.\n\n\"My mind is wrapped totally around giving our team a chance to not just have a special experience but a real special victory.\"", "source": {"uri": "wakingthered.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Waking The Red"},

I want to get back to loving the game that I love, and this team has helped me find that, and I'm very thankful for that.\"\n\nAfter Gregg Berhalter's contract expired as the USMNT's manager in December 2022, Marsch interviewed for the vacant head-coaching job before the team eventually ended up bringing Berhalter back on a new contract.\n\nMarsch, this past May, blasted the USMNT and the United States Soccer Federation for his experience in their interview process, saying, \"I wasn't treated very well.\"\n\nAnd Berhalter's future with the USMNT already hangs in the balance again after the team disastrously failed to advance past the group stages at the Copa America -- becoming the first host nation to be eliminated in the group stages in tournament history.\n\nThe USSF is evaluating Berhalter's future and will make a decision by midweek, according to multiple reports.\n\nMeanwhile, Marsch, 50, has the USMNT's neighbors up north playing some of the best soccer they've ever played and has certainly seemed to move on from his USMNT disappointment.\n\nWhile the nation that spurned him finds itself in disarray, Marsch has Canada where the USMNT believes it belongs itself.\n\n\"I never doubted my ability as a coach,\" Marsch said. \"What I've always doubted in this business is, how do you find the right people to work with?

We won't man-mark him, but he's certainly an emphasis of how we will defend.\"\n\nThough he's a Racine, Wis. native, Marsch has a lot of history in New Jersey, where Tuesday's clash will take place.\n\nHe rose to prominence over three years in charge of the Red Bulls in MLS, and before that was an assistant at Princeton -- where he played collegiately.\n\nAfter the Red Bulls, Marsch became an assistant manager at RB Leipzig in Germany, managed Red Bull Salzburg in Austria for two years, returned to RB Leipzig as manager for a year and then managed Leeds in England for a year before being fired in February 2023.\n\n\"To coach in the Copa America Final here in New Jersey, where I went to university, where I coached the New York Red Bulls, where a lot of my mentors and people that have had a big effect on me personally and professionally, to see them this week, to know they're gonna be at the match, to be here at this historic site, is special,\" Marsch said.\n\n\"My mind is wrapped totally around giving our team a chance.

Coach Jesse Marsch emphasized the need for developing homegrown talent and leadership to compete globally, eyeing improvements for the 2026 World Cup as the country prepares to co-host the event.\n\nCanada made \"incredible strides\" in their run to the Copa America semi-finals, but there is still much to do to compete with the world's top teams as the country prepares to co-host the 2026 World Cup, coach Jesse Marsch said on Wednesday.\n\nMarsch highlighted the importance of developing homegrown talent at younger ages and encouraging current players to be more vocal leaders both on and off the pitch. The former Leeds United manager discussed these strategies a day after Canada's 2-0 loss to World Cup winners Argentina. \"We're establishing things at some high levels. But in order to be a real team that can hold up to the biggest moments and biggest matches, there's more work to be done,\" Marsch noted. He took over just five weeks ahead of the Copa America tournament.\n\n\"Physically, mentally, intellectually, we've got to find a way to develop players faster,\" Marsch said. He pointed to the speed and power of elite teams like Argentina and France as benchmarks. With the third-place match against Uruguay or Colombia approaching on Saturday, Marsch ran a training session on Wednesday with players who did not start in the semi-final. He is still evaluating who will start that game, and mentioned that some non-starters have shown they deserve the opportunity to play against elite opponents.\n\nMarsch shared that Alphonso Davies's x-rays were \"negative\" after suffering a foot injury in Tuesday's match, but it remains uncertain if Davies will play on Saturday. Canada's deep run in the Copa America, their most successful outside the Gold Cup, is seen as a landmark moment that Marsch hopes will inspire a love of soccer in the hockey-dominated nation.\n\n\"We want to inspire the nation. We want to develop the sport in the country. We want people to remember this as a moment in time that changed the trajectory of what this sport is in Canada,\" Marsch said.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Marsch", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jesse Marsch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leeds United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphonso_Davies", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alphonso Davies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONCACAF_Gold_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CONCACAF Gold Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Floorball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Floorball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/01_03_2022_09_59_50_2994025.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716884", "eventUri": "eng-9716884", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

He's been clear that he hopes what has happened in the U.S. this summer is a sign of things to come.\n\nThe 2026 World Cup is on home soil (co-hosted with the United States and Canada) and getting out of the group stage is the top priority for Marsch and Canada. Their run at the Copa America bodes well -- now, Marsch and Canada have to learn and use the experiences they gained.\n\nWhen Marsch took over two months ago, he knew who his best 15 or so players were. But anyone remotely familiar with this squad would have known, too. It was the other 11 players, those who provide the depth that separates emerging teams from stable, good ones, that Marsch was unclear about. These five games at Copa America have provided answers.\n\nA result still felt within reach early in the second half at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey last night, even at two goals down, when Marsch dipped into his bag of tricks to make the kind of substitutions rarely made for Canada.\n\nOn 55 minutes, Ali Ahmed, a 23-year-old who had previously played nearly all of his minutes for his country as part of the secondary squad involved in the CONCACAF Gold Cup last summer, came on for stalwart defender Richie Laryea. After another 10 minutes, Jonathan David, still Canada's most potent finisher, was replaced by Tani Oluwaseyi, he of just six MLS starts. Just past the hour mark, Stephen Eustaquio, Canada's longtime rock in the middle of the park, gave way to Mathieu Choiniere, who had just 58 minutes of senior international experience before this game.\n\nThese changes were less part of a tactical blueprint and more symbolic: Canada's best players were not performing when they needed to.\n\n\"Obviously, if (David) and (Eustaquio) are at their best, they're always a big help to the team,\" Marsch said later.\n\nThat is a takeaway from this Copa America that will resonate into the preparations for 2026.\n\nThe best-case scenario for that World Cup would be: if Canada's best players were playing to their potential within Marsch's plan, the gulf in quality between the likes of Argentina and his best players wouldn't be that evident. Yet when Argentina made substitutions or had to rely on players lower down their line-up, they didn't miss a beat.\n\nThere were times late in Tuesday's game when Canada's depth players didn't merely miss a beat, they missed the entire song. Marsch needs to challenge his squad's second tier to close the gap to their counterparts around the world or establish a new core of such players he can rely upon to perform beside his stars.\n\n\"We need to develop more players that can contribute, so that we can also rotate in a tournament; because, eventually, the physicality and the fatigue can catch up with you -- that was a big part of what happened today,\" Marsch said.\n\nMarsch gave his bench players critical minutes against Argentina. And he's likely going to lean heavily on that depth in Canada's third-place game, against Colombia or Uruguay, on Saturday (early Sunday, UK time), too. \"I'm trying to really build and develop every single player in this pool so that we can have a real 26-man squad in 2026,\" he said.\n\nThere were glimpses to provide hope for Marsch. Ahmed showed spark with the ball. Oluwaseyi, 24, was dangerous and suggests he should be trusted further. Choiniere, 25, didn't back down from Lionel Messi. If Canada's squad players come out of Copa America feeling buoyed by their experience, the tournament will have been even more of a success. \"(Marsch) gave me an opportunity based on a small pool of games,\" Oluwaseyi said. \"Every guy who he's given an opportunity to has stepped up. And we'll continue to see that as we build up into the World Cup.\"\n\nCanada's coaching staff will have to look beyond this player pool. Scouring the world for dual nationals, which has been less of a priority within Canada Soccer since the previous World Cup two years ago, has to become a priority.\n\nIf Canada Soccer doesn't come away from Copa America without a very clear idea of what the gap between its team and the world's best actually looks like, the tournament shouldn't be considered much of a success. \"I felt that when we went 1-0 down, that a few too many guys were trying individual plays, I call it 'freestyling', instead of sticking to the plan,\" Marsch said. \"We've got to learn from that.\"\n\nNo one should be suggesting Canada comes out of Copa America with massive changes to its starting line-up and defensively the team were resolute, compact and decisive.\n\nDavid had a strong tournament overall, scoring one of their two goals, but that number is illuminating. Canada, and David, need to improve their finishing. Tallying 6.46 expected goals (xG), a metric used to measure the likelihood of a shot becoming a goal, over five games and actually scoring twice are numbers that need to improve. Significantly.\n\n\"It's frustrating because you can tell we're getting closer now,\" defender Alistair Johnston said. \"We had chances again and we're just missing just that little bit of composure, that little bit of world-class that these teams have in abundance. If you don't score your half-chances when you get them when you're on top for a little bit, they're going to make you pay. You need to be perfect against these teams.\"\n\nMarsch, quite literally, needs his best players to be his best players at the 2026 World Cup. And to achieve that, Canada needs to look back on Copa America understanding there's more to getting results than what happens on the scoresheet.\n\nChilean referee Piero Maza frustrated Canada's players and Marsch last night, but what they played through in the semifinal is hardly any different to the games earlier in the tournament. More experienced teams know how to manage the officiating.\n\nThese are the realities of competing at international level that Canada needs to understand. You would hope that, as Canada's group board their flight from New Jersey down to Charlotte for that third-place game, there's a realization the calls from the officials they hope to get -- especially when they play against the world's better sides in 2026 -- might not come.\n\nBut, at least when looking at the tournament from 30,000 feet, things did go Canada's way at Copa America.\n\nThe team went the furthest of any of the six CONCACAF guest nations. They succumbed to a team that could be considered one of the best, well, ever -- Argentina is the reigning Copa and World Cup champion and has lost just twice in 61 games over the past five years. They bought into a revamped style of play under Marsch and looked energized and often effective. Canada has a purpose it didn't have in the aftermath of that 2022 World Cup.\n\nAnd their tournament isn't even over. A third-place match represents a chance to end the summer on a high note.\n\nBut what won't end, regardless of the result in Charlotte, is the lessons to take from the past few weeks.\n\nThis Copa America will be Canada's last proper preparation for the 2026 World Cup. How Canada performs on home soil, in arguably the biggest sporting event in the country's history, could end up revealing just how important this Copa America was.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com",

Argentina rotated a lot of players throughout the tournament so... they weren't calling on the same players every match,\" he said.\n\n\"There's been heat, there's been travel, there's been a lot of challenges. In the end, we're still in the beginning of our process. Argentina has maybe had eight years together with this team.\n\n\"So we need to develop more players that can contribute so that we can also rotate in tournament play because eventually the physicality and the fatigue can catch up with you. And that was a big part of what happened with us tonight,\" he said.\n\nDespite the disappointment of the loss, Marsch said the run to the semis in Canada's first appearance in the Copa America was a notable achievement.\n\n\"What I said to the team afterwards is I know that they're very disappointed, but I'm very proud of them. We've put together some incredible performances,\" he said.\n\n\"We are just starting our process but we've had a wonderful five or six weeks together and it's gone way better than any of us could have scripted. So, there's still a lot of work to do, but we've built a really good foundation and I'm really optimistic about what the future can look like,\" he said.\n\nCanada will be co-hosts of the 2026 World Cup along with the USA and Mexico.\n\nMarsch said that when he first took over the team he feared the Copa America might be too tough of an initial test for his squad but he was glad to have been proven wrong.\n\n\"We performed well in most of those matches which was good and so we're way ahead already of where I would have thought we could possibly be and I'm thankful to have the opportunities to play the opponents that we've played because it's made us much stronger.\n\n\"We will definitely use it to help us grow and develop and build confidence in what we're doing.\"", "source": {"uri": "rfi.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "RFI"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Marsch", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jesse Marsch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leeds United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RB_Leipzig", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RB Leipzig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Rutherford,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "East Rutherford, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East Rutherford, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Handball/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Handball/Tournaments", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://s.rfi.fr/media/display/83024492-3e6f-11ef-b64d-005056bfb2b6/647157cba9948d97ddfed891faa5ded446d496e7.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716884", "eventUri": "eng-9716884", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

Roberto Baggio scored twice to lead the Azzurri to a 2-1 win.\n\n\"It was eye-opening for me,\" Marsch wrote in The Athletic in 2022. \"It was exciting, the possibility of having that kind of soccer culture back home... It made us dream.\"\n\nThree decades later, nearly to the day, Marsch will be back in the Meadowlands for an international tournament semifinal. The venue is more modern, the new MetLife Stadium versus the old Giants Stadium, and Marsch's view will be a bit different, too. He'll be standing on the sideline as the manager of Canada as his team looks to shock the world by upsetting Argentina in Copa America.\n\nIt's a full-circle moment for Marsch who, just a few weeks into his first head coaching job in international soccer, has a chance to make history. That he's doing it back in New Jersey, a place that was formative for him both as a student and athlete at Princeton and as coach of the New York Red Bulls, is not lost on him.\n\n\"I was more just thinking about Canada and making sure we're ready to play against Argentina,\" Marsch said on Sunday after Canada's training at the Pingry School in Basking Ridge (see top image), a field that was built as a training site for Baggio's Italy team in 1994. \"But then when we landed here and we started driving down the road and in the bus and I looked at all the familiar sights and then all the people that have reached out to me, it does remind me about how special this is, to be here in this moment.\"\n\nIt was here that Marsch first developed under then-Princeton coach Bob Bradley, the future United States men's national team manager, finishing as the Ivy League's top goal scorer in 1994 and 1995. It was here where he won his first trophy as a manager, the Supporters' Shield with the New York Red Bulls in 2015. It was also here where Marsch forged his own identity as a coach; a place that set him on a path to the Champions League as coach of Red Bull Salzburg and then to RB Leipzig in the German Bundesliga. After that came a spell in charge of Leeds United in the Premier League before he took on the Canada job in May.\n\nWin or lose on Tuesday, Marsch's start with Canada has been special -- and surprising. The Canadians emerged from a group that included Argentina, Chile and Peru before downing Venezuela in penalties in the quarterfinals. Now they'll get another shot at Lionel Messi and Argentina with a berth in the final on the line. It is Canada's first semifinal in an international tournament since winning the Gold Cup in 2000.\n\nJust as Marsch said he was inspired by that Italy-Bulgaria game and how the 1994 World Cup breathed life into the sport in this country, Tuesday's game might have a similar effect back in Canada, building momentum for the sport and behind the national team ahead of the 2026 World Cup, which Canada will co-host with the U.S. and Mexico.\n\n\"I said after the (Venezuela) match that we probably have to play a perfect match (against Argentina) and maybe even then it's not enough,\" Marsch said. \"We understand how good Argentina is, but we're certainly not afraid. They've only lost twice in five years, Messi is the best player to ever play the game, but we believe we have a chance. And that's the way we're preparing ourselves.\"\n\nThose who know Marsch best say they are not surprised that he has Canada on this stage already.\n\nThe bluestone patio in Princeton basketball coach Mitch Henderson's backyard is a reminder of Marsch's first years back in New Jersey.\n\nMarsch's first head coaching job in MLS with Montreal had lasted just one season -- he and the team parted by mutual consent -- and over the next year he and his wife, Kim, took their three kids out of school and traveled around the world. They slept in hostels in Hong Kong and Singapore, moved through south-east Asia and visited Bradley, who was coaching Egypt's national team.\n\nWhen they returned to the U.S., they settled back in Princeton, where Marsch took an assistant coaching job at his Alma mater under longtime coach Jim Barlow. Kim Marsch said it was important to come back to Princeton, where they had friends that could help root them as they figured out what came next.\n\n\"It was nice to have a support system, because we were kind of in the unknown,\" Kim Marsch said on Monday from the back of a cab after landing from Italy to watch Canada play. \"Jesse's dream was to be a coach and to be a good one, and there weren't any jobs coming. ... It was good to have people we considered family in New Jersey.\"\n\nJesse Marsch and Henderson had become good friends when the two were in Chicago -- Marsch playing for the Fire, Henderson coaching at Northwestern -- and their families quickly became close. In Princeton, they'd work on lawn projects with each other and discuss coaching philosophies and experiences. They still have the same types of exchanges now, only with a few more years of wins and losses behind them.\n\n\"As we've grown now, the human element comes up more,\" Henderson said. \"Instead of 'Well, we do this, this is my style, this is what I'm doing,' it's the interpersonal stuff.\"\n\nFor Marsch, returning to Princeton seemed to connect him back to his playing days and happy memories there. Barlow said Marsch seemed committed to helping the team find similar joy in their college playing days. After a loss to Darmouth at the start of the Ivy League season in 2014, Barlow said Marsch told the team they wouldn't lose another game. Princeton was 3-3-2 at the time -- they would finish 11-3-3.\n\n\"Jesse is so strong-willed, when he said that the guys were like, 'OK,' and we didn't lose the rest of the season,\" Barlow said. \"If someone like Jesse says we're not losing, we're not losing. He has that kind of powerful will to get people to believe in things, to get them to believe in themselves and to come together.\"\n\nBarlow recalled Marsch crying at a season-ending banquet because he had become so attached to the team. Henderson remembers those years as formative for both he and Marsch as they developed their coaching identities. Last year, as Princeton made a run to become the fourth 15-seed to reach the NCAA men's basketball tournament Sweet 16, Marsch was in the stands cheering Henderson on, and Henderson will be at the Meadowlands on Tuesday.\n\nMarsch's next coaching move to the New York Red Bulls, however, set him on a new path. Shortly after being hired, he went overseas for meetings with the company's sporting leaders. Marsch described what followed as \"an explosion in my brain. ... From a tactical perspective it was an epiphany in my life.\"\n\nMarsch sat in business class on a flight home from Doha, Qatar, scribbling furiously on napkins and in notebooks trying to get down all the ideas that the meetings inspired in him. After a few hours of watching Marsch writing, a glass of wine on the console next to his seat, RBNY sporting director Ali Curtis walked down the aisle of the plane to the man he hired to direct the RBNY project.\n\n\"You're killing me,\" Marsch recalled Curtis saying. \"I've got to know what you're thinking.\"\n\n\"This is going to work,\" Marsch said.\n\nHenderson said Marsch was \"buzzing\" upon his return. Kim Marsch recalled a dinner with assistant coach Denis Hamlett and his family in which Marsch turned over a kid's placemat at the pizza place and started sketching out how the team would play.\n\nSacha Kljestan signed with New York from Anderlecht after a few conversations with Marsch. Tactics were never discussed. After his last game in Belgium, Kljestan boarded a flight the next morning, took a physical in New Jersey and then boarded another flight to Orlando to join up with the team. The next morning, Marsch brought him over to his table to have breakfast and talk.\n\n\"He started to draw out on a piece of paper how he wanted us to play,\" Kljestan recalled. \"I was like, 'Woah, you want our outside backs to press that high up the field? Are you crazy?' He said, 'Trust me, it's going to work as long as everybody buys in.' We all bought in from day one and had a very good team. At first everybody had their questions, but we had a really good pre-season and the success of 2015 (when RBNY won the MLS Supporters' Shield) is proof of everything.\"\n\nNow with Canada, Marsch's style of play is being tested at international level. He has pushed back on those who doubted it could work, given coaches have less time to prepare with their teams. Instead, he argues that at club level, especially in the Premier League, the cracks in the way good teams play \"are so thin that they're almost impossible to get through.\" At the international level, Marsch says, those cracks are bigger because teams aren't as ingrained in their systems.\n\n\"The way that we're playing it's not the most complex version of what I normally do with teams, but it's enough to give us enough organization and enough identity for the players to understand how to execute it and what their roles are and what the plan is,\" Marsch said of Canada.\n\nKljestan, for one, isn't surprised to see it work so quickly. He pointed to the make-up of Canada's national team pool and the players who fit well into a more relentless style of play but, for Kljestan, there is another reason why Canada has been successful. It goes back to the confidence Marsch has long had in himself, and the confidence he built in his identity as a coach not far from where his team will take the field at MetLife on Tuesday.\n\n\"You can see with Canada, they are all very proud to play for their national team and excited to try to move soccer forward with their country,\" Kljestan said. \"So it's a mix tactically of what Jesse is trying to do, with what Jesse brings as an X-factor, which is his love and care for players and how players respond to him. It all comes together really really well.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_tenorio@nytimes.com", "name": "Paul

Uruguay.\n\nThe 48th-ranked Canadians are looking for a podium finish in their first Copa America appearance after losing 2-0 to top-ranked Argentina in semifinal play Tuesday at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J.\n\nNamed Canada coach on May 13, Marsch landed in the deep end with friendlies against No. 2 France and the seventh-ranked Netherlands before facing Argentina (twice), No. 40 Peru, No. 31 Chile and No. 54 Venezuela.\n\nThe Canadian men have gone 1-3-3 against that opposition, with one of those draws turning into a penalty shootout win (over Venezuela in the Copa quarterfinal).\n\nIn contrast, John Herdman's first seven games as Canada coach after taking over in January 2018 were against No. 120 New Zealand, the 199th-ranked U.S. Virgin Islands, No. 177 Dominica, No. 133 St. Kitts and Nevis, unranked French Guiana and Martinique, and No. 18 Mexico (all rankings at the time of the matches).\n\nCanada's current lack of clinical finishing is an issue, with just two goals in five Copa games. And March acknowledged Canada could have made life easier on itself -- and allowed him to go to his bench earlier and more often -- if it had scored more.\n\n\"We have to do better there,\" he said, citing 14 \"big chances missed\" at the tournament.\n\n\"We have big talent and some great goal-scorers And I know we will continue to develop that ... But the fact that we are getting big chances, the fact that we are still in the game, playing the way that we want to play, committing to all the things, that we want, in the end that's what will lead us to be more effective, more efficient, clearer, to have more game control -- all of those things.\n\n\"So big credit after five weeks, against these opponents, for these guys to perform like this. And even though we didn't execute everything perfectly, clearly, clearly we're on a good path. Clearly.\"\n\nCopa America has been gruelling in the summer heat with travel taking the Canadians from Atlanta to Kansas City, Orlando, Arlington, Texas, and East Rutherford before Saturday's finale in Charlotte.\n\nAfter sticking with a core group of players for the tournament, Marsch said he planned to dig into his roster for Saturday's game, noting \"we clearly ran out of legs (against Argentina).\"\n\nMarsh said Luc de Fougerolles, an 18-year-old defender with England's Fulham, could make his debut Saturday.\n\n\"He's been one of the best performers in camp,\" said the 50-year-old American.\n\nThe Canada coach also had positive news about captain Alphonso Davies, who hobbled off the pitch in the 71st minute Tuesday after a hard Argentine challenge.\n\nAn X-ray proved negative.\n\n\"Whether he'll be available for Saturday night it's too early to say,\" Marsch added.\n\nThe Canadian performance at the tournament has drawn attention.\n\nMidfielder Ismael Kone, perhaps Canada's best player Tuesday, has left England's Watford for the French top tier with Marseille. Centre backs Moise Bombito (Colorado Rapids) and Derek Cornelius (Malmo, Sweden) have reportedly been targeted by other clubs.\n\nStriker Jonathan David (Lille, France) continues to be linked with a number of English clubs while Davies' future with Bayern Munich remains up in the air, with reported interest from Real Madrid.\n\nCanada will also rise in the FIFA rankings.\n\nWidening the talent pool remains an objective, with Marsch saying he planned to take in Forge FC's CPL game against visiting Pacific FC on Sunday. Young talent has to be challenged at an earlier age and developed faster, he said.\n\n\"We've got to find a way to demand more out of the young players. And when I say young, I mean like 14, 15, 16, not 24 25, 26 ... We actually have the athletes in this country. We do. But we need to now develop them in a way where they understand high-level football.\"\n\nCanada has lost both previous matches with Uruguay, most recently falling 2-0 in September 2022 in Bratislava in a warm-up for the World Cup in Qatar. Uruguay won 3-1 when they met in February 1986 at the six-team Miami Cup, a tune-up for the World Cup in Mexico.\n\nCanada is 1-2-0 all-time against Colombia with the South Americans winning 1-0 in the most recent meeting in Harrison, N.J., in an October 2014 friendly.\n\nBut Canada's lone win over Colombia was a memorable one, a 2-0 decision in the final of the 2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup. Jason deVos and Carlo Corrazin scored the goals at the Los Angeles Coliseum.\n\nColombia blanked Canada 3-0 in the other meeting, in March 1988 in Armenia, Colombia.\n\n--\n\nFollow @NeilMDavidson on

Canada lost 2-0 to Argentina in the opening game of the tournament but Marsch believes they have improved in many ways since that game in Atlanta on June 20.\n\n\"If you just look at the amount of days that we've spent together, it's almost like the 18 days we've had since has doubled the amount of time we've spent together,\" he said. \"So we've invested in that time in making sure that we've tactically been clear, that the relationships on the pitch are clear and the understanding of how to handle all moments is better,\" he said. \"I just think we've developed and we feel more confident in the roles and tactically how we're playing,\" he added. Canada exceeded expectations by making it out of Group A ahead of South Americans Chile and Peru before pulling off a shock quarter-final win, on penalties, against Venezuela.\n\nOne key area where Marsch wants to see a big improvement though is in their handling of Lionel Messi.\n\n\"We didn't do well enough with Messi last match and he was able to run free at our goalkeeper too much. We won't man-mark him but he will be an emphasis in how we will defend and our ability to keep track of him will be really important,\" said Marsch.\n\n\"We have certain things that we'll try to do to try to make it difficult for him, but we know that limiting his space is the number one thing. \"We don't want him free and running at our back line, and running at our goalkeeper like last game, where that was not good enough, but we all know he is the greatest player to ever play the game,\" he said.\n\nMarsch has repeatedly talked of his team needing to play with a \"fearless\" approach and he said that was by no means simply about being brave. \"For me, fearlessness comes from the clarity of understanding roles and knowing that within the roles if you make mistakes that people are going to be able to help support you in those moments, tactically, mentally, psychologically, in every way.\n\n\"The more that you can create an environment where they understand what we're trying to achieve, where it makes sense to them and they know how to commit to it fully, the more engaged they are and the more they value it, the more they own it and the more they become fearless because they trust what's being built. And so that's what I try to do,\" he said.

The same was true inside the stadium, where a tightly packed section of red made up just a sliver of the 80,000-strong crowd in attendance.\n\nIt did not take long for the difference to be felt on the pitch, too, offering a reminder that the question asked of Cinderellas about if they can go for one more game can be answered simply with a no.\n\nCanada lost 2-0 to Argentina on Tuesday after the energy evaporated from them barely 20 minutes into the game, not helped by a hot, summer day that was accompanied by burdensome humidity. That is not to suggest that Canada crumbled under the weight of expectations; the first Copa America semifinal just became a slog that was meant to be survived, which is why a feeling of inevitability canceled out any excitement for an underdog story.\n\n\"I think that the tournament caught up with us a little bit,\" Canada head coach Jesse Marsch said after the game. \"Argentina rotated a lot of players throughout the tournament so that they were using different players at different moments so that they weren't calling on the same players every match. There's been heat, there's been travel, there's been a lot of challenges.\"\n\nIt required each team to rely on their parts rather than the sum, which was always going to benefit Argentina. It was far from their best 90-minute showing but it did not matter as Lionel Messi finally got his first goal of the competition while his team dominated the match. Adding to the feeling of certain defeat was the loss of Canada's star and captain Alphonso Davies, who Marsch said will need an x-ray after exiting the match with an injury.\n\nAnd yet, the air of optimism stayed put. How could it not, since Marsch has had less than two weeks in the job and took Canada all the way to the semifinals of a competition they struggled to qualify for before he turned up?\n\nIt is an impressive feat with so little time to prepare and alongside a player pool that has some star power but is incomparable to the world's top-ranked team. Luck always plays a part -- Canada were undoubtedly on the easy side of the bracket, facing some of South America's lower-ranked sides en route to the semifinals, which allowed them to get away with scoring just two goals so far. One-off meetings in tournament settings are also the perfect setting for a team to punch above their own weight as long as they have a good day. Marsch himself admitted that his first few weeks in the job went better than expected, with them now in Saturday's third-place match to close off their first-ever trip to the Copa America.\n\n\"It'll be hard when we're all done to say goodbye because I've really enjoyed the process with this team and I think we've made a lot of progress together,\" he said. \"We've had a wonderful five weeks together, six weeks together, and it's gone way better than any of us could have scripted. We have still a lot of work to do but we've built a really good foundation and I'm really optimistic about what the future can look like.\"\n\nIn just a few short weeks, though, Marsch mapped out the mission for the sport's middling national teams, each of whom have ambitions to do better than some might expect regardless of the challenges that face them. He translated his attack-minded, pressing style to the international level with immediate results, leading Canada to post nearly seven expected goals and pose danger along the way, even if by Marsch's own admission they need to be more efficient in front of goal. It's a demonstration that strong coaching can boost any team's chances, an exciting prospect amidst the visionless scenarios other similarly-positioned national teams find themselves in.\n\nThe easiest comparisons to Canada's quick success are the neighboring U.S. and Mexico, both of whom will co-host the 2026 World Cup with Canada and entered the Copa America as a chance to impress before the tournament on home soil in two years. The other two have historically been better than Canada and yet crashed out of the group stage and now feel directionless for different reasons. The U.S. situation is particularly glaring because Marsch was a candidate for the job in his native country but said he \"wasn't treated very well in the process\" that led them to re-hire Gregg Berhalter a year ago.\n\nThose two teams are far from the only examples, though, since so many national teams are in the midst of their own plateaus for a variety of reasons, chief among them the fact that it is just remarkably hard to turn a minnow into a dark horse. While Marsch and company earn praise from their nation, they have also raised the bar much higher than originally anticipated -- and perhaps raised the stakes in the process. If the Copa America was a dress rehearsal for the World Cup, then the countdown to live up to the billing in two years' time is officially underway.\n\nMarsch has already identified the areas of improvement for the next two years.\n\n\"Creating a broader player pool will be important,\" he said. \"And then continuing to work on the details of how we're going to play but we're off to a really good start.\"\n\nThe first point harkens back to Argentina's strengths since the team has been finding a way to score without Messi all tournament long and managed to rotate as they traveled around the U.S. to defend their Copa America title. It is also perhaps the hardest thing Marsch can do since he can only control player development so much. It is as big a promise as any, though, and the onus will be on him and the Canadian Soccer Association to deliver in two years.\n\nIt may be an uphill battle considering Marsch's constraints. In addition to the still-limited player pool, international coaches have intermittent FIFA-sanctioned breaks to impose their style of play and Canada will have the added difficulty of scheduling high-quality friendlies while the rest of the world is tied up with World Cup qualifiers. Time will tell if this is an impossible task or the start of the blueprint for national teams that hope the sum is greater than the parts.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "pardeep_cattry@cbssports.com", "name": "Pardeep Cattry", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Marsch", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jesse Marsch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Football pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinderella_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinderella (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MetLife_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MetLife Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Humidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getty_Images", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Getty Images"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Rutherford,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "East Rutherford, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East Rutherford, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphonso_Davies", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alphonso Davies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Soccer_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Soccer Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregg_Berhalter", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gregg Berhalter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_qualification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup qualification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dark horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/07/10/d9994393-71d4-4895-b30b-2cb491cec164/thumbnail/1200x675/c64abc9c25fcb9e92f0a7fc655b0f402/canada.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716884", "eventUri": "eng-9716884", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

We need to continue to challenge our group to come together and be able to perform in moments like this.\n\n\"But in general, we've had a wonderful five-six weeks together and it's gone way better than any of us could have scripted.

Did USMNT botch it with Canada coach Jesse Marsch?", "body": "The American Dream has been alive and well at the 2024 Copa America. And it's been lived by Canada.\n\nThe South America championship held in the United States this summer was supposed to be where the USMNT would show their mettle against elite international competition ahead of a World Cup on home soil in two years' time; where a so-called 'Golden Generation' of Europe-based talent would take the next crucial step in their development and prove they belong among the big hitters of the world game.\n\nInstead, the States flopped out of the tournament at the group stage, losing to Panama and Uruguay to bring about a swift and embarrassing exit that has sparked structural and existential questions for US soccer to ponder with 2026 on the horizon. Should the coach be fired? Are these players really as good as previously believed? Can this mess be fixed in time for the World Cup?\n\nMeanwhile it's Canada, co-hosts of the 2026 World Cup alongside the US and Mexico, who reached the semi-finals, losing only to reigning champions Argentina. And they've been led by an American coach the States turned down last year.\n\nJesse Marsch interviewed for the then-vacant USMNT job in the months after the 2022 World Cup. He'd been sacked by Leeds United in February 2023, but with a still-intact reputation for being able to foster a positive working culture and install the kind of effective counter-pressing system espoused by the Red Bull-owned clubs with whom he'd made his name, he was keen to bounce quickly back into management by taking charge of the national team.\n\nThe United States Soccer Federation instead decided to re-appoint Gregg Berhalter, the man they were trying to replace after his contract had expired at the end of 2022. In an interview earlier this year, Marsch hinted that he was unhappy with how he'd been treated by the USSF during their recruitment process. In May, he accepted an offer to become Canada's national team boss.\n\nMORE ON COPA AMERICA FROM F365:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Pulisic fails and USMNT dumped out of Copa America; Berhalter must be sacked this time\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Copa America power rankings: Transformed Darwin Nunez takes Uruguay top\n\n\ud83d\udc49 All 41 Premier League players in Copa America squads, including Man Utd pair and Paqueta\n\nIn the 14 games he's overseen since returning to the USMNT post in September, Berhalter's record reads seven wins, six losses and one draw. After a Copa America campaign that began with a humbling 5-1 pre-tournament thrashing by Colombia and ended early thanks to the Panama and Uruguay defeats, there are widespread calls for the coach to be binned.\n\nHad Marsch produced a similarly sketchy record in his short time at the Canadian helm, there would not have been such consternation. His first three games in charge saw Canada take on established powerhouses of the international game in France and the Netherlands in warm-up friendlies before kicking off their Copa against 2022 World Cup winners Argentina.\n\nA 4-0 loss to the Dutch on June 6 was a less-than-ideal start, but a credible goalless draw with France three days later showed signs of the success to come. Even in a 2-0 defeat to Argentina, the Canadians disrupted the flow of Messi and co. with a defensive rigidity that is quickly becoming their hallmark. A 1-0 win over Peru and a 0-0 draw with Chile allowed them to unexpectedly progress from their group.\n\nIn the quarter-finals, a clash with a flying Venezuela side - who'd topped their group on maximum points and had scored six goals while conceding only one - was where Canada's unlikely run was supposed to end. They'd have exited with plenty of credit in the bank, too. Getting out of a tough group and putting up a spirited fight against Argentina would have been a fine showing for the lowest ranked of the three 2026 World Cup host nations.\n\nBut Canada's resolute rear-guard was once again their trump card. They progressed on penalties after a 1-1 draw, setting up a semi-final rematch with Messi and Argentina on Tuesday night.\n\nCanada are far from the finished product under Marsch, and the manager knows it. For instance, despite a commitment to fast, direct attacking play, they scored only two goals at the Copa America. But even accepting their deficiencies and the work still to be done, they have provided clear evidence of what can be achieved in international football with cohesive coaching and a collective spirit.\n\n\"We're trying to find ways to be more proficient in our attack, and we're trying to continue to be a well-rounded team,\" Marsch told Fox Sports. \"But I think there's been real discipline, I think there's been real belief and excitement about what we're doing as a team. We still have so far to go to become the team that I really want us to be, but what I've learned is that you can implement a style on a national team, and if you're precise about the details, and you implement things step by step, and you're careful about how you instruct the team what you want to be and how you're going to get there, then you can have success with it.\n\n\"It also is a statement about these players. Their smarts, their desire to learn, their desire to achieve and become the kind of team that we are trying to build here is at a really high level and in a one-month time period, we've come a long way together.\"\n\nTheir presence among the Copa America's last four should not be seen as a heralding of Canada's arrival as major players on the international scene. They are, after all, currently 48th in the FIFA World Rankings, a full 24 spots behind the next-lowest-ranked semi-finalists, Uruguay. What they've achieved as guests in the South American championship will inevitably raise expectations for 2026, but more than anything it should foster hope for how - in the right circumstances, with luck breaking their way - a talented yet limited group of players can punch significantly above their weight.\n\nThe context of how Canada's Copa campaign has differed so greatly from the USMMT's performances at the tournament is inescapable. As both nations hatch plans for the next World Cup, the US would be well served to look north of the border for inspiration.\n\n\"I would love to say I'm just focused on what we're doing here in Canada, but obviously, I'm paying attention, as always, to the U.S. men's national team and I'm sad,\" Marsch said. \"I'm disappointed by the performances, by the lack of discipline. There's a lot of things that I think we've tried to be about, about the game in the US, and we've always believed in this group of players.\n\n\"Because I'm not there every day, I don't have my finger on the pulse of exactly what's going on but, certainly, it's not what we had expected before this tournament. And somehow, they've got to come up with solutions.\"\n\nMarsch might have been the man to provide those solutions for the USMNT. He's certainly struck upon a formula that fits Canada.", "source": {"uri": "football365.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Football News -"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_baldi@football365.com", "name":

We're establishing things at some high levels but in order to be a real team that can hold up to the biggest moments and biggest matches, there's more work to be done. But certainly we're on a good path.\"\n\nThat path takes the team to Charlotte on Saturday for the Copa America third-place game against either No. 12 Colombia or No 14. Uruguay.\n\nThe 48th-ranked Canadians are looking for a podium finish in their first Copa America appearance after losing 2-0 to top-ranked Argentina in semifinal play Tuesday at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J.\n\nNamed Canada coach on May 13, Marsch landed in the deep end with friendlies against No. 2 France and the seventh-ranked Netherlands before facing Argentina (twice), No. 40 Peru, No. 31 Chile and No. 54 Venezuela.\n\nThe Canadian men have gone 1-3-3 against that opposition, with one of those draws turning into a penalty shootout win (over Venezuela in the Copa quarterfinal).\n\nIn contrast, John Herdman's first seven games as Canada coach after taking over in January 2018 were against No. 120 New Zealand, the 199th-ranked U.S. Virgin Islands, No. 177 Dominica, No. 133 St. Kitts and Nevis, unranked French Guiana and Martinique, and No. 18 Mexico (all rankings at the time of the matches).\n\nCanada's current lack of clinical finishing is an issue, with just two goals in five Copa games. And March acknowledged Canada could have made life easier on itself -- and allowed him to go to his bench earlier and more often -- if it had scored more.\n\n\"We have to do better there,\" he said, citing 14 \"big chances missed\" at the tournament.\n\n\"We have big talent and some great goal-scorers And I know we will continue to develop that ... But the fact that we are getting big chances, the fact that we are still in the game, playing the way that we want to play, committing to all the things, that we want, in the end that's what will lead us to be more effective, more efficient, clearer, to have more game control -- all of those things.\n\n\"So big credit after five weeks, against these opponents, for these guys to perform like this. And even though we didn't execute everything perfectly, clearly, clearly we're on a good path. Clearly.\"\n\nCopa America has been gruelling in the summer heat with travel taking the Canadians from Atlanta to Kansas City, Orlando, Arlington, Texas, and East Rutherford before Saturday's finale in Charlotte.\n\nAfter sticking with a core group of players for the tournament, Marsch said he planned to dig into his roster for Saturday's game, noting \"we clearly ran out of legs (against Argentina).\"\n\nMarsh said Luc de Fougerolles, an 18-year-old defender with England's Fulham, could make his debut Saturday.\n\n\"He's been one of the best performers in camp,\" said the 50-year-old American.\n\nThe Canada coach also had positive news about captain Alphonso Davies, who hobbled off the pitch in the 71st minute Tuesday after a hard Argentine challenge.\n\nAn X-ray proved negative.\n\n\"Whether he'll be available for Saturday night it's too early to say,\" Marsch added.\n\nThe Canadian performance at the tournament has drawn attention.\n\nWidening the talent pool remains an objective, with Marsch saying he planned to take in Forge FC's CPL game against visiting Pacific FC on Sunday. Young talent has to be challenged at an earlier age and developed faster, he said.\n\n\"We've got to find a way to demand more out of the young players. And when I say young, I mean like 14, 15, 16, not 24 25, 26 ... We actually have the athletes in this country. We do. But we need to now develop them in a way where they understand high-level football.\"\n\nCanada has lost both previous matches with Uruguay, most recently falling 2-0 in September 2022 in Bratislava in a warm-up for the World Cup in Qatar. Uruguay won 3-1 when they met in February 1986 at the six-team Miami Cup, a tune-up for the World Cup in Mexico.\n\nCanada is 1-2-0 all-time against Colombia with the South Americans winning 1-0 in the most recent meeting in Harrison, N.J., in an October 2014 friendly.\n\nBut Canada's lone win over Colombia was a memorable one, a 2-0 decision in the final of the 2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup. Jason deVos and Carlo Corrazin scored the goals at the Los Angeles Coliseum.\n\nColombia blanked Canada 3-0 in the other meeting, in March 1988 in Armenia, Colombia.\n\n--\n\nFollow @NeilMDavidson on

And March acknowledged Canada could have made life easier on itself -- and allowed him to go to his bench earlier and more often -- if it had scored more.\n\n\"We have to do better there,\" he said, citing 14 \"big chances missed\" at the tournament.\n\n\"We have big talent and some great goal-scorers And I know we will continue to develop that ... But the fact that we are getting big chances, the fact that we are still in the game, playing the way that we want to play, committing to all the things, that we want, in the end that's what will lead us to be more effective, more efficient, clearer, to have more game control -- all of those things.\n\n\"So big credit after five weeks, against these opponents, for these guys to perform like this. And even though we didn't execute everything perfectly, clearly, clearly we're on a good path. Clearly.\"\n\nCopa America has been gruelling in the summer heat with travel taking the Canadians from Atlanta to Kansas City, Orlando, Arlington, Texas, and East Rutherford before Saturday's finale in Charlotte.\n\nAfter sticking with a core group of players for the tournament, Marsch said he planned to dig into his roster for Saturday's game, noting \"we clearly ran out of legs (against Argentina).\"\n\nMarsh said Luc de Fougerolles, an 18-year-old defender with England's Fulham, could make his debut Saturday.\n\n\"He's been one of the best performers in camp,\" said the 50-year-old American.\n\nThe Canada coach also had positive news about captain Alphonso Davies, who hobbled off the pitch in the 71st minute Tuesday after a hard Argentine challenge.\n\nAn X-ray proved negative.\n\n\"Whether he'll be available for Saturday night it's too early to say,\" Marsch added.\n\nThe Canadian performance at the tournament has drawn attention.\n\nMidfielder Ismael Kone, perhaps Canada's best player Tuesday, has left England's Watford for the French top tier with Marseille. Centre backs Moise Bombito (Colorado Rapids) and Derek Cornelius (Malmo, Sweden) have reportedly been targeted by other clubs.\n\nStriker Jonathan David (Lille, France) continues to be linked with a number of English clubs while Davies' future with Bayern Munich remains up in the air, with reported interest from Real Madrid.\n\nCanada will also rise in the FIFA rankings.\n\nWidening the talent pool remains an objective, with Marsch saying he planned to take in Forge FC's CPL game against visiting Pacific FC on Sunday. Young talent has to be challenged at an earlier age and developed faster, he said.\n\n\"We've got to find a way to demand more out of the young players. And when I say young, I mean like 14, 15, 16, not 24 25, 26 ... We actually have the athletes in this country. We do. But we need to now develop them in a way where they understand high-level football.\"\n\nCanada has lost both previous matches with Uruguay, most recently falling 2-0 in September 2022 in Bratislava in a warm-up for the World Cup in Qatar. Uruguay won 3-1 when they met in February 1986 at the six-team Miami Cup, a tune-up for the World Cup in Mexico.\n\nCanada is 1-2-0 all-time against Colombia with the South Americans winning 1-0 in the most recent meeting in Harrison, N.J., in an October 2014 friendly.\n\nBut Canada's lone win over Colombia was a memorable one, a 2-0 decision in the final of the 2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup. Jason deVos and Carlo Corrazin scored the goals at the Los Angeles Coliseum.\n\nColombia blanked Canada 3-0 in the other meeting, in March 1988 in Armenia, Colombia.\n\n--\n\nFollow @NeilMDavidson on

But this tournament has also been a transformational one for the 2026 World Cup co-hosts, with the Reds rebounding from a tournament opening 2-0 loss to this same Albliceleste side by beating Peru, Chile and Venezuela to reach the final four.\n\nAnd it's not done for Jesse March's team, which will play either Colombia or Uruguay for third place on Saturday. Somewhere along the way, the Reds took on the personality of their cocksure American coach.\n\n\"He's wanted us to be a bit more arrogant,\" defender Alistair Johnston said of Marsch after Tuesday's contest. \"He says we're 'too Canadian' in some ways, where we're almost too nice, and he wants us to have a bit more arrogance about us. And I think that we're having that. We're going out not being fazed. We're not just enjoying it -- we're really going out there and saying screw these guys, lets go out and let's throw the first punch.\"\n\nCanada almost landed it Tuesday against the World Cup champions. Despite entering the match as the heavy underdogs, the Reds had three golden chances to score during an end-to-end opening 20 minutes. They failed to capitalize and, sure enough, Argentina took the lead through Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez and never looked back. Lionel Messi added the backbreaking insurance goal early in the second half.\n\n\"I think we just lacked efficiency in the final third,\" Marsch said \"Every match, we created big chances.\" I know that they're very disappointed, but I'm very proud of them. We've put together some incredible performances.\"\n\nPerformances they can build on. On Saturday and beyond.\n\n\"We've had a wonderful five weeks, six weeks together, and it's gone way better than any of us could've scripted,\" Marsch said. \"There's still a lot of work to do. But we've built a really good foundation. I think we've made a lot of progress together. And I'm really optimistic about what the future can look like.\"\n\nWhen Canada men's national team qualified for the last World Cup in Qatar, it marked the program's first appearance at soccer's marquee event in almost 40 years. The country still has never won a men's World Cup game. They had lost seven straight matches in major competitions after losing the Copa opener to Argentina.\n\nThey'll have to get deeper, much deeper, in order to get anywhere near the final four at the next World Cup two years from now. That process has already begun. Marsch surprised many when he benched stout Qatar 2022 veteran Kamal Miller in favor of young central defender Mo\u00efse Bombito at this Copa. Bombito has more than repaid that faith even if he was beaten on \u00c1lvarez's strike on Tuesday.\n\n\"I'm trying to really build and develop every single player in this pool so that we can have a real 26-man squad when it comes to 2026,\" Marsch said. Like young forward Tani Oluwaseyi, who came on as a substitute on Tuesday and showed flashes of his potential.\n\n\"He gave me an opportunity based on a small pool of games and I'm very grateful to him,\" Oluwaseyi said. \"I think every guy who he's given an opportunity to stepped up. And I think we will just continue to see that as the years and months go on.\"\n\nWhat they've already seen is an attitude shift. Canada entered this competition as an afterthought. Whatever happens on Saturday, they will leave it with a well-earned swagger that can only help carry them forward. Much of that is thanks to Marsch, and the self-belief that he's instilled in his players already.\n\n\"That really comes from him and in his style of play and how he leads us,\" Johnston said. \"You can see the energy on the bench.

We're establishing things at some high levels but in order to be a real team that can hold up to the biggest moments and biggest matches, there's more work to be done. But certainly we're on a good path.\"\n\nThat path takes the team to Charlotte on Saturday for the Copa America third-place game against either No. 12 Colombia or No 14. Uruguay.\n\nThe 48th-ranked Canadians are looking for a podium finish in their first Copa America appearance after losing 2-0 to top-ranked Argentina in semifinal play Tuesday at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J.\n\nNamed Canada coach on May 13, Marsch landed in the deep end with friendlies against No. 2 France and the seventh-ranked Netherlands before facing Argentina (twice), No. 40 Peru, No. 31 Chile and No. 54 Venezuela.\n\nThe Canadian men have gone 1-3-3 against that opposition, with one of those draws turning into a penalty shootout win (over Venezuela in the Copa quarterfinal).\n\nIn contrast, John Herdman's first seven games as Canada coach after taking over in January 2018 were against No. 120 New Zealand, the 199th-ranked U.S. Virgin Islands, No. 177 Dominica, No. 133 St. Kitts and Nevis, unranked French Guiana and Martinique, and No. 18 Mexico (all rankings at the time of the matches).\n\nCanada's current lack of clinical finishing is an issue, with just two goals in five Copa games. And March acknowledged Canada could have made life easier on itself -- and allowed him to go to his bench earlier and more often -- if it had scored more.\n\n\"We have to do better there,\" he said, citing 14 \"big chances missed\" at the tournament.\n\n\"We have big talent and some great goal-scorers And I know we will continue to develop that ... But the fact that we are getting big chances, the fact that we are still in the game, playing the way that we want to play, committing to all the things, that we want, in the end that's what will lead us to be more effective, more efficient, clearer, to have more game control -- all of those things.\n\n\"So big credit after five weeks, against these opponents, for these guys to perform like this. And even though we didn't execute everything perfectly, clearly, clearly we're on a good path. Clearly.\"\n\nCopa America has been gruelling in the summer heat with travel taking the Canadians from Atlanta to Kansas City, Orlando, Arlington, Texas, and East Rutherford before Saturday's finale in Charlotte.\n\nAfter sticking with a core group of players for the tournament, Marsch said he planned to dig into his roster for Saturday's game, noting \"we clearly ran out of legs (against Argentina).\"\n\nMarsh said Luc de Fougerolles, an 18-year-old defender with England's Fulham, could make his debut Saturday.\n\n\"He's been one of the best performers in camp,\" said the 50-year-old American.\n\nThe Canada coach also had positive news about captain Alphonso Davies, who hobbled off the pitch in the 71st minute Tuesday after a hard Argentine challenge.\n\nAn X-ray proved negative.\n\n\"Whether he'll be available for Saturday night it's too early to say,\" Marsch added.\n\nThe Canadian performance at the tournament has drawn attention.\n\nMidfielder Ismael Kone, perhaps Canada's best player Tuesday, has left England's Watford for the French top tier with Marseille. Centre backs Moise Bombito (Colorado Rapids) and Derek Cornelius (Malmo, Sweden) have reportedly been targeted by other clubs.\n\nStriker Jonathan David (Lille, France) continues to be linked with a number of English clubs while Davies' future with Bayern Munich remains up in the air, with reported interest from Real Madrid.\n\nCanada will also rise in the FIFA rankings.\n\nWidening the talent pool remains an objective, with Marsch saying he planned to take in Forge FC's CPL game against visiting Pacific FC on Sunday. Young talent has to be challenged at an earlier age and developed faster, he said.\n\n\"We've got to find a way to demand more out of the young players. And when I say young, I mean like 14, 15, 16, not 24 25, 26 ... We actually have the athletes in this country. We do. But we need to now develop them in a way where they understand high-level football.\"\n\nCanada has lost both previous matches with Uruguay, most recently falling 2-0 in September 2022 in Bratislava in a warm-up for the World Cup in Qatar. Uruguay won 3-1 when they met in February 1986 at the six-team Miami Cup, a tune-up for the World Cup in Mexico.\n\nCanada is 1-2-0 all-time against Colombia with the South Americans winning 1-0 in the most recent meeting in Harrison, N.J., in an October 2014 friendly.\n\nBut Canada's lone win over Colombia was a memorable one, a 2-0 decision in the final of the 2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup. Jason deVos and Carlo Corrazin scored the goals at the Los Angeles Coliseum.\n\nColombia blanked Canada 3-0 in the other meeting, in March 1988 in Armenia, Colombia.\n\n--\n\nFollow @NeilMDavidson on

We're still at the beginnings of our process, right?\n\n\"Argentina has maybe had eight years together, seven years together with this team, and so we need to develop more players that can contribute so that we can also rotate in tournament play, because eventually the physicality and the fatigue can catch up with you.\"\n\nWhile the 2026 FIFA World Cup remains a focus for the Canadians, there's still one more game to be played at the Copa America, with third place on the line Saturday against either Uruguay or Colombia.\n\n\"Even though it's not the trophy, we want to get on the podium for the Copa America,\" Crepeau said of the motivation for Saturday.\n\nCanada can join Honduras and Mexico, a runner-up in 2001 and three-time third-place finisher, as the only non-South American sides to ever reach the podium at the Copa America.", "source": {"uri": "tsn.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "TSN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxime_Cr\u00e9peau", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maxime Cr\u00e9peau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Venezuela"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Venezuela"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peru"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Peru"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chile"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Chile"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco_2026_FIFA_World_Cup_bid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Morocco 2026 FIFA World Cup bid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honduras", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Honduras"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Honduras"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Arm_Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Arm Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://www.tsn.ca/content/dam/tsn/en/home/images/2024/7/10/maxime-crepeau--canada-1-2146643-1720614532623.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716884", "eventUri": "eng-9716884", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

They have staked their claim to the title of \"best national team ever\" by dethroning Brazil and ripping apart the reigning European champions, Italy. They won an unforgettable Mundial, beating the Netherlands, Croatia and France in quick succession. They came to the 2024 Copa Am\u00e9rica to defend their crown, perhaps expecting battles like the one they endured in 2021, where the journey began, in the Copa semifinals, against Colombia.\n\nThey got a team whose coach, Jesse Marsch, looked at assistants after two days of training and said: \"We could be in for a tough month.\"\n\nThey got a team they'd already discarded with relative ease in a glitzy Copa Am\u00e9rica opener. On that night, June 20 in Atlanta, they won 2-0 and, well, many assumed the Canadians were a mere appetizer; that the tournament would get tougher from there.\n\nBut it never really did.\n\nArgentina's obstacles en route to the final were Canada, then over-the-hill Chile, then floundering Peru, then Ecuador, then Canada again.\n\nIn 11 collective games, the non-Ecuador opponents combined to score two goals at this Copa Am\u00e9rica.\n\nTwo.\n\nMarsch, upon taking charge this spring, thought that his team -- a squad with stars but still in early-stage construction -- might go 0-5 in June.\n\nThey ultimately overachieved, but on talent and pedigree, they didn't belong here, at MetLife Stadium on Tuesday, in the Copa's final four. \"I couldn't have imagined that I'd be right here, right now,\" Marsch said.\n\nThat they were was a credit to their mettle, and their drive, and perhaps some good luck. But it also spoke back to the blatant truth of this Argentine run: at the 2024 Copa Am\u00e9rica, as American college football fans might say, they ain't played nobody.\n\nThey are, until proven otherwise, still the best national team in the world. Nobody doubts that. Nobody would dare doubt that. They are one win away from becoming the first South American team to complete a Copa-World Cup-Copa treble. They have lost only twice in five years.\n\nBut -- and this is the part you have to whisper -- they haven't looked all that great in the U.S. this summer. They easily could've lost to Ecuador last week. And they easily could've been dragged into a dogfight Tuesday.\n\nFor 20-ish minutes, they were relatively dormant against Canada. They struggled to break down a mid-block 4-4-2. \"It wasn't as easy to slice through our team as it was the first game,\" Marsch said. \"I thought that we were more stable defensively.\"\n\nThe Argentines were also a bit sloppy -- and, by extension, vulnerable. They let Jacob Shaffelburg run wild. They exposed themselves in ways that a better opponent would exploit, and Canada juuuust couldn't quite punish them.\n\n\"I think we just lacked efficiency in the final third,\" Marsch said.\n\n\"That's the difference between the best team in the world ... and us right now,\" defender Alistair Johnston said postgame.\n\nBut when I asked him about those first 20 minutes, and whether he and his Canadian teammates felt like they were right there with Argentina, \"for sure,\" Johnston said.\n\nJuli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez's goal after 22 minutes, a product of sharp attacking and loose Canadian defending, changed everything about Tuesday's game. It led to Canada players \"freestyling, instead of sticking to the plan,\" Marsch said. It forced Canada to open up, and expand the space between its midfield and defensive lines.\n\nMessi snuck in and out of that space, and lit up for perhaps the first time all tournament. But is he still great enough to dazzle against a South American giant?\n\nAnd is Argentina sturdy enough?\n\nAnd if Messi's legs are stalling, is the attack potent enough? Is the midfield still settled? Is the magic still alive?\n\nTwo hours after Tuesday's game, as Argentine players marched through a post-match interview zone, and as midnight passed, nobody was asking those questions. The prevailing mood was one of appreciation and awe. \"Grateful\" was defender Cristian Romero's word. Grateful to be part of such a special generation of players. Grateful for the rabid and adoring support of fans, which nearly brought Messi to tears. Grateful for six major finals in 11 years -- and determined not to take any of it for granted.\n\n\"I dreamed of playing just one game in the national team,\" goalkeeper Emiliano Mart\u00ednez said. \"If you told me I was going to be in my fourth final, I wouldn't believe it.\"\n\nThey were grateful for Messi, and for Angel Di Maria, who will play his final game for the national team Sunday. As those two gave late-night interviews, Mart\u00ednez walked behind them with a mischievous grin, and gave each a kiss on the back of the neck.\n\nThey all walked and talked with a lightness that only champions can display. They have earned the right to be unperturbed by the past or future, by strength of schedule or by dangerous predators lying in wait.\n\n\"I am aware that these are the last battles,\" Messi said, \"and I am enjoying them to the fullest.\"\n\nBut the facts remain the facts. The schedule has been soft. The final obstacle -- either Colombia or Uruguay in Sunday's final -- will be by far the largest and stiffest. And Argentina will, at last, have to prove itself once more.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

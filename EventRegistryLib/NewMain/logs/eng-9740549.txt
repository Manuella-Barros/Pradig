But in this polished, self-promotional documentary, few of their interactions don\u00b4t feel self-consciously calculated for public consumption.\n\n\"Skywalkers: A Love Story,\" which debuts Friday on Netflix, comes with an ominous warning: \"This film contains extremely dangerous and illegal activities. Do not attempt to imitate.\"\n\nThe same, of course, could have been said before the worm riding of \"Dune: Part Two\" or much of what transpires in \"Cocaine Bear.\" But in the case of \"Skywalkers: A Love Story,\" the caution label feels warranted. Nikolau and Beerkus each have backgrounds in athletics (Nikolau was an acrobat). But not much makes them \"rooftoppers\" besides that one day that started climbing cranes and haven\u00b4t looked back since.\n\n\"Skywalkers,\" directed by Jeff Zimbalist and co-directed by Maria Bukhonina, follows Nikolau and Beerkus through a relationship that begins with an invite to climb something in China. Beerkus, the more experienced of the two, is looking for a new angle to appeal to his sponsors. As they continue to travel the world together, their social-media fame grows. Soon, they\u00b4re in love, too, and their photos kissing perched high on skylines only help their viral numbers. They claim to aspire to \"art,\" but the images they create look more like screensavers.\n\nAlong the way, they\u00b4ve learned some helpful tips. Never to stay on top for more than 15 minutes - a lesson they picked up after their lingering atop Notre Dame caused a commotion. Mostly, they sneak into sites that are under construction by posing as workers. The way up can be tricky. On the way down, they notice, no one ever asks them questions.\n\nThis image released by Netflix shows Ivan Beerkus, right, and Angela Nikolau in a scene from \"Skywalkers: A Love Story.\" (Netflix via AP)\n\nThe big mission that bookends \"Skywalkers\" is their attempt to rooftop Malaysia\u00b4s Merdeka super-skyscraper, which proves to be an especially daunting task. In that way, the movie is similarly structured to a host of other documentaries, especially James Marsh\u00b4s \"Man on Wire,\" about Philippe Petit\u00b4s high wire stunt between the Twin Towers in 1974.\n\nBut \"Skywalkers\" bears none of the romance of \"Man on Wire,\" a film as much about its poignant location as its daredevil protagonist. We never get a much deeper sense of either Nikolau or Beerkus, either; even their most personal interactions feel scripted. There\u00b4s also something a touch less poetic about their day-to-day enterprise: auctioning an NFT in Kuala Lumpur or trying to get \"a drone guy\" on the phone. For more modern majesty at great heights, you\u00b4d be better off returning to Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin\u00b4s \"Free Solo,\" about Alex Honnold\u00b4s climb of El Capitan in Yosemite.\n\nJust as Petit was compelled by his passion for the Twin Towers, Honnold\u00b4s motivation came out of reverence for El Capitan. Insane as their climbs might be, you couldn't doubt their genuine fervor. The object of real adore in \"Skywalkers,\" though, might be a selfie stick.\n\n\"Skywalkers: A Love Story,\" a Netflix release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for language. Running time: 100 minutes. One and a half stars out of four.\n\nThis image released by Netflix shows \"Skywalkers: A Love Story.\" (Netflix via AP)\n\nThis image released by Netflix shows Angela Nikolau in a scene from

Just ask Angela Nikolau and Ivan \"Vanya\" Beerkus, who can be found bickering at the climax of their new documentary, Skywalkers: A Love Story, (premiering July 19 on Netflix). But work looks a bit different for them: the Russian couple are professional \"rooftoppers\" who have spent dozens of hours climbing all 118 stories of the Merdeka skyscraper in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia -- also known as the second-highest building in the world. When they reach the top of Merdeka's metal spire, which reaches 2,227 feet into the sky, Beerkus will attempt to hoist Nikolau in a Dirty-Dancing style lift -- that is, if they agree to go through with it. As Beerkus notes in the film, \"This is the craziest shit we've ever done.\"\n\nThat's saying something, considering that one of the couple's early dates was spent scaling the Eiffel Tower. They spent another in jail, after being arrested while descending the Notre Dame cathedral. So go the death-defying Nikolau and Beerkus, who partnered with co-directors Jeff Zimbalis and Maria Bukhonina, who also acts as their translator, for a conversation about their free falling love story.\n\nThe documentary's origins date back to the early nineties, when Zimbalist began rooftopping -- i.e. making unsecured, often illegal ascents up a tall structure. At the time, the filmmaker didn't know the practice had a name. \"I just called it trespassing,\" he says with a laugh. \"I was drawn to it for a lot of the same reasons that Ivan and Angela were; the transcendence, attraction to the unknown, being able to escape the pre-prescribed destinations of the city and find these autonomous places to face my fear and figure out who I wanted to be on my own terms.\"\n\nZimbalist spent years in search of rooftoppers to follow for a doc. He encountered a lot of \"daredevils dangling for likes\" before he met Nikolau -- the first major female rooftopper to burst on the scene, who found the sport after growing up in a traveling circus. \"Her influences were Basquiat and Warhol, not the Kardashians,\" says Zimbalist. When she introduced him to Beerkus, \"they presented their relationship as a competition or a rivalry. But you could sense under the surface that there was a flirtation, a courtship bubbling.\" He became intrigued by the parallels between extreme climbing and romantic trust. \"So many of the stories we have access to are about morally compromised subjects -- about deceit, betrayal, and abandonment,\" says Zimbalist. \"Our hope is that Skywalkers can encourage all of us to lean in to trusting each other again, especially when it's the scariest thing to do.\"\n\nAs they shot the film over six years across six countries, the couple helped capture more than 200 hours of original footage from their climbs. (They got an \"extreme cinematography\" credit on Skywalkers in return.) But the most daunting scenes they shot were those on the ground. \"Yeah, they weren't afraid of the heights at all,\" Zimbalist smiles. \"It was just revealing their true selves.\"\n\nNikolau and Beerkus are used to curating their image for social media. In the film, though, they were asked to get real about their fears surrounding falling -- both from buildings and for each other. \"They taught us how to rooftop, and we taught them how to do feature film -- warts-and-all,\" says Bukhonina. \"Of course, temperatures get high sometimes, and things fly.\"", "source": {"uri": "vanityfair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vanity Fair"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conde_nast@vanityfair.com", "name": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Nikolau", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angela Nikolau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_(love)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Romance (love)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merdeka", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Merdeka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooftopping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rooftopping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyscraper", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Skyscraper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kuala Lumpur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kuala Lumpur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notre-Dame_de_Paris", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Notre-Dame de Paris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Filmmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_Tower", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eiffel Tower"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Michel_Basquiat", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jean-Michel Basquiat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Feature film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Warhol", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andy Warhol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Circus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stunt_performer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stunt performer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Romanticism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinematography", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cinematography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6696a2da7a7992a3c4b5ab0b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Skywalkers__A_Love_Story_n_01_33_57_17.jpg,Skywalkers__A_Love_Story_n_01_33_57_17.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9740549", "eventUri": "eng-9740549", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 330, "textEnd": 337}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 225, "relevance": 1}

Beerkus asks the cameras to stop shooting during the latter scene. \"Every relationship goes through a lull or hits a plateau, and this film happened to be around when that was happening to us,\" Beerkus tells VF. \"Talking to filmmakers is kind of like therapy as well,\" he adds with a smile, \"because you have to explain to somebody your feelings.\"\n\nWitnessing these pressure points gave Beerkus and Nickolau a clearer picture of their dynamic, for better and worse. \"Seeing ourselves on the screen renewed our commitment to our lifestyle,\" he says. \"Before we saw the film, we sort of thought that it's routine -- we just do our life like everyone else's. But participating in the film reminded us that we live an unusual lifestyle and we made some choices that we're proud of.\"\n\nOf course, most couples don't spend their days intentionally putting themselves in mortal danger. \"This film contains extremely dangerous and illegal activities,\" a disclaimer warns at the start of Skywalkers. \"Do not attempt to imitate.\" Says Zimbalist, \"It was important to us to avoid any thoughts in a viewer's head about copycatting the activity. We make a big meal out of how they're trained acrobats and gymnasts, and they have a heightened sense of balance and concentration -- that they're actually athletes.\"\n\nThe film also acknowledges the many deaths that have resulted from skywalking, and Zimbalist says safety for its subjects was their priority. \"Don't do anything for the camera that you wouldn't do for yourselves otherwise,\" he told Nikolau and Beerkus, who during one climb had to remind his partner: \"Don't rush -- the importance is your life.\" Says Zimbalist, \"We had a whole safety protocol with their families, a written-out document that said we could only go up to certain rooftops with them. When the spire or crane started, they would film that [portion of the climb] on their own.\"\n\nMedia coverage has tended to focus on the #content produced from their climbs, inviting criticism -- and conspiracy -- about the motives behind the couple's work. But making the doc was less about silencing naysayers and more about exposing others to this often misunderstood pursuit.\"Our idea is never to prove anything to anybody, but just to do our art,\" Nickolau tells VF. \"There's not another couple doing what we're doing, so we're hoping that this film will show people the truth behind us as artists striving to create a new art form, a new point of view on life.\"\n\nFor months before the film's final climb, Nikolau and Beerkus wrestled with their decision to go through with it. At one point, while sequestered in Merdeka's overheated construction site with dwindling food and water, Nikolau recalls asking Beerkus, \"What's going to happen if we don't make it?\" before deciding, \"Oh no, if we have to go again and pick another building, we'll have to reshoot the whole film. It'll be too much work.\"\n\nZimbalist insists that whether the couple succeeded in climbing the windy apparatus was never the point. \"Even if you fail, what's going to be satisfying is whether you choose to trust each other,\" he told Nikollau and Beerkus. \"What we're hoping to build here as a love story has the central suspense [of] whether Angela decides to trust Ivan.\" In the film, Nikolau says most relationships involve two types of people: dream-chasing fliers like her, and safety-focused catchers like Beerkus. \"We thought of ourselves as the catcher and them as the flyer in our relationship between filmmaker and subject,\" says Zimbalist. \"So during Merdeka, when they were reporting about some of the obstacles, we were saying to them, 'Don't get arrested. You guys have got to find your way out of there.'\"\n\nAs strenuous as the climb appears in the movie, in real-life, Nikolau says, \"I remember suffering a lot more.\" At one point during their trek, the couple was forced to shutter their cameras and save any remaining battery life for the spire's peak. \"So it was even more eventful than the film was able to show,\" she adds. \"Normally when we climb, there's nobody expecting us to come back. So when we saw the film crew downstairs waiting for us, being so happy that we're alive and safe, it felt like great teamwork.\" Adds Zimbalist, \"We were partners in crime -- literally -- and also partners in creativity, and that was a beautiful process.\"\n\nThe pair's intrepid ascent, which was later projected as an NFT in Times Square, has elicited emotional reactions from early audiences. \"I haven't been to a single screening where people haven't applauded during the final lift at Merdeka,\" says Zimbalist. \" To look at audiences covering their eyes and gesturing towards the screen and yelling...it's more like a sporting event than a film.\"\n\nThe couple, who have been residing in -- and climbing their way through -- Bangkok, is next headed to New York City. They don't divulge details about any upcoming climbs, but admit that it'll be even more difficult for them to scale any city's skyscrapers after the documentary. \"There's a big chance people will recognize us,\" says Beerkus. \"We are already banned from some sites in Europe because we seem to be in some database -- they see us coming before we even get close. So there's a big chance the film will impact that even further.\" But this so-called \"daredevil couple\" remains undeterred. As Beerkus puts it, \"That just means we'll have to prepare better.\"", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Zimbalist", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Zimbalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooftopping", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rooftopping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Nikolau", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Angela Nikolau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Story_(Taylor_Swift_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Love Story (Taylor Swift song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notre-Dame_de_Paris", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Notre-Dame de Paris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courtship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Courtship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Michel_Basquiat", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jean-Michel Basquiat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Warhol", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andy Warhol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Translation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Circus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyscraper", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Skyscraper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_(love)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Romance (love)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Filmmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_Tower", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eiffel Tower"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kuala Lumpur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kuala Lumpur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plateau", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plateau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Feature film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Panic attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrobatics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acrobatics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stunt_performer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stunt performer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_Square", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Times Square"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangkok", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangkok"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangkok"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://dnyuz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Meet-the-Death-Defying-Couple-Who-Fell-in-Love-While-Climbing.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9740549", "eventUri": "eng-9740549", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 188, "textEnd": 195}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 224, "relevance": 1}

Do not attempt to imitate.\"\n\nThe force is not strong in \"Skywalkers: A Love Story,\" a shallow \"Man on Wire\" for social media influencers about a pair of Russian daredevils who stealthily scale urban heights to attain the precious treasure of a much-liked Instagram post.\n\nThere's a novel thrill to the high-wire relationship of Angela Nikolau and Ivan Beerkus, a Moscow couple who squabble atop skyscraper spires the way others might at the grocery store check-out line. But in this polished, self-promotional documentary, few of their interactions don't feel self-consciously calculated for public consumption.\n\n\"Skywalkers: A Love Story,\" which debuts Friday on Netflix, comes with an ominous warning: \"This film contains extremely dangerous and illegal activities. Do not attempt to imitate.\"\n\nThe same, of course, could have been said before the worm riding of \"Dune: Part Two\" or much of what transpires in \"Cocaine Bear.\" But in the case of \"Skywalkers: A Love Story,\" the caution label feels warranted. Nikolau and Beerkus each have backgrounds in athletics (Nikolau was an acrobat). But not much makes them \"rooftoppers\" besides that one day that started climbing cranes and haven't looked back since.\n\n\"Skywalkers,\" directed by Jeff Zimbalist and co-directed by Maria Bukhonina, follows Nikolau and Beerkus through a relationship that begins with an invite to climb something in China. Beerkus, the more experienced of the two, is looking for a new angle to appeal to his sponsors. As they continue to travel the world together, their social-media fame grows. Soon, they're in love, too, and their photos kissing perched high on skylines only help their viral numbers. They claim to aspire to \"art,\" but the images they create look more like screensavers.\n\nAlong the way, they've learned some helpful tips. Never to stay on top for more than 15 minutes -- a lesson they picked up after their lingering atop Notre Dame caused a commotion. Mostly, they sneak into sites that are under construction by posing as workers. The way up can be tricky. On the way down, they notice, no one ever asks them questions.\n\nThe big mission that bookends \"Skywalkers\" is their attempt to rooftop Malaysia's Merdeka super-skyscraper, which proves to be an especially daunting task. In that way, the movie is similarly structured to a host of other documentaries, especially James Marsh's \"Man on Wire,\" about Philippe Petit's high wire stunt between the Twin Towers in 1974.\n\nBut \"Skywalkers\" bears none of the romance of \"Man on Wire,\" a film as much about its poignant location as its daredevil protagonist. We never get a much deeper sense of either Nikolau or Beerkus, either; even their most personal interactions feel scripted. There's also something a touch less poetic about their day-to-day enterprise: auctioning an NFT in Kuala Lumpur or trying to get \"a drone guy\" on the phone. For more modern majesty at great heights, you'd be better off returning to Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin's \"Free Solo,\" about Alex Honnold's climb of El Capitan in Yosemite.\n\nJust as Petit was compelled by his passion for the Twin Towers, Honnold's motivation came out of reverence for El Capitan. Insane as their climbs might be, you couldn't doubt their genuine fervor. The object of real adore in \"Skywalkers,\" though, might be a selfie stick.", "source": {"uri": "eastbaytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "East Bay Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

He\u00b4d dabbled in the activity, on a smaller scale in his youth, and was fascinated to learn that it had become a global phenomenon on social media.\n\nOne rooftopper who stuck out was Angela Nikolau, notable for being one of the few women operating in the space. She introduced him to Ivan Beerkus, a fellow rooftopper who she\u00b4d begun doing joint posts with. Together, they were fascinating and good on camera.\n\n\"We didn\u00b4t know what the finish line was,\" Zimbalist said in a recent interview with The Associated Press. \"We really took a leap of faith on this.\"\n\nBut in the making of \" Skywalkers: A Love Story,\" now streaming on Netflix, Zimbalist quickly realized that there was something bigger happening with his subjects: They were falling in love.\n\nThis, he knew, was the story. The vertigo-inducing spectacle was the backdrop.\n\nThis image released by Netflix shows Angela Nikolau in a scene from \"Skywalkers: A Love Story.\" (Netflix via AP)\n\nAnd like illegally climbing an under-construction skyscraper, nothing was going to be simple or straightforward about the mission of putting it all together. In total, the small team spent six years making the film, traveling to six countries with Nikolau and Beerkus to capture their attempts to pose on top of the likes of the 1,957-foot (596.6-meter) Goldin Finance 117, in Tianjin, China, and the 2,227-foot (679-meter) Merdeka 118 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\n\nThe film begins in a tense moment in Merdeka: They\u00b4re trying to get to the top undetected. They\u00b4re scared. And their relationship is on the line.\n\nBehind the scenes was the inherent danger of it all: The trespassing aspect takes on a different kind of gravity in strict countries like Malaysia. Add in the difficulties of continuing production through COVID and Russia\u00b4s war on Ukraine, the logistics of filming without distracting, and the constant conversation about trust - not only between filmmaker and subjects but between the subjects themselves.\n\n\"They\u00b4d only been doing short form,\" Zimbalist said. \"The idea that we wanted access to all of the stuff in between their perfect, polished, finished poses was a new concept to them.\"\n\nNikolau was already relatively famous by the time Zimbalist got in touch. Born in Moscow to circus performer parents, she began amassing a large social media following by posting photos of herself on the top of buildings in acrobatic poses. Beerkus was too, for his more \"extreme\" photographs and films. They were both ardently solo acts. But when they started climbing and posing together, around the time when Zimbalist and his team began to follow them, their popularity grew. Prior to the Netflix debut, she had over 730,000 followers on Instagram, and he had over 236,000.\n\n\"We wanted to give it all to this project like we always do,\" Beerkus said through Maria Bukhonina, who co-directed the film and translated their interview. \"But it was unusual when the cameras started following us everywhere.\"\n\nOne place they weren\u00b4t being followed, however, was to the top of the spires or cranes. The filmmakers had made an agreement with their families to only go to the base roof with their verit\u00e9 cameras so as not to distract. Those shots were all done by the subjects themselves.\n\n\"They rigged themselves with body cams and night vision and GoPros and selfie sticks. Ivan\u00b4s a master drone operator. And Angela really started to understand what coverage was,\" Zimbalist said. \"They\u00b4re credited as extreme cinematographers in the film.\"\n\nAnother essential lynchpin was Bukhonina, who was born in Russia, and became the main conduit to the subjects during the pandemic. She and their small camera crew were on the road with them for years.\n\n\"We felt they were different from other subjects in the extreme space,\" Bukhonina said. \"Many athletes like this and in the Red Bull space kind of deny that they have any fear of death. But Ivan and Angela talked about their fears.\"\n\nBoth filmmakers like to say, this isn\u00b4t a film about the fear of falling from heights. It\u00b4s a film about the fear of falling in love.\n\n\"It doesn\u00b4t matter if you don\u00b4t make it to the top of Merdeka,\" Zimbalist said. \"The real suspense of this movie is, is Angela going to ultimately choose to trust Ivan?\"\n\nIn recent years there\u00b4s been several high-profile documentaries chronicling the lives and exploits of extreme athletes and daredevils, including Alex Honnold in \" Free Solo.\" Nikolau and Beerkus ignored the suggestion to watch that one and \"Man on Wire\" to get a sense of what a longform documentary was like. Their first foray was watching their own film.\n\n\"We saw how unusual our life is,\" Nikolau said. \"We always thought of ourselves as a normal, typical couple. Seeing that from the side kind of gives us a new perspective.\"\n\nBeerkus added: \"We liked all the choices that the directors of the film made because they were able to grasp the real essence of our relationship and what\u00b4s going on in there.\"\n\nIn the days after this interview, Nikolau and Beerkus moved from Thailand to New York. They have big dreams to explore other art forms. She likes to paint. He likes to write music.\n\n\"We don\u00b4t put any limits on ourselves,\" Beerkus said.\n\nThis image released by Netflix shows Ivan Beerkus, right, and Angela Nikolau in a scene from \"Skywalkers: A

They're the daredevil Russian couple who make a living \"rooftopping\", as in they illegally climb up spires and cranes mounted atop skyscrapers. And then they express their affection for each other in breathtakingly delicate poses, embracing each other while holding on to the ledge as if with their fingertips; all for the 'gram.\n\nThey flaunt that Bonnie & Clyde romance in Skywalkers: A Love Story, a doc that is alternately propulsive, trite and uplifting as it builds up towards the day in 2022 when Nikolau and Beerkus scaled the world's second-tallest skyscraper. The viral moment, captured with selfie sticks and drone cameras from Kuala Lumpur's Merdeka 118, didn't just attract headlines but also immediate questions from authorities who wondered how the couple got past the building's security and whether the couple perhaps faked their purported feat.\n\nNikolau and Beerkus have receipts, of course; the most convincing one being this several-years-in-the-making documentary. But such interrogations of authenticity remain the most fascinating thread throughout Skywalkers. This, after all, is a documentary about social media influencers whose lives become carefully composed content. Hell, their relationship in effect began as sponsored content.\n\nA travel brand encouraged Beerkus - then an extreme solo performer who would scale ice-covered cranes to the detriment of our nervous system - to seek out a female counterpart for his material. He landed on Nikolau, the daughter of circus performers who brought touches of ballet, acrobatics and an all-around artistry to her own rooftopping pictures. He pushed her to greater heights. She brought him a touch of class. Conveniently, or perhaps curiously, the sparks begin to fly right around the time the cameras started rolling on Jeff Zimbalist and Maria Bukhonina's documentary.\n\nSkywalkers often can't shake those reality TV/Love Is Blind vibes. So much of it is about an enviably hot couple staging their romance in front of the most spectacular sunset views. Occasionally, they have conversations between themselves, and the people around them, that can feel artificial and coaxed for the camera. During one rooftop exchange, Beerkus starts speaking in tropes, dramatically suggesting that the inevitable Merdeka mission be their one last job. Nikolau looks back at him with what comes across as genuine frustration. \"Let's stop now,\" she says, as if calling cut. \"We're talking complete bullshit.\"\n\nTo their credit, Beerkus and Nikolau are often too real for such gimmicks, which is why scenes when they play into the narrative tropes this genre demands are so awkward. The most compelling scenes, like the exchange mentioned above, chip away at that performativity and their precise but belaboured compositions, and peer over at what's typically meant to be out of frame. And it just so happens those moments can take place when Beerkus and Nikolau are dangling over the edge, like when they're arguing about composition - specifically how to get a shot of Nikolau's leg that meets her high expectations - while thousands of feet in the air.\n\nWe're struggling with vertigo. They're bickering about angles.\n\nSkywalkers obviously has its thrills as far as stunt footage goes, most captured with the tiny cameras Beerkus wears on his head. We ride shotgun as the couple evade security, make their way up anything that can be climbed (as well as the things that shouldn't be climbed); and get into foot chases that end in arrest or injury. It's so easy to get caught up in the fun that you forget many of their rooftopping peers didn't make it. When Skywalkers does bring up the casualties who died chasing this frivolous social media high, it's about setting the stakes for Nikolau and Beerkus's own escapades, rather than grappling with the ethics behind the illegal stunts the film romanticizes.\n\nThe film isn't grasping for deeper conversations, nor does it ever get comfortable in the negative space where a more fascinating movie might live. The years Nikolau and Beerkus spend grounded due to the pandemic - working as everyday social media influencers rather than the gravity-defying kind - and then watching the Russia-Ukraine war break out, are quickly montaged over. There's even a breakup somewhere in between that only warrants brief mention. You get the impression the couple is only comfortable sharing their lives when they're perched above where the rest of us live.\n\nBut I'd be lying if I said I didn't find them swoon-worthy, never mind the cryptocurrencies and branded partnerships circling their pursuits. Footage of the couple rehearsing the dizzying swan lift they eventually execute at the top of Merdeka has a casual Dirty Dancing energy. And the moment they pull it off, and sweep into a kiss so perfectly staged for Instagram, feels transcendent, even with a selfie stick in hand.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyscraper", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Skyscraper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russian language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stunt_performer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stunt performer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooftopping", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rooftopping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_(love)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Romance (love)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crane_(machine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Crane (machine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Nikolau", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Angela Nikolau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merdeka_118", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Merdeka 118"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Story_(Taylor_Swift_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Love Story (Taylor Swift song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonnie_and_Clyde", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bonnie and Clyde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_phenomenon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral phenomenon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protagonist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Protagonist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kuala Lumpur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kuala Lumpur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie_stick", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Selfie stick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Zimbalist", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Zimbalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet celebrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ballet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29d395acfefbb659c82435672fbb11a559a6ffdf/122_0_3596_2160/master/3596.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTMucG5n&s=b8b2c761ee411d11e819208b2e07ee52", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9740549", "eventUri": "eng-9740549", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

In 2016, two young Russians known for their extreme \"rooftopping\" adventures -- where they attempt to illegally climb vertiginous landmarks like La Sagrada Familia and the Eiffel Tower -- skipped the perfunctory happy hour cocktail and instead ascended China's tallest incomplete skyscraper, the 1,957-foot-high Goldin Finance 117.\n\nAt the time, Ivan Beerkus and Angela Nikolau didn't know they'd end up together. Beerkus had invited Nikolau, a rare female member of the rooftopping community (she was scaling the proverbial glass wall before breaking it), to join him for the climb to produce sponsored social media posts. But it was the beginning of a long romantic and creative partnership, which has led them to travel thousands of miles -- and thousands of feet in the air -- together.\n\nEight years later, the documentary film \"Skywalkers: A Love Story\" takes an intimate look at their unusual romance through hundreds of hours of footage that, of course, includes heart-dropping POV footage from impossible heights and the occasional run-in with law enforcement.\n\nNikolau was the first major female rooftopper and caught the eye of Beerkus, who was looking to partner for social media content.\n\nCourtesy Netflix\n\nLike all couples, Beerkus and Nikolau have their ups and downs, and when they argue the stakes are a just bit higher than most (in one scene, Beerkus bravely accuses his girlfriend of being \"too negative\" as she gears up to nail a precarious acrobatic pose literally above the clouds). Through the pair's unusual lifestyles, \"Skywalkers\" becomes a meditation on trust and commitment, though their stunts will also get your palms sweaty, if that's your thing.\n\nDirected by Jeff Zimbalist, a filmmaker with rooftopping experience of his own, and co-directed by Maria Bukhonina, \"Skywalkers\" debuted at Sundance Film Festival in January and is now streaming on Netflix. It follows the couple, who utilize Nikolau's background as a trained gymnast to create acrobatic stunts on narrow ledges, poles and scaffolding, as they take on increasingly difficult challenges and navigate their own budding relationship.\n\nThe couple were briefly arrested in Paris, and caught the attention of police in Kuala Lumpur as well.\n\nCourtesy Netflix\n\n\"It's not just about the fear of falling from heights, but more about the fear of falling in love,\" Zimbalist said in a video call with CNN. \"Angela first told me that they were... competitors and rivals. But you could sense under the surface that there was this bubbling flirtation there.\"\n\nAn architectural dare\n\nAs the documentary progresses, the pair plot out their most difficult climb yet: Kuala Lumpur's Merdeka 118, the world's second-tallest building. The gleaming 2,227-foot-tall tower, which opened earlier this year, is crowned with a 527-foot-tall spire whose apex is only accessible via a narrow internal ladder.\n\nIn 2022, when Beerkus and Nikolau made their plans, the \"supertall\" skyscraper had topped out but was still under construction. Evading security and reaching its apogee safely required an intense and elaborate scheme -- one conjured while they worked through relationship issues. (At the time of their climb, the tower's owner said police were investigating the pair for trespassing, although Malaysian authorities did not respond to CNN about whether further legal action was taken.)\n\n\"Skywalkers\" mixes the couple's own footage with original footage from the film crew.\n\nCourtesy Netflix\n\nTrained as a gymnast, Nikolau made acrobatics her signature as a rooftopper.\n\nCourtesy Netflix\n\nRooftopping is a contentious pastime -- both for the danger it poses and participants' reliance on illegal trespassing. With the urban \"sport\" emerging as one more of the more extreme ways to get likes on social media, several harrowing deaths have followed.\n\nFor \"Skywalkers\" the film crew followed Beerkus and Nikolau to document their stunts, but only to a point. Zimbalist emphasized his team's safety measures, which were designed to ensure the crew neither endangered themselves nor presented any distractions for the couple.\n\n\"We talked a lot with Ivan and Angela, saying, 'Please, don't go do anything additionally crazy beyond what you would usually do,'\" Zimbalist said. \"Because to us, this isn't a movie about whether or not you succeed at Merdeka or any other climb... the genuine suspense here is if you choose to trust each other.\"\n\nAn 'expanded state of mind'\n\nFor the couple, rooftopping isn't just about thrill-seeking. Nikolau, the daughter of circus performers, says in the film that pushing herself to her limits was engrained from childhood and that she is always striving to better herself. For Beerkus, who scaled buildings alone in Moscow for years, rooftopping offers a sense of mental clarity.\n\n\"The higher I went, the easier it was to breathe,\" he says to camera, recalling his earliest climbs. \"This extreme life, this expanded state of mind, it's essential for me.\"\n\nZimbalist recognizes the dangers of rooftopping and says his film is not about \"defending what they do against critics.\"\n\nIn the film, the couple emphasize that their motivations are more complex than just thrill-seeking.\n\nCourtesy Netflix\n\nInstead, he hope that \"Skywalkers,\" in addition to its message on love and trust, provides a rare look at the hard work and planning behind the rooftoppers' \"polished\" social media posts.\n\n\"With any activity that's dangerous, social media tends to disguise the difficulty,\" he said. \"Telling the story behind a stunt helps to give context and just how challenging and how dangerous some of these things are.\"\n\nNikolau says she's had to continuously overcome her fear of heights.\n\nCourtesy Netflix\n\nBelieve it or not, Nikolau maintains that she is afraid of heights, something she has had to confront repeatedly to keep up with her chosen line of work.\n\n\"The fear never really went away; I just got better and better at facing it,\" she explains in one clip.\n\nSo while the makers of \"Skywalkers\" would probably rather you don't climb your nearest skyscraper, their film encourages us to dare -- and say \"yes\" to the thing that scares us the most.\n\n\"Skywalkers: A Love Story\" is available to watch on Netflix\n\nAdd to Queue: Such great heights\n\nWATCH: \"Free Solo\" (2018)\n\nIf you prefer watching daring feats on rock cliffs instead of skyscrapers, this Academy Award-winning documentary by filmmaker Chai Vasarhelyi and photographer-mountaineer Jimmy Chin follows climber Alex Honnold as he prepares to summit Yosemite's very vertical 3,000-foot-tall rock formation, El Capitan, without a rope or a harness.\n\nREAD: \"Extreme Like a Girl\" (2021)\n\nPhotographer Carolina Amell compiles images and personal accounts of women in extreme sports, including wingsuit pilots, parkour athletes and slackliners, who are not only pushing themselves to their limits but breaking barriers in male-dominated arenas.\n\nLISTEN: \"Stuff Mom Never Told You: Women Climbing Mountains\" (2022)\n\nThis podcast episode delves into the lesser-known history of women mountaineers, from F\u00e9licit\u00e9 Carrel, the first woman to attempt to summit Mount Matterhorn, to Miriam O'Brien, who coined the term \"manless climbing\" in the early 20th century and achieved some of the world's most difficult climbs.\n\nWATCH: \"People in Motion\" (2012)\n\nThis documentary on parkour at the height of its popularity follows five people who practice the sport for different reasons.

I just got better and better at facing it,\" she explains in one clip.\n\nSo while the makers of \"Skywalkers\" would probably rather you don't climb your nearest skyscraper, their film encourages us to dare -- and say \"yes\" to the thing that scares us the most.", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooftopping", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rooftopping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrobatics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Acrobatics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyscraper", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Skyscraper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Nikolau", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Angela Nikolau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldin_Finance_117", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goldin Finance 117"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagrada_Fam\u00edlia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sagrada Fam\u00edlia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Romance film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_Tower", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eiffel Tower"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Romanticism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merdeka_118", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Merdeka 118"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topping_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Topping out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaffolding", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scaffolding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundance_Film_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sundance Film Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Filmmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kuala Lumpur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kuala Lumpur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/Indoor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/Indoor", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Production_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Production Services", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/content/dam/ctvnews/en/images/2024/7/19/skywalkers-1-6970329-1721404797155.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9740549", "eventUri": "eng-9740549", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

The directors effectively build tension throughout, showing the legal and physical risks of this sport. Some of the real-world issues surrounding the subjects get glossed over, leaving it mostly touching on only simple ideas.\n\nAcrophobia, or the fear of heights, is one of the most common sources of anxiety. As someone who dreads even getting on a ladder, I know it well. If you suffer from said condition, Skywalkers: A Love Storymight be the horror of the year for you, Longlegs be damned. But it also might be the documentary and romance of the year, too, with breathtaking footage that has to be seen to be believed and a compelling dynamic between its dual protagonists.\n\nSkywalkers: A Love Story (2024)\n\nDocumentary\n\nSkywalkers: A Love Story is a documentary that follows the daring exploits of rooftopping sensations Angela Nikolau and Vanya Beerkus. The film chronicles their attempt to scale the Merdeka 118 in Kuala Lumpur, the world's second-highest skyscraper, and perform a death-defying acrobatic stunt on its spire. As they navigate personal and professional challenges, this visually stunning documentary captures their journey to salvage both their career and relationships through a series of high-stakes adventures.\n\nRelease Date January 18, 2024\n\nDirector Jeff Zimbalist\n\nCast Angela Nikolau , Ivan Beerkus\n\nWhat is 'Skywalkers: A Love Story' About?\n\nThe dual protagonists in question are Angela Nikolau and Vanya Beerkus, two Russian rooftoppers -- people who climb tall urban buildings and often post the footage online for the world to see. Beerkus becomes one of the biggest names in the strange business due to his social media content, which is how he catches the attention of Nikolau, who aspires to build her own presence and platform.\n\nThe two reach new heights (pun very intended) when they join forces, with Beerkus' technical and strategic skills and Nikolau's artistic and creative touch making them unstoppable. The followers and sponsorships pour in, and soon, the two are traveling all over the world -- and catching feelings for one another. Unfortunately, the inherent stress of the job, the juggling of being both creative and romantic partners, and world events like COVID threaten to spoil the untraditional fairytale. It's up to the two of them to overcome these obstacles -- and over 2,000 feet -- as they embark on their most ambitious climb yet to fight for their place at the top and their relationship at the same time.\n\n'Skywalkers: A Love Story' Is Stunning and Suspenseful\n\nClose\n\nThe visuals in Skywalkers: A Love Story are jaw-dropping to the point that it's almost difficult to comprehend what you're seeing. It's a true feast for the eyes, with each photo and piece of footage showcasing endless seas of small buildings set against the vast blue sky more impressive than the last. Simply getting to the top of these places is unthinkable, and the stunts Nikolau and Beerkus do are impressive, even on the relative safety of the ground. To see the two combined? It's unbelievable and would be thought impossible if we weren't given a front-row seat to their process step-by-step. Skywalking is an athletic and artistic feat alike, and we get the pleasure of seeing them train for both aspects.\n\nBut skywalking is also dangerous -- not to mention illegal -- and the film smartly never lets the audience forget the peril involved. A sense of danger permeates the documentary, with harrowing footage of people falling to their deaths peppered throughout and references to old friends who have passed away attempting the very thing we are seeing the pair actively work toward. Nikolau's very understandable panic attacks are on full display, as are her injuries -- a stark reminder that they are not invincible or immune to paralyzing anxiety. They're only human, just like the rest of us. \"Our full potential,\" Nikolau notes at one point, \"is on the other side of fear.\"\n\nThe two aren't shy about talking about potential legal ramifications either -- especially in countries with strict vandalism laws. Some of its best scenes feel ripped straight out of a heist film. There are foot chases and high-stakes games of hide-and-seek as they try to hide from security, where one single cough could mean the difference between a successful mission and years in prison. It's tense and intense, as you feel like you're right there with them, your heart pounding in your ears.\n\nWatching the preparation is just as riveting as the strategy behind these climbs is fascinating. Directors Jeff Zimbalist and Maria Bukhonina do an excellent job stylishly having Nikolau and Beerkus walk us through the best way to distract security dogs, outline why you should utilize staff elevators, and the best ways to blend in and act like you belong in any given place -- not to mention how they figure out the best entrances and dates to perform these risky tricks. Even watching them practice the stunts themselves is interesting, unfolding like a training montage in a sports movie. (One highly important lift calls Dirty Dancing to mind.)\n\n'Skywalkers: A Love Story's Romance Helps Keep It Grounded\n\nSkywalkers: A Love Story has a larger-than-life premise and aesthetic. That's what will likely initially draw people in. However, viewers will stay for the small-scale focus on Nikolau and Beerkus' relationship. While the vast majority of us can't relate to climbing 118-story buildings, we can relate to wanting to protect the people we love and the struggle to open up and trust. We can also relate to bickering with a significant other, though the fact they do it while thousands of feet in the air adds drama but also a bit of comedy. They really made it look so easy.\n\nRight away, the film gets us invested in the people behind the profession. We learn that Nikolau comes from a circus family -- something she remembers as a magical place where her parents lived their dreams before separating. But we also learn that her childhood impacts her ability to fully lean on Beerkus emotionally (and, at times, even physically), her mother falling into a deep depression after her father left, and her grandmother instilling the fact that she can only rely on herself. Nikolau also must fight against sexism, as rooftopping is a male-dominated sport, with many of them excluding her. But Nikolau proves determined, deciding to become better than them and prove herself as one of the greats. Her obsession with legacy -- with being remembered after she's gone -- is deeply affecting and hits close to home.\n\nWe don't get to know Beerkus quite as well as his background is more thinly sketched. His parents argued a lot, and he began to join kids who would break onto rooftops to drink. Beerkus' priority, however, wasn't the alcohol, but rather, the exploring. \"This extreme life -- this expanded state of mind -- is essential for me,\" he says. He's an adrenaline junkie, that's for sure, but he also has an irresistible gentleness about him. He's tender toward Nikolau, and it's lovely to see, despite causing friction, with her claiming he's grown too overprotective. The two have an undeniable chemistry and connection when they first meet, though it's quite shy, and that makes it all the sweeter to watch it grow into something more confident and passionate.\n\nThe film stumbles a bit when it comes to weaving in the current events of the time. We hear that COVID has made it virtually impossible to do their jobs, causing them to pivot in the meantime until travel opens back up, but we don't delve too deeply into how the pandemic and being trapped together in a confined space impacted their dynamic or potentially contributed to their relationship problems. In fact, we fast-forward through many years, basically skipping a large and crucial point in time that feels like it changed everything. The Russia-Ukraine war, too, is touched on, but its effects aren't examined closely -- something that seems rather important, especially considering Beerkus is part Ukrainian and is torn about where he should live, especially considering the censorship he now faces in Russia. The fact that part of it then comes off like an advertisement for their NFTs is vaguely uncomfortable, feeling a bit out of place and salesy with how authentic the rest comes across.\n\nConsequently, the message we're left with is satisfying enough if a bit oversimplified -- one of love conquering all and inner belief being the most important thing. It's a bit of a clich\u00e9 theme for such an original movie otherwise, but it is a classic for a reason, and it is mostly effective. There's an edgier, grittier, and more thought-provoking movie hiding in here somewhere -- about chasing adrenaline and the commodification of your body, safety, and existence -- but what we get is still plenty entertaining. It's a beautiful story in an even more beautiful package that proves we should never stop holding out our hands and reaching for the sky -- or one another.\n\nSkywalkers: A Love Story

Illegally scaling the world's tallest buildings together", "body": "Nikolau says she's had to continuously overcome her fear of heights.\n\n(CNN) -- What was your most thrilling first date? In 2016, two young Russians known for their extreme \"rooftopping\" adventures -- where they attempt to illegally climb vertiginous landmarks like La Sagrada Familia and the Eiffel Tower -- skipped the perfunctory happy hour cocktail and instead ascended China's tallest incomplete skyscraper, the 1,957-foot-high Goldin Finance 117.\n\nAt the time, Ivan Beerkus and Angela Nikolau didn't know they'd end up together. Beerkus had invited Nikolau, a rare female member of the rooftopping community (she was scaling the proverbial glass wall before breaking it), to join him for the climb to produce sponsored social media posts. But it was the beginning of a long romantic and creative partnership, which has led them to travel thousands of miles -- and thousands of feet in the air -- together.\n\nEight years later, the documentary film \"Skywalkers: A Love Story\" takes an intimate look at their unusual romance through hundreds of hours of footage that, of course, includes heart-dropping POV footage from impossible heights and the occasional run-in with law enforcement.\n\nLike all couples, Beerkus and Nikolau have their ups and downs, and when they argue the stakes are a just bit higher than most (in one scene, Beerkus bravely accuses his girlfriend of being \"too negative\" as she gears up to nail a precarious acrobatic pose literally above the clouds). Through the pair's unusual lifestyles, \"Skywalkers\" becomes a meditation on trust and commitment, though their stunts will also get your palms sweaty, if that's your thing.\n\nDirected by Jeff Zimbalist, a filmmaker with rooftopping experience of his own, and co-directed by Maria Bukhonina, \"Skywalkers\" debuted at Sundance Film Festival in January and is now streaming on Netflix. It follows the couple, who utilize Nikolau's background as a trained gymnast to create acrobatic stunts on narrow ledges, poles and scaffolding, as they take on increasingly difficult challenges and navigate their own budding relationship.\n\n\"It's not just about the fear of falling from heights, but more about the fear of falling in love,\" Zimbalist said in a video call with CNN. \"Angela first told me that they were... competitors and rivals. But you could sense under the surface that there was this bubbling flirtation there.\"\n\nAn architectural dare\n\nAs the documentary progresses, the pair plot out their most difficult climb yet: Kuala Lumpur's Merdeka 118, the world's second-tallest building. The gleaming 2,227-foot-tall tower, which opened earlier this year, is crowned with a 527-foot-tall spire whose apex is only accessible via a narrow internal ladder.\n\nIn 2022, when Beerkus and Nikolau made their plans, the \"supertall\" skyscraper had topped out but was still under construction. Evading security and reaching its apogee safely required an intense and elaborate scheme -- one conjured while they worked through relationship issues. (At the time of their climb, the tower's owner said police were investigating the pair for trespassing, although Malaysian authorities did not respond to CNN about whether further legal action was taken.)\n\nRooftopping is a contentious pastime -- both for the danger it poses and participants' reliance on illegal trespassing. With the urban \"sport\" emerging as one more of the more extreme ways to get likes on social media, several harrowing deaths have followed.\n\nFor \"Skywalkers\" the film crew followed Beerkus and Nikolau to document their stunts, but only to a point. Zimbalist emphasized his team's safety measures, which were designed to ensure the crew neither endangered themselves nor presented any distractions for the couple.\n\n\"We talked a lot with Ivan and Angela, saying, 'Please, don't go do anything additionally crazy beyond what you would usually do,'\" Zimbalist said. \"Because to us, this isn't a movie about whether or not you succeed at Merdeka or any other climb... the genuine suspense here is if you choose to trust each other.\"\n\nAn 'expanded state of mind'\n\nFor the couple, rooftopping isn't just about thrill-seeking. Nikolau, the daughter of circus performers, says in the film that pushing herself to her limits was engrained from childhood and that she is always striving to better herself. For Beerkus, who scaled buildings alone in Moscow for years, rooftopping offers a sense of mental clarity.\n\n\"The higher I went, the easier it was to breathe,\" he says to camera, recalling his earliest climbs. \"This extreme life, this expanded state of mind, it's essential for me.\"\n\nZimbalist recognizes the dangers of rooftopping and says his film is not about \"defending what they do against critics.\"\n\nInstead, he hope that \"Skywalkers,\" in addition to its message on love and trust, provides a rare look at the hard work and planning behind the rooftoppers' \"polished\" social media posts.\n\n\"With any activity that's dangerous, social media tends to disguise the difficulty,\" he said. \"Telling the story behind a stunt helps to give context and just how challenging and how dangerous some of these things are.\"\n\nBelieve it or not, Nikolau maintains that she is afraid of heights, something she has had to confront repeatedly to keep up with her chosen line of work.\n\n\"The fear never really went away; I just got better and better at facing it,\" she explains in one clip.\n\nSo while the makers of \"Skywalkers\" would probably rather you don't climb your nearest skyscraper, their film encourages us to dare -- and say \"yes\" to the thing that scares us the most.\n\n\"Skywalkers: A Love Story\" is available to watch on Netflix\n\nAdd to Queue: Such great heights\n\nWATCH: \"Free Solo\" (2018)\n\nIf you prefer watching daring feats on rock cliffs instead of skyscrapers, this Academy Award-winning documentary by filmmaker Chai Vasarhelyi and photographer-mountaineer Jimmy Chin follows climber Alex Honnold as he prepares to summit Yosemite's very vertical 3,000-foot-tall rock formation, El Capitan, without a rope or a harness.\n\nREAD: \"Extreme Like a Girl\" (2021)\n\nPhotographer Carolina Amell compiles images and personal accounts of women in extreme sports, including wingsuit pilots, parkour athletes and slackliners, who are not only pushing themselves to their limits but breaking barriers in male-dominated arenas.\n\nLISTEN: \"Stuff Mom Never Told You: Women Climbing Mountains\" (2022)\n\nThis podcast episode delves into the lesser-known history of women mountaineers, from F\u00e9licit\u00e9 Carrel, the first woman to attempt to summit Mount Matterhorn, to Miriam O'Brien, who coined the term \"manless climbing\" in the early 20th century and achieved some of the world's most difficult climbs.\n\nWATCH: \"People in Motion\" (2012)\n\nThis documentary on parkour at the height of its popularity follows five people who practice the sport for different reasons.

But in this polished, self-promotional documentary, few of their interactions don't feel self-consciously calculated for public consumption.\n\n\"Skywalkers: A Love Story,\" which debuts Friday on Netflix, comes with an ominous warning: \"This film contains extremely dangerous and illegal activities. Do not attempt to imitate.\"\n\nThe same, of course, could have been said before the worm riding of \"Dune: Part Two\" or much of what transpires in \"Cocaine Bear.\" But in the case of \"Skywalkers: A Love Story,\" the caution label feels warranted. Nikolau and Beerkus each have backgrounds in athletics (Nikolau was an acrobat). But not much makes them \"rooftoppers\" besides that one day that started climbing cranes and haven't looked back since.\n\n\"Skywalkers,\" directed by Jeff Zimbalist and co-directed by Maria Bukhonina, follows Nikolau and Beerkus through a relationship that begins with an invite to climb something in China. Beerkus, the more experienced of the two, is looking for a new angle to appeal to his sponsors. As they continue to travel the world together, their social-media fame grows. Soon, they're in love, too, and their photos kissing perched high on skylines only help their viral numbers. They claim to aspire to \"art,\" but the images they create look more like screensavers.\n\nAlong the way, they've learned some helpful tips. Never to stay on top for more than 15 minutes -- a lesson they picked up after their lingering atop Notre Dame caused a commotion. Mostly, they sneak into sites that are under construction by posing as workers. The way up can be tricky. On the way down, they notice, no one ever asks them questions.\n\nThe big mission that bookends \"Skywalkers\" is their attempt to rooftop Malaysia's Merdeka super-skyscraper, which proves to be an especially daunting task. In that way, the movie is similarly structured to a host of other documentaries, especially James Marsh's \"Man on Wire,\" about Philippe Petit's high wire stunt between the Twin Towers in 1974.\n\nBut \"Skywalkers\" bears none of the romance of \"Man on Wire,\" a film as much about its poignant location as its daredevil protagonist. We never get a much deeper sense of either Nikolau or Beerkus, either; even their most personal interactions feel scripted. There's also something a touch less poetic about their day-to-day enterprise: auctioning an NFT in Kuala Lumpur or trying to get \"a drone guy\" on the phone. For more modern majesty at great heights, you'd be better off returning to Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin's \"Free Solo,\" about Alex Honnold's climb of El Capitan in Yosemite.\n\nJust as Petit was compelled by his passion for the Twin Towers, Honnold's motivation came out of reverence for El Capitan. Insane as their climbs might be, you couldn't doubt their genuine fervor. The object of real adore in \"Skywalkers,\" though, might be a selfie stick.\n\n\"Skywalkers: A Love Story,\" a Netflix release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for language. Running time: 100 minutes. One and a half stars out of four.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Nikolau", "type":

Follow the couple's journey to the top of buildings worldwide, showcasing their dedication to their art form.\n\nSkywalkers: A Love Story is a Netflix documentary focused on the true story of Russian rooftopper couple Ivan Beerkus and Angela Nikolau. The film, which is one of Netflix's best movies of 2024, is partially about two people who have enjoyed the cultural phenomenon of \"rooftopping,\" or illegally climbing buildings, their entire lives. Rooftopping appeals to people who enjoy taking extreme risks, and the movie allows viewers to vicariously experience it through breathtaking shots and access to Beerkus and Nikolau's thoughts.\n\nAlthough Beerkus and Nikolau contributed drone footage of their climbing expeditions that will satisfy people searching for action series on Netflix, the documentary is far more than a chronicle of the couple's adventures. For Beerkus and Nikolau, climbing is an art form that reflects their desire to live their lives fully. The documentary tells the story of how this extraordinary couple fell in love and celebrate life together through their dedication to climbing; the couple's climbs cannot be separated from their personalities or their relationship with each other.\n\nRelated 30 Best Movies On Netflix Right Now (July 2024)\n\nFrom Godzilla Minus One to Under Paris and The Gentlemen, here are our picks for the best movies on Netflix for everyone to enjoy this month.\n\nIvan Beerkus & Angela Nikolau Are Famous Rooftoppers Beerkus Got Nikolau's Attention When He Was Climbing Buildings In Moscow Close\n\nBeerkus and Nikolau are both Moscow-born climbers who have been engaging in the activity since they were teenagers, with Nikolau's background as a circus acrobat coming in handy as they climb buildings together. Beerkus got media attention before he and Nikolau met; in 2014, Nikolau followed his Instagram account where he was documenting the Stalin-era buildings he was climbing in Russia. Although she was not yet famous, Nikolau was also climbing buildings on her own during this period. She and Nikolau first connected online before beginning to climb buildings together.\n\nAngela Nikolau is the first woman to participate in rooftopping as an art form.\n\nThe couple risks not only their safety, but also their freedom to scale buildings, as most of what they do is illegal. They take such extreme risks that critics often accuse them of putting fake footage on Instagram, a charge which they consistently deny. Skywalkers: A Love Story is one of Netflix's best documentaries because the crew accompanied them on dangerous and illegal climbs, often using drone footage provided by the climbers themselves, which adds to the intensity and immersion of the viewing.\n\nHow Long Ivan Beerkus & Angela Nikolau Have Been Together They Fell In Love During a Dangerous Climb In 2016\n\nIn 2016, Beerkus invited Nikolau to join him on a climb in Hong Kong. At the time, he wasn't intending to have a romantic relationship with her; he needed a female climber as part of a sponsorship deal. However, while the couple was in Hong Kong together, they went out during a typhoon to look at rooftops and Nikolau fell for him during this risky activity. Soon afterward, they scaled several buildings in Hong Kong; each new adventure helped their new relationship to grow.\n\nAs of 2024, the couple is still together and has weathered many storms related to world events. The Russian invasion of Ukraine and the loss of social media in their home country forced them to flee, and they lost income and sponsorship opportunities due to travel restrictions during the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020. This led to their most risky climb in 2022, as they desperately needed the money to survive. The couple currently lives together in New York City where they are pursuing new rooftopping collaborations as well as other types of art.\n\nIvan Beerkus & Angela Nikolau's Malaysia's Merdeka 118 Skyscraper Climb Explained The Couple Hid In The Building For 30 Hours To Avoid Arrest\n\nSkywalkers: A Love Story spends a lot of time on the 2022 Merdeka climb, which was one of the riskiest climbs Nikolau and Beerkus participated in over their career. This climb was extremely dangerous. The skyscraper was 2,200 feet tall, soany accident would be fatal, especially since the rooftoppers weren't using safety equipment. The film depicts Nikolau having a panic attack while training for this climb and completely freezing, which underscores the danger the couple faced.\n\nOnce they began the climb, the couple faced another type of danger: the potential loss of their freedom. They meticulously planned the climb, using drones to help them map it out, and decided to do it on the night of the World Cup because they thought security would be distracted. The Netflix crew wired them for sound before they began the climb, and at first all went according to plan. However, the couple decided to take a break until sunrise while halfway up, which was a nearly fatal flaw in their plan.\n\nNikolau and Beerkus awakened at sunrise to discover they were sharing the floor they had sneaked onto with a construction crew. They had to hide to avoid detection and didn't know how they would survive, as it was hot and the building was dusty from the construction. The pair hid for 30 hours but had to risk going out into the open to get some water. Eventually, they made it to floor 188, where posters warning them about the arrests of previous climbers sparked their determination to make it to the top of the building.\n\nBeerkus attached the video footage to drones and flew it down so that if the couple were arrested before they got back on the ground, the crew would not lose the footage.\n\nOther Notable Buildings & Structures The Skywalkers Couple Have Climbed The Pair Has Climbed Buildings All Over The World\n\nBetween 2016 and 2022, Nikolau and Beerkus climbed many tall buildings that got them the type of media attention that led to Netflix giving them a green light for their documentary. Their relationship began when they climbed Goldin Finance Tower 117 in China. They have climbed several other buildings in China, most notably the Ping An Financial Centre. They have also climbed several buildings in Paris, including the Sainte-Clotide. They also attempted to climb the Notre Dame, but were arrested on the way down and held in a cell overnight, which is documented in the film.\n\nThis focus on authenticity sets Nikolau and Beerkus apart from other rooftoppers, especially those who take risks for the sake of it rather than planning meticulously so that they can create art while illegally perched on the top of tall buildings.\n\nSkywalkers: A Love Story depicts both the failures and successes of the couple's life as rooftoppers. It also provides an authentic look at their relationship, including Nikolau's trust issues in general and arguments and bickering between the couple during their climbs and at other times in their lives. This focus on authenticity sets Nikolau and Beerkus apart from other rooftoppers, especially those who take risks for the sake of it rather than planning meticulously so that they can create art while illegally perched on the top of tall buildings.\n\nSkywalkers: A Love Story (2024) RDocumentary\n\nA daring couple, Angela Nikolau and Ivan Beerkus, embark on an ambitious journey to scale the world's second-highest skyscraper, the Merdeka 118 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

He'd dabbled in the activity, on a smaller scale in his youth, and was fascinated to learn that it had become a global phenomenon on social media.\n\nOne rooftopper who stuck out was Angela Nikolau, notable for being one of the few women operating in the space. She introduced him to Ivan Beerkus, a fellow rooftopper who she'd begun doing joint posts with. Together, they were fascinating and good on camera.\n\n\"We didn't know what the finish line was,\" Zimbalist said in a recent interview with The Associated Press. \"We really took a leap of faith on this.\"\n\nBut in the making of \" Skywalkers: A Love Story,\" now streaming on Netflix, Zimbalist quickly realized that there was something bigger happening with his subjects: They were falling in love.\n\nThis, he knew, was the story. The vertigo-inducing spectacle was the backdrop.\n\nAnd like illegally climbing an under-construction skyscraper, nothing was going to be simple or straightforward about the mission of putting it all together. In total, the small team spent six years making the film, traveling to six countries with Nikolau and Beerkus to capture their attempts to pose on top of the likes of the 1,957-foot (596.6-meter) Goldin Finance 117, in Tianjin, China, and the 2,227-foot (679-meter) Merdeka 118 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\n\nThe film begins in a tense moment in Merdeka: They're trying to get to the top undetected. They're scared. And their relationship is on the line.\n\nBehind the scenes was the inherent danger of it all: The trespassing aspect takes on a different kind of gravity in strict countries like Malaysia. Add in the difficulties of continuing production through COVID and Russia's war on Ukraine, the logistics of filming without distracting, and the constant conversation about trust -- not only between filmmaker and subjects but between the subjects themselves.\n\n\"They'd only been doing short form,\" Zimbalist said. \"The idea that we wanted access to all of the stuff in between their perfect, polished, finished poses was a new concept to them.\"\n\nNikolau was already relatively famous by the time Zimbalist got in touch. Born in Moscow to circus performer parents, she began amassing a large social media following by posting photos of herself on the top of buildings in acrobatic poses. Beerkus was too, for his more \"extreme\" photographs and films. They were both ardently solo acts. But when they started climbing and posing together, around the time when Zimbalist and his team began to follow them, their popularity grew. Prior to the Netflix debut, she had over 730,000 followers on Instagram, and he had over 236,000.\n\n\"We wanted to give it all to this project like we always do,\" Beerkus said through Maria Bukhonina, who co-directed the film and translated their interview. \"But it was unusual when the cameras started following us everywhere.\"\n\nOne place they weren't being followed, however, was to the top of the spires or cranes. The filmmakers had made an agreement with their families to only go to the base roof with their verit\u00e9 cameras so as not to distract. Those shots were all done by the subjects themselves.\n\n\"They rigged themselves with body cams and night vision and GoPros and selfie sticks. Ivan's a master drone operator. And Angela really started to understand what coverage was,\" Zimbalist said. \"They're credited as extreme cinematographers in the film.\"\n\nAnother essential lynchpin was Bukhonina, who was born in Russia, and became the main conduit to the subjects during the pandemic. She and their small camera crew were on the road with them for years.\n\n\"We felt they were different from other subjects in the extreme space,\" Bukhonina said. \"Many athletes like this and in the Red Bull space kind of deny that they have any fear of death. But Ivan and Angela talked about their fears.\"\n\nBoth filmmakers like to say, this isn't a film about the fear of falling from heights. It's a film about the fear of falling in love.\n\n\"It doesn't matter if you don't make it to the top of Merdeka,\" Zimbalist said. \"The real suspense of this movie is, is Angela going to ultimately choose to trust Ivan?\"\n\nIn recent years there's been several high-profile documentaries chronicling the lives and exploits of extreme athletes and daredevils, including Alex Honnold in \" Free Solo.\" Nikolau and Beerkus ignored the suggestion to watch that one and \"Man on Wire\" to get a sense of what a longform documentary was like. Their first foray was watching their own film.\n\n\"We saw how unusual our life is,\" Nikolau said. \"We always thought of ourselves as a normal, typical couple. Seeing that from the side kind of gives us a new perspective.\"\n\nBeerkus added: \"We liked all the choices that the directors of the film made because they were able to grasp the real essence of our relationship and what's going on in there.\"\n\nIn the days after this interview, Nikolau and Beerkus moved from Thailand to New York. They have big dreams to explore other art forms. She likes to paint. He likes to write music.\n\n\"We don't put any limits on ourselves,\" Beerkus said.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

But there has perhaps never been something quite like Skywalkers: A Love Story, the new film from director Jeff Zimbalist premiering on Netflix on July 19. Skywalkers might be the first of a new genre: extended vlog (or TikTok, or Instragram reel) as feature film, existing somewhere between fact and fiction and all in service of promoting a brand.\n\nThat may sound like a negative critique -- and in some ways, it is. But Zimbalist's film is also a wholly compelling portrait of two crazy people who are crazy in love, risking their lives for what they've deemed art. The film centers on Angela Nikolau and Vanya Beerkus, a pair of daredevil Russians whose hobby-turned-profession is scaling various urban structures -- skyscrapers and bridges, mostly. Captured by GoPro cameras and drones, these exploits have made the couple famous. Or infamous, if you happen to work for a police department in one of the various countries whose laws Nicolau and Beerkus have broken.\n\nZimbalist's film finds the pair before they are a romantic item. Nikolau provides her backstory in voiceover: circus performer parents, an innate desire for excitement well past the norm. She and Beerkus initially hook up because he needs a partner for a sponsored video. Soon they are traversing the world together, scaling ever more daring heights to capture vertiginous images of young people caught up in the swoon of their own seeming invincibility. Beerkus, who appears to be from a wealthier family and has a cushy (and sea-level) job waiting for him should he want it, is impressed by Nikolau's tenacity, but soon grows worried for her safety.\n\nThere is something sweet, if rather old-fashioned, in this romance, two post-adolescents of boggling nerve who must negotiate the quotidian balance of a relationship -- particularly how their respective genders should govern their dynamic. They must also endure the pandemic and its dire effects on their business -- most of their sponsors had been travel industry clients -- before gearing up for what might be their biggest stunt yet. They plan to scale Malaysia's Merdeka 118, the second-tallest building in the world, all the way to the top of its spire.\n\nThus the film turns into something of a globe-trotting heist thriller, with intricate plans made and a suspenseful infiltration of a heavily guarded superstructure. Zimablist makes fascinating use of the access granted by his subjects' relentless self-documentation. Skywalkers deftly blends Zimablist's third-person camera work with the first-person material; the film is a beguiling stitching-together of perspectives. One does wonder, though, what may have been done just for the sake of those cameras, especially a sequence in which a doubting Nikolau stumbles upon a circus and tearfully contemplates her relationship and life pursuits. It's a poignant moment, but awfully convenient.\n\nWhat is perhaps most alarming about the way that Skywalkers treads the seam between truth and a murkier counterpart is how little one begins to care about that blurring. The hybrid construction makes for pleasing drama, all centered around those terrifyingly real climbing scenes. One grows to trust that the love passing between these two lunatics is real too, so ardently do they seem to dwell in a clench of existential quandary.\n\nNikolau is the true lead of the film; her tough defiance is in ever more intriguing conversation with the loose, delicate, self-avowedly feminine presentation of her work. I don't think you would find such a character in America; she seems wholly born of an eastern tradition that threads a stern conservatism through darkly poetic romanticism. Hers is the demanding passion of a Bolshoi dancer, a sort of graceful rigidity.\n\nShe makes quite a case for celebrity. As the film nears its end, that drive to viral fame emerges as perhaps the main raison d'etre for the whole project. Which puts something of a sour note on what has otherwise been a strange and enveloping experience. We hear Nikolau and Beerkus talk about their NFT business -- selling exclusive ownership of their photographs and video -- earlier in the film, but at the very end it's at glaring center stage. It's a disarming, entirely 2020s digital sales pitch, a confidence in a new economy of which people like Nikolau and Beerkus want to be at the center -- not for their climbing, but for their marketing.\n\nOne leaves Skywalkers with the hackles-raised prickle of ambivalence, feeling both a swell of affection for these lovebirds and a shiver at the cold modernity of their project. I'd imagine Skywalkers won't be the last film like this, as more and more young people seek the hustling, nontraditional revenue streams so relentlessly advertised to them by people like Nikolau and Beerkus. These two have a rare and dangerous skill -- and no doubt some Free Solo-esque brain wiring -- that elevates them above the influencer horde. They may also be too good at their bizarre jobs. It seems impossible that someone out there will see them in Skywalkers -- so free and monetized -- and won't think about trying it at home.", "source": {"uri": "vanityfair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vanity Fair"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conde_nast@vanityfair.com", "name": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Nikolau", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Angela Nikolau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlog", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vlog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickbait", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clickbait"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Zimbalist", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Zimbalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backstory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Backstory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoPro", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "GoPro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet celebrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Feature film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice-over", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Voice-over"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Circus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyscraper", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Skyscraper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stunt_performer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stunt performer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Romanticism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merdeka_118", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Merdeka 118"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/History", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6697cc59ed2aeec6b0d73963/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Skywalkers__A_Love_Story_n_00_21_37_22.jpg,Skywalkers__A_Love_Story_n_00_21_37_22.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9740549", "eventUri": "eng-9740549", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 417, "textEnd": 424}], "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

Born in Moscow to circus performer parents, she began amassing a large social media following by posting photos of herself on the top of buildings in acrobatic poses. Beerkus was too, for his more \"extreme\" photographs and films. They were both ardently solo acts. But when they started climbing and posing together, around the time when Zimbalist and his team began to follow them, their popularity grew. Prior to the Netflix debut, she had over 730,000 followers on Instagram, and he had over 236,000.\n\n\"We wanted to give it all to this project like we always do,\" Beerkus said through Maria Bukhonina, who co-directed the film and translated their interview. \"But it was unusual when the cameras started following us everywhere.\"\n\nOne place they weren't being followed, however, was to the top of the spires or cranes. The filmmakers had made an agreement with their families to only go to the base roof with their verit\u00e9 cameras so as not to distract. Those shots were all done by the subjects themselves.\n\n\"They rigged themselves with body cams and night vision and GoPros and selfie sticks. Ivan's a master drone operator. And Angela really started to understand what coverage was,\" Zimbalist said. \"They're credited as extreme cinematographers in the film.\"\n\nAnother essential lynchpin was Bukhonina, who was born in Russia, and became the main conduit to the subjects during the pandemic. She and their small camera crew were on the road with them for years.\n\n\"We felt they were different from other subjects in the extreme space,\" Bukhonina said. \"Many athletes like this and in the Red Bull space kind of deny that they have any fear of death. But Ivan and Angela talked about their fears.\"\n\nBoth filmmakers like to say, this isn't a film about the fear of falling from heights. It's a film about the fear of falling in love.\n\n\"It doesn't matter if you don't make it to the top of Merdeka,\" Zimbalist said. \"The real suspense of this movie is, is Angela going to ultimately choose to trust Ivan?\"\n\nIn recent years there's been several high-profile documentaries chronicling the lives and exploits of extreme athletes and daredevils, including Alex Honnold in \" Free Solo.\" Nikolau and Beerkus ignored the suggestion to watch that one and \"Man on Wire\" to get a sense of what a longform documentary was like. Their first foray was watching their own film.\n\n\"We saw how unusual our life is,\" Nikolau said. \"We always thought of ourselves as a normal, typical couple. Seeing that from the side kind of gives us a new perspective.\"\n\nBeerkus added: \"We liked all the choices that the directors of the film made because they were able to grasp the real essence of our relationship and what's going on in there.\"\n\nIn the days after this interview, Nikolau and Beerkus moved from Thailand to New York. They have big dreams to explore other art forms. She likes to paint.

Sign up to receive USA TODAY's movie and TV recommendations right in your inbox\n\nFor Nikolau, 31, a gymnast and the child of circus performers, the risky pursuit has as much to do with personal fortitude as it does performance art.\n\n\"I had a fear as well, but as you see in the documentary, my grandmother said. 'Every woman in our bloodline is strong,' so I was used to never showing weakness,\" she says.\n\nThe couple spoke in Russian with USA TODAY about their climbs, relationship and future plans with the interpretive help of Maria Bukhonina, co-director of \"Skywalkers\" along with Jeff Zimbalist.\n\nQuestion: As you head up Merdeka 118, you vow to each other that this will be the last climb. I sense, however, that it was not?\n\nBeerkus: We did talk about quitting after Merdeka. We haven't, but we're more reasonable. Angela does have panic attacks on unstable buildings, so we try not to climb on cranes anymore. We are more looking for unusual roofs to provide unusual photos.\n\nNikolau: Every time we land in a new city, we can't help but notice the roofs. We can talk about quitting, but you put a new roof in front of us and we get excited.\n\nYou have climbed some famous off-limits places, like Notre-Dame in Paris. Is there any structure that is calling your name, say, perhaps the pyramids in Egypt?\n\nNikolau: There's nothing that is built that we haven't done or is calling our names. I also joke, what we are planning is a secret, so follow us on Instagram. But in truth we are trespassing, so we can't share that.\n\nWas Merdeka the most challenging of your rooftop climbs?\n\nBeerkus: It was, mainly because of what we heard about the prisons in Malaysia, and how tough the laws are there if you are caught. You can go to prison for months for rooftopping, which isn't the case in other countries.\n\nAny concern that you're getting too famous to do this, since you rely on anonymity to sneak into buildings?\n\nNikolau: People in the know already know who we are. When we went to the (church) Sagrada Familia in Barcelona just as tourists recently, they immediately waved us off. It happens a lot in Hong Kong as well, because security in these marquee buildings is huge.\n\nOne could argue life is inherently dangerous, but how do you deal with the fear of death?\n\nNikolau: When I was 18, I had to bury my cousin who was the same age, he died of an embolism. And I thought, you can die at any moment, so I want to live my life to the fullest. What's better, live long and smolder like a coal, or burn bright like a fire? I want to burn bright.\n\nBeerkus: You can live 100 years but if your life is boring, it's not the same. We want to live these bright moments to the fullest. We consider ourselves artists, we want to show others what it's like to pursue your passions.Would you stop if you had a child?\n\nBeerkus: (laughs) Maybe you have to ask the woman over there who would be the mother.\n\nNikolau: You know I come from a crazy circus family. So you can draw your own conclusions.\n\nWhat is your message to kids who want to emulate what you do?\n\nNikolau: Don't do it, it's dangerous. But I'd say the same about gymnastics or skiing or skydiving, they all have risks. My message is, decide what you want to do and stick to your guns.\n\nBeerkus: This is why at the beginning of our documentary, it says don't do this at home.\n\nThe documentary is billed as a love story. How is your relationship now, after the tense times shown in the movie?\n\nBeerkus: Our relationship was strong but after Merdeka, it was stronger. We did see how unusual a couple we are, we are maybe one in a billion who found each other. Whatever secrets we had, we told them to each other the night before we climbed. That really solidified our relationship so much more.\n\nNikolau: We stopped thinking of ourselves as normal. We're a bit rare, and we have a new appreciation for ourselves.\n\nBeerkus: But we're also just a normal couple with everyday quarrels, too. The film reminded us that we have to choose each other every day. It's not about the roofs and the big emotions, it's about how you treat each other every day.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merdeka_118", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Merdeka 118"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Nikolau", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Angela Nikolau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooftopping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rooftopping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merdeka", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Merdeka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_art", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Performance art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Circus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kuala Lumpur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kuala Lumpur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pyramid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Panic attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crane_(machine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crane (machine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagrada_Fam\u00edlia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sagrada Fam\u00edlia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachuting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parachuting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skiing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Skiing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/Guides_and_Schools", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/Guides and Schools", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/Indoor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/Indoor", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/By_Region", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/By Region", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/Aid_Climbing", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/Aid Climbing", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/24/USAT/74196513007-skyw-3.jpg?auto=webp&crop=2399,1349,x80,y0&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9740549", "eventUri": "eng-9740549", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

He'd dabbled in the activity, on a smaller scale in his youth, and was fascinated to learn that it had become a global phenomenon on social media.\n\nOne rooftopper who stuck out was Angela Nikolau, notable for being one of the few women operating in the space. She introduced him to Ivan Beerkus, a fellow rooftopper who she'd begun doing joint posts with. Together, they were fascinating and good on camera.\n\n\"We didn't know what the finish line was,\" Zimbalist said in a recent interview with The Associated Press. \"We really took a leap of faith on this.\"\n\nBut in the making of \" Skywalkers: A Love Story,\" now streaming on Netflix, Zimbalist quickly realized that there was something bigger happening with his subjects: They were falling in love.\n\nThis, he knew, was the story. The vertigo-inducing spectacle was the backdrop.\n\nAnd like illegally climbing an under-construction skyscraper, nothing was going to be simple or straightforward about the mission of putting it all together. In total, the small team spent six years making the film, traveling to six countries with Nikolau and Beerkus to capture their attempts to pose on top of the likes of the 1,957-foot (596.6-meter) Goldin Finance 117, in Tianjin, China, and the 2,227-foot (679-meter) Merdeka 118 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\n\nThe film begins in a tense moment in Merdeka: They're trying to get to the top undetected. They're scared. And their relationship is on the line.\n\nBehind the scenes was the inherent danger of it all: The trespassing aspect takes on a different kind of gravity in strict countries like Malaysia. Add in the difficulties of continuing production through COVID and Russia's war on Ukraine, the logistics of filming without distracting, and the constant conversation about trust -- not only between filmmaker and subjects but between the subjects themselves.\n\n\"They'd only been doing short form,\" Zimbalist said. \"The idea that we wanted access to all of the stuff in between their perfect, polished, finished poses was a new concept to them.\"\n\nNikolau was already relatively famous by the time Zimbalist got in touch.

Illegally climbing the world's tallest buildings together", "body": "Editor's Note: To keep you informed,Cultural queueis an ongoing series of recommendations for current books to read, movies to watch, and podcasts and music to listen to.\n\nWhat was your most exciting first date? In 2016, two young Russians known for their extreme rooftop adventures where they attempt to illegally scale dizzying monuments like the Sagrada Familia and the Eiffel Tower skipped the happy hour cocktail and instead climbed China's tallest unfinished skyscraper, the 600-meter-high Goldin Finance 117.\n\nAt the time, Ivan Beerkus and Angela Nikolau didn't know they would eventually find each other. Beerkus had invited Nikolau, a rare female member of the rooftopping community (she scaled the famous glass wall before breaking it), to join him on the climb to produce sponsored social media posts. But it was the beginning of a long romantic and creative partnership, one that would see them travel thousands of miles and thousands of feet in the air together.\n\nEight years later, the documentary film The Skywalkers: A Love Story takes an intimate look at their unusual romance through hundreds of hours of footage that, of course, includes breathtaking POV shots from impossible heights and occasional encounters with law enforcement.\n\nLike any couple, Beerkus and Nikolau have their ups and downs, and when they do argue, the stakes are a little higher than most (in one scene, Beerkus bravely accuses his girlfriend of being too negative as she prepares to pull off a precarious acrobatic pose literally above the clouds). Through the couple's unusual lifestyles, Skywalker becomes a meditation on trust and commitment, though their stunts will also make your palms sweat, if that's your thing.\n\nDirected by Jeff Zimbalist, a filmmaker with some rooftop experience himself, and co-directed by Maria Bukhonina, Skywalkers debuted at the Sundance Film Festival in January and is now streaming on Netflix. The film follows the couple, who use Nikolaus's background as a skilled gymnast to create acrobatic stunts on narrow ledges, poles, and scaffolding, as they take on increasingly difficult challenges and navigate their own budding relationship.\n\n\"It's not just the fear of falling from a great height, but the fear of falling in love,\" Zimbalist said in a video call with CNN. \"Angela initially told me that they were competitors and rivals. But you could feel beneath the surface that there was a bubbling flirtation between them.\n\nAs the documentary progresses, the two men prepare for their most challenging climb yet: Kuala Lumpur's Merdeka 118, the world's second-tallest building. The gleaming 670-metre-high tower, which opened earlier this year, is topped by a 160-metre-high spire whose summit is accessible only by a narrow interior ladder.\n\nIn 2022, when Beerkus and Nikolau hatched their plans, the giant skyscraper had reached its peak but was still under construction. Escaping security and reaching its peak safely required an intense and elaborate plan that they hatched while working out their relationship issues. (At the time of their climb, the towers' owner said police were investigating the couple for trespassing, though Malaysian authorities did not respond to CNN for comment on whether any further legal action had been taken.)\n\nRooftopping is a controversial pastime, both because of the danger it poses and because of its participants' reliance on illegal trespassing. The urban sport has become one of the most extreme ways to get likes on social media, and several gruesome deaths have followed.\n\nFor Skywalker, the film crew followed Beerkus and Nikolau to document their stunts, but only to a point. Zimbalist emphasized his crew's safety measures, which were designed to ensure the team didn't put themselves in danger or present any distractions to the couple.\n\nWe talked a lot with Ivan and Angela, saying, 'Please don't do anything crazier than you normally do,'\" Zimbalist said. Because for us, this is not a film about success or failure at Merdeka or any other climb. The real suspense here is the decision to trust each other.\n\nFor the couple, rooftopping isn't just about the thrill. Nikolau, the daughter of circus performers, explains in the film that pushing her limits has been instilled in her since childhood, and she's always striving to improve. For Beerkus, who climbed buildings alone in Moscow for years, rooftopping offers a sense of mental clarity.\n\n\"The higher I climbed, the easier it was to breathe,\" he says on camera, recalling his early climbs. \"This extreme life, this expanded state of mind, it's essential for me.\"\n\nZimbalist acknowledges the dangers of rooftopping and says his film is not about defending what they do against critics.\n\nInstead, he hopes that Skywalker, in addition to its message about love and trust, offers a rare glimpse into the hard work and planning behind rooftoppers' polished social media posts.\n\nAs with any dangerous activity, social media tends to obscure the difficulty, he said. Telling the story of a stunt helps provide context and show how difficult and dangerous some of these things are.\n\nBelieve it or not, Nikolau claims she has a fear of heights, a problem she has had to deal with on several occasions to continue practicing her profession.\n\nThe fear never really went away; I just learned to deal with it better and better, she explains in an excerpt.\n\nWhile the creators of Skywalker would probably prefer that you not climb the nearest skyscraper, their film encourages us to dare and say yes to the thing that scares us the most.\n\nIf you prefer to watch daring feats on rocky cliffs rather than skyscrapers, this Oscar-winning documentary from filmmaker Chai Vasarhelyi and photographer-climber Jimmy Chin follows climber Alex Honnold as he prepares to scale Yosemite. very 3,000-foot-high vertical rock formation, El Capitan, without ropes or harnesses.\n\nREAD: Extreme like a girl (2021)\n\nPhotographer Carolina Amell compiles images and personal stories of women in extreme sports, including wingsuit pilots, parkour athletes and slackliners, who not only push their limits but also break barriers in male-dominated fields.\n\nLISTEN: What Mom Never Told You: Women Who Climb Mountains (2022)\n\nThis podcast episode looks at the lesser-known stories of female climbers, from Flicit Carrel, the first woman to attempt the Matterhorn, to Miriam OBrien, who coined the term \"male-free climbing\" in the early 20th century and completed some of the world's most difficult climbs.\n\nWATCH: People on the move (2012)\n\nThis documentary about parkour at the height of its popularity follows five people who take up the sport for different reasons. It was shot in slow motion to capture all the nuances and spectacle of their movements.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

And in case any viewers were brave enough to think they could, it adds: \"Do not attempt to imitate.\"\n\nWell-known for taking their daredevil ways around the world, Angela Nikolau and Ivan Beerkus took on one of their highest, and highest-stakes, challenges back in 2022.\n\nEasily the most prominent rooftopping couple, the Moscow pair's love for taking to the top of some of the world's tallest buildings and for one another is documented in Skywalkers: A Love Story.\n\nLanding on Netflix today (July 19), the documentary sees Nikolau and Beerkus work towards and attempt to reach the top of Malaysia's Merdeka 118 super-skyscraper.\n\nBut before they could try and get that Instagram-perfect shot from the top of its 160-metre spire, the skywalkers spent 30 hours inside the 2,200-foot tall building.\n\nIn the days before the attempt, the doc shows how meticulously the pair planned the ascent - from pages of maps and blueprints to Beerkus flying his drone up to get a clear view of the top of the skyscraper.\n\nPlus, Beerkus very importantly planned for them to take to Merdeka on the night of the 2022 World Cup final as he figured the security guards would be distracted by the soccer match.\n\nSo, as the game played out, the couple put on their disguise, entered at 1am and began to make their way up. By the time the penalties had begun, they had made it a good way up and decided to take a break to rest until sunrise.\n\nBut then, as they awoke just after 5am, they soon ran into trouble.\n\nNikolau and Beerkus realized the construction workers were on the same floor as them, 113.\n\nSo close to the top, they ended up hiding themselves behind building materials.\n\nViewers can see all this play out as the crew had them hooked up with mics and GoPros.\n\n\"I don't know how we get out of here,\" Beerkus says. \"Our chances are low with this heat and zero water left.\"\n\nWhile Nikolau 'keeps thinking of those prisons' they could end up in if they're caught, her partner is quietly coughing from the dust.\n\nThe pair end up suffering from 'pounding headaches, rising fevers' and struggling to breathe as Beerkus manages to make a break for some water.\n\nTrapped as a second load of construction workers arrive for a night shift, the pair ended up in their 'cave' for 23 hours before they escaped.\n\nAnd when UNILAD spoke to co-director Maria Bukhonina, she said it was just as anxious to see play out as it is to watch in the doc itself.\n\nShe explained: \"We knew they got stuck. We knew they didn't know what to do. We knew they had to decide whether they're going to stay or leave and maybe not have a second chance.\n\n\"So, it was a pretty high, high stakes, very high intensity situation for 30 hours sitting outside waiting for them.\"\n\nBukhonina added that it was 'nerve wracking' for them as they didn't know if they'd end up getting harmed or arrested and jailed for months.\n\nBut, and spoiler alert, the pair managed to make it to floor 188 where they were greeted by warning posters of other rooftoppers who had been caught and imprisoned.\n\nNot backing down at that point, Nikolau and Beerkus continue their ascent and an incredible record climb is finally achieved with 30 hours in Merdeka racked up.", "source": {"uri": "unilad.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UNILAD"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Nikolau", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angela Nikolau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merdeka_118", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Merdeka 118"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooftopping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rooftopping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stunt_performer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stunt performer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Romanticism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blueprint", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blueprint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merdeka", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Merdeka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_material", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Building material"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction_worker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Construction worker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Security guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyscraper", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Skyscraper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoPro", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GoPro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Headache"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prison"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://images.ladbible.com/resize?type=webp&quality=70&width=1200&fit=contain&gravity=auto&url=https://images.ladbiblegroup.com/v3/assets/blt949ea8e16e463049/blt0277a8ade5734600/669a7f000b59dba04c5396dc/skywalkers-30-hours-building-netflix.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9740549", "eventUri": "eng-9740549", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 745, "textEnd": 752}], "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

It follows the couple, who utilize Nikolau's background as a trained gymnast to create acrobatic stunts on narrow ledges, poles and scaffolding, as they take on increasingly difficult challenges and navigate their own budding relationship.\n\n\"It's not just about the fear of falling from heights, but more about the fear of falling in love,\" Zimbalist said in a video call with CNN. \"Angela first told me that they were... competitors and rivals. But you could sense under the surface that there was this bubbling flirtation there.\"\n\nAs the documentary progresses, the pair plot out their most difficult climb yet: Kuala Lumpur's Merdeka 118, the world's second-tallest building. The gleaming 2,227-foot-tall tower, which opened earlier this year, is crowned with a 527-foot-tall spire whose apex is only accessible via a narrow internal ladder.\n\nIn 2022, when Beerkus and Nikolau made their plans, the \"supertall\" skyscraper had topped out but was still under construction. Evading security and reaching its apogee safely required an intense and elaborate scheme -- one conjured while they worked through relationship issues. (At the time of their climb, the tower's owner said police were investigating the pair for trespassing, although Malaysian authorities did not respond to CNN about whether further legal action was taken.)\n\nRooftopping is a contentious pastime -- both for the danger it poses and participants' reliance on illegal trespassing. With the urban \"sport\" emerging as one more of the more extreme ways to get likes on social media, several harrowing deaths have followed.\n\nFor \"Skywalkers\" the film crew followed Beerkus and Nikolau to document their stunts, but only to a point. Zimbalist emphasized his team's safety measures, which were designed to ensure the crew neither endangered themselves nor presented any distractions for the couple.\n\n\"We talked a lot with Ivan and Angela, saying, 'Please, don't go do anything additionally crazy beyond what you would usually do,'\" Zimbalist said. \"Because to us, this isn't a movie about whether or not you succeed at Merdeka or any other climb... the genuine suspense here is if you choose to trust each other.\"\n\nFor the couple, rooftopping isn't just about thrill-seeking. Nikolau, the daughter of circus performers, says in the film that pushing herself to her limits was engrained from childhood and that she is always striving to better herself. For Beerkus, who scaled buildings alone in Moscow for years, rooftopping offers a sense of mental clarity.\n\n\"The higher I went, the easier it was to breathe,\" he says to camera, recalling his earliest climbs. \"This extreme life, this expanded state of mind, it's essential for me.\"\n\nZimbalist recognizes the dangers of rooftopping and says his film is not about \"defending what they do against critics.\"\n\nInstead, he hope that \"Skywalkers,\" in addition to its message on love and trust, provides a rare look at the hard work and planning behind the rooftoppers' \"polished\" social media posts.\n\n\"With any activity that's dangerous, social media tends to disguise the difficulty,\" he said. \"Telling the story behind a stunt helps to give context and just how challenging and how dangerous some of these things are.\"\n\nBelieve it or not, Nikolau maintains that she is afraid of heights, something she has had to confront repeatedly to keep up with her chosen line of work.\n\n\"The fear never really went away; I just got better and better at facing it,\" she explains in one clip.\n\nSo while the makers of \"Skywalkers\" would probably rather you don't climb your nearest skyscraper, their film encourages us to dare -- and say \"yes\" to the thing that scares us the most.\n\nIf you prefer watching daring feats on rock cliffs instead of skyscrapers, this Academy Award-winning documentary by filmmaker Chai Vasarhelyi and photographer-mountaineer Jimmy Chin follows climber Alex Honnold as he prepares to summit Yosemite's very vertical 3,000-foot-tall rock formation, El Capitan, without a rope or a harness.\n\nREAD: \"Extreme Like a Girl\" (2021)\n\nPhotographer Carolina Amell compiles images and personal accounts of women in extreme sports, including wingsuit pilots, parkour athletes and slackliners, who are not only pushing themselves to their limits but breaking barriers in male-dominated arenas.\n\nLISTEN: \"Stuff Mom Never Told You: Women Climbing Mountains\" (2022)\n\nThis podcast episode delves into the lesser-known history of women mountaineers, from F\u00e9licit\u00e9 Carrel, the first woman to attempt to summit Mount Matterhorn, to Miriam O'Brien, who coined the term \"manless climbing\" in the early 20th century and achieved some of the world's most difficult climbs.\n\nWATCH: \"People in Motion\" (2012)\n\nThis documentary on parkour at the height of its popularity follows five people who practice the sport for different reasons. It was shot in true slow motion to capture all the nuances and spectacle of their movements.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

The male-dominated pursuit was particularly popular in Russia, and it now had its first legitimate female roof-topper.\n\nNikolau wasn\u2019t interested in competing with her male peers or earning their acceptance, however. She began incorporating costumes and choreography into a medium that had until now been dictated simply by who was willing to climb the highest \u2013 with a terrifying number paying the ultimate price.\n\n\u201cAngela was doing something totally different, she was generating art,\u201d says Zimbalist. \u201cHer influences were Basquiat and Warhol. I reached out to her, and she told me how her parents raised her in a travelling circus, which immediately intrigued me. Then she introduced me to Ivan, who at the time was the biggest roof-topper in Russia.\u201d\n\nIt seemed that Zimbalist had found his story.\n\n\u201cAngela and Ivan talked about having a rivalry, but you could sense that underneath it, at the very least there was a bubbling flirtation, if not an entire courtship that they weren\u2019t willing to go public with yet. And that is where the seed got planted of telling a love story on top of the world. Maybe we could use extreme climbing as a metaphor for romantic trust.\u201d\n\nBeyond the obvious challenges of filming a duo intent on repeatedly trespassing to put themselves in perpetual danger, the production faced a number of other obstacles, from the coronavirus pandemic to the outbreak of war between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nRussian-American Maria Bukhonina was brought on as co-director and producer, to ensure that despite the travel restrictions, the crew could keep following Angela and Ivan, and their enthralling odyssey could be documented.\n\n\u201cThey were very focused on the final product, the polished pose,\u201d Zimbalist says about the collaboration between his crew and the two young artists. As their popularity increased online, they landed sponsorship deals to pay for their travels, turning their eye-catching accomplishments into NFTs.\n\n\u201cI told them, everything you leave on the cutting room floor, that is the stuff we need. We cannot relate to what you do as this nomadic circus of trespassers \u2026 but if you show us that you\u2019re stumbling upon the same kinds of issues that all of us have had in our own romantic relationships, or better yet, that this stuff scares you, you\u2019ll be able to reach more people.\n\n\u201cWe joked that they taught us how to rooftop and we taught them how to do long-form storytelling \u2013 they had never seen a documentary feature film before! \u2013 and they got really good at it.\u201d\n\nOnce the couple had been convinced to open up in front of the camera, Skywalkers took on a whole different dimension. The film was no longer simply an exhilarating documentary about a pair of reckless youngsters eager to express themselves, but \u2013 as Zimbalist had hoped \u2013 a love story.\n\nAs anyone who has travelled with their significant other will know, high-stress situations in unfamiliar locations can often lead to disagreements and heated altercations. All very well at an unfamiliar railway station, but something altogether more terrifying when perched 600 metres above the ground.\n\nFor Nikolau and Beerkus, this tension is an integral part of their dynamic, claims their director. \u201cThey don\u2019t know how shaky, slippery, windy these climbs are going to be. They\u2019re negotiating their fear every step of the way and oftentimes that takes the form of high-stakes, high-tension interaction.\n\n\u201cTo them that is nothing new, it\u2019s part of what they do when figuring this out, and in some ways the loudest voice wins, in other ways logic wins.\u201d\n\nFor viewers, this means being held captive during a petty squabble with your heart in your throat, as the couple berate one another from an ice-covered radio mast, quivering violently in the clouds.\n\nFrom its opening moments, Skywalkers: A Love Story hijacks its audience and catapults them on a nerve-shredding roller-coaster ride that will have vertigo sufferers clutching their sofa cushions in abject terror.\n\nBut in the end, the film\u2019s greatest triumph is that you will find yourselves rooting for Nikolau and Beerkus. Not to see them successfully defy gravity once more or evade capture by the circling authorities \u2013 but for them to succeed as a couple, against insurmountable odds.\n\n\u201cAngela uses this metaphor of trapeze artists,\u201d recalls Zimbalist. \u201cHow the flier leads you further into the sky towards your dreams, while the catcher is for safety and brings you down to earth. That dynamic is always at play with them.\n\n\u201cThat dynamic was also in play between us and them. We were always the catcher, they were always the flier. I said to them constantly, \u201cWe\u2019re not making a film about the fear of falling from heights, we\u2019re making a film about the fear of falling in love\u201d.\n\nUltimately, the legality of their endeavours becomes a moot point, eclipsed by the pair\u2019s audacious expression of courage, commitment and trust in one another.\n\nSkywalkers: A Love Story will start streaming on Netflix on July 19.\n\nWant more articles like this?

But add in going viral on Instagram, getting arrested and the danger of death and you've got Angela Nikolau and Ivan Beerkus.\n\nThe Moscow daredevils have made a career out of standing on the top of some of the world's tallest buildings - despite the climbs technically being illegal.\n\nAnd their love for 'rooftopping', as well as for each other, is explored in the new Netflix documentary, Skywalkers: A Love Story.\n\nBefore directors Jeff Zimbalist and Maria Bukhonina came on board, the couple had also filmed 60 hours of raw material - including their arrest while making their nervy descent from the Notre Dame cathedral in Paris.\n\nSo, with both the illegality and very real risk of death that comes with scaling 2,200 foot tall buildings, the pair had to make an 'agreement' with the directors.\n\nZimbalist explained to LADbible that he and his co-director are 'both caretakers by nature' which made things tricky for them 'ethically'.\n\nHe added: \"The last thing that we would ever feel comfortable with is if something happened to them while on our watch, or because of us.\"\n\nThe documentary sees Nikolau and Beerkus work towards and face Malaysia's Merdeka 118 super-skyscraper - including its 160-metre spire.\n\nTowards the end of the film, the pair make their way up the whopping 118-storey building.\n\nAnd while they spent a long 36 hours stuck on one floor hiding from construction workers, they also walk past warning posters with the faces of other rooftoppers who have already tried and failed to get up the tower.\n\nTherefore, not only does the pair's aim to get that clip of them on top of the building come with the danger of, well, falling off but the risk of ending up in a Malaysian prison.\n\n\"And so we did need to make an agreement with them right up front that they wouldn't do anything that they wouldn't do otherwise, just because our cameras were there or because they thought it would be good for the film,\" Zimbalist continued.\n\n\"Obviously, you know that they can say that, but then sometimes subconsciously, they want to do it anyway.

This is a love story and not an extreme sports story, and so don't do that right?'\"\n\nThat love story very much is at the centre of the documentary though, with Nikolau often using a metaphor about 'the flyer and the catcher and the trapeze' which the pair flip between in their relationship.\n\nBut, while he says they trusted the pair's instincts, Zimbalist claims that metaphor often came into play with their dynamics too.\n\nHe added: \"We often felt that actually we were the catcher and they would go up to the sky, and we'd pull them down a little bit and say, 'Don't be so reckless.

There is quite a bit of that in this engaging, bewildering, occasionally aimless Netflix documentary. And the best (worst?) is saved for last. The final stunt is best viewed sitting down with a cool liquid nearby to help sooth queasiness.\n\nJeff Zimbalist's film, which Netflix picked up at Sundance, goes among the deranged world of rooftopping, a pastime involving the free ascent of tall structures, often without the permission of the owners. We are in the company of the Russian daredevils Vanya Beerkus and Angela Nikolau, initially rivals who end up both romantic and professional partners. They travel to Paris and Bangkok as they plot \"one last job\" to crown their careers. The Merdeka 118 in Kuala Lumpur, not quite completed at time of filming, offers 828m of hitherto unscaled skyscraper ending with a lonely spire poking into the ionosphere. Beerkus and Nikolau plan to close with the sort of acrobatic lift that would seem unwise on even a stepladder.\n\nThere are reminders of James Marsh's great 2008 doc Man on Wire - following Philippe Petit's similarly illegal journey between the World Trade Center towers - in the scenes leading up to the assault on the Merdeka. It is a similarly crafty operation. The pair made their ascent on the night of the 2022 World Cup final, so ensuring that security staff were diverted. Unlike Marsh, Zimbalist, himself from the rooftopper community, had access to GoPro and drone footage from the ascending pair. The only downside is that the images sometimes seem too implausibly spectacular to believe.\n\nEfforts to tease out the relationship between Beerkus and Nikolau are less successful, sometimes taking on the quality of filler. Inevitably, Beerkus's family want him to get a nice safe job as a sales rep.

Then we get some backstory on the couple before they met and the literal and romantic ups and downs of their relationship.\n\nNikolau grew up in a circus family. She loved watching her aerialist parents perform together on a flying trapeze. But her father left for another woman and her mother never recovered. Nikolau was raised by her grandmother and promised herself she would never depend on anyone again. But she struggled to decide on a direction for her life until she began to see the rooftoppers on Instagram. They were all men. She knew what she was made for. \"Seeing their passion, their freedom, was magical. They take crazy risks to feel their potential.... I knew I had found my performance. This is my trapeze.\"\n\nShe wanted to outdo the men by climbing higher and more dangerous structures and she wanted to perform for her social media audience by wearing striking costumes (high heels!) and in gymnastic poses requiring supreme balance and flexibility. Now might be a good time to point out that Nikolau is exceptionally pretty.\n\nBeerkus loved the exhilaration of the climb. He tells us the higher he climbed, the more he could breathe. He had the largest number of Instagram followers in Russia. And it was on Instagram where he first saw Nikolau. He was captivated by her posts and invited her to accompany him on a sponsored trip to China to climb the highest construction site in the world. They first met en route. And as soon as the pictures are online, Nikolau gets hundreds of thousands of new followers and some sponsorship offers.

Fully completed only last year, it's the tallest building in Southeast Asia.\n\nScaling the whole thing is something few would dream of attempting, but that's the illegal challenge a Russian couple, Angela Nikolau and Ivan Beerkus, set themselves in 2022, when the building was at its full height, but still internally under construction.\n\nThe Netflix documentary Skywalkers: A Love Story retells the saga of this duo's \"rooftopping\" stunts up to that point, and climaxes with the night they gave it a shot. Both carry their own GoPro cameras, so a lot of the footage we get - of this particular climb, and all their others - is self-filmed.\n\nThis is the really hairy stuff, of them inching up cranes in windy conditions, or leaning off sky-high platforms with selfie sticks. Supplementing the footage is more high-def photography by the experienced filmmaking team led by director Jeff Zimbalist. It makes for a giddy aesthetic experience, with the busy carpet of various cities spinning far below - all more than enough to make Jimmy Stewart in Vertigo turn green and need a lie-down.\n\nIf Skywalkers allied its visuals to a framing narrative that wasn't basic as hell, we'd be getting somewhere. It convinces you on some fundamental level that these two are made for each other, but only because their obsessions are the same, and have a lot to do with social media cachet, rather than the summitting of these structures as a goal in itself. If they haven't filmed themselves punching the air up there - or in Angela's case, performing circus routines - did it really happen?\n\nWithout meaning to, Skywalkers captures a dispiriting aspect of the here and now, in which every feat must be mediated to sustain sponsorship deals, and indeed, whole livelihoods. Fleeting pauses to half question the sanity of this are generally swept aside by euphoric celebrations.\n\nThis pair may have picked a singularly dangerous path to fame, but Zimbalist's way of punching up their successes (and slumps) makes rooftopping feel exactly like any other extreme sport.\n\nIf adrenaline, Instagram likes, and an intense concern for each other's safety have kept this relationship alive, don't expect the implications of all that to be grasped in much depth. On their own, these two might simply come across as narcissists with a death wish, so the film ruthlessly weds itself to the USP of them being in love - like a slick Cupid locking down a Netflix deal.\n\nOn Netflix from July 19", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tim_robey@aol.co.uk", "name": "Tim Robey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Nikolau", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Angela Nikolau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merdeka_118", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Merdeka 118"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyscraper", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Skyscraper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southeast Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kuala Lumpur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kuala Lumpur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooftopping", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rooftopping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie_stick", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Selfie stick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Stewart", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James Stewart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoPro", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "GoPro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertigo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vertigo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_story", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Frame story"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinning_(textiles)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spinning (textiles)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Filmmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crane_(machine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crane (machine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aesthetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Photography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenaline", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adrenaline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cupid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extreme sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Circus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Quotations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Quotations", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Production_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Production Services", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Stunts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Stunts", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/gF8lEvF_jsJrw7QYUxHygg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NTA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_the_telegraph_624/0e83760d6d841bf347fa62877f687c88", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9740549", "eventUri": "eng-9740549", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 2798, "textEnd": 2805}], "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

The stunning image that we see in the movie was later projected as an NFT in Times Square, New York City.\n\nAfter their climb in December 2022, the couple faced accusations that it was all faked and they didn't really scale the Merdeka 118. In response, both Angela and Ivan shared photos and footage taken during the climb on their Instagram accounts.\n\nIt wasn't without controversy though. Like with so many of the couples' climbs, their Merdeka 118 climb was considered trespassing and, in January 2023, it was reported that they were under investigation by the Malaysian police for trespassing. (No further updates have been made on the investigation since then.)\n\nFollowing a thread that she posted on Twitter about how they achieved the climb, Angela also apologised when the stunt was criticised online for breaking the law, as well as Angela using a hijab to avoid being detected by the building's security team.\n\n\"I apologise if I offended the feelings of Malaysian people. That was never my intent. I wish nothing but piece [sic] and art, and in no way am I interested in any kind of conflict or hatred,\" she responded.\n\nSince their Merdeka 118 climb, Angela and Ivan have been living in Bangkok and climbing various buildings in the city. As we see in Skywalkers, they sell imagery they capture as NFTs, while Angela has also become an artist and Ivan has become a musician.\n\nThey're planning to head to New York City soon, but they won't tell anybody what their upcoming climbs might be. \"There's a big chance people will recognise us,\" Ivan told Vanity Fair in July 2024.\n\n\"We are already banned from some sites in Europe because we seem to be in some database - they see us coming before we even get close. So there's a big chance the film will impact that even further... That just means we'll have to prepare better.\"\n\nIn a separate interview with The Guardian, Angela confirmed that even with their potential increased publicity and their new pursuits, they have no plans to stop their daredevil climbs any time soon.\n\n\"We are not anticipating quitting any time soon,\" she said. \"Maybe when we are 75.\"", "source": {"uri": "digitalspy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Digital Spy"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merdeka_118", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Merdeka 118"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Story_(Taylor_Swift_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Love Story (Taylor Swift song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spire", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Nikolau", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Angela Nikolau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Non-fungible token"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Malaysia_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royal Malaysia Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merdeka", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Merdeka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_Square", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Times Square"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hijab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanity_Fair_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vanity Fair (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangkok", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangkok"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangkok"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/skywalkers-a-love-story-ivan-beerkus-angela-nikolau-6697c351728fb.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.890xh;0,0.110xh&resize=640:*", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9740549", "eventUri": "eng-9740549", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

The pair circles each other until they meet up for a brand collab. Ah, young online love.\n\nAngela is fiercely independent, a product of her upbringing (both her parents were circus performers), and she makes a promise to herself to always be self-reliant, no matter what. Vanya gives her someone to lean on, and he wants to take care of her, and the two fall madly in love, documenting their crazy courtship from the tops of buildings the world over. But their initial whirlwind love affair eventually gives way to arguments and bickering, which is even worse when it's happening 2,000 feet above the ground.\n\nAfter the COVID-19 pandemic wipes out the pair's revenue streams and pushes them into the world of NFTs -- a sign of the times that already feels dated -- Angela and Vanya attempt to save their relationship by embarking on the climb of all climbs, scaling the world's second tallest skyscraper at the time of filming, Kuala Lumpur's Merdeka 118.\n\nThat's 118 as in 118 floors, plus a 500-foot spire on top, and the couple plans to not only break in and get to the top of the structure, which is staged like an \"Ocean's 11\" job and timed against the backdrop of the World Cup final, but they train to do a move straight out of \"Dirty Dancing\" once they reach the top and shoot it with a drone hovering nearby. And you thought your Instagram of your sandwich was cool.\n\n\"Skywalkers\" is co-directed by Jeff Zimbalist and Maria Bukhonina, and some of the scenarios -- an injury just three weeks before the final climb, Angela's impeccably timed visit to the circus in her most dire moment -- feel as staged, or at least as coerced, as a sponsored social media post.\n\nBut \"Skywalkers\" is so beautifully filmed and its content is so dizzying that it almost doesn't matter. This is a highly watchable and easily digestible document of two risk takers putting it all on the line, again and again.

It's a mixture of free climbing and urban exploration with a dash of parkour. The Russian climber Angela Nikolau, one of the subjects of the new Netflix documentary Skywalkers: A Love Story, gained notoriety for introducing gymnastics and a softer, feminine angle to a sport that tends to valorize fitness, dominance, and adrenaline. As the film tells it, her poses -- sometimes casual, sometimes intense, always impressive -- caught the eye of fellow climber Ivan Beerkus, and the two soon began collaborating. The fact that they're both strikingly good-looking might have had something to do with it, too. A romantic relationship soon ensued.\n\nAs a film, Skywalkers: A Love Story can be both muddled and predictable. It begins in typical streaming-doc fashion, in medias res, with Angela and Ivan breathlessly hiding from some workers as they attempt to scale Kuala Lumpur's Merdeka 118 tower in 2022, while everybody down at street level is distracted by the World Cup final between France and Argentina. Then the movie flashes back to tell their overall story -- from Angela's childhood in a circus family, to their initial collaboration, to their attempts to scale greater and greater heights, always with an eye on their follower counts. Along the way, we get standard-issue moments of personal challenge. The Russian invasion of Ukraine is a disruption. COVID is a disruption. A breakup is a distraction. Their story seems genuine, but the filmmaking can make it all feel premeditated, in part because directors Jeff Zimbalist and Maria Bukhonina are determined to hit every plot turn at the most obvious points. Even that initial moment of tension atop the Merdeka tower, the second-tallest building in the world, has a weirdly fabricated quality: There's a big bright light on Ivan's face as he frantically hides from the workers, trying not to cough. Really? A huge bright light, shining there for all the world to see?\n\nBut maybe the light was there. These are people who record their every move and whose social currency is built on their ability to present compelling footage to their many thousands of followers. They live in a world where there's always a camera or a phone conveniently placed nearby to capture the moment, even (maybe especially) during supposedly intimate, vulnerable ones. As a result, Skywalkers hovers between a sense of constant performance and disarming immediacy -- the latter generally during the many vertigo-inducing drone shots of Ivan and Angela's hair-raising accomplishments. The filmmakers cut freely and rapidly among the duo's poses, their stumbles, their fears, their tightrope walks across precarious beams in the sky. The camera rarely settles.\n\nThat rooftopping became so popular in the past decade among young men and women in the former Soviet Union probably says something about a generation with nothing left to lose trying to assert their personality and power over rapidly changing and oppressive urban landscapes. Obviously, there are rooftoppers that hail from all over the planet, so perhaps young generations with nothing left to lose are a universal phenomenon nowadays. But it also just plain looks amazing when someone makes it to the top of an impossibly tall building and hangs over the edge. As someone who gets queasy simply looking at a roof gutter, I find these pictures and videos both nerve-racking and wonderful.\n\nAnd so, for all its problems, Skywalkers is often very watchable. It can be hard for the viewer to take in more than a mere movement -- a shame, because one imagines the heart-stopping tension that could be evoked if the movie had the patience to take in the full measure of what these people are doing. Then again, a lot of this material is probably footage that's already been pre-edited for rapid-fire internet consumption. There's a story there, one that perhaps speaks to the way we live now. And that's the question that underlies much of what's onscreen in this perplexing, entertaining, frustrating picture. You can sense the more thoughtful film lurking beneath all this footage, one that more fully explores the nexus of raw physical achievement and premeditated celebrity at which these people live.", "source": {"uri": "vulture.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vulture"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bilge_ebiri@vulture.com", "name": "Bilge Ebiri", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climbing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Climbing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Nikolau", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Angela Nikolau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooftopping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rooftopping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenaline", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adrenaline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_climbing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free climbing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_medias_res", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "In medias res"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parkour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Physical fitness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_exploration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Urban exploration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyscraper", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Skyscraper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crane_(machine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crane (machine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Romanticism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merdeka_118", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Merdeka 118"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Zimbalist", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Zimbalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merdeka", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Merdeka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Circus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Filmmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kuala Lumpur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kuala Lumpur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-Soviet_states", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Post-Soviet states"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/346/562/4af19c9647931fc0fac7719af76843b890-skywalkers-a-lovestory-review.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9740549", "eventUri": "eng-9740549", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 116, "relevance": 1}

The documentary, which starts streaming Friday on Netflix, chronicles the adventures of Ivan Beerkus and Angela Nikolau, two Russian daredevils who bond over their mutual passion for rooftopping, a hobby that seems about as safe as sticking your head into a hungry lion's mouth.\n\nCo-directors Jeff Zimbalist and Maria Bukhonina spent six years collecting footage of their climbs around the world, including stops in Malaysia, China and France. The shots of them posing for social media followers from perilous positions can be hard to watch. And the film doesn't spend much time dissuading viewers from following in their footsteps.\n\n\"This is stupid scary,\" Nikolau says during one of their most daunting stunts. It's the closest the doc comes to a public-service announcement.\n\nThe film may not be very responsible, but it's strangely romantic. We watch Beerkus and Nikolau, both lifelong loners, get over their own fears of depending on someone else. It's a hard, but visually stunning, way to learn about love.\n\nIf you weren't already inclined to root for the most decorated gymnast during the Summer Olympics, this four-part documentary should do the trick. The 27-year-old star is quite open about mental health issues and circumstances that led to her decision to pull out of the 2020 Games. Her frankness should put a muzzle on critics who once called her unpatriotic. Netflix\n\n'Sausage Party: Foodtopia'\n\n2016's \"Sausage Party,\" one of the most successful R-rated animated films of all time, gets a TV sequel that may be even more outrageous. The series picks up right after the grocery store occupants have revolted against humans, leaving them to construct a government that ends up looking oddly familiar. The writing team, which includes star Seth Rogen, has some clever things to say about politics, but they're mainly concerned about shocking us with outrageous orgies, cannibalism and puns that will make even your dad groan. Only those with a huge appetite for shock comedy will consume all eight episodes. Prime Video\n\n'The Commandant's Shadow'\n\nYou may have seen 2023's \"The Zone of Interest,\" the Oscar winning film about the private life of Rudolf H\u00f6ss, who ran the Auschwitz concentration camp while raising a family next door. This documentary dives even deeper into the subject, tagging along with H\u00f6ss' son and grandson as they confront their relative's evil legacy. The film leads up to a meeting between the H\u00f6sses and one of the camp's survivors, an emotionally stirring, but all-too short session. 9 p.m. ET Thursday, HBO\n\n'Popeye'\n\nThe death of Shelley Duvall's on July 11 may trigger the urge to rewatch \"Brewster McCloud\" and \"The Shining.\" Add \"Popeye\" to that list. The 1980 film bombed so hard that director Robert Altman was relegated to the B list until 1992's \"The Player.\" But the movie, shot on an intricate set in Malta, presents a visual feast with bits inspired more by the circus than cartoon strips. Robin Williams is fine as the muttering macho man, but it's Duvall who lands the biggest comic punches with her performance as Olive Oyl, committing fully to the lunacy with a symphony of hiccups, squeaks and falsetto notes.

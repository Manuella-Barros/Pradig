{"id": 237095466, "title": "Provide commercial ranches for herders, farmers tell FG", "text": "Farmers in Nigeria have asked the Federal Government to establish commercial ranches across the country where herders would graze their cattle and pay rents for the services received from the ranches. Speaking under the aegis of the All Farmers Association of Nigeria, they stated that it was high time the government stopped the movement of cattle from one location to the other, leading to losses of crops and clashes in many villages. They backed the move for a bill that would ban open grazing, stressing that this would not only tackle cases of farmers and herders clashes in various communities but would lead to a drop in food prices. The South-West Chairman, AFAN, Femi Oke, told our correspondent that ranches should be commercialised and stated that this should be given speedy attention by the legislature and the executive arms of government. He said, \u201cI was one of the speakers during the recent World Food Safety Day in Lagos and it was raised that open grazing should be stopped because those people moving around with these cattle destroy many things. So it is not right. \u201cAnd if the government can develop a conducive environment by having some ranches where these people can easily go to, pay rent, and graze their cattle, it will be better, and this may lead to a reduction in the prices of things in that axis. \u201cThis will be better instead of moving cattle around and destroying farm crops which people have invested on. So I am in support of the government opening up ranches, but it should be commercialised. People can rent it or the state governments should monitor it.\u201d Recall that on June 5, 2024, The PUNCH reported that tensions ran high as the bill to ban open grazing successfully passed its second reading in the Nigerian Senate. The report stated that the legislative session was marked by heated debates and strong emotions, reflecting the contentious nature of the proposed law. If enacted, this bill will finally prohibit open grazing nationwide, aiming to resolve longstanding conflicts between herders and farmers. The bill, sponsored by Senator Titus Zam, representing Benue North West, outlines specific regulations for the establishment and management of ranches, promoting best practices and mitigating disputes between herders and farmers. Explaining the general principles of the bill, Zam canvassed the need for the proposed commission to manage, regulate, and preserve ranches across the country. \u201cThe proposed National Animal Husbandry and Ranches Commission is for management, preservation, and control of ranches throughout Nigeria,\u201d the Senator had stated. The bill, however, met stiff opposition from Senator Danjuma Goje from Gombe and his counterpart from Kebbi, Adamu Aliero. Both lawmakers and former governors argued that cattle rearing and ranching activities were more in the North than in other parts of the country, reasoning that lawmaking should be for the entire country and not for a section. High food prices The South-West AFAN chairman also commented on the high cost of food items in Nigeria, as he explained that pest infestation, among other factors, was the reason for this. \u201cThe agric minister talked about it recently and I should not denounce what he said, though we discovered that there are pests that have destroyed many farms. This is why we are saying farmers should be subsidised. \u201cA price commodities board should be created, and when we have a crisis as farmers, the government can come to our aid and this will support us in the business. \u201cMost of the funds we are using in our businesses were accessed from banks as loans. So how do you cope if you can\u2019t service these loans and there is no aid from the government? How do you cope?\u201d Oke stated. The Minister of Agriculture and Food Security, Abubakar Kyari, on May 28, 2024, attributed the high cost of tomatoes and some vegetables to high pest infestation of the crops. He disclosed via his official X handle. \u201cA significant number of our tomato farms have been affected by a severe infestation known as Tomato Ebola or Tomato Leaf Miner. This has drastically reduced the availability of tomatoes and contributed to rising costs. \u201cOur ministry is taking immediate action to combat this issue. We are deploying agricultural experts to affected areas to contain and eliminate the infestation. Additionally, we are supporting our farmers with the necessary resources and guidance to recover their crops as quickly as possible, just as we instituted the Ginger Blight Control Taskforce. \u201cWe understand the impact this has on your daily lives and are working tirelessly to resolve the situation and restore the supply of affordable tomatoes. Thank you for your patience and understanding during this challenging time,\u201d the minister stated. Also speaking on the high cost of food, the National President, AFAN, Kabir Ibrahim, said it was not true to say that the reason for this was because of food export or smuggling. \u201cFor vegetables, they thrive more in the dry season, but right now we are in the rainy season in the South and it is beginning to rain in the North. So these vegetables are not readily produced like before, except for people who have greenhouses. \u201cAlso, the cost of transporting some of these vegetables from where they are produced to city centres is very high, which has further compounded the cost implication of the crops. So it is not right to say there is a diversion. It is not easy to export crops such as vegetables. \u201cWe also witnessed devastating levels of pest infestation, which was alluded to by the agriculture minister recently. So there are a couple of factors causing the high prices of food items across the country now, and smuggling is not one of the major ones for now.\u201d On how to tackle this challenge, the AFAN president said, \u201cIf we learn to cultivate all year round, that is when we will have abundance, in terms of food sufficiency for our country.\u201d", "summary": "<p>Farmers in Nigeria have asked the Federal Government to establish commercial ranches across the country where herders would graze their cattle and pay rents for the services received from the ranches.

To channel her boundless energy, her mother enrolled her in dance classes.\n\nWu's journey into track and field began in the fifth grade when she was spotted during a sports competition held in Neijiang, Sichuan. From there, she went to get further training in Chengdu, the capital city of Sichuan.\n\nIn 2012, after being picked up by Yang Hui, a coach from the Beijing Sport University hurdles team, Wu began her career in 100-metre hurdles. Seven years later, her notable performances earned her a spot on China's national athletics squad.\n\nYang once described Wu as \"made for hurdling\" during an interview with local Chinese media, adding: \"She possesses many of the qualities that define a great athlete.\"\n\nChina's Wu Yanni celebrates after the women's 100m Hurdles Final of Athletics at the 19th Asian Games in Hangzhou. - Photo: Xinhua\n\nA rising star\n\nWu soon began amassing a slew of hurdling medals in various national competitions.\n\nShe claimed gold in the 100m at China's Youth Games in 2015 and secured third place at the 13th National Games two years later with a time of 13.36 seconds.\n\nHer ascent continued as she rose to the elite ranks of Chinese female hurdlers, winning gold at the National Athletics Championships in 2018, 2020, and 2021.\n\nAt the 14th National Games in 2021, however, Wu missed out on the title, earning a silver medal as compatriot Lin Yuwei took the gold.\n\nWu rose to the pinnacle of her career after earning a silver medal in the women's 100m hurdles in the FISU World University Games, held in Chengdu in August 2023.\n\nShe set her personal best of 12.76 seconds during the race, which also secured her a place in Paris.\n\nChina's Yanni Wu looks on as she stands with officials following a false start during the women's 100m hurdles final. - Photo: Reuters\n\nSetbacks\n\nDuring last year's Asian Games in Hangzhou, the capital city of the eastern Zhejiang province, Wu came under the spotlight after being disqualified for a false start.\n\nIt was not the first time she had found herself in difficulty at the starting line - months earlier, at the 2023 Athletic Championships in Bangkok, she was also disqualified in the final of the 100m hurdles for the same reason.\n\nReflecting on these moments in an interview with Chinese news outlet The Paper, Wu described the 2021 National Games and the Asian Games as \"the worst moments of my athletic career, and probably nothing worse after that\".\n\nBut Wu said those setbacks introduced a more \"playful\" attitude toward racing, allowing her to focus on the process rather than the results.\n\nThese false-start incidents, along with her tattoos and cosmetics during the race, thrust her into the centre of online controversies and even criticism.\n\nAddressing the doubts about her make-up during races, Wu told local media: \"I'll perform better when all the focus is on me ... I think it's normal for girls to wear make-up, and we can't take away a person's right to look beautiful.\"\n\nShe emphasised: \"We should allow others to be others and allow ourselves to be ourselves. This is the most important.\"\n\nChina's Wu Yanni has become notable for her tattoos and on-track make-up as well as her track success. - Photo: Xinhua\n\nRunning to the Olympics\n\nAway from the track, Wu has found popularity on social media with more than 3.7 million followers on her official Douyin account.\n\nBut Wu also distanced herself from labels like \"internet celebrity\".\n\n\"I've been in this sport for 11 years, working hard every day,\" she said. \"Am I doing this to be an internet celebrity? No. Do doctors, lawyers and forensic scientists work years in their fields to become celebrities? Of course not.\"\n\nAfter earning a place at the Paris Olympics, Wu's preparation for the Olympics was far from smooth\n\nAfter the Asian Games debacle, she fell short of expectations at the Diamond League meet held in Xiamen on China's southeast coast in April, where she finished in a disappointing 10th place with a time of 13.04 seconds.\n\nBut Wu has shown she can bounce back from a setback during her impressive pre-Olympic form.\n\nBefore winning gold and setting a personal best at the recent National Track and Field Championships, she has also secured back-to-back victories in the 100-metre hurdles at the World Continental Tour held in Osaka and Tokyo, Japan in May. - South China Morning Post", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com.my", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star "},

I didn\u2019t get there, and I\u2019m quite regretful. But I will bring this regret into next year\u2019s [competitions], the next training, and hope \u2026 I can have a better breakthrough.\u201d\n\nWu\u2019s time of 12.98 seconds on Thursday was well off the personal best 12.74 she recorded to win June\u2019s national championships.\n\nAfter Wednesday\u2019s heat, when she ran 12.97, Wu awarded herself \u201czero\u201d marks.\n\nAt the same time, the athlete\u2019s coach, Yang Hui, said Wu was \u201ca bit uptight\u201d. \u201cShe also had her period yesterday, which affected her,\u201d added Yang, who claimed Wu should \u201cmake the semi-finals\u201d because her competitors are \u201cnot that strong\u201d.\n\nWu was 11th fastest of the 21 repechage competitors, however. Japan\u2019s Yumi Tanaka, the Asian Games bronze medallist, advanced to Friday\u2019s semi-finals after finishing second in Wu\u2019s heat.\n\nAsked about Tanaka, Wu, who was disqualified from last year\u2019s Asian Games final for false starting, said: \u201cI also think I should still be very good in Asia. Because of my state of mind, I wasn\u2019t able to develop. It\u2019s my own problem, I need to go back and reflect on what happened.\u201d\n\nWu counts her social media followers in the millions, and the interest she generates was illustrated by the scrum of Chinese journalists fighting to talk to the runner post-race. Some ignored requests from officials to stop filming, which is not permitted in mixed zone areas.\n\nIgnoring the kerfuffle, Wu added: \u201cThis Olympics means a lot to me. It\u2019s one of the most important and unforgettable moments in my life.\n\n\u201cI do have regrets about this Olympics, but I think enjoying the process is the most important thing. In the future, at some international events, I hope everyone can see our Chinese athletes doing well.\u201d\n\nLin\u2019s failure to progress was equally disappointing. She set her 12.74 personal best for that Asian Games gold 10 months ago, but could only manage times of 13.24 and 13.13 in the Stade de France.\n\nThe relay quartet of Dheng Xhijian, Xie Zhenye, Yan Haibin and Chen Jiapeng, meanwhile, stormed into Friday\u2019s final.\n\nOn the second leg, Xie, who disappointingly slumped in his individual 100m heat, ran a blistering 9.06 to elevate China from fifth to third. Yan eased into second, before Chen overhauled France\u2019s Pablo Mateo to bring the Chinese home in 38.24.\n\nThat time was bettered by seven teams in the opening semi-final, which underlines the size of China\u2019s task in the medal race.", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South China Morning Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres_hurdles", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "100 metres hurdles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repechage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Repechage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Asian Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Outdoor_Track_and_Field_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hui_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hui people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yan_Haibin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yan Haibin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xie_Zhenye", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xie Zhenye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Running", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/d8/images/canvas/2024/08/08/1a36e036-ccb2-4955-9c74-4dfceaa2bd2c_ef52f4bd.jpg?itok=pADwwggn", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9800311", "eventUri": "eng-9800311", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

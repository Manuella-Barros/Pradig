I really like this sport and I still love the crowd and the people who support us.\"\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that the Dutch, not Chilean, team won the match.\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jimmy_golen@register-herald.com", "name": "Jimmy Golen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lex_Immers", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lex Immers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beach_volleyball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beach volleyball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chile"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Chile"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Outdoors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Outdoors", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Trucks,_Vans,_and_Sport_Utility", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Trucks, Vans, and Sport Utility", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/register-herald.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/51/85149963-1361-5ab4-816e-5b9e65193794/66aa61e990d70.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C125&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777754", "eventUri": "eng-9777754", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

I am ashamed that my words so inaccurately represented myself.

The pair lost their first match (2-1) to Italy on Sunday and defeated Chile (2-0) on Wednesday.\n\nVan de Velde pleaded guilty to three counts of rape against a child for events that occurred in 2014. He flew from Amsterdam to London in 2014 to meet with a 12-year-old girl he'd met online, The Athletic reported, then had sex with her and advised her to get a morning-after pill. Staff at a family planning clinic then alerted her family and the police. In 2016, he was sentenced in England to four years in prison. He served one year in Britain before he was transferred to the Netherlands and released one month later. Had he been tried in his home country, The Guardian reported, he likely would not have been convicted of rape and instead his actions would have been considered the lesser crime of \"ontucht,\" sexual actions that violate social-ethical norms. Van de Velde resumed his volleyball career after his release. He qualified for the 2024 Paris Olympics in his national pair with Immers, which immediately sparked controversy around the world. It was later announced Van de Velde would not stay in the Olympic Village and he has not done any interviews.\n\nA petition with more than 125,000 signatures has been circulating since before the Games, calling on the International Olympic Committee to ban him from participating. \"This is about more than just one person; it's about the worldwide image of the Olympics and the kind of society we want to live in,\" petition author Lauren Muir wrote. Groups in support of rape victims have been vocal about their disagreement with the decision to allow Van de Velde to compete, with the UK-based Survivors Trust group calling it an \"endorsement of the shocking toleration we have of child sexual abuse.\" USA Today reporter Gentry Estes called Van de Velde's the \"nastiest storyline\" of the Olympics.\n\nOne GBNews commentator has been met with backlash on X after she seemed to defend the circumstances of Van de Velde's relationship with the minor, and The Guardian noted the circumstances haven't stirred up much controversy in his home country. The news of a convicted rapist playing for the Dutch team hasn't made the front pages in the Netherlands according to The Guardian, nor has it spurred columns or editorials the way it has abroad. The Netherlands' Olympic Committee defended the choice to let Van de Velde play by noting he'd served his sentence, completed a rehabilitation program and was determined to be at no risk of reoffending. The volleyball federation called Van de Velde \"an exemplary professional and human being.\" On a recent GBNews segment in England, commentator Emma Woolfe seemed to defend the circumstances of Van de Velde's relationship with the victim. She said he was \"a few years older than her\" at the time and called the incident a \"very inappropriate holiday romance.\" She added that Can de Velde would have been able to \"carry on with his job in any other walk of life.\" Ofcom, the broadcasting regulatory agency of the United Kingdom, is looking into complaints received over the segment.\n\n\"I made that choice in my life when I wasn't ready,\" Van de Velde said in a TV interview after his release from prison. \"I was sort of lost and now I have so much more life experience... I can't reverse it, so I have to carry the consequences. It's the biggest mistake of my life.\"", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_van_de_Velde", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steven van de Velde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lex_Immers", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lex Immers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volleyball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Volleyball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Child sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_contraception", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emergency contraception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amsterdam"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Amsterdam"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chile"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Chile"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_planning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Family planning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Village", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Village"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofcom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ofcom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Trucks,_Vans,_and_Sport_Utility", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Trucks, Vans, and Sport Utility", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice/Syndicated", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice/Syndicated", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66aa5f1c119b2f8e8f90e9f8/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1988,1117,x0,y0,safe&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777754", "eventUri": "eng-9777754", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

However, beneath this inspiring facade, some dark realities emerge, revealing a twisted side of the stories we so eagerly celebrate. A recent controversy involving Dutch beach volleyball player Steven van de Velde, set to compete in the Paris Olympics 2024, has sparked a significant ethical debate.\n\nSteven van de Velde, now 29, has a deeply twisted history. In 2014, at the age of 19, he was convicted of raping a 12-year-old girl he met on Facebook. The occurred in Milton Keynes, UK, where Van de Velde travelled specifically to meet the girl. Aylesbury Crown Court sentenced him to four years in prison in 2016, although he served just one year in the Netherlands.\n\nDespite his criminal history, the Dutch Olympic Committee has decided not to exclude Van de Velde from the Games. They stated that Van de Velde has been participating in international beach volleyball tournaments since 2018 following an \"intensive professionally supervised trajectory.\" This decision has ignited outrage, questioning the integrity of the selection process and the message it sends to athletes and fans.\n\nThe notion that a convicted child rapist can represent his country at the highest level of sports is profoundly unsettling. While rehabilitation and second chances are essential aspects of justice, the role of elite athletes as role models cannot be overlooked. Allowing Van de Velde to compete undermines the values that sports are meant to represent. The survivor's family, in particular, must find this decision deeply distressing.\n\nVan de Velde's presence at the Paris Olympics is not expected to be smooth. The public and media scrutiny will be intense, and the Dutch team's decision to bar him from media interviews suggests an attempt to minimize backlash. However, the court of public opinion is likely to be unforgiving.\n\nIn what can be seen as a double standard practised by the Olympic committee, while a convicted felon is proudly included in the national squad, a woman wearing a hijab of her own will is barred from the opening ceremony of the Olympics.\n\nThe differing reactions between the Netherlands and the UK highlight a significant legal distinction. In the UK, sex with a 12-year-old is unequivocally classified as rape, whereas in the Netherlands, Van de Velde's crime was considered the lesser offence of \"ontucht\" (indecency). This legal nuance may contribute to the muted reaction in the Netherlands.\n\nThe participation of Van de Velde in the Olympics raises critical questions about the impact on survivors of sexual abuse. For the survivor, seeing her rapist gain fame on an international stage must be incredibly traumatic. True rehabilitation would involve actively using his platform to address the impact of sexual abuse and contribute positively to society.\n\nGlobal events like the Olympics wield immense power to shape and define ethical boundaries, influencing societal norms and maintaining power balances on an international scale. These events have the potential to uplift the human spirit and promote values such as fairness, integrity, and respect. However, it is extremely disheartening to witness a country prioritize winning a medal over maintaining these principles, choosing to send criminals to the global stage.\n\nThe decision to allow Steven van de Velde to compete in the Paris Olympics is a stark reminder of the complex ethical issues within sports. The sports community must reflect on the values it upholds and the messages it sends to both athletes and fans.", "source": {"uri": "shethepeople.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "SheThePeople"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ishika_thanvi@shethepeople.tv", "name": "Ishika Thanvi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_van_de_Velde", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steven van de Velde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beach_volleyball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beach volleyball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crown Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aylesbury", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aylesbury"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Aylesbury"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Keynes", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milton Keynes"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milton Keynes"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOC*NSF", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NOC*NSF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Role model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Physical therapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Child sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_norm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social norm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_standard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double standard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games_ceremony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games ceremony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hijab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Trucks,_Vans,_and_Sport_Utility", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Trucks, Vans, and Sport Utility", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://img-cdn.thepublive.com/fit-in/1200x675/shethepeople/media/media_files/UQv3gZSe40WhE8yyiP0S.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777754", "eventUri": "eng-9777754", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

There were more boos when Van de Velde played most any shot.\n\n\"I was disappointed with the crowd, for sure,\" Immers said. \"I cannot do anything about his past anymore.

Although victims advocates, lawmakers and fans have called for him to be banned from the Olympics, the IOC has said it was powerless to stop the Netherlands from sending an athlete who qualified in the usual way.\n\nVan de Velde again did not walk through the mix zone to address the media on Wednesday, something typically required of every athlete. When Immers arrived, Dutch press attache Hans Nieuwenburg told reporters, \"Sport questions only.\"\n\n\"He said everything on (Sunday),\" when the two lost their opening match to Italy, Nieuwenburg said.\n\nImmers was asked about the reception and said the two spoke on the court and recognized they would need to be extra supportive of each other. Asked if he understood why they received that reception, he said, \"I don't want to talk about that, if it's OK.\"\n\n\"I think what's in the past is in the past, and we're here to go for a good result together,\" Immers said, noting that there were Dutch fans cheering for them. \"And I want to say there was also a lot of people supporting us, and we're doing it for them.

The world is watching.\"\n\nIn 2014, Book delivered the keynote address at the Dutch National Rapporteur on Human Trafficking's \"Symposium on Sexual Violence Children\" in conjunction with the Netherlands' first-ever national study on child sexual abuse.\n\nShe advised the organization on setting national guidelines for child safety, but said Tuesday that she remains concerned with the country's lax laws, beliefs and cultural mores around child sexual abuse and abusers. The country has no sexual abuse registry and sets light punishment for abusers. In some cases, the country permits convicted child sexual predators to volunteer at schools or parks where children gather to offer repentance for their crime.\n\n\"The safety and trust of our children and communities must take precedence over individual redemption,\" she said. \"When it comes to the Olympic Games, it is irresponsible and offensive for the IOC to stand idly by.\"\n\nVan de Velde was sentenced in 2016 after admitting that he flew from Amsterdam to a small north London airport in 2014 to have sex with a 12-year-old girl with whom he'd been speaking frequently online. Authorities caught him after he advised the victim to get a morning-after pill and staff at a family planning clinic reported him to the girl's family.\n\nHe ultimately served just over a year behind bars.\n\nOn Sunday, van de Velde received a mixture of boos and applause when he was introduced before losing his opening match. Asked if the Dutch Olympic team was protecting a convicted child rapist, team spokesperson John van Vliet said, \"We are protecting a convicted child rapist to do his sport as best as possible and for a tournament which he qualified for.\"\n\n\"The general matter of sex conviction and sex-related crime is definitely a more important issue than sport,\" van Vliet said after the match. \"In his case, we've got a person who has been convicted, who did his sentence, who did everything afterwards which he can do to be able to compete again.\"\n\nVan de Velde's next match is on Wednesday against Chile. A second loss would create a difficult, but not impossible, road to the knockout round.\n\nAnother petition calling on the IOC to ban known sex offenders from competing received nearly 81,000 signatures by Thursday, the New York Times reported. A Change.org petition aimed solely at van de Velde, started Saturday, has more than 5,600 signatures.\n\nThis isn't the first time the Olympics were tarnished by child sex abuse. An internal investigation by the U.S. Justice Department found that the FBI turned a \"blind eye\" to early reports of abuses by Larry Nassar, a former team doctor for the U.S. gymnastics team, before he was charged in 2016 for serial child rape in one of the largest sexual abuse scandals in sports history.\n\n___\n\nMaterial from the Associated Press was used in this report.

In 2014, when van de Velde was 19, he began corresponding with a 12-year-old girl on Facebook, continuing their communication even when he learned her age. He eventually traveled from the Netherlands to England to meet her and raped her. He pleaded guilty to three counts of child rape and was sentenced to four years in prison, but only served one year. Almost immediately after his release, the Dutch Volleyball Association permitted him to resume his volleyball career without consequences and has adamantly supported his selection to the Olympics.\n\nMultiple athlete advocacy groups penned an open letter asking the Olympics to disqualify van de Velde immediately, while a petition calling for his removal gained over 120,000 signatures. The letter and petition pointed out how he has shown no remorse for his actions and will not even admit that he committed a crime, describing what he did as merely a small mistake he made when he was a \"teenager still figuring things out.\" However, the Olympics failed to disqualify him. Now, not only is a convicted child rapist competing in the Paris Olympics, but he's also getting special treatment.\n\nReports have arisen that the Olympics are going out of their way to accommodate van de Velde and ensure he's separated from the media and fellow athletes. On the one hand, if he's going to be allowed to be there at all, he should be separated from the other athletes for their protection, considering there are minor athletes participating in the Olympics. But what's strange is that the Dutch are taking these measures to protect him. Viewers noticed that van de Velde has been excused from doing interviews or participating in any media, even though this is an obligation for the majority of Olympic athletes.\n\nAccording to The Sun, Dutch aide John van Vliet said they were protecting him so he could \"do his sport as best as possible.\" However, it's not just the Dutch. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) permitted the Netherlands to accommodate van de Velde and \"create an environment which is best for them and their performance.\" He was even provided with three bodyguards to escort him around the Games for protection. While most of the athletes are staying in the terrible living conditions of the Olympic Village because it's the most affordable option, van Vliet confirmed that they had secured special sleeping quarters outside the Village for van de Velde.\n\nThe volleyball player even goes through separate entrances and exits as his team members to avoid the \"Mixed Zone\" where the press is stationed. However, the IOC defended this decision, claiming that while teams are required to go through the Mixed Zone and participate in media, not every individual team member has to do so.\n\nIt doesn't matter how the IOC and Dutch try to spin it, though; they're shielding van de Velde from the media to avoid him receiving even an ounce of scrutiny or discomfort for the serious crimes he has committed.\n\nThe special treatment van de Velde is getting even goes beyond Olympic officials. His teammate Matthew Immers has gushed over how van de Velde is now a good person and expressed confusion over why \"there is so much attention\" on his horrific crime. Meanwhile, although van de Velde received a smattering of boos during his first match at the Olympics, the boos were quickly drowned out by cheers as his home country celebrated him. Not only has the Olympics declared that a convicted child rapist can be celebrated as an Olympian, but that the Games will actually go out of their way to protect sex offenders.\n\nAgain, the only people who need protection are the women and minor athletes forced to compete with a convicted sex offender. For their protection, he should've been banned from the Olympic Village and left to find accommodations on his own instead of having the Dutch make special arrangements for him. He should always have a chaperone supervising him, not three bodyguards protecting him. It's well-known that a trade-off for all athletes accepting the privilege of going to the Olympics is dealing with the scrutiny and pressure from the media, making it unclear why van de Velde is being given all the privileges and none of the drawbacks.", "source": {"uri": "themarysue.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Mary Sue"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rachel_ulatowski@themarysue.com", "name": "Rachel Ulatowski", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Child sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nederlandse_Volleybalbond", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nederlandse Volleybalbond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_van_de_Velde", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steven van de Velde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOC*NSF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NOC*NSF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_offender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sex offender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_letter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Open letter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volleyball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volleyball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beach_volleyball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beach volleyball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Sun (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodyguard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bodyguard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Village", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Village"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Trucks,_Vans,_and_Sport_Utility", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Trucks, Vans, and Sport Utility", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://www.themarysue.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Steven-van-de-Velde-Olympics.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777754", "eventUri": "eng-9777754", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2941176470588235, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

Every time Van de Velde lined up to serve there were clear murmurs from the stands - though a number of Dutch fans continued to cheer him.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee said on the eve of the games that it is satisfied with explanations given by the Netherlands Olympic team regarding the participation of Van de Velde in Paris.\n\nHe was given a four-year sentence for the rape of a 12-year-old girl in Milton Keynes in 2014. He served 12 months in a British prison, before being transferred to his home country where he was released after a further month - and has been competing nationally since 2018.\n\nBut his inclusion at the Olympics has sparked a heated reaction, with Australian chief Anna Meares leading the backlash against Van de Velde's selection.\n\nBritish marathon legend Paula Radcliffe was also forced to apologise after wishing the disgraced athletes \"the best of luck\" while saying he had served his time. Radcliffe backtracked within 24 hours of her comments on a radio station by posting on social media: \"I am mortified that I expressed it so badly and didn't condemn the rape out loud.\"\n\nBut after a week of debate around the ethics of someone previously found guilty of such a serious crime, Van de Velde was given the green light to compete for the Dutch - with certain safeguarding rules in place.\n\nHe will not be allowed to stay in the athletes' village and is expected to skip all media during his time in Paris, including dispensation to skip the mixed zone that all athletes must walk through following competition.\n\n\"To characterise it as comfortable and happy would not be correct,\" IOC spokesperson Mark Adams said at a press conference after being asked about the governing body's reaction to his inclusion.\n\n\"We have made it clear we have been in long conversations with the Dutch National Olympic Committee. A crime occurred 10 years ago, a great deal of rehabilitation has taken place and strong safeguarding is in place,\" he said.\n\n\"The athlete is not even staying in the village. We feel the NOC have explained their decision. Comfortable and happy, characterise it how you want, but the statement that they have given to us is correct and we will continue with the situation as it is.\"\n\nHaving become acquainted with his victim on Facebook , the then 19-year-old travelled to the UK and police were alerted to the offence after his victim sought the morning after pill at a family planning clinic.\n\nDutch Olympic chiefs say that Van de Velde has \"sought and received professional counselling [and] demonstrated to those around him -

Many condemned the decision to let Van de Velde play, and even called on the International Olympic Committee to investigate how he had been allowed to compete.\n\nRemarkably, in the Netherlands itself, the case has not caused much commotion. The news hasn't made the front pages and there were no columnists or opinion-makers expressing astonishment or indignation.\n\nLast week, the Team Netherlands chef de mission, Pieter van den Hoogenband, expressed mild surprise at the timing of the uproar, pointing out Van de Velde had already returned to international sports in 2017, and played in European and World championships.\n\nThe Netherlands' Olympic committee, which selected Van de Velde, said in a statement he had served his sentence, completed an extensive rehabilitation programme and experts had concluded there was no risk of him reoffending. The volleyball player had shown he had \"grown and positively changed his life\", it said.\n\nBut why the muted reaction in the Netherlands? One legal distinction is Van de Velde is unlikely to have been convicted of rape had he stood trial in the Netherlands rather than England. In England, sex with a 12-year-old is rape, regardless of the circumstances: an under-16 cannot legally consent.\n\nBut after he was extradited to the Netherlands, having serving almost a year of his prison sentence, he was released after less than a month. Under Dutch law, his crime was deemed to be the lesser offence of ontucht, sexual acts that violate social-ethical norms.\n\nOn social media, there are, of course, Dutch people arguing Van de Velde should not compete, with others going much further in their imagined punishments. There are also those, such as the court reporter Chris Klomp, who have argued he is not the \"sex monster\" or \"groomer\" he has been made out to be in some English-language media.\n\nKlomp wrote on X that, although what Van de Velde did was utterly wrong and punishable, he did not physically force the girl to have sex with him. He wrote: \"The absence of coercion (other than the age difference) is also evident from the fact that the British court acquitted him of grooming. It was not his intention to 'persuade her' into sexual acts.\"\n\nKlomp, along with the Dutch sports authorities and many other Dutch people, believes now that Van de Velde has served his sentence and publicly expressed remorse, he is \"of course free to move on with his life\".\n\nBut there is a difference between moving on with one's life and representing your country at the most prestigious sporting event in the world, where you are also supposed to set an example. Which raises the question: what message does the Netherlands send to the world by allowing itself to be represented by a man convicted of a sexual offence?\n\nIt is obvious not much thought has been given to how this might affect victims of sexual abuse.\n\nBecause there is another, even more critical question: How does all of this impact the woman involved? Van de Velde has picked up the pieces of his life, but for victims of sexual abuse it is very difficult to do the same. It must be hard for her to relive everything that happened, through Van de Velde's participation in the Olympic Games and all the conversation around it.\n\nTaking into account the victim's perspective was also what Sara Alaoui, director of the Safe Space Club, an organisation supporting victims of sexual violence, called for during a programme on Dutch radio.\n\nShe felt Van de Velde had not demonstrated enough of that in his statements to the Dutch press. And besides, she argued, expressions of regret alone were not sufficient when aiming for such a prestigious second chance in life: he should show by his actions he truly deserved that second chance. For instance, by using the significant platform he now had as an Olympic athlete to talk openly and honestly about the impact of sexual abuse on victims.\n\nAlaoui cited the example of a unique therapy group in the Dutch city of Eindhoven, where men who have been involved in domestic violence help other men who are guilty of the same. \"It would be very much to his credit if he would commit himself to something like that,\" she said.\n\nDuring this extremely heated global debate, this was one humane and constructive contribution.\n\n- If you are affected by any of the issues raised in this article, please click here for a list of support services.", "source": {"uri": "irishexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Examiner"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_mission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head of mission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Role model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pieter_van_den_Hoogenband", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pieter van den Hoogenband"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dutch people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recidivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recidivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volleyball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volleyball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Physical therapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexual_activity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human sexual activity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_grooming", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Child grooming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coercion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coercion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extradition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extradition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eindhoven", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eindhoven"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Eindhoven"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/8453/4226944_5_articlelarge_2.76975956.jpg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777754", "eventUri": "eng-9777754", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

There were more boos when Van de Velde played most any shot.\n\n\"I was disappointed with the crowd, for sure,\" Immers said. \"I cannot do anything about his past anymore. I\u00b4m here to play with him. ... So, yeah, I\u00b4m disappointed with it. But I think mentally we\u00b4re really strong, and I\u00b4m really strong to get through this, together. And we\u00b4re going to do that.\"\n\nVan de Velde, 29, served 13 months in prison after his 2016 conviction for raping a 12-year-old girl in England. Although victims advocates, lawmakers and fans have called for him to be banned from the Olympics, the IOC has said it was powerless to stop the Netherlands from sending an athlete who qualified in the usual way.\n\nVan de Velde again did not walk through the mix zone to address the media on Wednesday, something typically required of every athlete. When Immers arrived, Dutch press attache Hans Nieuwenburg told reporters, \"Sport questions only.\"\n\n\"He said everything on (Sunday),\" when the two lost their opening match to Italy, Nieuwenburg said.\n\nThe Netherland's Steven van de Velde gets set to return a shot against Chile in a beach volleyball match at the 2024 Summer Olympics, Wednesday, July 31, 2024, in Paris, France.

Asked if he understood why they received that reception, he said, \"I don\u00b4t want to talk about that, if it\u00b4s OK.\"\n\n\"I think what\u00b4s in the past is in the past, and we\u00b4re here to go for a good result together,\" Immers said, noting that there were Dutch fans cheering for them. \"And I want to say there was also a lot of people supporting us, and we\u00b4re doing it for them. I really like this sport and I still love the crowd and the people who support us.\"\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that the Dutch, not Chilean, team won the match.\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\n\nThe Netherland's Steven van de Velde applauds the crowd after his team's victory against Chile in a beach volleyball match at the 2024 Summer Olympics, Wednesday, July 31, 2024, in Paris, France.

He was handed a four-year prison sentence but served only 12 months behind bars.\n\nVan de Velde was controversially selected for the Dutch Olympic volleyball team in June, arriving in France last week under tight security. He was met with jeers from the crowd when he took to the sand court at Champs de Mars park under the Eiffel Tower for his Olympic debut on Sunday, where he lost to Italy alongside team-mate Matthew Immers.\n\nIt has since emerged that Van de Velde is not staying in the Olympic village with the thousands of other athletes competing at the Games, instead, he is off campus in private digs. The Athletic reports that the DOC agreed to house the Olympian elsewhere to keep him from the public limelight and media questioning.\n\n\"They (the Dutch Olympic Committee) have put out a statement, they've made it very clear there's a lot of safeguarding going on, special extra safeguarding,\" International Olympic Committee spokesman Mark Adams told a news conference in Paris on Saturday.\n\nThe DOC clarified its decision in a statement last Thursday: \"We are implementing concrete measures to ensure a safe sporting environment for all participants. These measures include, at the request of Van de Velde, alternative accommodation for Van de Velde and no media contact during his stay in Paris.\"\n\nVan de Velde left the arena on his own after Italy's three-set 22-20 19-21 15-13 triumph. He and Immers are next in action on 31 July at 15:00 BST, when they take on Chile's Marco and Esteban Grimalt.\n\nVan de Velde met his victim on Facebook and travelled from Amsterdam to the UK in 2014, where he raped the girl at an address in Milton Keynes. After a European warrant was issued for Van de Velde's arrest, he was extradited to the UK in January 2016, with the court case held in March the same year.\n\nThere, Van de Velde pleaded guilty to three counts of child rape, specifically the \"rape of a child under the age of 13\". The Dutchman was sentenced to four years in prison in 2016 after pleading guilty.\n\nHe later returned home to the Netherlands where he underwent a \"specialist treatment programme\". Since then, Van de Velde has married fellow pro volleyball player Kim Behrens, who also works as a police officer in her native Germany, and together they have a young son.\n\nThe 2024 Paris Games represents Van de Velde's first Olympics appearance. In 2014, at the time of the offence, Van de Velde was a budding star tipped for greatness having won the Under-20 Dutch national championships and was in line to make the 2016 Olympics in Rio.\n\nFollow all the action on day 5 of the Paris Olympics with Mirror Sport's live blog\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Durkeim postulated that a lack of social cohesion leading to the degradation of norms which cultures were built upon would inevitably lead to the dissolve of a society. His theory and heritage proved to be prescient, perhaps best illustrated by the opening ceremony of the 2024 Olympics in Paris. While the controversial ceremony marked by satanic imagery, debauchery, gluttony, and transgenderism embodied the social degradation Durkeim forewarned of, the host nation that organized the garish display is not the only country whose participation in the games is marred by sexual depravity. In an even more brazen abandonment of respect for social and cultural norms, France's neighbor the Netherlands has sent its compatriot Steven van de Velde to represent the nation at the 2024 games despite the fact that the beach volleyball player was sentenced to 4 years in prison for the rape of a 12-year-old girl on 2014.\n\nIn 2016 van de Velde was found guilty of traveling to Britain from his native country to meet a 12 year-old girl who he groomed through Facebook. While the victim initially told the Dutch Olympian that she was 16, she confessed her true age to van de Velde before he arrived to meet in her hometown of Milton Keynes, England. Upon arrival, van de Velde got the underaged girl drunk and raped her 3 times over the course of 2 days. He returned to his native Netherlands, advising the victim to get contraception over Facebook when they resumed their correspondence. She went to a local sexual health clinic for the morning-after pill and local authorities were alerted in consideration of her age.\n\nDutch authorities eventually extradited van de Velde back to Britain to face charges in March 2016. During proceedings, his victim revealed the toll the rape had taken on her. She described how the trauma inflicted upon her led her to commit self-harm and that she suffered a drug overdose trying to cope with the rape. In light of the abundance of evidence against him, van de Velde pled guilty to rape of a child under the age of 13 and was sentenced to 4 years in prison and placed on the UK sex offender registration list. At the time of his sentence, van de Velde was already an accomplished athlete and aspiring Olympian. This was not lost upon the court as the judge stated \"Your hopes of representing your country now lie as a shattered dream.\" going on to proclaim \"Plainly it is a career end for him\" to conclude his sentencing hearing.\n\nUnfortunately, the judge's remarks would not age well. The flaws in the justice system that enabled him to eventually achieve his lifelong dream of competing in the Olympics immediately took form as van de Velde was allowed to return to the Netherlands to serve his sentence in accordance with a treaty between the UK and the Netherlands. Upon his return, the 4-year prison term was adjusted to conform to Dutch law. After serving just 13 months behind bars, van de Velde was released from prison.\n\nFollowing his release, van de Velde campaigned to rehabilitate his image as his aspirations to compete in the Olympics remained undeterred. During his public relations tour, he unconvincingly feigned regret for his actions, with that disingenuousness being obvious when he would show indignance at criticisms labeling him as a pedophile by responding that the term did not apply to what he did. His lack of remorse became utterly apparent during his media tour, succinctly demonstrated by his remarks in 2018 when he said \"As you know, things happened. We had sex and I came back the next day.\", referring to the rape he pleaded guilty to as sex, wrongfully implying it was a consensual act.\n\nHis remorseless attitude was emboldened by the Dutch Volleyball Association (Neveobo) as it allowed him to resume his international career as a beach volleyball player in 2018, not even one year removed from serving his truncated prison sentence. The convicted rapist and his partner Matthew Immers would qualify for the Olympics in Paris in June 2024. Nevobo would defend his participation in the games, which stated \"We know Steven's history. Before he expressed his desire to return to beach volleyball, we spoke extensively with him, as well as with [the Dutch Sports Federation] and the international volleyball federation FIVB,\" when its general director Michel Everaert addressed van de Velde's qualification in the games. While Nevobo sanctioned his return to competition, his participation in the 2024 games in Paris was ultimately determined by the Dutch Olympic Committee, which decided that \"Van de Velde now meets all the qualification requirements for the Olympic Games and is therefore part of the team,\".\n\nImmers and van de Velde took to the court at the Olympics in Paris for the first time on July 28th. When the child molester's name was announced before the crowd attending the match between the Netherlands and Italy, he was booed by the audience. Their outcry represents the rejection of the normlessness Durkheim forewarned of that been advanced by Olympic institutions during the games. That sentiment was amplified by a round of applause celebrating the Netherlands defeat to Italy. Following the loss, van de Velde reaffirmed his lack of character and accountability by breaking Olympic protocol by skipping his post-match media duties.\n\nThe breach of decorum in skipping media availability was revealed to be part of a strategy the Dutch Olympic team implemented to shield van de Velde from criticism. Dutch press attache John van Vliet admitted \"We are protecting a convicted child rapist, yes,\" confirming that van de Velde was allowed to skip media duties after the match. He would go on to explain the rationale behind the decision, stating \"We are very much aware that if we bring Steven out here, it won't be about sport or his performance.\" Dutch Olympic officials also stated that they had taken additional measures to insulate van de Velde, including arranging accommodations to keep him lodged outside of the Olympic Village where the rest of the athletes stay.\n\nIronically, the Olympics claims it holds its athletes to high standards. Participants, including van de Velde, are required to sign a declaration promising to act as role models during the games. Despite being a literal child rapist, the Olympics officially have sanctioned the premise that van de Velde can be held in such esteem. That social decay has also been exemplified by media coverage of van de Velde's controversial inclusion which has included rape apologists who have tried to paint the child molester in a positive light.\n\nDespite the inclusion of van de Velde in the games, the International Olympics Committee (IOC) has reserved the right to bar athletes from competition when it comes to pushing its own political agenda. This was evident when the Russian Olympic Committee was barred from the 2024 games in Paris as a reactionary measure to the war in Ukraine. While Russian athletes are still allowed to compete, they must be designated as an Individual Neutral Athlete (INA) and are not allowed to display the Russian flag or play its national anthem. The IOC has even gone as far as banning Russian INAs who voice support for Russia in the war or have any affiliation with the country's military or national security agencies. All Russian INAs are subjected to strict scrutiny by being vetted by the IOC Individual Neutral Athlete Eligibility Review Panel to assure they meet those qualifications.\n\nWhile the IOC has taken extreme measures against Russian athletes in the name of the integrity of the games, they're unconcerned about the blatant hypocrisy of allowing an admitted child rapist to participate in the 2024 Olympics. The politicization behind that dichotomy embodies Durkheim's theory of anomie, in which the degradation of norms that would otherwise preclude van de Velde from participating in the games have been completely abandoned. It is apropos that Durkeim put forward this theory in his seminal 1897 work titled Suicide, considering that the 2024 Olympics in Paris put western civilizations' intent to destroy itself on full display.", "source": {"uri": "zerohedge.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zero Hedge"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label":

There were more boos when Van de Velde played most any shot.\n\n\"I was disappointed with the crowd, for sure,\" Immers said. \"I cannot do anything about his past anymore. I'm here to play with him. ... So, yeah, I'm disappointed with it. But I think mentally we're really strong, and I'm really strong to get through this, together.

Although victims advocates, lawmakers and fans have called for him to be banned from the Olympics, the IOC has said it was powerless to stop the Netherlands from sending an athlete who qualified in the usual way.\n\nVan de Velde again did not walk through the mix zone to address the media on Wednesday, something typically required of every athlete. When Immers arrived, Dutch press attache Hans Nieuwenburg told reporters, \"Sport questions only.\"\n\n\"He said everything on (Sunday),\" when the two lost their opening match to Italy, Nieuwenburg said.\n\nImmers was asked about the reception and said the two spoke on the court and recognized they would need to be extra supportive of each other.

It was intentional.\n\nWhile tasked with covering events at the Paris 2024 Olympics, Radio-Canada commentators \u00c9velyne Audet and Gilles L\u00e9pine chose to stay silent during Wednesday's men's beach volleyball match between the Netherlands and Chile. Their decision was a form of protest against the participation of Dutch player Steven Van de Velde, who has a troubling past.\n\nVan de Velde's involvement in the Games has been contentious for many due to his 2014 conviction for raping a minor in England. After serving 13 months in prison, the 29-year-old was extradited to the Netherlands and released. Despite this, he resumed his volleyball career and was selected by the Dutch Olympic Committee for the current Games.\n\nAudet later shared on social media that she and her colleagues agreed it was best to avoid commenting on the match, highlighting the offputting nature of the athlete's involvement in the event.\n\n\"Disgusting. He should be in prison for his crime, and has instead returned to his sport,\" she wrote of the Dutchman, whose victim was 12 years old at the time. \"We have voiced our discomfort to our superiors and thought it would be best to sit out this match.\"\n\nMeanwhile, on the ground, Van de Velde was repeatedly booed and heckled by spectators as his team overcame Chile in two sets.\n\nWith that said, the convicted pedophile still has some people on his side.\n\nAfter the match, Van de Velde's teammate Matthew Immers shrugged off the criticism of the player's presence in Paris.\n\n\"I'm really disappointed with the reactions [of the crowd].

The IOC's decision to allow convicted child rapist Steven van de Velde to compete in the 2024 Olympic Games is a betrayal of the trust placed in the IOC by athletes, spectators, and the global community. Senator Book is demanding the IOC take immediate corrective action with the adoption of new rules.\n\n\"As a society, we must send a clear and unequivocal message that child sexual abuse is intolerable and will be met with the utmost consequences,\" says Senator Book, Lauren's Kids Founder/CEO. \"This means holding abusers accountable and ensuring they do not have the opportunity to regain positions of influence and trust, particularly in high-profile events like the Olympics. The IOC, as a leading international organization, has a moral obligation to uphold these standards and set an example for others to follow. The world is watching.\"\n\nThe case of van de Velde, a Dutch beach volleyball player who was sentenced to four years in prison in England in 2016 for raping a 12-year-old girl when he was 19, is a terrible reminder of the need for stringent measures to protect our children. His competition in the Olympic Games undermines the values of the Olympics, compromises the safety and well-being of children, and sends a strong message to millions of survivors of child sexual abuse worldwide that an abuser's athletic excellence can overshadow and excuse their horrific crimes.\n\nSenator Book, a survivor of childhood sexual abuse who has successfully influenced policy change on the state, national, and global stages as a Florida Senator and internationally recognized child advocate, is calling on the IOC to enact immediate changes to bylaws prohibiting convicted rapists from competing in the games.\n\n\"The IOC must demonstrate a commitment to protecting the most vulnerable members of our society by immediately adopting new rules ensuring those with a history of sexual abuse have no place in the Olympic Games,\" says Senator Book.\n\nHaving advised the Dutch National Rapporteur on suggested changes to the Netherlands' national guidelines for child safety, Senator Book remains concerned by the country's lax laws, beliefs, and cultural mores surrounding child sexual abuse and those who commit this heinous crime. The country has no sexual abuse registry, punishment for abusers is light, and due to a lack of understanding of the compulsory, hardwired nature of pedophilia - a mental condition which cannot be cured, only managed - individuals found guilty of child sexual abuse were, at the time of Senator Book's visit in 2014, in some cases allowed to volunteer at schools or parks where children gather to offer repentance for their crimes.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\n\"The safety and trust of our children and communities must take precedence over individual redemption - and when it comes to the Olympic Games, it is irresponsible and offensive for the IOC to stand idly by,\" Senator Book continues.\n\nChild sexual abuse is a silent epidemic happening in every single community across the United States and the world, and continues to be one of the most under-reported victim crimes. One in 3 girls and 1 in 5 boys will be victimized before their 18th birthday - and 1 in 5 children who touch a digital device will be sexually solicited online. It is up to individuals and organizations around the world to support victims and survivors, and to hold predators accountable. When a convicted pedophile is allowed to compete, it undermines the integrity of the Games and suggests that athletic excellence can outweigh moral conduct.\n\nThis is not the first time the Olympics have been marred by child sexual abuse. Despite being told about team doctor Larry Nassar's sexual abuse of young Olympic gymnasts, USA Gymnastics and the United States Olympic Committee turned a blind eye and continued to allow child athletes - including beloved and well-decorated Olympic champion Simone Biles - to be victimized by a sexual predator.\n\nTo learn more and sign the petition demanding the IOC change its rules to

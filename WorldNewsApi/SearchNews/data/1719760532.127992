The deal is valued at $22.5 billion when including $5.4 billion in debt. Crude prices have jumped more than 12% this year and the cost for a barrel rose above $80 this week. As part of the transaction, Marathon Oil shareholders will receive 0.2550 shares of ConocoPhillips common stock for each share of Marathon Oil common stock that they own, the companies said Wednesday. ConocoPhillips said Wednesday that the transaction will add highly desired acreage to its existing U.S. onshore portfolio. \u201cThis acquisition of Marathon Oil further deepens our portfolio and fits within our financial framework, adding high-quality, low cost of supply inventory adjacent to our leading U.S. unconventional position,\u201d ConocoPhillips Chairman and CEO Ryan Lance said in a prepared statement. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter. It still needs approval from Marathon Oil stockholders. Separate from the transaction, ConocoPhillips said that it anticipates raising its ordinary dividend by 34% to 78 cents per share starting in the fourth quarter. The company said that once the Marathon Oil deal closes and assuming recent commodity prices, ConocoPhillips plans to buy back more than $7 billion in shares in the first full year. It plans to repurchase more than $20 billion in shares in the first three years.", "summary": "ConocoPhillips is buying Marathon Oil in an all-stock deal valued at approximately $17.1 billion as energy prices soar and big oil companies reap massive profits", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/conocophillips-ap-b2553189.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/05/29/12/ConocoPhillips-Marathon-Oil_38335.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:03:08", "author": "Michelle Chapman", "authors": ["Michelle Chapman"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.372}

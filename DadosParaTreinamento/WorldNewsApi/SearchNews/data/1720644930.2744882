{"id": 231302084, "title": "'Not a green wave, not a wipeout', MEP Ciar\u00e1n Cuffe says as he faces tough battle to hold seat", "text": "THE GREEN PARTY looks to be holding its ground as counting gets underway across the country in the local elections, but the faith of the party\u2019s two MEPs appears more uncertain. Based on tallies from this morning, Green Party candidates in the local elections have fared better than some had predicted. Counting for the European Parliament elections will not get underway until tomorrow morning \u2013 but tallies from this morning show that the party\u2019s two MEPs, Ciar\u00e1n Cuffe and Grace O\u2019Sullivan are far from guaranteed to keep their seats. Speaking to The Journal this afternoon in the RDS count centre in Dublin, Ciar\u00e1n Cuffe said it \u201cclearly isn\u2019t a green wave but it\u2019s not a wipeout either\u201d. Leah Farrell Leah Farrell Cuffe said he expects to see some existing green councillors lose their seats, but expects to see gains in other areas. Indeed, in some areas the Green vote appears to have remained strong. Tallies have shown Green Party councillor Michael Pidgeon sweeping ahead in the South West Inner City, Dublin. While in the South East Inner City, the party\u2019s councillor Claire Byrne was also leading across several ballot boxes. \u201cIt\u2019s a real mixed bag for the Greens, but I\u2019m glad that despite being in government during challenging times, we will still have some gains in certain areas,\u201d Cuffe said. When asked about his own seat, the Dublin MEP said he would love to see a good result tomorrow but that it is a crowded field, even among the centre left. \u201cIt\u2019s quite hard to predict. I think we will see seats for the main parties, Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il. I think we will see Barry Andres [Fianna F\u00e1il] returned, but from there on it\u2019s hard to call,\u201d Cuffe said. But everyone says second preferences are all over the place so I don\u2019t think anyone knows. \u201cI\u2019m certainly happy that I\u2019ve been working hard in Europe for the last five years. I hope that translates into votes and preferences tomorrow, but it\u2019s quite early to tell,\u201d he added. Speaking to reporters earlier at the RDS, Green Party leader Eamon Ryan said Cuffe\u2019s seat was at risk. \u201cIt\u2019s such a competitive field, I know that myself having ran for it a few years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cI think he\u2019ll be in with a chance for that last seat, but it\u2019ll be dependent on transfers,\u201d Ryan added. In the Ireland South constituency for the European Parliament, Green MEP Grace O\u2019Sullivan also faces an uphill battle to keep her seat. Reports on the tallies from the count centre in Cork today suggest that Billy Kelleher and Sean Kelly look likely to go to the top of the poll while O\u2019Sullivan will struggle.

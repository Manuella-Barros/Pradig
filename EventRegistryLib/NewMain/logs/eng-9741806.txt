This decision was based on the safety conditions required for other hoardings on the site, considering the local soil and climatic conditions, according to his statement.\n\nKhalid also considered the proximity of a petrol pump to the hoarding and imposed additional conditions prescribed by BPCL in their tender allotment order on Ego Media Private Limited, the operator for the hoarding.\n\nOn December 19, 2022, Ego Media applied for revised rentals, proposing an increase in the board size to 33,600 square feet.

Khalid also claimed that some of the dates in the documents had been tampered with to make it seem that he was responsible for approving the oversized hoarding. In his statement, Khalid has explained everything about the Ghatkopar hoarding from the e-tendering process, which was initiated by his predecessor Ravindra Sengaonkar.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFormer Government Railway Police Commissioner Quaiser Khalid; (right) Khalid's successor Ravindra Shisve\n\nAccording to Khalid's statement to the Mumbai Crime Branch two days before the charge sheet was filed, the e-tender for four hoardings in Ghatkopar was initiated by his predecessor in 2020 and after he took over, he proceeded according to the terms and conditions. Khalid claimed that the initial tender was issued by BPCL, and the winning bidder was Qicom Brand Solution. However, since Qicom was not paying the Railways, a fresh bid was invited, and the contract was awarded to Ego Media, as it was the highest bidder.\n\nKhalid mentioned that they sought legal opinions from former Bombay High Court judge Nirgude, the APS law firm and the legal officer of Railways. He clarified that he never stated that the land belonged to the Indian Railways. The e-tender mentioned that the land belonged to the state government, but the title of the land was under the home department, government railway headquarters. Khalid pointed out that while the BMC collected taxes, the hoarding concerns were related to the Railways. The legal opinion clearly indicated that BMC approval was not required for land under railway jurisdiction. Khalid claimed he was unaware of who paid the legal fees to Justice Nirgude and the law firm. The charge sheet claims that it was Ego Media who had done so.\n\nThe site of the billboard collapse on May 13. File pic ; (right) Bhavesh Bhinde, head of Ego Media, who is named in charge sheet\n\nKhalid further explained that the director general of police (DGP) office's permission was not sought because, in September 2020, it approved a BPCL-operated petrol pump at Ghatkopar, which was 60x60 sq m. The proposal for the pump was sent by Sengaonkar and was approved by the DGP office. Khalid clarified in his statement that the approval and design already included permission for a hoarding. Therefore, he did not seek additional permission from the DGP office, as it had been pre-approved during Sengaonkar's tenure.\n\nAccording to Khalid, he approved a 200 sq ft hoarding on November 22, 2022 and noted that if the size were to be increased, the rent for the GRP should be considered. This issue remained unresolved when he handed over charge to Shisve. Until April 21, 2023, Shisave did not decide on the matter and forwarded a proposal to the DGP office to regularise the hoarding size to 33,600 sq ft. The DGP office rejected this proposal and instead issued a show-cause notice to Shisve.\n\nQuaiser Khalid's statement to Crime Branch\n\nShisve responded to the DGP office on September 16, 2023, arguing that the plot was commercial and would remain so even without the hoarding, thus permission should be granted. However, the office did not grant the permission. Khalid claimed that Shisve also received multiple complaints about the illegal hoarding being larger than the size approved by him [Khalid]. These complaints were made by former Ghatkopar corporator and BJP leader Kirit Somaiya, RTI activist Anil Galgali and social activist Saleem Pathan.\n\nAccording to Khalid, Ego Media submitted an application for revised rental where the size of the billboard was increased to 33,600 sq ft on December 19, 2022, his last day in office. And as this was a policy matter, he refused to take any decision and asked the office to put up the matter before Shisve.\n\nAccording to Khalid, BPCL objected to the scale of digging by Ego Media on the plot allocated for running the pump. An office note was put up before Shisve on December 21, 2022, as it violated Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO) licence conditions, and a request for the stoppage of work was made. According to Khalid, Shisve failed to take any action on the violation of the original order dated November 22, 2022 by him, which permitted a hoarding up to 200 sq ft in size, as per the standard design of the petrol pump.\n\nKhalid further stated that on April 30, 2024, 13 days before the hoarding collapsed, the BMC issued a notice to the GRP to remove the illegal hoarding. However, it appears that Shisve did not take any action on this and instead continued to collect rent from EGO Media. According to sources, Ego Media was paying around 12 lakh per month for the hoarding, and by the time it collapsed, over one crore had been paid to the Railways.\n\nKhalid's statement concludes, \"It appears that Shisve did not act on these aspects, and hence, on May 13, the illegal hoarding collapsed due to a natural disaster, killing 17 people and injuring more than 80.\"\n\nHe also claimed that the construction work took place during Shisve's tenure and that it was the latter's responsibility to check the hoarding's stability. According to Khalid, the land at the site was soft and marshy. While in typical cases in Mumbai, digging to a depth of three meters is sufficient, at Ghatkopar, a depth of 10 metres is required to reach hard rock.\n\nIn his statement, Shisve said that he was shocked when it was brought to his notice that approval from the DGP office had not been taken for the hoarding. He immediately asked his office to prepare a letter to inform his superiors, and the letter was sent to the DGP office. As commissioner, he was handling law and order, crime control, and administrative work, which kept him busy. When he eventually followed up on the letter sent to the DGP office, he was informed that no response had been received and that the letter had not been acknowledged. Consequently, he wrote a fresh letter on April 21, 2023.\n\nHe added that in August 2023, an ADG-rank officer sent him a letter and spoke to him on the phone about how permission was granted for the hoarding, asking him to prepare a detailed report. \"On September 16, 2023, I sent a clarification to the DGP office. Later, I learned that a show-cause notice was issued to Khalid by the DGP office. Khalid then called one of the junior clerks in my office and asked for all the files to review. The clerk sought my permission, which I granted. After that, there were no further orders from the DGP office until the hoarding collapsed,\" Shisve's statement reads.\n\nShisve claimed that complaints made by the corporator and activists were never brought to his notice. \"You won't see any remarks from me on those complaints. I have 21 years of experience in the service, and addressing such complaints is my responsibility.\"", "source": {"uri": "mid-day.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mid-day"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaiser_Khalid", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quaiser Khalid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_general_of_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Director general of police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalid_(singer)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Khalid (singer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharat_Petroleum", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharat Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoarding", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hoarding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Police_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian Police Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chargesheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chargesheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghatkopar", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ghatkopar"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ghatkopar"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brihanmumbai_Municipal_Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Billboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghatkopar_East_Assembly_constituency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ghatkopar East Assembly constituency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_Railway_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government Railway Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatwa", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fatwa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_governments_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State governments of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Railways", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian Railways"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombay_High_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bombay High Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gasoline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_Information_Act,_2005", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right to Information Act, 2005"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_investigation_department", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Criminal investigation department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pashtuns", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pashtuns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirit_Somaiya", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kirit Somaiya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Activism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_rock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hard rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://images.mid-day.com/images/images/2024/jul/How-did-hoarding-a_d.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9741806", "eventUri": "eng-9741806", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-05-13", "textStart": 2278, "textEnd": 2284, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-09-", "textStart": 2484, "textEnd": 2498}, {"amb": false, "date": "2016-09-", "textStart": 3453, "textEnd": 3465, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-12-", "textStart": 4073, "textEnd": 4084}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

Their accusatory statements to the Crime Branch are part of the 3,299-page charge sheet submitted to the court earlier this month. mid-day has examined documents to ascertain whether Khalid had allowed the hoarding and how Shisve allegedly failed to prevent its construction and removal.\n\nThe statements of both top officers raise serious questions about their conduct. Khalid has already been suspended by the home department for gross irregularities and administrative lapses while Shisve, who took charge as railway commissioner on December 19, 2022, was asked to provide an explanation, which he did, but the director general of police's (DGP) office has not yet responded to it, as per his statement.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nKhalid claims he only allowed a 200-sq-ft hoarding on November 22, 2022, a month before his last working day, with the condition that the Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) pump hoarding size should not exceed 80 to 200 square feet. This claim is supported by documents as stated in his statement.\n\nIt is alleged that Khalid approved a 120x140 (both sides) hoarding (totalling 36,600 square feet) on his last day in office, December 19, 2022, and signed the papers. Khalid claims that on his last day, Ego Media submitted an application to the GRP to increase the size of the hoarding.\n\nGovernment Railway Police ex-commissioner Quaiser Khalid and Khalid's successor Ravindra Shisve\n\nSince it was his last day, he did not make any policy decisions but signed the file after reviewing the documents. mid-day has examined these documents, which show that the file was put before Khalid for his approval, and he signed it without making any comments, unlike his previous orders where he wrote \"approved\" or \"disapproved\". Sources close to Khalid claim that it was mandatory for him to sign the papers since the file was put before him, but he told his officers to present it to the new commissioner. However, no remarks were found on the files, which raises doubts.\n\nA senior IPS officer said, \"Once you sign files without any remarks, it means you have approved them.\"\n\nAfter Khalid left, the authorisation letter to increase the hoarding's size was given to Ego Media on the same day. However, the letter only had the signature of Office Superintendent (OS) Hemant Nevkar, a senior clerk who is now retired, amd two junior clerks. Nevkar signed the letter, stating it was with the approval of the commissioner of police, but did not mention the commissioner's name.\n\nThe site of the Ghatkopar hoarding collapse on May 16. Pic/Atul Kamble\n\nIn contrast, the authorisation for the hoarding granted to Ego Media on November 22, 2022, by Khalid had multiple signatures, with Khalid's being the final one. According to Khalid, the file he signed was not the final approval. Even if it was considered approval, GRP officers were supposed to submit another file for the final letter of authorisation to be issued to Ego Media. The letter increasing the size of the hoarding should have gone to the commissioner for final authorisation before being issued to Ego Media. Instead, the authorisation letter given to EGO Media was signed by Nevkar with a note stating it was approved by the commissioner of railway police.\n\nKhalid claims in his statement that, the dates on the files bearing his signature were manipulated, and there are overwrites on the clerk's signatures. mid-day has reviewed these documents and observed the overwrites. It appears the dates, initially 26-12-2022 or 29-12-2022, were changed to 19-12-2022. Khalid in his statement to the Crime Branch has revealed this.\n\nFormer GRP Commissioner Quaiser Khalid\n\nAccording to him, this was done to make it look like everything happened on his last day and that the authorisation letter was given to Ego Media on the same day. He further claims there was manipulation in the outward diary of the GRP. According to his statement, entry no. 13965 was changed to 13965A, and between the empty spaces of 13964 and 13965A, another entry -- 13965 -- was created to show that the letter was handed over to Ego Media on the same day. Sources from the DGP office have confirmed that this has come to their knowledge and the matter is being probed.\n\nCrime Branch sources said, \"We don't know about Khalid's manipulation claims in his statement, as he has not provided any supporting documents. He is a suspect in the case, and his statements cannot be taken as gospel truth.\"\n\nAfter Shisve took over, the construction of the hoarding began. Between the start of construction and the collapse, four complaints were made to Shisve, claiming the hoarding was illegal and warning it might collapse. One complainant specifically mentioned a similar hoarding in Pune that had collapsed, killing five people. In his statement, Shisve claimed these complaints never reached him.\n\nAdditionally, two objections were raised by BPCL, and a notice from the BMC was sent to the GRP, stating the hoarding was illegal. The BMC notice, sent just 13 days before the hoarding collapsed, requested that if the GRP had granted permission, it should be revoked and the hoarding should be taken down. Despite these warnings, no action was initiated by Shisve.\n\nAccording to documents accessed by mid-day, after Shisve took over, the first complaint and objection were raised by BPCL following the digging work started by EGO Media at the petrol pump, which violated PESO (Petroleum and Explosive Safety Guidelines). BPCL raised the first objection on December 14, 2022, (The said letter was put up on noting on December 21 after Khalid left) stating, \"We would like to bring to your notice that commercial activity in PESO-licensed premises is not allowed without approvals. Also, we would like to state that the OC for the said retail outlet is under progress, and a site visit by the BMC officer is due. Therefore, you must immediately stop the work.\" Despite this, the GRP did not act, leading BPCL to send another objection on January 14, 2023.\n\nThe BPCL objection was presented to Shisve, and he remarked, \"Very shocking and surprising that this is put up before me on January 25, 2023, which is after 40 days.\" He asked for an explanation from his office for the delay in five days.\n\nAfter five days, when the matter was brought to his knowledge again, a clerk stated that he had come to his office with the file containing the objection but was told to look into other administrative work relating to the police welfare fund and recruitment and the clerk claimed that he got busy with these tasks.\n\nA meeting was called on February 1, 2023, to discuss the BPCL objection. It was concluded there that it was meaningless as the land belongs to Railways, and BPCL was given permission to run only the pump; the hoarding part was with Railways and same should be communicated with the BPCL.\n\nIn his statement to the Crime Branch, Shisve said he had explained everything to the ADG (Admin) at the DGP office in a detailed response after an explanation was sought from him in August 2023. He responded on September 16, 2023, assuring them that his office would adhere to whatever decision the DGP office made. However, he further claimed that he did not receive any response before the hoarding collapsed. mid-day reached out to ADG admin Nikhil Gupta, but he refused to comment.\n\nShisve also declined to comment on the matter. However, sources close to him stated, \"The allegations of overwriting are baseless. The Crime Branch is probing everything. The money trail and all relevant evidence are with the agency, which will establish who is responsible. The former commissioner has been suspended for gross irregularities, and nothing else is needed to prove accountability.\"\n\nIn a major setback to the Mumbai Crime Branch, which investigating the Ghatkopar hoarding collapse case, Manoj Ramkrishna Sanghu, the Bombay Municipal Corporation-approved engineer and architect responsible for the structural stability of the hoarding, was granted bail of Rs 1 lakh by the sessions court on Wednesday. Opposing his bail, the Crime Branch argued that Sanghu had conspired with Ego Media director Bhavesh Bhinde, a key accused, and Janhvi Marathe, the firm's former head, to issue a fraudulent structural stability report and could jeopardise the investigation if he were released.\n\nThe bail was granted by Additional Sessions Judge V M Pathade after imposing several conditions such as making it mandatory for Sanghu to appear before the investigating officer when required, not leave the country without court permission, avoid influencing prosecution witnesses and not tamper with evidence or engage in similar crimes.\n\nAccording to the Crime Branch, Sanghu, 41, is accused of designing the hoarding and issuing the structural stability audit report without proper verification from the authorised agencies. The Crime Branch also claimed that Sanghu's stability certificate permitted a hoarding size of 40x40 feet, but he failed to address why the structure was illegally erected at 120x140 feet.\n\nSanghu was represented by advocate Devanand Manekar, who argued that his client had been falsely implicated and had no direct involvement in the crime. He stated, \"It was Ego Media's responsibility to submit the design to VJTI or another recognised institution for approval. The claims that Sanghu was on a monthly payroll are false. Bhinde was paying him in instalments due to financial constraints.\"\n\nManekar further contended that Sanghu's role was limited to issuing the structural stability audit report and that the hoarding collapsed due to extraordinary wind speed of 87 kmph. He emphasised that the construction was carried out by another party, with no involvement from Sanghu.\n\nPublic Prosecutor Iqbal Solkar objected to the bail, highlighting the seriousness of the incident, which resulted in 17 deaths. Solkar pointed out that VJTI reported flaws in Sanghu's design, and the police had sent Sanghu's architect certificates to Mumbai University for verification and its response is awaited.\n\nManekar told mid-day, \"I argued before the court this was an act of God and my client cannot be held responsible as he was just doing his job by issuing a stability certificate. The hoarding was the largest in Asia and listed in the Guinness Book of World Records.\n\nWhat were the agencies concerned such as the BMC and GRP doing if the same was illegal?\"", "source": {"uri":

Khalid is under scrutiny for approving the tender for the Ghatkopar illegal hoarding that collapsed on May 13, killing 17 and injuring 81.\n\nThe collapse occurred at a Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) petrol pump on Ghatkopar railway police land, at the Eastern Express Highway. In 2020, then-commissioner Ravindra Sengaonkar signed a memorandum of understanding with BPCL, including plans for a hoarding on the premises. During BPCL's process of acquiring permissions, Sengaonkar was transferred, and Khalid took over in February 2021. BPCL then called for tenders for the \"installation and operation of the hoarding,\" awarding the contract to QUICOM Brand Solutions LLP after bidding.\n\nDue to payment issues, QUICOM withdrew, and Ego Media Ltd took over, becoming the owner of the hoarding that later collapsed. The Crime Branch investigation noted abnormalities beginning at this point.\n\nKhalid stated that Ego Media successfully bid for three hoardings on the same plot and submitted a fresh application for a fourth hoarding in November 2022. He explained, \"In view of the 2016 government directive, an order can be repeated on the same terms and conditions if it has been done through competitive bidding, is within six months of the original order, and is of a smaller volume.\n\nEgo Media was permitted to operate the fourth hoarding, with a maximum size of up to 200 square feet, as the first three were 80 feet by 80 feet.\" He added that this permission was granted considering local soil and climatic conditions and the proximity of the petrol pump, as prescribed by BPCL. The terms and conditions stipulated that the size of the hoarding should be between 80 to 200 square feet.\n\nKhalid further mentioned that as per the office of CP GRP (Mumbai) dated December 2021, the responsibilities of the successful bidder include, condition number 8: \"You shall be solely responsible for the structural stability of the display board.

He attended to the complaint and wrote to the DGP office recommending that the hoarding be regularized as the hoarding company was contributing to police welfare, the chargesheet says.\n\nThe DGP office, however, wrote back to Shisve raising several issues with the authorisation as it did not follow norms of the 2016 policy formulated by the Maharashtra government on hoardings.\n\nThe letter further said there could be other ways of ensuring funds for police welfare. Shisve wrote back to DGP office clarifying the issues raised by the DGP office.

Ego Media, an advertising agency, had already put up three hoardings on the plot by then.\n\n\"Once Bhinde approached Khalid, he called the other party and told them that they do not have legal rights to erect hoarding there. After that, Bhinde put up the proposal for the fourth hoarding and Khalid cleared his proposal a couple of hours before he was transferred from the GRP commissioner,\" said the police officer.\n\nThe fourth hoarding, eventually erected by Ego Media, collapsed on the petrol pump on May 13 following a short spell of heavy, unseasonal rain and gusty winds. Seventeen people were killed, and several others were injured in the crash.\n\nEgo Media had applied for permission to erect three hoardings on the Ghatkopar plot in 2020. The GRP, under its then chief Ravindra Sengaonkar, granted permission, with the size of the hoardings stipulated at 40x40 feet and a tenure of 10 years, as per the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation's (BMC's) norms.\n\nIn July 2022, Bhinde allegedly approached Khalid, who had become the GRP commissioner by then, with a request to increase the size of the three hoardings to 80x80 feet and the length of the tenure from 10 to 30 years. Bhinde also sought permission for a fourth hoarding, for which a tender was not issued. Khalid allegedly approved the application in December 2022.\n\nKhalid, in his statement to the SIT on July 11, claimed he was unaware that the tender for the fourth hoarding, sized 140x120 feet, was not issued. He thought all four hoardings were part of one project, out of which three had already been erected. He said he gave permission thinking the money could be used for police welfare, according to an officer.\n\nAlso part of the charge sheet is the statement of Arshad Khan, the alleged business partner of Khalid's wife. He received at least \u20b955 lakh from Ego Media, according to the police. Khan had taken blank cheques, some of which were post-dated, from the company and withdrew the money by depositing cheques in dozens of people's bank accounts. During the investigation, the police found 22 transactions since 2022, added officials.\n\nKhan told the SIT he was dealing with Bhinde in his personal capacity. He added that he had provided labourers and technicians for electrical, welding, and other work for the hoarding, which was why he received payment from Ego Media. The firm made the payments to people who worked with Khan, said the officer.\n\nThe police have so far arrested four people in connection with the incident: Bhinde; Jahnavi Marathe, the former director of Ego Media; Manoj Sanghu, a BMC-approved civil engineer who had issued a stability certificate for the hoarding despite knowing it exceeded permissible limits; and Sagar Kumbhar, the contractor who erected the hoarding. Sanghu got bail, while the other three are in judicial custody.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoarding", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hoarding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Billboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiberglass", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fiberglass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventeen_(American_magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seventeen (American magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filling_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Filling station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advertising agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brihanmumbai_Municipal_Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheque", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cheque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghatkopar", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ghatkopar"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ghatkopar"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arshad_Khan_(Pakistani_cricketer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arshad Khan (Pakistani cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welding", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Welding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_engineer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil engineer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2024/07/16/1600x900/The-hoarding--eventually-erected-by-Ego-Media--col_1721156694070.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9741806", "eventUri": "eng-9741806", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-05-13", "textStart": 655, "textEnd": 661}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-11", "textStart": 1522, "textEnd": 1529}], "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

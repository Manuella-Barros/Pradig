This was also the goal during the Lok Sabha elections, but the turnout only reached 53.90% at that time. \"While we did not reach the 75% target, I was very much satisfied with the efforts of our officers. The public too should come of their houses to vote. However, the turnout was over 25,000 more than in the previous elections, which is a positive sign,\" said Itankar.\n\nAdditionally, the district has also seen a notable increase in polling infrastructure apart from in slums and societies. There were 4,474 polling centres earlier, which have now grown to 4,610 with the addition of 136 new polling stations. This was done under the Special Summary Review Programme 2024.Itankar also emphasized upon the increase in voter base, with the total number of voters rising from 42.72 lakh during the Lok Sabha elections to 43.24 lakh, reflecting an addition of approximately 52,000 voters.\n\nThis is the first draft, published months after the district administration faced criticism over errors in the voting list during the April LS elections. A source from the district administration also shared that 14,259 names were deleted from the list as dead voters, whereas 16,605 voters have registered as first-time voters until now.Currently, there is a backlog of 67,260 pending Form No. 6, which are applications from new electors.\n\nThese applications are expected to be processed by August 30, with Kamptee having the highest number of pending forms at 14,397, while Nagpur West has the fewest, with 927 pending forms.Before the press meet, the collector also met representatives of political parties. Claims and objections can be submitted between August 6 and August 20, with a final decision anticipated by August 29. The updated voter list will be published on August 30.\n\nAdditionally, dates for special voter registration campaigns have been rescheduled to August 10, 11, 17, and 18.

He reviewed the status of Forms 06, 07, and 08, focusing on both accepted and rejected forms, and inquired about the reasons for form rejections on an assembly-wise basis. He emphasized that verification must be conducted for any rejected form, and forms should only be canceled for valid reasons.

He mandated regular meetings with booth level officers to review work progress and stressed that all tasks related to the voter revision program must be completed within the Election Commission of India's specified timeframe.\n\nDistrict Election Officer Ananya Mittal informed that, under the Commission's Inclusive Week initiative, a camp was organized to register voters from remote areas. Special campaigns were also conducted to register eligible citizens, including disabled individuals, senior voters aged 85 and above, transgenders and persons residing in night shelters or shelter homes. Instructions were issued to review polling stations with low voter turnout, correct the voter lists of those stations, and motivate voters to participate in elections.\n\nThe Divisional Commissioner, along with the District Election Officer, inspected various polling stations in the 49-Jamshedpur West Assembly Constituency. They reviewed the Assured Minimum Facilities (AMF) available at polling stations, inspecting locations such as Community Center Kagalnagar and Carmel Junior College in Sonari. During the tour of the area, they interacted with voters in Sonari and reviewed the progress of the voter list revision work.", "source": {"uri": "avenuemail.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Avenue Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polling_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Polling station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamshedpur", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jamshedpur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jamshedpur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisional_commissioner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Divisional commissioner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolhan_division", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kolhan division"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "District"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaibasa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chaibasa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chaibasa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Commission_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Election Commission of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Voter turnout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonari", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sonari"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sonari"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic_Participation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic Participation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://avenuemail.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/WhatsApp-Image-2024-08-07-at-16.54.59.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9798428", "eventUri": "eng-9798428", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 83, "textEnd": 91}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

Young black voters appear particularly inclined to vote Republican.\n\nAt first glance, this seems like a sea change in Americans' voting affinities. The last time Republicans did this well with black voters was in 1976. And given that black voters currently make up nearly a quarter of the Democratic base, a scenario in which nearly 20 percent of those voters defected to the other camp would be absolutely devastating to the vice president's electoral prospects.\n\nThe good news for Democrats is that even if the polls truly reflect the general sentiment of blacks in the United States, they are unlikely to accurately predict the final distribution of votes in November.\n\nTo clarify why the polls are unlikely to reflect the final vote margins for this particular subset of voters, it might be helpful to look at how things typically play out for third-party candidates.\n\nElections are decided by voters, not by those polled\n\nDuring the 2016 election cycle, Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson consistently polled around 9% of the vote. As the race tightened in the weeks leading up to the election, voters began to shift toward one of the more prominent candidates. However, in the week leading up to the vote, he was still projected to have over 6% of the vote. In the end, he polled just over 3%.\n\nIn 2020, Green Party candidate Howie Hawkins garnered 2% of the national vote six weeks before the election. He ultimately received about a quarter of 1% of the vote.\n\nIn the current cycle, Robert F Kennedy Jr. has been polling at over 10% of the vote for most of the campaign, and at his peak, more than double that. However, as the race has tightened (we are less than 90 days in) and after Joe Biden withdrew, Kennedy is now polling at around 4%. Ultimately, he would probably be lucky to get half that many votes in November.\n\nBottom line: Despite the fact that most Americans consistently express support for alternatives to both the Democratic and Republican candidates, third-party candidates consistently underperform in polls, even in cycles (like 2016) when unusually large numbers of voters dislike both major-party candidates.\n\nAmericans who are disgusted by both major party candidates often find other things to do on Tuesday afternoons.\n\nOne of the main reasons for this gap between polls and results is that elections are ultimately decided by who shows up to vote on Election Day. And Americans who are disgusted by both major party candidates often find better things to do on a Tuesday afternoon than line up at a polling place to vote for someone who has little chance of winning. And when these voters do show up to vote, it is often to hold their noses and vote for the one they perceive as the lesser of the two evils of the major parties, in order to deny victory to the candidate they prefer less. So, in the end, few Americans who express support for third-party candidates in polls actually show up to vote for them. Polls may accurately reflect Americans' preferences for third-party candidates, but they are not good predictors of voting behavior toward those candidates.\n\nA similar story applies to black support for Republicans.\n\nWhile polls this cycle have consistently shown that nearly one in five black Americans are willing to vote for Trump, they also show that most black voters could easily be swayed to vote for someone other than the one they currently lean toward. Most black voters are far less committed to their current candidate than other Americans, and about a third of them say they are unlikely to vote at all. This trend is also reflected in historical voting behavior: Black voters are more likely than most other Americans not to vote.\n\nBroadly speaking, Americans most likely to turn out on Election Day -- highly educated, relatively affluent, urban and suburban voters -- now tend to favor Democrats, even as less likely voters (younger, working-class, low-income, and/or less educated Americans, particularly those living in small towns and rural areas) have shifted to the right.\n\nHistorically, the dynamic has moved the other way. Democrats have taken advantage of high voter turnout and sought to expand access and participation, while Republicans have aggressively sought to reduce turnout by increasing voting restrictions, purging voter rolls, redistricting, and otherwise weakening the Voting Rights Act. However, as the Democratic Party has shifted its focus toward knowledge economy professionals, many other constituencies have shifted the other way. And because there are far more normie voters than token capitalists, high voter turnout has increasingly favored Republicans.\n\nThis matters because Republican polling gains among African Americans are concentrated more heavily among low-propensity-to-vote blocs (such as younger and less affluent or educated voters), and therefore the lower the overall voter turnout, the more we should expect to see Republicans underperform among black voters relative to the polls.\n\nIn 2020, the Republican Party won a larger share of the black vote than in previous cycles, but that was partly due to record turnout among nonwhite voters (while Democrats outperformed in subsequent special elections, which saw much lower overall turnout). Unfortunately for Trump, there are signs that turnout among African Americans this cycle may be significantly lower among the least likely voters. As a result, the share of the vote that Republicans ultimately receive in 2024 among black voters may end up being significantly lower than the polls suggest.\n\nThe bad news for Democrats is that Trump doesn't necessarily need to win around 20% of the black vote to keep Kamala out of the White House. If he were to narrowly surpass his numbers from last cycle, Democrats would find themselves on a very precarious path to victory unless they can make up for their losses with other voters in key states.\n\nBoth parties have alienated their core voters\n\nSince 2010, Democrats have consistently lost vote share among African Americans in every midterm and general election.\n\nAnd it wasn't just African-American voters who left the country, but also Hispanic Americans, religious minorities, and less affluent or less educated voters. The very populations that Democrats often see themselves as representing and defending. The very voters who were supposed to give Democrats an indefinite electoral majority.\n\nIt is actually quite difficult to maintain a coalition that is focused on knowledge economy professionals but also attractive to less advantaged Americans.\n\nThese defections had far-reaching consequences: They contributed to huge congressional losses between 2010 and 2014 and cost Democrats the White House in 2016 (black voter attrition helped swing states like Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Ohio, while Hispanic alienation helped swing Arizona, Texas and Florida Republican).\n\nMany thought that with Trump in the White House, minority voters would flock to the Democratic Party. Instead, the Republican Party maintained its lead among nonwhite voters in the 2018 midterm elections. Democratic gains in those elections were driven almost exclusively by shifts among highly educated, relatively affluent white people living in urban and suburban areas.\n\nIn 2020, Black voters in states like South Carolina helped save Biden's failed primary campaign. In response, the president promised to nominate a Black woman as his running mate if he won the Democratic nomination. After getting the vote, he ultimately settled on Harris.\n\nThe choice is striking because Harris was not popular with black voters in the primaries. She typically lagged not only behind Biden, but also Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and sometimes other contenders, consistently winning about 5 percent of the vote among African Americans.\n\nThis general sentiment seems to have carried over into the general election. While Harris' nomination was historic in that she was potentially the first Black, female, and/or Asian vice president, her appearance on the ticket generated little enthusiasm among these blocs of voters. Democrats ultimately won a smaller share of the Black and Asian vote in 2020 than they did in 2016 (all distinctions combined). Democrats were still able to pull off a narrow victory in the Electoral College, largely because white men (particularly moderates and self-described independents) drifted away from Donald Trump in 2020.\n\nThese trends continued in the 2022 midterms: Nonwhite people, including nonwhite women, turned to the GOP much more than white people (especially white men). And it seems likely that Democrats will see further attrition in 2024, even if it is less than current polls suggest.\n\nContrary to the optimistic narratives that circulated when Obama came to power, it is actually quite difficult to maintain a coalition that is centered on knowledge economy professionals but also attractive to less advantaged Americans.\n\nAs for the current Democratic electorate, while knowledge economy professionals have drifted away from Democrats since Biden's election, they appear poised to mobilize en masse for Harris. The record-breaking White Women: Answer the Call and White Dudes for Harris online events seem to be a strong indicator, as is the huge outpouring of support from Wall Street, Silicon Valley, and big law firms. The token professions appear to be 100% on coconut pills.\n\nBlacks, on the other hand, seem much less enthusiastic. And if Harris were to lean heavily on her race or gender to try to rally support, while that might appeal to knowledge-economy professionals (who are disproportionately white), it would risk further alienating nonwhite normie voters (who tend to prefer less identity-based and more issue-focused messages).\n\nThe big question for 2024 is whether Trump will continue to alienate whites at a rate equal to or greater than the Democrats who are driving out voters of color. The answer will likely determine control of the White House.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Voter turnout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Party_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Green Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howie_Hawkins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Howie Hawkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Special campaigns will be conducted on August 10, 11, 17, and 18 during public holidays to address the objections. Voters should verify whether their names are listed in the draft electoral roll, Diwase said. The final publication of the electoral roll will be on August 30, 2024.

These voters will be able to vote at another polling station within the same building. Political party representatives should inform voters about these changes.\n\nVoters with old MT series voter ID cards from outside the district, and those whose names are not in the district electoral roll, should participate in the special summary revision programme.

But polls can be deceiving\n\nThroughout the 2024 cycle, polling has suggested that Republicans are poised to do extraordinarily well with African Americans.\n\nEven with Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket, more than one out of five black voters say they support Donald Trump. Younger Black voters seem especially open to casting ballots for the Republican party.\n\nOn its face, this seems like a sea change in Americans' electoral affinities. The last time Republicans put up numbers anywhere near that level with Black voters was in 1976. And given that Black voters currently make up nearly one-quarter of the Democratic base, a scenario where more than 20% of these constituents defected to the other side would be absolutely devastating for the vice-president's electoral prospects.\n\nThe good news for Democrats is that, even if the polls have been genuinely capturing overall Black sentiment in the US, they are unlikely to be accurately predicting the final vote distribution in November.\n\nTo clarify why polls are unlikely to reflect the eventual vote margins for this particular subset of voters, it might be helpful to look at how things typically shake out for third-party candidates.\n\nDuring the 2016 electoral cycle, Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson consistently hovered around 9% of the vote in polling. As the race tightened in the weeks before the election, voters began defecting to one of the top ticket candidates. However, in the week before ballots were cast, he was still polling at more than 6%. Ultimately, he ended up with just over 3%.\n\nIn the 2020 cycle, Green party candidate Howie Hawkins polled at 2% of the national vote six weeks before the election. He ultimately secured roughly one-quarter of 1% of ballots.\n\nIn the current cycle, Robert F Kennedy Jr polled above 10% for most of the race and, at his high point, was more than double that. However, as the race has tightened (we're less than 90 days out), and after Joe Biden dropped out, Kennedy is now polling around 4%. In the end, he'd probably be lucky to get half that many votes in November.\n\nIn short: despite most Americans consistently expressing support for alternatives to the Democratic and Republican nominees, third-party candidates consistently underperform at the ballot box relative to their polling - even in cycles (like 2016) where unusually high numbers of voters dislike both major party candidates.\n\nOne of the primary causes of this gap between polling and outcomes is that contests are ultimately decided by who shows up to vote on election day. And Americans who are disgusted with both major-party nominees often find other things to do on a Tuesday afternoon than standing in line at a polling place to cast a ballot for someone who has little prospect of actually winning. And when these voters do show up at the ballot box, it's often to hold their nose and vote for whomever they perceive to be the lesser of the two major party evils, in order to deny victory to the candidate they least prefer. And so, in the end, few Americans who express support for third-party candidates in polls actually show up to vote for them. The polls may accurately capture Americans' preferences for third-party candidates, but they don't predict well voting behavior with respect to those candidates.\n\nA similar tale holds for Black support of Republicans.\n\nAlthough polls this cycle have consistently found that nearly one in five Black Americans are open to voting for Trump, they also show that most Black voters could be easily swayed to vote for someone other than who they're leaning towards at the moment, most Black voters have much weaker commitments to their current candidate of choice than other Americans, and roughly a third say they will probably not vote at all. This pattern in responses is also reflected in historical voting behavior: Black voters are more likely than most other Americans to sit elections out.\n\nAcross the board, the Americans who are most likely to show up on election day - highly-educated, relatively affluent, urban and suburban voters - now tend to favor Democrats, even as lower-propensity voters (younger, working class and low-income, and/or less educated Americans, especially those who live in small towns and rural areas) have been shifting to the right.\n\nHistorically, the dynamic has gone the other way. Democrats benefitted from high turnout and sought to expand access and participation while Republicans aggressively sought to suppress turnout by increasing voting restrictions, purging voter rolls, gerrymandering districts and otherwise undermining the Voting Rights Act. However, as the Democratic party was reoriented around knowledge economy professionals, many other constituencies swung in the other direction. And because there are far more \"normie\" voters than there are symbolic capitalists, high turnout increasingly came to favor Republicans instead.\n\nThis matters because Republicans' polling gains among African Americans are concentrated most heavily among lower-propensity voting blocs (such as younger and less affluent or educated constituents) and, as a consequence, the lower overall electoral turnout is, the more we should expect to see Republicans underperform among black voters relative to the polls.\n\nIn 2020, the GOP got a bigger share of the black vote than in previous cycles, but this was in part because of record turnout among non-white voters (whereas Democrats overperformed in subsequent special elections that had much lower overall turnout). Unfortunately for Trump, there are signs that African American turnout this cycle may be significantly lower among lower-propensity voters. Consequently, the vote share Republicans ultimately receive in 2024 among black voters may end up being significantly lower than the polling suggests.\n\nThe bad news for Democrats is that Trump doesn't necessarily need to get around 20% of the black vote to freeze Kamala out of the White House. If he's to even marginally exceed his numbers from last cycle, Democrats would be left with a highly precarious path to victory unless they can make up the losses with other constituents in swing states.\n\nSince 2010, Democrats had been consistently losing vote share among African Americans in every midterm and general election.\n\nAnd it wasn't just African American voters who were leaving, but also Hispanic Americans, religious minorities, and less affluent or educated voters. The very populations that Democrats often fancy themselves as representatives of and advocates for. The very constituents that were supposed to ensure Democrats an indefinite electoral majority.\n\nThese defections were highly consequential: they contributed to enormous congressional wipeouts from 2010 to 2014 and cost Democrats the White House in 2016 (as Black voter attrition helped flip states including Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Ohio, even as Hispanic alienation helped tilt Arizona, Texas and Florida toward the Republicans).\n\nMany assumed that with Trump in the White House, minority voters would come flocking back to the Democratic party. Instead, the GOP held their margins with non-white voters in the 2018 midterms. Democratic gains in that election were near-exclusively due to shifts among highly-educated, relatively affluent, urban and suburban white people.\n\nIn 2020, Black voters in states such as South Carolina helped save Biden's floundering primary election campaign. In response, the president vowed to appoint a Black woman as his running mate should he win the Democratic nomination. Upon securing the vote, he ultimately settled on Harris.\n\nThis choice was striking because Harris was not popular with Black voters during the primary. She typically trailed behind not just Biden, but also Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and sometimes other competitors as well - consistently polling about 5% with African Americans.\n\nThat general sentiment seems to have continued through to the general election. Although Harris's nomination was historic in virtue of her being potentially the first Black, female and/or Asian vice-president, her appearance on the ticket generated little enthusiasm among any of these voter blocs. Democrats ultimately got a smaller share of the black vote and the Asian vote in 2020 as compared with 2016 (across gender lines). Democrats were able to nonetheless carve out a narrow electoral college win primarily because white men (especially self-identified \"moderates\" and \"independents\") shifted away from Donald Trump in 2020.\n\nThese patterns continued through the 2022 midterm elections: non-white people, including non-white women, shifted much further towards the GOP than white people (especially white men). And it seems likely that Democrats will see further attrition in 2024, even if it's less than current polling suggests.\n\nContrary to optimistic narratives that circulated as Obama was ushered into office, it's actually quite difficult to hold together a coalition that is centered around knowledge economy professionals but attractive to less advantaged Americans as well.\n\nWith respect to the Democratic party's current core constituency, although knowledge economy professionals have been straying from the Democrats since the election of Biden, they seem poised to turn out in force for Harris. The record-breaking \"White Women: Answer the Call\" and \"White Dudes for Harris\" online events seem like a strong indicator - as does the huge outpouring of support from Wall Street, Silicon Valley and big law. The symbolic professions seem to be 100% coconut-pilled.\n\nBlack people, on the other hand, seem much less enthusiastic. And should Harris lean heavily into her race or gender in an attempt to rally support - although this might be appealing to (disproportionately white) knowledge economy professionals - it would likely alienate non-white \"normie\" voters even more (who tend to prefer messages that are less identitarian and more focused on bread and butter issues).\n\nThe big question for 2024 is whether or not Trump will continue to alienate white people at an equal or greater clip as Democrats are driving away voters of color. The answer will likely determine control of the White House.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Voter turnout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Party_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Green Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howie_Hawkins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Howie Hawkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Praveen, later, got employed at a call centre. He and Sharmila, who was a BBA graduate from Jalladianpettai and belonging to other backward castes, fell in love. Since the parents of the girl were opposed to the marriage owing to their caste differences, Sharmila and Praveen had a self-respect marriage which they later got registered duly. Praveen brought her to his house and they started living there.\n\nOn noticing Praveen walking alone near a Tasmac outlet in Pallikaranai on February 23, Sharmila's brother Dinesh and four of his friends, waylaid him and hacked him to death using knives. The Pallikaranai police registered a case in connection with the murder and arrested Dinesh, 24, and his associates -- Sriram, 18, Jothlingam, 25, Vishnuraj, 25, and Stephankumar, 24.\n\nSubsequently, Sharmila demanded that her parents and another brother be also arrested, since they were responsible as well, for the murder of her husband. Under such circumstances, on April 14, Sharmila attempted to end her life. She was admitted to a private hospital in Pallikaranai and later referred to Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital where she died without responding to the treatment on Monday night.\n\nG. Chitra, Praveen's mother, in a written complaint to the Tambaram Police Commissioner, alleged that her daughter-in law Sharmila attempted to end her life, because the police failed to add her parents' and her elder brother's names to the charge-sheet. She also alleged that the police were supporting Sharmila's family and that it caused great distress to Sharmila.\n\nHowever, the police have denied the allegations.

He married Sharmila who belonged to the other backward caste, after they fell in love with each other, despite opposition from the latter's family. The couple lived at Praveen's parental house in Pallikaranai for a couple of months.\n\nOn February 23, Sharmila's brother Dinesh, 24, and four of his acquaintances allegedly hacked Praveen to death.\n\nBased on a complaint from Sharmila, the Pallikaranai police registered a case, and Dinesh and the four others. Sharmila demanded that her parents and another brother be arrested citing their involvement.\n\nUnder such circumstances, Sharmila attempted to end her life, following which she was admitted to the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital, where she died on Monday.\n\nIn a written complaint to Tambaram Police Commissioner, Praveen's mother alleged that Sharmila took the extreme step after the police failed to add her parents and elder brother's names in the chargesheet.\n\nSince the case involves the suicide of a woman within seven years of her marriage, the RDO and an Assistant Commissioner are conducting separate inquiries as per the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code.\n\n(Assistance for overcoming suicidal thoughts is available on the State's health helpline 104, Tele-MANAS 14416. and Sneha's suicide prevention helpline 044-24640050.)\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallikaranai", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pallikaranai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pallikaranai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_Backward_Class", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Other Backward Class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honor_killing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Honor killing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dalit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_Criminal_Procedure_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Code of Criminal Procedure (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suicide prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_commissioner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police commissioner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chargesheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chargesheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tambaram", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tambaram"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tambaram"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://th-i.thgim.com/public/news/cities/chennai/4wvter/article68107308.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/WhatsApp%20Image%202024-04-25%20at%2021.45.45.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505408", "eventUri": "eng-9505408", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-02-23", "textStart": 584, "textEnd": 595}], "sentiment": -0.3490196078431372, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

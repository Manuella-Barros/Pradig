Cannon drew the assignment in June 2023 to oversee former President Donald Trump's classified documents case, two more experienced colleagues on the federal bench in Florida urged her to pass it up and hand it off to another jurist, according to two people briefed on the conversations.\n\nThe judges who approached Cannon -- including the chief judge in the Southern District of Florida, Cecilia M. Altonaga -- each asked her to consider whether it would be better if she were to decline the high-profile case, allowing it to go to another judge, the two people said.\n\nBut Cannon, who was appointed by Trump, wanted to keep the case and refused the judges' entreaties. Her assignment raised eyebrows because she has scant trial experience and had previously shown unusual favor to Trump by intervening in a way that helped him in the criminal investigation that led to his indictment, only to be reversed in a critical rebuke by a conservative appeals court panel.\n\nThe extraordinary and previously undisclosed effort by Cannon's colleagues to persuade her to step aside adds another dimension to the increasing criticism of how she has gone on to handle the case.\n\nShe has broken, according to lawyers who operate there, with a general practice of federal judges in the Southern District of Florida of delegating some pretrial motions to a magistrate -- in this instance, Judge Bruce E. Reinhart. While he is subordinate to her, Reinhart is an older and much more experienced jurist. In 2022, he was the one who signed off on an FBI warrant to search Mar-a-Lago, Trump's club and residence in Florida, for highly sensitive government files that Trump kept after leaving office.\n\nSince then, Cannon has exhibited hostility to prosecutors, handled pretrial motions slowly and indefinitely postponed the trial, declining to set a date for it to begin, even though both the prosecution and the defense had told her they could be ready to start this summer.\n\nBut Trump's lawyers have also urged her to delay any trial until after the election, and her handling of the case has virtually ensured that they will succeed in that strategy. Should Trump retake the White House, he could order the Justice Department to drop the case.\n\nAs Cannon's handling of the case has come under intensifying scrutiny, her critics have suggested that she could be in over her head, in the tank for Trump -- or both.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, word of the early efforts by her colleagues on the bench to persuade her to step aside -- and the significance of her decision not to do so -- has spread among other federal judges and the people who know them.\n\nNeither Cannon nor Altonaga directly responded to requests for comment, including by emails sent via the clerk of the district court, Angela E. Noble. Noble later wrote in an email, \"Our judges do not comment on pending cases.\"\n\nIt is routine for novice judges to look to more experienced jurists for informal advice or mentoring as they learn to perform their new roles. And as the district's chief, Altonaga has a formal role in administering the federal judiciary in South Florida.\n\nBut ultimately, Cannon is not subject to the authority of her district court elders. Like any Senate-confirmed, presidentially appointed judge, she has a life tenure and independent standing and is free to choose to ignore any such advice.\n\nThe two people who discussed the efforts to persuade her to hand off the case spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the matter. Each had been told about it by different federal judges in the Southern District of Florida, including Altonaga.\n\nNeither of the people identified the second federal judge in Florida who had reached out to Cannon. One of the people confirmed the effort to persuade Cannon to step aside but did not describe the details of the conversations the two judges had with her. The other person offered more details.\n\nThis person said each outreach took place by telephone. The first judge to call Cannon, this person said, suggested to her that it would be better for the case to be handled by a jurist based closer to the district's busiest courthouse in Miami, where the grand jury that indicted Trump had sat.\n\nThe Miami courthouse also had a secure facility approved to hold the sort of highly classified information that would be discussed in pretrial motions and used as evidence in the case. Cannon is the sole judge in the federal courthouse in Fort Pierce, a two-hour drive north of Miami. When she was assigned to the case, the courthouse in Fort Pierce did not have a secure facility.\n\nBecause Cannon kept the case, taxpayers have since had to pay to build a secure room -- known as a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, or SCIF -- there.\n\nAfter that initial argument failed to sway Cannon to step aside, the person said, Altonaga placed a call.\n\nThe chief judge -- an appointee of President George W. Bush -- is said to have made a more pointed argument: It would be bad optics for Cannon to oversee the trial because of what had happened during the criminal investigation that led to Trump's indictment on charges of illegally retaining national security documents after leaving office and obstructing government efforts to retrieve them.\n\nIn August 2022, the FBI obtained a search warrant from Reinhart to go to Mar-a-Lago to hunt for any remaining classified documents that Trump had failed to turn over after receiving a subpoena for them.\n\nThe agents found thousands of government files that Trump had kept, even though under the Presidential Records Act, they should have gone to the National Archives when he left office. The files the FBI recovered included more than 100 marked as classified, including some at the most highly restricted level.\n\nSoon after the search, Trump filed a lawsuit against the government protesting the seizure of the materials, which he claimed were his personal property, and asking for a special master to be appointed to sift through them. Rather than letting Reinhart handle that lawsuit, as would be the normal procedure, Cannon chose to decide the matter.\n\nShocking legal experts across ideological lines, she banned investigators from gaining access to the evidence and appointed a special master, although she said that person would only make recommendations to her and she would make the final decisions.\n\nCannon's decision was unusual in part because she intervened before there were any charges -- treating Trump differently from typical targets of search warrants based on his supposed special status as a former president.\n\nShe also directed the special master to consider whether some of the seized files should be permanently kept from investigators under executive privilege, a notion that was widely seen as dubious since it has never successfully been made in a criminal case.\n\nProsecutors appealed to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in Atlanta. In a repudiation, a three-judge panel that included two Trump appointees reversed her order and ruled that she never had legal authority to intervene in the first place.\n\n\"It is indeed extraordinary for a warrant to be executed at the home of a former president -- but not in a way that affects our legal analysis or otherwise gives the judiciary license to interfere in an ongoing investigation,\" the panel wrote.\n\nLimits on when courts can interfere with a criminal investigation \"apply no matter who the government is investigating,\" it added. \"To create a special exception here would defy our nation's foundational principle that our law applies 'to all, without regard to numbers, wealth or rank.'\"\n\nTrump's lawyers appealed to the Supreme Court, but it declined to hear the case. In December 2022, Cannon dismissed Trump's lawsuit.\n\nSix months later, the grand jury in Miami indicted Trump, alleging in detail how he had stored highly sensitive documents in a bathroom and on a stage at Mar-a-Lago and persistently led his aides and lawyers to stymie efforts by the Justice Department and the National Archives to recover them.\n\nUnder the district's standard practices, according to its clerk, the new case went into a system that would randomly assign it to one of a handful of judges whose chambers are in the West Palm Beach division, which covers Mar-a-Lago, or in either of its two adjoining divisions, Fort Pierce and Fort Lauderdale.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Her intervention was subsequently reversed by a conservative appeals court.\n\nLawyers who work in the Southern District of Florida have said that Cannon has broken with general practice to delegate some pretrial motions to a magistrate, according to The Times. In this case, that would be Judge Bruce Reinhart, who's subordinate to Cannon but has more experience. Reinhart signed off on the 2022 FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago to recover classified documents from Trump's residence and private club.\n\nCannon has since appeared combative against prosecutors, been slow to take care of pretrial motions, and put the trial on hold despite that both sides said they could be ready to begin proceedings this summer.\n\nHowever, the Trump legal team has also pushed her to postpone the trial until after the election in November, and the way she has handled the case appears to have made it highly likely that they will be successful. If he becomes president again, Trump could order the Department of Justice to end the case.\n\nThe clerk of the district court told The Times that judges don't comment on pending cases.\n\nCritics have argued that Cannon may have taken on more than she can handle, that she is supportive of Trump, or both.\n\nAs a judge appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, Cannon has life tenure and does not have to take on the advice of more experienced jurists.\n\nThe second judge who spoke to Cannon was not identified by the sources who spoke to The Times about the efforts to get Cannon to hand over the case. One of the sources said the initial judge to reach out to Cannon did so over the phone, telling her that it would be better for a jurist based closer to the district's Miami courthouse to take charge of the case. The grand jury that indicted Trump was based in the city.\n\nThe Miami courthouse had a facility to house classified documents at the time. Judge Cannon is the only federal judge in the courthouse in Fort Pierce, about two hours north of Miami, which didn't have a classified documents facility when the case was assigned to her. A Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, or SCIF, has since been constructed there.\n\nAltonaga called Cannon after the first conversation failed to persuade her to hand over the case. The George W Bush nominee reportedly told Cannon that it would look bad for her to be in charge of the trial because of what occurred during the investigation that prompted Trump's indictment. The former president was charged with unlawfully holding on to national security information after leaving the White House and obstructing the government's attempts to get the documents back.\n\nDuring the 2022 FBI search of Mar-a-Lago, agents found thousands of files, including more than 100 marked classified. Trump then filed a lawsuit pushing back against the confiscation of the documents, which he argued were private property. He asked for a special master to be appointed to review the materials.\n\nNormal procedure would have been to allow Reinhart to rule on the lawsuit, but Cannon chose to handle it herself. To the surprise of legal observers on the left and right, she stopped investigators from seeing the evidence and appointed a special master, however adding that the special master would only make recommendations to her.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_Southern_District_of_Florida", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(legal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Motion (legal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indictment of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aileen_Cannon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aileen Cannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magistrate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Magistrate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitive_compartmented_information_facility", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sensitive compartmented information facility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jurist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI_search_of_Mar-a-Lago", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FBI search of Mar-a-Lago"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_master", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Special master"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George W.

Trump nominated her for the lifetime appointment in May 2020, even though she had never served as a judge. Of the 224 cases she's been assigned, only four have gone to trial, and all four concerned routine matters, taking up a total of 14 trial days, the Times reported when she was assigned to the incredibly high-profile case.\n\nTwo people familiar with the efforts to persuade Cannon to step down shared the details with the Times under the condition of anonymity.\n\nThe chief judge involved in those efforts, Cecilia Altonaga, reportedly first called Cannon to say it would be better to hand the case off to a judge in Miami, where there was already a secure facility designed to hold the highly classified documents in the case. Cannon refused Altonaga's initial proposal, the Times reported, and taxpayers have had to pay for construction of a secure room at her courthouse in Fort Pierce.\n\nAltonaga then reportedly placed another call to an unnamed person to raise concerns about the optics of Cannon overseeing the case. According to the Times, she pointed out Cannon's highly scrutinized actions leading up to Trump's indictment, which came about after the FBI served a search warrant at Trump's Mar-a-Lago property in 2022 to retrieve highly classified documents he'd taken from the White House and then refused to turn over.\n\nTrump filed a lawsuit shortly after the search, asserting that the documents were his personal property. Under typical procedure, Judge Bruce Reinhart, who signed off on the FBI search, would handle the matter. But Cannon, who's position is superior to Reinhart's, despite his years of experience, intervened to take on the lawsuit herself.\n\nCannon then proceeded to bar investigators from access to the evidence in the case, shocking legal experts who viewed the decision as giving special treatment to Trump.

She has come under fire for several unorthodox decisions viewed as favorable to Trump, including a ruling earlier this month allowing partisan representatives with no involvement in the case to argue in Trump's defense at a hearing Friday.\n\nShe has also declined to set a date for the trial and has postponed it indefinitely, even though prosecutors and Trump's defense team have both said they'll be ready to start proceedings this summer. It's now unlikely the relatively straightforward case will go to trial before the November election, in which Trump is expected to be the GOP nominee for president.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_judge_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief judge (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aileen_Cannon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aileen Cannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecilia_Altonaga", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cecilia Altonaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indictment of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courthouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Courthouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_warrant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Search warrant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Pierce,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fort Pierce, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fort Pierce, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HuffPost", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "HuffPost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_Southern_District_of_Florida", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bar (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Judiciary"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Supplies", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Healthcare/Case_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Healthcare/Case Management", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Homemade", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Homemade", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/dbc39d73b1e4c8eb4ba63d5f4c50e3d2", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668809", "eventUri": "eng-9668809", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-05-", "textStart": 502, "textEnd": 510}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

Cannon drew the assignment in June 2023 to oversee former President Donald Trump's classified documents case, two more experienced colleagues on the federal bench in Florida urged her to pass it up and hand it off to another jurist, according to two people briefed on the conversations.\n\nThe judges who approached Cannon -- including the chief judge in the Southern District of Florida, Cecilia M. Altonaga -- each asked her to consider whether it would be better if she were to decline the high-profile case, allowing it to go to another judge, the two people said.\n\nBut Cannon, who was appointed by Trump, wanted to keep the case and refused the judges' entreaties. Her assignment raised eyebrows because she has scant trial experience and had previously shown unusual favor to Trump by intervening in a way that helped him in the criminal investigation that led to his indictment, only to be reversed in a critical rebuke by a conservative appeals court panel.\n\nThe extraordinary and previously undisclosed effort by Cannon's colleagues to persuade her to step aside adds another dimension to the increasing criticism of how she has gone on to handle the case.\n\nShe has broken, according to lawyers who operate there, with a general practice of federal judges in the Southern District of Florida of delegating some pretrial motions to a magistrate -- in this instance, Judge Bruce E. Reinhart. While he is subordinate to her, Reinhart is an older and much more experienced jurist. In 2022, he was the one who signed off on an FBI warrant to search Mar-a-Lago, Trump's club and residence in Florida, for highly sensitive government files that Trump kept after leaving office.\n\nSince then, Cannon has exhibited hostility to prosecutors, handled pretrial motions slowly and indefinitely postponed the trial, declining to set a date for it to begin, even though both the prosecution and the defense had told her they could be ready to start this summer.\n\nBut Trump's lawyers have also urged her to delay any trial until after the election, and her handling of the case has virtually ensured that they will succeed in that strategy. Should Trump retake the White House, he could order the Justice Department to drop the case.\n\nAs Cannon's handling of the case has come under intensifying scrutiny, her critics have suggested that she could be in over her head, in the tank for Trump -- or both.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, word of the early efforts by her colleagues on the bench to persuade her to step aside -- and the significance of her decision not to do so -- has spread among other federal judges and the people who know them.\n\nNeither Cannon nor Altonaga directly responded to requests for comment, including by emails sent via the clerk of the district court, Angela E. Noble. Noble later wrote in an email, \"Our judges do not comment on pending cases.\"\n\nIt is routine for novice judges to look to more experienced jurists for informal advice or mentoring as they learn to perform their new roles. And as the district's chief, Altonaga has a formal role in administering the federal judiciary in South Florida.\n\nBut ultimately, Cannon is not subject to the authority of her district court elders. Like any Senate-confirmed, presidentially appointed judge, she has a life tenure and independent standing and is free to choose to ignore any such advice.\n\nThe two people who discussed the efforts to persuade her to hand off the case spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the matter. Each had been told about it by different federal judges in the Southern District of Florida, including Altonaga.\n\nNeither of the people identified the second federal judge in Florida who had reached out to Cannon. One of the people confirmed the effort to persuade Cannon to step aside but did not describe the details of the conversations the two judges had with her. The other person offered more details.\n\nThis person said each outreach took place by telephone. The first judge to call Cannon, this person said, suggested to her that it would be better for the case to be handled by a jurist based closer to the district's busiest courthouse in Miami, where the grand jury that indicted Trump had sat.\n\nThe Miami courthouse also had a secure facility approved to hold the sort of highly classified information that would be discussed in pretrial motions and used as evidence in the case. Cannon is the sole judge in the federal courthouse in Fort Pierce, a two-hour drive north of Miami. When she was assigned to the case, the courthouse in Fort Pierce did not have a secure facility.\n\nBecause Cannon kept the case, taxpayers have since had to pay to build a secure room -- known as a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, or SCIF -- there.\n\nAfter that initial argument failed to sway Cannon to step aside, the person said, Altonaga placed a call.\n\nThe chief judge -- an appointee of President George W. Bush -- is said to have made a more pointed argument: It would be bad optics for Cannon to oversee the trial because of what had happened during the criminal investigation that led to Trump's indictment on charges of illegally retaining national security documents after leaving office and obstructing government efforts to retrieve them.\n\nIn August 2022, the FBI obtained a search warrant from Reinhart to go to Mar-a-Lago to hunt for any remaining classified documents that Trump had failed to turn over after receiving a subpoena for them.\n\nThe agents found thousands of government files that Trump had kept, even though under the Presidential Records Act, they should have gone to the National Archives when he left office. The files the FBI recovered included more than 100 marked as classified, including some at the most highly restricted level.\n\nSoon after the search, Trump filed a lawsuit against the government protesting the seizure of the materials, which he claimed were his personal property, and asking for a special master to be appointed to sift through them. Rather than letting Reinhart handle that lawsuit, as would be the normal procedure, Cannon chose to decide the matter.\n\nShocking legal experts across ideological lines, she banned investigators from gaining access to the evidence and appointed a special master, although she said that person would only make recommendations to her and she would make the final decisions.\n\nCannon's decision was unusual in part because she intervened before there were any charges -- treating Trump differently from typical targets of search warrants based on his supposed special status as a former president.\n\nShe also directed the special master to consider whether some of the seized files should be permanently kept from investigators under executive privilege, a notion that was widely seen as dubious since it has never successfully been made in a criminal case.\n\nProsecutors appealed to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in Atlanta. In a repudiation, a three-judge panel that included two Trump appointees reversed her order and ruled that she never had legal authority to intervene in the first place.\n\n\"It is indeed extraordinary for a warrant to be executed at the home of a former president -- but not in a way that affects our legal analysis or otherwise gives the judiciary license to interfere in an ongoing investigation,\" the panel wrote.\n\nLimits on when courts can interfere with a criminal investigation \"apply no matter who the government is investigating,\" it added. \"To create a special exception here would defy our nation's foundational principle that our law applies 'to all, without regard to numbers, wealth or rank.'\"\n\nTrump's lawyers appealed to the Supreme Court, but it declined to hear the case. In December 2022, Cannon dismissed Trump's lawsuit.\n\nSix months later, the grand jury in Miami indicted Trump, alleging in detail how he had stored highly sensitive documents in a bathroom and on a stage at Mar-a-Lago and persistently led his aides and lawyers to stymie efforts by the Justice Department and the National Archives to recover them.\n\nUnder the district's standard practices, according to its clerk, the new case went into a system that would randomly assign it to one of a handful of judges whose chambers are in the West Palm Beach division, which covers Mar-a-Lago, or in either of its two adjoining divisions, Fort Pierce and Fort Lauderdale.", "source": {"uri": "startribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Star Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_Southern_District_of_Florida", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(legal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Motion (legal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurist", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jurist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aileen_Cannon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aileen Cannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal judiciary of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courthouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Courthouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magistrate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Magistrate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitive_compartmented_information_facility", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sensitive compartmented information facility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_master", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Special master"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_tenure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Life tenure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Classified information in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Florida", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_judge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States federal judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Pierce,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fort Pierce, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fort Pierce, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_Records_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidential Records Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George W.

According to a report from The New York Times, the growing ethical questions could have been avoided had Cannon heeded the advice of senior judges in the Southern District of Florida, who counseled her to pass the case to a more experienced judge.\n\nAccording to the Times, when Cannon drew the case in 2023 two judges, including Chief Judge Cecilia M. Altonaga and a second unidentified judge, advised her against accepting the assignment. The unidentified judge told Cannon that her home courthouse in Fort Piece was a considerable distance from Miami, and lacked the secure facilities needed to store many of the classified evidentiary documents related to the case.\n\nAltonaga took a much more direct approach, reportedly telling Cannon that her oversight of the case would be compromised by past controversy relating to her treatment of Trump's legal issues. Specifically, Cannon's controversial 2022 decision to grant the former president's request for a \"special master\" to review the documents seized during the FBI's search of his Mar-a-Lago, a decision that delayed federal prosecutors' ability to review evidence. Cannon's decision was sharply rebuked by 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, who wrote in their decision that the unprecedented nature of Trump's case did not give \"the judiciary license to interfere in an ongoing investigation.\"\n\nCannon rejected the advice from the two senior judges and went ahead and took up the case.\n\nCannon was appointed to Florida's District Court by Trump in 2020. Before her appointment, Cannon worked as a corporate lawyer with little experience in criminal trials. She had never held a position as a judge.\n\nIn her oversight of the case, Cannon has made several decisions that have seemed to disproportionally favor the former president. Critically, Cannon ruled to indefinitely delay the start of the former president's trial, all but certainly pushing it back to after the November election. The judge has been accused of slow-walking major rulings and decisions and barred the Justice Department from using allegations that Trump showed classified documents to individuals unauthorized to use them as a basis for their indictment.\n\nThe discrepancy has gotten so blatant that close allies of the former president previously went so far as to describe Cannon to Rolling Stoneas a \"godsend\" to the former president and his campaign. Earlier this week, undercover audio recorded in March and provided exclusively to Rolling Stone showed Trump ally and adviser Roger Stone speculating that Cannon was poised to dismiss the case. She hasn't gone that far, but MAGA diehards aren't likely to have many complaints about how she's ruled.", "source": {"uri": "rollingstone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rolling Stone"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nikki_mccann_ramirez@rollingstone.com", "name": "Nikki McCann Ramirez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_judge_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief judge (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aileen_Cannon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aileen Cannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_Southern_District_of_Florida", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Stone", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roger Stone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_master", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Special master"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Eleventh_Circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_courts_of_appeals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States courts of appeals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rolling Stone"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Supplies", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Healthcare/Case_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Healthcare/Case Management", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Homemade", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Homemade", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Aileen-Cannon-case.jpg?crop=0px%2C53px%2C1798px%2C1014px&resize=1600%2C900", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668809", "eventUri": "eng-9668809", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

However, Judge Cannon, a Trump appointee, declined their requests and chose to retain the case.\n\nThe assignment of Judge Aileen M. Cannon to preside over former President Donald J. Trump's case has sparked interest due to her limited trial experience and perceived bias in favour of Mr. Trump.\n\nNew York Times reports that following her assignment in June 2023, two experienced fellow judges on the Florida federal bench reportedly encouraged her to recuse herself and reassign the case to another judge, according to individuals familiar with the matter.\n\nAccording to two individuals familiar with the matter, Judges Cecilia M. Altonaga, the Chief Judge of the Southern District of Florida, and another judge approached Judge Aileen M. Cannon, urging her to consider recusing herself from the high-profile case involving former President Donald J. Trump.\n\nThey suggested that it might be more appropriate for another judge to preside over the case. However, Judge Cannon, a Trump appointee, declined their requests and chose to retain the case.\n\nHer decision raised concerns due to her limited trial experience and a previous instance where she had ruled in favour of Trump, a decision that was later overturned by a conservative appeals court panel in a strongly worded rebuke.\n\nThe previously unknown attempt by Judge Cannon's colleagues to persuade her to recuse herself adds a new layer to the growing scrutiny surrounding her handling of the case. This development highlights the concerns within the judiciary regarding her ability to preside over the case impartially.\n\nThe report noted that Judge Cannon has departed from the typical practice in the Southern District of Florida, where federal judges often assign pretrial motions to a magistrate judge, such as Judge Bruce E. Reinhart, who has more experience and is subordinate to her.\n\nNotably, Judge Reinhart signed the FBI warrant to search Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump's residence, for sensitive government documents in 2022. Since then, Judge Cannon has demonstrated a slower pace in handling pretrial motions, has yet to set a trial date despite both parties' readiness, and has shown hostility towards prosecutors.\n\nThis has effectively delayed the trial, aligning with Mr. Trump's lawyers' strategy to postpone it until after the election. If Mr. Trump wins the presidency, he could potentially order the Justice Department to dismiss the case.\n\nDespite requests for comment, neither Judge Cannon nor Judge Altonaga directly responded. The clerk of the district court, Angela E. Noble, later stated via email, \"Our judges do not comment on pending cases,\" indicating that they will not provide any further information on the matter.\n\nThe two individuals familiar with the matter declined to name the second federal judge in Florida who approached Judge Cannon.\n\nOne of them confirmed that an effort was made to persuade Judge Cannon to recuse herself, but did not provide specific information about the conversations. The other individual provided more detailed information about the attempts to persuade Judge Cannon to step aside.\n\nAccording to reports, Chief Judge Altonaga, a appointee of former President George W. Bush, made a straightforward argument: It would be perceived as inappropriate for Judge Cannon to preside over the trial due to her previous involvement in the criminal investigation that resulted in Mr. Trump's indictment on charges related to mishandling national security documents and obstructing efforts to recover them.\n\nIn August 2022, the FBI obtained a search warrant from Judge Reinhart to search Mar-a-Lago for classified documents subpoenaed from Mr. Trump.\n\nThe search uncovered thousands of government files, including over 100 marked as classified, that should have been transferred to the National Archives upon his departure from office.\n\nMr. Trump subsequently filed a lawsuit contesting the seizure, claiming the materials were personal property, and requested a special master to review them. Departing from standard procedure, Judge Cannon took on the case instead of Judge Reinhart.\n\nHer decision to bar investigators from accessing the evidence and appoint a special master surprised legal experts across the ideological spectrum. Notably, Judge Cannon's intervention occurred before any charges were filed, affording Mr. Trump unusual treatment due to his former presidency.\n\nAdditionally, she instructed the special master to consider applying executive privilege to certain seized files, a notion widely viewed as dubious in a criminal case.\n\nProsecutors appealed to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, which overturned Judge Cannon's ruling.\n\nMr. Trump's legal team appealed to the Supreme Court, but it declined to hear the case.\n\nIn December 2022, Judge Cannon dismissed Mr. Trump's lawsuit, and six months later, a grand jury in Miami indicted him on charges related to mishandling sensitive documents at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFollowing standard procedures, the new case was assigned to Judge Cannon's court in the West Palm Beach division, which covers Mar-a-Lago.", "source": {"uri": "saharareporters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sahara Reporters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_disqualification", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Judicial disqualification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_Southern_District_of_Florida", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_judge_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief judge (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(legal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motion (legal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_magistrate_judge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States magistrate judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_privilege", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Executive privilege"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_master", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Special master"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Eleventh_Circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bar (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_and_seizure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Search and seizure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Archives_and_Records_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Archives and Records Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpoena", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Subpoena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George W.

So, it's not like there's a roadmap here that makes anything about this normal.\"\n\nRead Also: A criminologist explains why Judge Cannon must step away from Trump trial immediately\n\n\"It is quite normal for novice judges newly appointed to the bench, like Judge Cannon, to look to her colleagues or their colleagues who had many, many more years of experience being judges for advice and mentorship about how to do the job. And that is a, sort of, informal culture in federal courts -- probably state courts too -- mentoring and helping young judges sort of get their feet under them.\n\n\"And, so, this is certainly her rejecting that culture and going her own way.\"\n\nOn X, MSNBC host and analyst Katie Phang called the move \"Stunning the hubris ... resulting in repeated miscarriages of justice.\"\n\n\"Given how federal district courts function, this is an especially stunning piece,\" said MSNBC legal analyst Lisa Rubin.\n\nWhen she spoke on air, Rubin explained, \"The very fact that the conversations even existed is itself remarkable,\" speaking of the conversation between the judges.\n\nRubin cited Chief Judge Cecilia Altonaga, who clearly stated the reasons she thought Cannon should pass, according to the Times.\n\nParaphrasing, Rubin said, \"Given what happened after the initial search at Mar-a-Lago, and your own involvement and receptivity to a civil lawsuit from former President Trump challenging that search -- that's the case in which Judge Cannon appointed a special master slowing down the government's investigation. For several months. Only to be overturned, and very harshly, by the [conservative] 11th circuit.\"\n\nGiven all of that happened, the Times said Altonaga told Cannon, it might be better to step back. Cannon still refused.\n\n\"It gives some comfort, I guess, for lack of a better word, to people who have said all along that Judge Cannon's handling of this case has been somewhat awry and mysterious to know that two other judges also thought she might be out of her depth, if not biassed in her handling of the case,\" Rubin closed.\n\nFormer state and federal prosecutor Glenn Kirschner posted comments about Cannon mere hours before the story dropped.\n\n\"The federal law requires a judge to recuse from a case if 'her impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\" (28 USC 455),\" he wrote on X.\n\nHe quoted retired Judge Shira Scheindlin, who found the constant delays in the case to be the biggest standout. \"The second thing that stands out to me is what appears to me to be her dislike of the government and her favoritism toward the defense.\"\n\n\"Instead, Cannon will have to be removed from the case. And the bench. So far she's proved she barely knows where the court building is,\" former MSNBC host Keith Olbermann.\n\nPolitical scientist Norman Ornstein called Cannon \"even more corrupt than we thought.\"", "source": {"uri": "rawstory.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Raw Story"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sarah_k_burris@rawstory.com", "name": "Sarah K.

Trump has pleaded not guilty to all charges, maintains his innocence and has accused Smith of targeting him for political purposes. Cannon, a Trump appointee, has faced criticism over her handling of the case, as some legal experts view her rulings as too favorable to Trump.\n\nOn Thursday, the Times reported that two \"more experienced\" federal judges in Florida recommended that Cannon give the case to another judge after she was assigned to the case.\n\nOne of the judges suggested the case should be handled by a judge closer to Miami, where a courthouse had a secure facility that could hold the documents involved in the case. Chief Judge Cecilia M. Altonaga then told Cannon it would be bad optics for her to oversee the trial after her handling of the investigation of Mar-a-Lago, which sparked criticism from legal experts.\n\nHowever, Cannon declined to remove herself from the case.\n\nThe report was based on anonymous sources, and Newsweek could not independently verify it. The article sparked criticism from some legal experts.\n\nNewsweek reached out to Cannon through the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida for comment via email.\n\nFormer federal prosecutor Gene Rossi told Newsweek on Thursday that it is \"unheard of\" for judges to ask another judge to step back from a case.\n\nThere is nothing binding about the advice from those judges, but would only help Smith if he were to seek her removal from the case, he said, noting their recommendation was made \"before the multitude of decisions that appear to favor President Trump.\"\n\n\"It is abundantly clear that Judge Aileen has appeared to have lost all sense of objectivity in this matter,\" he said.\n\nFormer federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani told Newsweek that judges advising her to recuse herself is \"unusual,\" but noted, \"This is no usual judge and case.\"\n\n\"Judge Cannon was very inexperienced when she took the federal bench, and it shows. She has ruled for Trump at almost every possible turn and entertained some defense arguments that no other judge would.\"\n\nThe more experienced judges \"saw this coming,\" and it is \"not surprising\" they would have asked her to decline taking the case, he said.\n\nLegal and political experts responded to the report on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter.\n\n\"Stunning the hubris...resulting in repeated miscarriages of justice,\" posted MSNBC host and lawyer Katie Phang.\n\nPolitical scientist Norman Ornstein wrote, \"Aileen Cannon, even more corrupt than we thought.\"\n\n\"Further evidence of Aileen Cannon's determination to help Donald Trump escape justice in the open-and-shut documents case she oversees as a federal judge,\" wrote journalist John Harwood.\n\nDemocratic strategist Ally Sammarco wrote, \"Aileen Cannon needs to be removed from the documents case now.\"\n\nConservative attorney Julie Kelly defended Cannon, writing, \"I like her even more now. Chief judge in southern Florida--a GWB appointee--privately urged Judge Cannon to give the Trump documents case to another judge. She said no thank you.\"\n\nShe added, \"You now will see the same state media fluffers and 'legal experts' who insisted Juan Merchan shouldn't recuse despite his legit conflicts again call for Cannon's recusal. And I am sure the chief judge of the DC court never asked Judge Chutkan to recuse despite the numerous anti-Trump statements she made in court for J6 cases.\"\n\nJudge Altonaga, appointed to the bench by former President George W.

Her Fort Pierce courtroom, unlike federal court south in Miami, wasn't equipped with a secure facility for document handling.\n\nSenior judges encouraged Judge Aileen Cannon to step back after she was assigned the Trump classified documents case. She stayed on instead\n\n'Her critics have suggested that she could be in over her head, in the tank for Mr. Trump -- or both,' as the Times put it in its report, which relied on sources who relayed details of the entreaties, which came by phone.\n\nAmong those urging her to step back from the case were judge Cecilia M. Altonaga, chief judge of the Southern District of Florida, a George W. Bush appointee who is the first female Cuban American federal judge.\n\nProsecutors, led by special counsel Jack Smith, successfully got an Appeals Court panel to overturn her order that was preventing the government from using classified documents seized from the former president during its investigation. It agreed with the DOJ's contention that 'the district court likely erred in exercising its jurisdiction.'\n\nAmong those who have blasted her procedural decisions over the past year are lawyer George Conway, who last year announced his divorce from former Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway. He called Cannon 'she's uniquely incompetent but effective.'\n\nFederal judges such as Cannon make their own decisions on recusal or whether to relinquish a case.\n\nA year ago, experts identified the Florida case as the greatest threat to Trump. Now it is highly unlikely to see trial before the November election\n\nTrump has blasted the case, federal prosecutors, and FBI agents who searched Mar-a-Lago. If he were to be elected president, he could use his authority to try to shut down the case\n\nU.S. District Chief Judge Cecilia Maria Altonaga has been identified as asking Judge Cannon to decline to oversee the case\n\nCourt clashes and filings have grown increasingly heated, with Smith's team calling one Trump legal theory 'pure fiction,' and Cannon blasting Smith's prosecutors for demanding a speedy decision 'unprecedented and unjust.'\n\nThe information on the pressure from colleagues, which Cannon resisted, comes out after the classified documents case - once called the most serious legal threat facing Trump - has little chance of getting tried before Trump faces a jury.\n\nIn May, Cannon accused Smith of making a 'bad faith' request to impose a gag order on Trump following his claim that the FBI was authorized to shoot him during a search at Mar-a-Lago.

Those judges were reportedly concerned about Cannon's lack of criminal trial experience, the case involving extremely sensitive classified documents and the fact that Cannon's courthouse in Fort Pierce, Florida didn't have a Sensitive Compartmentalized Information Facility (also known as a SCIF) inside to safely store and review classified documents.\n\nThe Times cited an anonymous source who confirmed that two judges, including U.S. District Judge Cecilia Altonaga (who was appointed to her position by former President George W. Bush in 2003), asked Cannon to hand off the case to a more experienced judge. Altonaga and the other judge, who was not named in the report, suggested that the federal courthouse in Miami, which is just a two-hour drive from Fort Pierce, would be better suited for the case since it already had a SCIF. However, Cannon still refused to let go, forcing taxpayers to front the cost of building a SCIF in Fort Pierce.\n\nREAD MORE: 'Overwhelmed': Lawyers experienced with Judge Cannon say she's not equipped for Trump case\n\nIn a Thursday segment on MSNBC, legal analyst Lisa Rubin opined that the Times' report on Judge Cannon rebuffing calls from her colleagues to pass the case to a more experienced jurist was highly unusual and suggested that others on the federal bench shared Americans' concerns about Cannon being partial to the former president.\n\n\"[Judge Altonaga] mentioned what Judge Cannon's experience had been after the search [of Mar-a-Lago],\" Rubin said, noting that Cannon's decision to appoint a special master to review the documents seized in the FBI's raid on Trump's home was overturned by the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. \"It was on that basis that Judge Altonaga said to her, 'you've already kind of had a rough go of this .. maybe it's time to let someone else handle this.'\"\n\nRubin went on to say that the Times' unnamed source speaking to the leading national newspaper of record about judges' pleas to Cannon to step down from the case was \"almost as big as the news itself.\"\n\n\"The very fact that somebody is sharing this information with the Times is what our colleague Nicolle Wallace, would call a 'break-glass situation,'\" Rubin said. \"It is somebody who is literally saying to the American public, all of those concerns that you are hearing about Judge Cannon being out of her depth, in the tank for Donald Trump, or both, those are concerns that were shared by at least two of her colleagues on the bench and at least one very, very seasoned judge, the chief judge of the district, which depending on the district, is a position given by seniority.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Judge Cannon got so many complaints an appeals court cut them off\n\nCannon has indefinitely postponed the classified documents trial, which was initially scheduled for May 20, 2024. She cited a backlog of pre-trial motions she has yet to rule on as the reason for delay, and said that it could take until late July for her to finish her work in the pre-trial process.\n\nThe Mar-a-Lago case is considered the strongest of the two federal cases against the former president, due to the wealth of evidence the DOJ has. Trump is facing 37 felony counts in the case, which include charges of willful retention of national defense information, conspiracy to obstruct justice, withholding a document or record, corruptly concealing a document or record, concealing a document in a federal investigation, scheme to conceal and making false statements.\n\nClick here to read the Times' full report (subscription required).

Altonaga, suggested that Cannon decline to oversee the case brought by special counsel Jack Smith and allow another judge to govern the case instead, the Times wrote, citing two people briefed on the conversations.\n\nCannon is still overseeing the case, which has seen a multitude of delays and is not yet scheduled to go to trial.\n\nAltonaga's chambers declined to comment on the report to CNN. The Times did not identify the second judge who reportedly contacted Cannon.\n\nAt the time Cannon was assigned the high-profile criminal case, she had already faced public backlash - and a major reversal by an appeals court - over her handling of the lawsuit Trump brought challenging the FBI's search of his Mar-a-Lago residence in August 2022, when agents found hundreds of classified documents scattered about the property.\n\nSince then, Cannon has repeatedly raised eyebrows among legal scholars for her approach. Critics of the judge say that she has slowed the pace of the case to a near standstill, making a pre-election trial essentially out of reach.\n\nAttorneys who have practiced in front of Cannon have told CNN that she tends to allow irrelevant legal questions distract from core issues - including a longshot motion from the former president to invalidate Jack Smith's appointment as special counsel that she's scheduled to hear extensive arguments on in the coming days.\n\nThe attorneys who spoke to CNN also reported a zero-tolerance approach to any technical defects in filings, and a struggle with docket management that allows the type of pretrial disputes that other judges would decide in weeks go unresolved for months.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hannah_rabinowitz@cnn.com", "name": "Hannah Rabinowitz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aileen_Cannon", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aileen Cannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Smith_(lawyer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jack Smith (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Special counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Supplies", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Healthcare/Case_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Healthcare/Case Management", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Homemade", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Homemade", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/image002-20240605201136290.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668809", "eventUri": "eng-9668809", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

Cannon has been the source of fury and puzzlement among Trump critics after she issued rulings in the case that got overturned and failed to get it on track for trial before the November elections.\n\nTrump was indicted in June 2023 and charged with illegally retaining national security documents at his Florida club . Not long after the fact, two senior federal judges asked Cannon, who had been assigned the case, to step back, the New York Times reported Thursday, citing her limited trial experience and rulings that helped the defense.\n\nJudge Cannon was confirmed to the Senate in November 2020, weeks before Trump left office, and had limited experience in the complex area of national security law and classified documents. Her Fort Pierce courtroom, unlike federal court south in Miami, wasn't equipped with a secure facility for document handling. 'Her critics have suggested that she could be in over her head, in the tank for Mr. Trump -- or both,' as the Times put it in its report, which relied on sources who relayed details of the entreaties, which came by phone.\n\nAmong those urging her to step back from the case were judge Cecilia M. Altonaga, chief judge of the Southern District of Florida, a George W. Bush appointee who is the first female Cuban American federal judge.\n\nProsecutors, led by special counsel Jack Smith, successfully got an Appeals Court panel to overturn her order that was preventing the government from using classified documents seized from the former president during its investigation. It agreed with the DOJ's contention that 'the district court likely erred in exercising its jurisdiction.'\n\nAmong those who have blasted her procedural decisions over the past year are lawyer George Conway, who last year announced his divorce from former Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway . He called Cannon 'she's uniquely incompetent but effective.' Federal judges such as Cannon make their own decisions on recusal or whether to relinquish a case.\n\nCourt clashes and filings have grown increasingly heated, with Smith's team calling one Trump legal theory 'pure fiction,' and Cannon blasting Smith's prosecutors for demanding a speedy decision 'unprecedented and unjust.'\n\nThe information on the pressure from colleagues, which Cannon resisted, comes out after the classified documents case - once called the most serious legal threat facing Trump - has little chance of getting tried before Trump faces a jury.\n\nIn May, Cannon accused Smith of making a 'bad faith' request to impose a gag order on Trump following his claim that the FBI was authorized to shoot him during a search at Mar-a-Lago. She ruled against Smith, saying federal prosecutors didn't show 'professional courtesy' when they conferred with defense lawyers right before the start of the Memorial Day weekend. Also in May, she postponed the trial indefinitely. It had been scheduled to begin May 20th.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

She refused.\n\nIt was a year ago this month when Donald Trump's classified documents case was assigned to, of all people, U.S. District Court Judge Aileen Cannon, a controversial Trump appointee. According to a striking new report from The New York Times, two of the jurist's more experienced colleagues on the same court urged Cannon to hand the case off to someone else.\n\nAltonaga, it's worth noting for context, is a George W. Bush appointee.\n\nThe Times' report has not been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News, but if it's accurate, it's a rare and important peek behind the curtain.\n\nAccording to the Times, one judge called Cannon early on in the process, making a logistical argument for her handing off the case to a colleague: Cannon's courthouse is a two-hour drive from the courthouse in Miami, where the grand jury was located.\n\nWhen that didn't work, the local chief judge encouraged the jurist to pass on the case for optics reasons, given a related controversy from months earlier related to Cannon and the underlying Trump investigation, which left Cannon looking incompetent and biased.\n\nThis pitch didn't work, either.\n\nBy any fair measure, the judges who encouraged Cannon to do the responsible thing were offering sound advice. The Trump-appointed conservative really did lack the relevant experience to oversee such a case, and she really was on record leaving little doubt about her ideological pro-Trump disposition.\n\nWhat's more, we now know with the benefit of hindsight that those who urged Cannon to hand the case off to someone better suited to hear it were right. The Times' report added, \"Judge Cannon has exhibited hostility to prosecutors, handled pretrial motions slowly and indefinitely postponed the trial, declining to set a date for it to begin even though both the prosecution and the defense had told her they could be ready to start this summer.\"\n\nShe's also, incidentally, repeatedly given observers reason to question her competence, lent credence to questions that legal experts consider absurd, and justified procedural delays by pointing to logjams that she created.\n\nI'm reminded anew of an infamous quote attributed to Roy Cohn: \"Don't tell me what the law is, tell me who the judge is.\"", "source": {"uri": "msnbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MSNBC.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aileen_Cannon", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aileen Cannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurist", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jurist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George W.

In fact, the raid had been agreed with Trump's lawyers in advance and timed to take place when he would not be present.\n\nThe attempt to persuade Cannon to step aside was reportedly prompted by her actions after the FBI seized the documents - when she intervened on Trump's side after he had filed suit claiming they were his personal property, appointing a special master to review them before prosecutors had a chance to see them.\n\nThis ruling was later reversed by the 11th court of appeals in Atlanta, which issued a rebuke of Cannon's judgment, saying she had no authority to bar investigators from seeing the documents.\n\nThe argument that this episode was sufficient reason for Cannon to pass on the case was reportedly put forward by Cecilia Altonaga, the chief judge of Florida's southern district.\n\nAnother unnamed judge was said to have put a different line of reasoning to her - that it would be better to have the case transferred to a jurist based closer to the district's busiest courthouse in Miami, which had a facility to store the classified documents and where Trump had initially been indicted.\n\nSince Cannon rejected entreaties to defer the case to another judge, a secure facility to store the documents has since been built at taxpayers' expense in the courthouse where she presides at Fort Pierce, around two hours' drive north of Miami.",

And that is a, sort of, informal culture in federal courts -- probably state courts too -- mentoring and helping young judges sort of get their feet under them.\n\n\"And, so, this is certainly her rejecting that culture and going her own way.\"\n\nOn X, MSNBC host and analyst Katie Phang called the move \"Stunning the hubris ... resulting in repeated miscarriages of justice.\"\n\n\"Given how federal district courts function, this is an especially stunning piece,\" said MSNBC legal analyst Lisa Rubin.\n\nWhen she spoke on air, Rubin explained, \"The very fact that the conversations even existed is itself remarkable,\" speaking of the conversation between the judges.\n\nRubin cited Chief Judge Cecilia Altonaga, who clearly stated the reasons she thought Cannon should pass, according to the Times.\n\nParaphrasing, Rubin said, \"Given what happened after the initial search at Mar-a-Lago, and your own involvement and receptivity to a civil lawsuit from former President Trump challenging that search -- that's the case in which Judge Cannon appointed a special master slowing down the government's investigation. For several months. Only to be overturned, and very harshly, by the [conservative] 11th circuit.\"\n\nGiven all of that happened, the Times said Altonaga told Cannon, it might be better to step back. Cannon still refused.\n\n\"It gives some comfort, I guess, for lack of a better word, to people who have said all along that Judge Cannon's handling of this case has been somewhat awry and mysterious to know that two other judges also thought she might be out of her depth, if not biassed in her handling of the case,\" Rubin closed.\n\nFormer state and federal prosecutor Glenn Kirschner posted comments about Cannon mere hours before the story dropped.\n\n\"The federal law requires a judge to recuse from a case if 'her impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\" (28 USC 455),\" he wrote on X.\n\nHe quoted retired Judge Shira Scheindlin, who found the constant delays in the case to be the biggest standout. \"The second thing that stands out to me is what appears to me to be her dislike of the government and her favoritism toward the defense.\"\n\n\"Instead, Cannon will have to be removed from the case.

Altonaga, suggested that Cannon decline to oversee the case brought by special counsel Jack Smith and allow another judge to govern the case instead, the Times wrote, citing two people briefed on the conversations.\n\nCannon is still overseeing the case, which has seen a multitude of delays and is not yet scheduled to go to trial.\n\nAltonaga's chambers declined to comment on the report to CNN. The Times did not identify the second judge who reportedly contacted Cannon.\n\nAt the time Cannon was assigned the high-profile criminal case, she had already faced public backlash - and a major reversal by an appeals court - over her handling of the lawsuit Trump brought challenging the FBI's search of his Mar-a-Lago residence in August 2022, when agents found hundreds of classified documents scattered about the property.\n\nSince then, Cannon has repeatedly raised eyebrows among legal scholars for her approach. Critics of the judge say that she has slowed the pace of the case to a near standstill, making a pre-election trial essentially out of reach.\n\nAttorneys who have practiced in front of Cannon have told CNN that she tends to allow irrelevant legal questions distract from core issues - including a longshot motion from the former president to invalidate Jack Smith's appointment as special counsel that she's scheduled to hear extensive arguments on in the coming days.\n\nThe attorneys who spoke to CNN also reported a zero-tolerance approach to any technical defects in filings, and a struggle with docket management that allows the type of pretrial disputes that other judges would decide in weeks go unresolved for months.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

And on Tuesday, she will consider the question of whether a D.C. judge erred by allowing testimony from Trump's lawyer under the crime-fraud exception to attorney-client privilege.\n\nThose are the sorts of motions, some criminal law experts say, that few judges would have entertained during lengthy hearings. Instead, they say, she could have read the legal briefs and issued a ruling.\n\nBy continuing to require hours of court time for nearly every matter of dispute, Cannon, a Trump appointee, has played right into Trump's strategy of trying to delay a trial in this case until after the election. While she says she is merely trying to ensure fairness, her actions have raised questions among legal scholars.\n\n\"Motions that other judges would decide routinely and quickly, Judge Cannon puts them on her docket and delays for an inordinate amount of time,\" said Joyce Vance, an MSNBC legal contributor and a former U.S. attorney. \"It's like death by a thousand cuts.\"\n\nMost peculiar, experts say, is Cannon's decision to allow outside parties to argue before her Friday that Smith's appointment is unconstitutional.\n\n\"It's highly unusual to bring in amicus,\" John Fishwick, a former U.S. attorney, said using part of the Latin term for \"friends of the court.\" \"That never happens.\"\n\nShira Scheindlin, now retired after 22 years as a federal judge in New York City, added, \"There's no reason to let (outside parties) come in and argue their brief. They don't have a right to be heard.\"\n\nIt may be appropriate, she said, to allow Trump's lawyers to argue briefly about the issue of Smith's appointment, because there is a unique issue -- he is the only special counsel in recent memory who was never confirmed by the Senate. Those challenging his appointment say the founders did not envision investing such power in someone never confirmed.\n\nIn general, however, Scheindlin believes that Cannon has mishandled the classified documents case by failing to move expeditiously.\n\n\"She drags out everything ... she's very slow and she's expanding the time that it takes and now she's got motions piled up, they're all backlogged.\"\n\nCannon's defenders vehemently dispute this view. Jon Sale, a former federal prosecutor in Florida who recommended Cannon for the judgeship, said the criticism of her judicial approach is motivated mainly by disagreement with some of her rulings.\n\n\"For the life of me, I don't understand why she's criticized for holding hearings in a case that is extraordinarily important, that the whole world is watching,\" he said. \"It shows she's giving careful thought to it. If you take politics out of this, there should be no rush to judgment.\"\n\nCannon did not respond to a voicemail request for comment left in her chambers.\n\nApproved by the Senate in 2020 and then appointed by Trump, Cannon has been on the federal bench for less than four years and this is, by far, the highest-profile matter she has handled.\n\nBorn in Cali, Colombia, she earned an undergraduate degree from Duke University in 2003 and graduated magna cum laude from the University of Michigan Law School in 2007.\n\nAfter clerking for a judge and working at a law firm, she served from 2013 to 2020 as an assistant U.S. attorney in the Southern District of Florida, working in major crimes and in the appellate section.\n\nA member of the conservative Federalist Society, she has long been a Republican, but not politically active. She has said her mother fled Fidel Castro's Cuba at age 7.\n\nCannon first drew public scrutiny when she was randomly assigned to the litigation over the FBI search warrant of Trump's Mar-a-Lago compound in Florida. To the shock of many legal experts, she granted a request by Trump's lawyers to appoint a special master to review everything the FBI seized. She cited the fact that Trump was a former president.\n\nIn December 2022, a three-member panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in Atlanta shut down the special master in a 21-page ruling that sharply rebuked Cannon, saying that she sought to create \"a special exception\" for Trump that \"would defy our nation's foundational principle\" that everyone is equal under the law.\n\nThat ended Cannon's involvement in the matter. But after Trump was indicted, a judge had to be randomly assigned from a small pool in the northern part of the southern district of Florida. Of four available judges, Cannon drew the case.\n\nOn Thursday, the New York Times reported that Cannon rebuffed suggestions by two federal judges that she not take the case. One cited the optics of the reversal of her special master ruling. The other said the case should be handled closer to Miami.\n\nCannon has repeatedly sparred with the prosecutors assigned to the case, who have appeared exasperated at times with her plodding approach.\n\nIn March, when one of the prosecutors urged Cannon \"to keep things moving along,\" she bristled.\n\n\"I can assure you that in the background, there is a great deal of judicial work going on,\" she said. \"So while it may not appear on the surface that anything is happening, there is a ton of work being done.\"\n\nBut experts says Cannon has not done anything that rises to the level of Smith asking that she be removed from the case.\n\nCannon has ruled against Trump on important issues. In April, she decided against his claim that the case should be dismissed because the Presidential Records Act allowed Trump to consider the classified documents he allegedly kept at Mar-a-Lago to be his personal records.\n\nBut it took her months to rule. On other issues, she has forced prosecutors to jump through every technical hoop. A few weeks ago, when Smith filed a motion asking her to stop Trump from falsely saying the FBI was authorized to kill him during the Mar-a-Lago search, she blocked the motion on the grounds that the special counsel did not sufficiently consult with Trump's lawyers before filing it. He refiled it, and it will be among the topics discussed at the marathon hearings unfolding over the next few days.\n\nMost legal experts believe it's unlikely the case will go to trial before the November election. That means voters will not know whether a jury believes Trump is guilty of endangering national security and obstructing justice.\n\n\"This is important information for voters to have,\" Vance said.\n\n\"Had she just done her job, we would have had a verdict by now,\" Scheindlin said. \"It's a shame.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors":

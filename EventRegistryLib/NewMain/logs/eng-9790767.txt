In a significant setback for Kejriwal, a bench led by Justice Neena Bansal Krishna stated that the arrest had \"justifiable reasons.\" The court ruled that the CBI's actions could not be deemed illegal.\n\nKejriwal, the Aam Aadmi Party's national convener, was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on March 21 in a money laundering case tied to the alleged excise policy scam. Although the Supreme Court granted him interim bail, he remains in jail due to a related arrest by the CBI last month. Kejriwal had contested his arrest in the corruption case registered by the CBI.\n\nJustice Krishna disposed of Kejriwal's bail plea, but allowed him the option to approach the trial court for relief. Kejriwal was represented by Senior Advocates Abhishek Manu Singhvi, N Hariharan, and Ramesh Gupta. The CBI was represented by Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) DP Singh in this case.\n\nSinghvi, representing Kejriwal, argued that the arrest was an \"insurance arrest\" following the interim bail granted by the Supreme Court in the ED case. He contended that the policy was not only signed by Kejriwal but also by then Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal and other bureaucrats involved in the process.\n\nSPP Singh countered Singhvi's argument, stating that Kejriwal is the \"sutradhar\" or mastermind of the \"entire scam.\" He presented that there is direct evidence to show Kejriwal's involvement. Singh also noted that the trial court has already found that the arrest is not illegal and a mere filing of chargesheet by the CBI does not entitle Kejriwal to be released on bail.\n\nThe excise policy was scrapped in 2022 after the Delhi L-G ordered a CBI probe into alleged irregularities and corruption in its formulation and execution. According to the CBI and the ED, irregularities were committed while modifying the excise policy, with undue favours extended to licence holders.

The Delhi High Court made clear that it will deliver its judgment on Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's petitions on Monday. These petitions challenged his arrest and sought bail in connection with the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) case concerning the Excise Policy matter.\n\nNew Delhi [India], August 5 (ANI): The Delhi High Court made clear that it will deliver its judgment on Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's petitions on Monday. These petitions challenged his arrest and sought bail in connection with the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) case concerning the Excise Policy matter.\n\nOn Monday, Arvind Kejriwal's legal team mentioned the matter before the bench of Justices Neena Bansal Krishna, urging the court to expedite the decision on his petitions. The bench stated that it scheduled the pronouncement of judgment for 2:30 p.m. on the same day.\n\nAlso Read | Badminton Gold Medalist From UP Forced Into Prostitution in Delhi, Rescued From Sex Traffickers After Police Raid at Brothel in GB Road Area.\n\nThe same bench had reserved its order on Arvind Kejriwal's regular bail plea in the CBI case related to the Excise Policy on July 29, 2024. Additionally, on July 17, 2024, the court reserved its order on Kejriwal's plea challenging his arrest by the CBI in the same case.\n\nDuring the hearing, the Central Bureau of Investigation opposed the bail plea, referring to Kejriwal as the \"sutradhar\" of the case. During the arguments, CBI's Special counsel DP Singh informed the Delhi High Court that as their investigation progressed, they discovered more evidence implicating Arvind Kejriwal. The chargesheet had been filed naming six individuals, including Kejriwal, but five of them have not been arrested.\n\nAlso Read | Japan Stock Market Crash: From Geopolitical Concerns to Apprehension Over US Recession, List of Reasons Why Japanese Market Suffered Worst Losses Since 1987.\n\nThe CBI informed the Delhi High Court that they had completed their investigation and filed a chargesheet within a month. They claimed that Arvind Kejriwal was the central figure or \"sutradhar\" in the excise policy scam. The CBI counsel stated that Arvind Kejriwal, as the head of the cabinet, signed the excise policy, circulated it to his colleagues, and received their signatures within a single day. This occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe CBI counsel further submitted that C. Aravind, an IAS officer under Manish Sisodia, testified that Vijay Nair brought a copy of the excise policy to be entered into the computer, and Arvind Kejriwal was present at that time. This, according to the CBI, indicates Kejriwal's direct involvement in the matter. CBI counsel DP Singh stated that the investigation agency has traced Rs 44 crores of money related to the case, which was sent to Goa. Arvind Kejriwal instructed his candidates not to worry about the funds and to focus on contesting the elections, said Advocate DP Singh\n\nCBI counsel DP Singh argued that while direct evidence might be lacking, witness testimonies, including three witnesses and 164 statements made in court, clearly indicate Kejriwal's involvement. Singh asserted that such evidence emerged only after Kejriwal's arrest, as Punjab officers would not have come forward otherwise.\n\nCBI counsel DP Singh stated that after the issue blew up in the media, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal sought ex post facto approval from the council of ministers.\n\nThe CBI stated that while certain circumstances allow the High Court to hear bail applications directly, it cannot be the first court for bail hearings. With the final chargesheet now filed, the CBI is prepared for the trial to commence, said Advocate DP Singh representing the CBI.\n\nHowever, Senior Advocate Dr Abhishek Manu Singhvi, representing Arvind Kejriwal, began his submissions by arguing that the case represents an \"insurance arrest.\"\n\nHe stated that Kejriwal has been granted bail thrice in the ED case. Singhvi also pointed out that since Kejriwal's arrest by the CBI, there has been no confrontation or new developments. He argued that the distinction between bail and writ petitions does not impact the case's merit.\n\nAbhishek Manu Singhvi stated that there is no direct evidence against Arvind Kejriwal. He highlighted that the CBI frequently refers to Vijay Nair as a central figure in the case, but Nair had been granted bail in the CBI case a long time ago.\n\nAbhishek Manu Singhvi criticized the CBI's portrayal of Arvind Kejriwal as the \"Sutradhar\" of the excise policy, arguing that they fail to acknowledge the broader context.\n\nHe emphasized that the policy was the result of nine inter-ministerial committees, involving officials from various departments, and was published in July 2021 after a year of deliberation.\n\nSenior Advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi argued that while Arvind Kejriwal signed the excise policy, so did 15 other people, including the Lieutenant Governor.\n\nBy the CBI's logic, the Lieutenant Governor and the 50 bureaucrats, including the Chief Secretary, should also be considered co-accused, said Singhvi. Singhvi also emphasized that he did not wish to implicate the Lieutenant Governor but questioned the CBI's selective targeting.\n\nAbhishek Manu Singhvi asked CBI to produce a statement that isn't based on hearsay, asserting that after two years of probe, the case relies on presumptions and hypotheses rather than concrete evidence.\n\nDelhi Chief Minister had approached the Delhi High Court stated that the applicant/Kejriwal is the National Convenor of a National Political Party (Aam Aadmi Party) and the sitting Chief Minister of Delhi who is being subjected to gross persecution and harassment for wholly malafide and extraneous considerations, is knocking at the doors of this Court seeking regular bail in this case.

Additionally, on July 17, 2024, the court reserved its order on Kejriwal's plea challenging his arrest by the CBI in the same case.\n\nDuring the hearing, the Central Bureau of Investigation opposed the bail plea, referring to Kejriwal as the \"sutradhar\" of the case. During the arguments, CBI's Special counsel DP Singh informed the Delhi High Court that as their investigation progressed, they discovered more evidence implicating Arvind Kejriwal. The chargesheet had been filed naming six individuals, including Kejriwal, but five of them have not been arrested.\n\nThe CBI informed the Delhi High Court that they had completed their investigation and filed a chargesheet within a month. They claimed that Arvind Kejriwal was the central figure or \"sutradhar\" in the excise policy scam. The CBI counsel stated that Arvind Kejriwal, as the head of the cabinet, signed the excise policy, circulated it to his colleagues, and received their signatures within a single day. This occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe CBI counsel further submitted that C. Aravind, an IAS officer under Manish Sisodia, testified that Vijay Nair brought a copy of the excise policy to be entered into the computer, and Arvind Kejriwal was present at that time. This, according to the CBI, indicates Kejriwal's direct involvement in the matter. CBI counsel DP Singh stated that the investigation agency has traced Rs 44 crores of money related to the case, which was sent to Goa. Arvind Kejriwal instructed his candidates not to worry about the funds and to focus on contesting the elections, said Advocate DP Singh\n\nCBI counsel DP Singh argued that while direct evidence might be lacking, witness testimonies, including three witnesses and 164 statements made in court, clearly indicate Kejriwal's involvement. Singh asserted that such evidence emerged only after Kejriwal's arrest, as Punjab officers would not have come forward otherwise.\n\nCBI counsel DP Singh stated that after the issue blew up in the media, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal sought ex post facto approval from the council of ministers.\n\nThe CBI stated that while certain circumstances allow the High Court to hear bail applications directly, it cannot be the first court for bail hearings. With the final chargesheet now filed, the CBI is prepared for the trial to commence, said Advocate DP Singh representing the CBI.\n\nHowever, Senior Advocate Dr Abhishek Manu Singhvi, representing Arvind Kejriwal, began his submissions by arguing that the case represents an \"insurance arrest.\"\n\nHe stated that Kejriwal has been granted bail thrice in the ED case. Singhvi also pointed out that since Kejriwal's arrest by the CBI, there has been no confrontation or new developments. He argued that the distinction between bail and writ petitions does not impact the case's merit.\n\nHe emphasized that the policy was the result of nine inter-ministerial committees, involving officials from various departments, and was published in July 2021 after a year of deliberation.\n\nDelhi Chief Minister had approached the Delhi High Court stated that the applicant/Kejriwal is the National Convenor of a National Political Party (Aam Aadmi Party) and the sitting Chief Minister of Delhi who is being subjected to gross persecution and harassment for wholly malafide and extraneous considerations, is knocking at the doors of this Court seeking regular bail in this case.

The court concluded that Kejriwal's arrest was justified and not without cause.\n\nThe court also disposed of Kejriwal's bail application, giving him the option to seek relief from the trial court. Earlier, Kejriwal's legal team had urged the bench of Justices Neena Bansal Krishna to expedite the decision on his petitions. The same bench had previously reserved its order on Kejriwal's regular bail plea related to the CBI's Excise Policy case on July 29, 2024. Additionally, on July 17, 2024, the court had reserved its order on Kejriwal's plea challenging his CBI arrest in the same case.\n\nDuring the hearings, the CBI opposed the bail plea, referring to Kejriwal as the \"sutradhar\" or central figure in the case. CBI Special Counsel DP Singh informed the court that further evidence implicating Kejriwal had emerged during the investigation. The chargesheet, naming six individuals including Kejriwal, had been filed, but five of the accused have not yet been arrested.\n\nALSO READ: Delhi HC Appoints Arbitrator in Yuvraj Singh's Personality Rights Dispute\n\nThe CBI detailed that they had completed their investigation and filed the chargesheet within a month. They claimed that Kejriwal, as the head of the cabinet, played a pivotal role in the excise policy scam, noting that he signed and circulated the policy rapidly during the COVID-19 pandemic. The CBI also highlighted testimony from IAS officer C. Aravind, who stated that Kejriwal was present when Vijay Nair brought the excise policy for computer entry.\n\nFurthermore, CBI Counsel DP Singh stated that the agency had traced Rs 44 crores related to the case, which was allegedly sent to Goa. Singh also claimed that Kejriwal instructed his candidates not to worry about the funds and to focus on the elections. The CBI contended that while direct evidence may be limited, witness testimonies and 164 statements made in court suggest Kejriwal's involvement.\n\nIn response, Senior Advocate Dr. Abhishek Manu Singhvi, representing Kejriwal, argued that the case constituted an \"insurance arrest.\" Singhvi noted that Kejriwal had already been granted bail thrice in the ED case and highlighted the absence of new developments or confrontations since his arrest by the CBI. He also emphasized that the excise policy, a result of extensive deliberations and published in July 2021, involved multiple inter-ministerial committees.\n\nKejriwal's plea to the Delhi High Court stressed that as the National Convenor of the Aam Aadmi Party and the sitting Chief Minister of Delhi, he was facing undue persecution and harassment.\n\n(WITH INPUTS FROM ANI)", "source": {"uri": "newsx.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsX"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvind_Kejriwal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arvind Kejriwal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chargesheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chargesheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_High_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delhi High Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trial court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chief_ministers_of_Delhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "List of chief ministers of Delhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuvraj_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yuvraj Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arbitration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excise", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Excise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Senior counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Directorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Enforcement Directorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Singhvi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Singhvi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_News_International", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asian News International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Administrative_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian Administrative Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aam_Aadmi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aam Aadmi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Goa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Swati-Website-Image-4.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790767", "eventUri": "eng-9790767", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-07-", "textStart": 831, "textEnd": 838}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

CBI's counsel argued that Kejriwal is the head of cabinet and he signed the New Excise Policy. However, Senior Advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi appearing for Kejriwal said that just by signing if Kejriwal becomes mastermind then LG VK Saxena also signed the policy, he should also be impleaded in the case. However, CBI's counsel said that Singhvi was trying to sensationalise the matter.\n\nThe Delhi High Court on July 17 had reserved verdict on Kejriwal's interim bail plea and challenge to arrest by CBI. That verdict is yet to be pronounced.\n\nThe counsel appearing for CBI told the high court that Arvind Kejriwal is the mastermind behind the alleged Delhi Liquor Policy case as he was the one who appointed ministers and members of the secretariat which includes the main accused Vijay Nair.\n\nThere are certain circumstances in which bail can be heard directly by the High Court, but the High Court cannot become the first court for hearing of bail, the counsel for CBI argued.\n\nCBI further told the court that a money trail of Rs 44 crores has been established and that money was used in Goa elections.\n\nSinghvi however argued that most of the statements in the case are based on hearsay. In the previous hearing, Singhvi appearing for Kejriwal had called the CBI arrest an insurance arrest. He had argued that after CBI realised that Kejriwal will walk out in the PMLA case by the Enforcement Directorate, they arrested him from Tihar Jail, where he was already jailed.\n\nKejriwal has been granted interim bail by the Supreme Court in the Delhi Liquor Policy case by the ED.

These petitions challenged his arrest and sought bail in connection with the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) case concerning the Excise Policy matter.\n\nOn Monday, Arvind Kejriwal's legal team mentioned the matter before the bench of Justices Neena Bansal Krishna, urging the court to expedite the decision on his petitions. The bench stated that it scheduled the pronouncement of judgment for 2:30 p.m. on the same day.\n\nThe same bench had reserved its order on Arvind Kejriwal's regular bail plea in the CBI case related to the Excise Policy on July 29, 2024. Additionally, on July 17, 2024, the court reserved its order on Kejriwal's plea challenging his arrest by the CBI in the same case.\n\nDuring the hearing, the Central Bureau of Investigation opposed the bail plea, referring to Kejriwal as the \"sutradhar\" of the case. During the arguments, CBI's Special counsel DP Singh informed the Delhi High Court that as their investigation progressed, they discovered more evidence implicating Arvind Kejriwal. The chargesheet had been filed naming six individuals, including Kejriwal, but five of them have not been arrested.\n\nThe CBI informed the Delhi High Court that they had completed their investigation and filed a chargesheet within a month. They claimed that Arvind Kejriwal was the central figure or \"sutradhar\" in the excise policy scam. The CBI counsel stated that Arvind Kejriwal, as the head of the cabinet, signed the excise policy, circulated it to his colleagues, and received their signatures within a single day. This occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe CBI counsel further submitted that C. Aravind, an IAS officer under Manish Sisodia, testified that Vijay Nair brought a copy of the excise policy to be entered into the computer, and Arvind Kejriwal was present at that time. This, according to the CBI, indicates Kejriwal's direct involvement in the matter. CBI counsel DP Singh stated that the investigation agency has traced Rs 44 crores of money related to the case, which was sent to Goa. Arvind Kejriwal instructed his candidates not to worry about the funds and to focus on contesting the elections, said Advocate DP Singh\n\nCBI counsel DP Singh argued that while direct evidence might be lacking, witness testimonies, including three witnesses and 164 statements made in court, clearly indicate Kejriwal's involvement. Singh asserted that such evidence emerged only after Kejriwal's arrest, as Punjab officers would not have come forward otherwise.\n\nCBI counsel DP Singh stated that after the issue blew up in the media, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal sought ex post facto approval from the council of ministers.\n\nThe CBI stated that while certain circumstances allow the High Court to hear bail applications directly, it cannot be the first court for bail hearings. With the final chargesheet now filed, the CBI is prepared for the trial to commence, said Advocate DP Singh representing the CBI.\n\nHowever, Senior Advocate Dr Abhishek Manu Singhvi, representing Arvind Kejriwal, began his submissions by arguing that the case represents an \"insurance arrest.\"\n\nHe stated that Kejriwal has been granted bail thrice in the ED case. Singhvi also pointed out that since Kejriwal's arrest by the CBI, there has been no confrontation or new developments. He argued that the distinction between bail and writ petitions does not impact the case's merit.\n\nAbhishek Manu Singhvi stated that there is no direct evidence against Arvind Kejriwal. He highlighted that the CBI frequently refers to Vijay Nair as a central figure in the case, but Nair had been granted bail in the CBI case a long time ago.\n\nAbhishek Manu Singhvi criticized the CBI's portrayal of Arvind Kejriwal as the \"Sutradhar\" of the excise policy, arguing that they fail to acknowledge the broader context.\n\nHe emphasized that the policy was the result of nine inter-ministerial committees, involving officials from various departments, and was published in July 2021 after a year of deliberation.\n\nSenior Advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi argued that while Arvind Kejriwal signed the excise policy, so did 15 other people, including the Lieutenant Governor.\n\nBy the CBI's logic, the Lieutenant Governor and the 50 bureaucrats, including the Chief Secretary, should also be considered co-accused, said Singhvi. Singhvi also emphasized that he did not wish to implicate the Lieutenant Governor but questioned the CBI's selective targeting.\n\nAbhishek Manu Singhvi asked CBI to produce a statement that isn't based on hearsay, asserting that after two years of probe, the case relies on presumptions and hypotheses rather than concrete evidence.\n\nDelhi Chief Minister had approached the Delhi High Court stated that the applicant/Kejriwal is the National Convenor of a National Political Party (Aam Aadmi Party) and the sitting Chief Minister of Delhi who is being subjected to gross persecution and harassment for wholly malafide and extraneous considerations, is knocking at the doors of this Court seeking regular bail in this case.

However, the trial court's order was stayed by the high court.\n\nOn July 12, the Supreme Court granted him interim bail in the money laundering case.\n\nThe excise policy was scrapped in 2022 after the Delhi lieutenant governor ordered a CBI probe into alleged irregularities and corruption involving the formulation and execution of the excise policy.

In the Arnesh Kumar ruling, the Supreme Court had formulated guidelines to prevent unnecessary arrests and ensure that the same are made only when mandatory.\n\nThe petition went on to add that the Delhi court failed to satisfy itself as to how the AAP supremo's arrest was necessitated, and erred in law in appreciating that the CBI took him into custody by failing to abide by the conditions laid down under section 41 of the CrPC. The said provision allows police to make arrests with a warrant or permission from a magistrate in cases where the police fear it is necessary to prevent a person from committing a further offense or for proper investigation.\n\nThe chief minister, represented by senior advocate AM Singhvi, asserted that his arrest by the CBI was an after thought insurance and a \"safeguard\", aimed at preventing his release in the separate money laundering case related to the same matter. The probe agency had no new \"new evidence\" or \"material\" justifying the arrest in judicial custody, almost a year after he was summoned as a witness by the CBI in April 2023.\n\nThe senior lawyer argued that the probe agency arrested his client on two \"non existing grounds\", i.e., non-cooperation in investigation and Magunta Reddy's statement. \"When they came to interrogate me and didn't arrest me, they had the same material which they had to arrest me a day later. The material is six months old, I am already in ED custody,\" Singhvi said.\n\nHe highlighted that there were three favorable orders for his client's release under a more stringent provision, i.e., the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). Against this backdrop, Singhvi contended that the CBI's action to move the trial court seeking permission to interrogate and arrest the AAP chief, was only because the probe agency was \"worried\" as the wind had started blowing in Kejriwal's favor in the ED case and wanted to ensure by \"hook or by crook\" that the former does not walk out of jail. He also argued that because of the CBI arrest, his client was back to square one despite Supreme Court's July 12 order granting him interim bail in the ED case after acknowledging that he had spent over 90 days in incarceration.\n\n\"This term insurance arrest coined by him is unjustified. The order of a stay on his bail in the ED case was to be pronounced on June 25. Only after this order came did we arrest him. If it was an insurance arrest, I could have arrested him before the HC order. It would have raised eyebrows, but I only arrested him when this court gave a complete stay on his bail. None knew about the Supreme Court's order (July 12 order of interim release). It was not a way as they say,\" Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) DP Singh, representing the CBI, submitted.\n\nSingh argued that the probe agency took the CM into custody in June only after it received a sanction in April 2024 under the Prevention of Corruption Act to prosecute the leader.\n\n\"He is a public servant. The Prevention of Corruption Act requires permissions to investigate under Section 17. To say that in January, I had the statement of Magunta Reddy; in April I got the sanction. There is a mechanism at the CBI. An investigating officer (IO) alone cannot take a call. We took three months to collect all the material. It's not as if we did nothing. Whatever I needed to do was only after April 23, not before it. To say why I took one year to get this sanction... He is the CM of Delhi,\" Singh asserted. The law officer added that the agency even at the time of arrest had \"probable reasons\" and sufficient material to prove that Kejriwal had the capability of influencing and derailing the investigation. \"CrPC permits arrest for the purpose of investigation,\" Singh argued.\n\nKejriwal has been in custody since March 21 following his arrest by the Enforcement Directorate, apart from a 21-day interim bail in May granted by the top court for campaigning during the Lok Sabha elections. On July 12, the Supreme Court granted him interim bail in the ED case, acknowledging that he had spent over 90 days in incarceration. Still, he continued to remain in custody due to the separate CBI case.\n\nThe case against Kejriwal stems from allegations of irregularities in Delhi excise policy of 2021-22, which the CBI began probing following a recommendation by Delhi's Lieutenant Governor in July 2022.\n\nKejriwal was the third AAP leader arrested in this connection after former deputy CM Manish Sisodia in February 2023, and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh, who was later granted bail by the top court in April, six months after being in custody.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

This is notwithstanding the Supreme Court granting ordinary bail on July 12. However, that was for his detention by the ED and not by the CBI.\n\nThe CBI detained Mr. Kejriwal in June, days after the Rouse Avenue Court in Delhi granted bail - in a ruling subsequently upheld by the Supreme Court - for his detention by the Enforcement Directorate.\n\nDuring the previous month, senior lawyer Abhishek Singhvi, representing Mr. Kejriwal, criticized the CBI's case against his client as rumors and suggested that the federal agency is attempting to implicate the Chief Minister using \"assumptions and hypotheses\".\n\n\"They mention AAP spending Rs 4 crore on publicity. I am curious about the amount of money the ruling party has allocated for publicity. I wonder if CBI will pose this question to them. Currently, there is no direct evidence, no recovery. It's all rumors,\" he stated.\n\nMr. Singhvi asserted that the AAP leader meets the three criteria for bail - he is not a flight risk, he is unlikely to tamper with evidence, or influence witnesses.\n\nHe reiterated that Mr. Kejriwal's detention is a \"precautionary arrest\". \"I have received bail three times, in one way or another, in the ED case. Since I was detained by the CBI, there has been no confrontation, nothing.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the CBI stated that they have traced the financial transactions in the case and it amounted to Rs 44 crore.\n\n\"This money was transferred to Goa.

The guilty should be in jail if found guilty. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has moved the Supreme Court, it is a personal matter of the party,\" he told IANS.\n\nThe Delhi High Court on Monday dismissed a plea filed by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal challenging his arrest by the CBI in the corruption case linked to the alleged liquor policy scam.\n\nThe High Court asked CM Kejriwal to approach the trial court with his plea seeking release on interim bail.\n\nOn July 12, the Supreme Court ordered CM Kejriwal to be released on interim bail in connection with the money laundering case lodged by the Enforcement Directorate (ED). However, he was not able to walk out of jail since he was arrested by the CBI.\n\nDevender Yadav also justified the Supreme Court's decision regarding the appointment of 10 aldermen to the Municipal Corporation of Delhi.\n\nThe Supreme Court on Monday upheld the decision of the Delhi Lieutenant Governor (L-G) to appoint 'aldermen' to the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) without the aid and advice of the elected government.\n\n\"This decision will also have an impact on the mayoral elections.

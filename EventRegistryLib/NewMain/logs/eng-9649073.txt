If the Ukrainian is around, Richard Riakporhe wants in.\n\nUsyk recently outlined his desire to drop back down to cruiserweight in order to recapture all the titles in a division he has already conquered on one occasion.\n\nIt comes in the wake of the 37-year-old defeating Tyson Fury in Saudi Arabia last month to become the first undisputed heavyweight champion since 1999.\n\n\"To be able to share a ring with such a legend like that, that's a special thing - something I can look back and tell my family and friends 'I shared a ring with this guy',\" Riakporhe told Sky Sports.\n\n\"I see myself as a legend as well, having to overcome all of the adversity to get to where I am now. It's like a legend vs a legend - that's beautiful.\"\n\nRiakporhe is gearing up for the first world title fight of his career as he challenges Chris Billam-Smith for the WBO cruiserweight belt at Selhurst Park.\n\nIBF champion Jai Opetaia awaits as one of the primary targets for the winner. So too, perhaps, does Usyk.\n\n\"He's not a big heavyweight, he doesn't have a lot of muscle. I've seen people like Roy Jones try to go up to heavyweight and come back down,\" said Riakporhe.\n\n\"But the way he bulked up and put so much muscle on, I think it became a bit dangerous because he's losing power and punch resistance too, that's why it's not really too good to move up and down the weights like that.\n\n\"But Usyk isn't a big heavyweight, so we'll see if he wants to do that. I think what they'll be telling him is to move down gradually - maybe bridgerweight then cruiserweight - but anything is possible when you put your mind to it and he has a great team to be able to guide him to do it professionally. I think it's definitely possible and I think it would be great - I would love to have that fight.\"\n\nUsyk last fought at cruiserweight in November 2018 when he knocked out Tony Bellew in the eighth round to retain the undisputed world championship.\n\nHe cited the challenge of making weight as one of the reasons he would consider dropping back down following his rematch against Fury, which is scheduled for December 21.\n\n\"That's even more motivation [to beat Chris Billam-Smith]. I want to mix it with the biggest names in the division and there is a big opportunity for me right now,\" said Riakporhe.\n\n\"I've put extra pressure on myself and I think it's a really good time for me and everyone as boxers really. But it's really a a special time for me at cruiserweight.\"\n\nBefore thinking about Usyk, Riakporhe has a momentum-fuelled Billam-Smith standing between him and a world title.\n\nThe Midnight Train sees only one outcome. And doesn't plan on letting it go the distance.\n\n\"I think it's going to end in a technical knockout,\" he said. \"The way I've been performing in camp and my career so far, I feel like I'm punching really hard and I know what I'm doing.\n\n\"I know how to take these guys out, which is the way I'm doing it. I feel like with CBS, it's just a matter of time before I get to him.\"\n\nOnly 30 per cent of tickets remain for Billam-Smith vs Riakporhe.

Light-heavyweight stars Ben Whittaker and Dan Azeez feature on the undercard.\n\nSelhurst Park is only a few miles from the Aylesbury Estate in south London, where Richard Riakporhe grew up. But Riakporhe has come a long way to reach this point when, on Saturday, he fights for a world title at the Crystal Palace ground. To challenge for the WBO championship this weekend, live on Sky Sports, at the stadium of the football club he supports, in a rematch against British rival Chris Billam-Smith, is the stuff of dreams.\n\nIt marks the culmination of a journey that he almost didn't get to start. When he was just 15, Riakporhe was the victim of a stabbing that he was lucky to survive. He still bears the scar from that brush with death. It's a reminder now of how he changed his whole life. \"I came off the streets straight into the boxing gym,\" he told Sky Sports. \"I came through the hard way. I learned like a true apprentice.\"\n\nThe Lynn, the oldest boxing club in the country and an institution in southeast London, set him on that new path. \"I fell in love with the sport. It gave me purpose, it gave me drive, it gave me something to do, kept me out of a lot of trouble, and before you know it, I was actually competing for amateur championships,\" Riakporhe said.\n\n\"I said, you know what, I want to pursue my passion, and my passion was boxing. I just felt like it was perfect for me and who I am as a human being. I'm very ambitious. I always wanted to work towards something in my life, and it just matched everything.\" He didn't even realize he had a unique quality that would subsequently mark him out as a professional - his fearsome punch power.\n\nIn his first amateur bout, he hesitated. He backpedaled. \"I didn't want to get hit. I always believed as an amateur that everybody possessed the same power that I did. I thought it was normal to be able to punch like that. I didn't want to get hit with that type of power, so I was just always moving, and then when I landed my shots, the fight was over. I knocked him out in the first round,\" Riakporhe recalled.\n\n\"It was a run of KOs. I remember going into the championships and knocking out everybody to get to the finals. I was known for being a big puncher from way back then.\"\n\nBillam-Smith, on his quest to avenge his only career defeat against Riakporhe, believes he can turn the Londoner's power-punching into a weakness. He thinks Riakporhe relies too much on that power, waiting for a knockout and giving up rounds. That Billam-Smith fully intends to exploit. Riakporhe naturally rejected that notion. \"That's complete nonsense,\" he said.\n\n\"It doesn't matter whether I'm being lazy or not, whether I'm winning the rounds or not. There are fights that I've been in where I didn't come with the intention to win the rounds. I just wanted the knockout.\n\n\"I've hit so many people that I know that when I land my shots, I will cause a lot of damage, even if they don't get knocked out.\"\n\nHe did acknowledge: \"It's a blessing to have a skill like that, but it can be a curse at the same time. It can make you a bit lazy.\n\n\"I've gone back to the gym, and I've rectified that laziness, and that's what makes me even more dangerous now.\"\n\nThis fight will be Riakporhe's first attempt to win a world title, but he has beaten Billam-Smith before. \"He has to rectify the loss. He has to get one back,\" the Londoner said. \"He can't live with his own failure, and that's the blemish on his record to me.\n\n\"Because guess what, it's actually brought him back full circle to me.\n\n\"So what does that mean? Have you really progressed? Because if you'd really progressed, you wouldn't be having to see the 'Midnight Train' once again. But we're back here.\"\n\nHe added: \"I'm not giving 'The Gentleman' no more chance. There's not going to be no trilogy. This fight is where it ends. I'll do it again, and that's it. There'll be no third chance for him.\"\n\nFor Riakporhe, winning this fight \"would mean everything.\" \"Because we had a goal, and the goal was to become world champion and to move on from there. I never thought that I would be able to perform on the ground of my favorite football team. Just to be able to represent Crystal Palace was enough for me. That done it for me. For them to entrust me with their brand, what they represent, as a fellow south Londoner, that is very humbling, very humbling for me,\" he said.\n\n\"I will do everything to make sure I bring that title, not only to win it for myself but also to bring hope to everybody in south London. Everybody has their individual fights, things that they're going through that nobody knows, just to be a kind of reference to them.\n\n\"Like if I can do it coming from my background, all the things that I had to overcome, being stabbed when I was 15, nearly dying, being a product of my environment, being able to make it out, everything was always a fight, and I just want to be that kind of reference to them. That I'm one of you. I'm no superstar.\n\n\"I'm just a normal guy. A normal working-class guy that just had dreams and was ambitious, and I made something of myself.", "source": {"uri": "pattayaone.news", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pattaya One News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Riakporhe", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Richard Riakporhe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Billam-Smith", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chris Billam-Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amateur boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Boxing_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Boxing Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selhurst_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Selhurst Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Azeez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dan Azeez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aylesbury_Estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aylesbury Estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crystal_Palace", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Crystal Palace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruiserweight_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cruiserweight (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_heavyweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Light heavyweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crystal Palace F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South London"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_class", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Working class"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Organizations", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Spirit/Fight_Songs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Spirit/Fight Songs", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://pattayaone.news/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Richard-Riakporhes-Journey-to-Selhurst-Park-Title-Fight.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9649073", "eventUri": "eng-9649073", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-15", "textStart": 166, "textEnd": 173}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

People mentioned about the deterioration and it brought it to light.\n\n\"That's when I thought, let me see what this deterioration is really about, because boxing is not easy.\n\n\"Sometimes we make mistakes, sometimes you have an off day or a bad performance, that's normal.\n\n\"But when I watched the fights back, from a technical analysis, I started to see a lot of gaps.\n\n\"I wondered, what's the difference? I watched my fight back with him and I noticed he was much more live, he was fresh.\n\n\"I feel like it's a normal wear and tear on a boxer.\n\n\"When you're taking too many shots and you're gifted with a chin like CBS, sometimes you want to say it's not affecting you, but it is. It's science.\n\n\"You can't afford it. Which is why we can't stay in our prime forever.\n\n\"We're going to see what he has left.\n\n\"Maybe he's still all right, maybe he's not. It all depends when I land the shots in the fight.\"\n\n(Image: Stuart Martin)\n\nBillam-Smith replied: \"I think he's just hoping for it, to be honest.\n\n\"There's no decline and you'll see that on Saturday night.\"\n\nAsked how much he has changed as a fighter since the two last went head-to-head, Billam-Smith added: \"I'm different in so many ways.\n\n\"It's so irrelevant. I almost see it as a different person, like it's 20 years ago in boxing terms.\n\n\"It seems that long ago because I'm such a different fighter.\n\n\"It's been a great journey from then to now. The experience and growth I've had is massive.\"\n\nBillam-Smith's trainer Shane McGuigan concurred, saying: \"He's got the experience. He uses his jab a lot more effectively.\n\n\"He doesn't waste energy and run around the ring. He's a lot more poised when he's in there.\n\n\"He uses his feints to his advantage and he's got that inner belief.\n\n\"These are the things that can make those attacks more meaningful.\n\n\"He's just a completely different beast these days.\"\n\nRiakporhe added: \"I'm very excited. I've been waiting for this opportunity for a very long time. I'm just hungry. I'm ready to take this title.\n\n\"It's a proper fight.

You need a lot of adrenaline and testosterone.\n\n\"I'm quite good at turning that switch between being the boxing version of myself and the family version. It's almost like you're a character.\"\n\nIt was at another Premier League stadium - the home of his beloved AFC Bournemouth - where he outpointed his former stablemate Lawrence Okolie just over a year ago.\n\nThe newly-crowned world champion dedicated the win to his mother who, before making a full recovery, was diagnosed with breast cancer for the second time in her life.\n\n\"She's always been my rock; my best mate,\" he said. \"We lived together for a while, just her and I, when my brothers had moved out and my mum and dad had split up.\n\n\"A couple of years ago I had my son, Frank, and she's amazing with him. They've got a real, special bond. She's definitely where I get my fighting spirit from.\"\n\nAway from boxing, there are two constants that will always be central to Billam-Smith's life: family and Bournemouth.\n\nAs a well-supported, high-profile athlete, his presence is felt by a number of local charities; one of which, the Bournemouth Foodbank, he is an ambassador for.\n\nAfter visiting their warehouse - which was full of food - and being told they had just one to two months' worth of stock, he was, quite emphatically, left stunned by the magnitude of the charity's work.\n\n\"My wife ended up in tears,\" he said. \"She just couldn't believe it, seeing how many people are in dire need, especially now with the cost of living going up.\n\n\"It was eye-opening beyond belief, really. All the staff are lovely, and they put on some really good events.\n\n\"It's more than just food. There's some really amazing people down there who make such an important difference in the area.\"\n\nAs a life-long Bournemouth fan, Billam-Smith has developed a strong partnership with his boyhood football club which, in turn, has opened the door to several opportunities.\n\nHe has, in a rather unconventional sense, learnt more about the players by hosting a brand-new series on the AFC Bournemouth YouTube channel, which is filmed at a local restaurant.\n\nBillam-Smith asks a sequence of questions and the players can respond by either providing an answer or, if they are brave enough, tucking into an extra-hot chicken wing.\n\n\"It's been great fun,\" he said. \"To host something like that - and I'm not known for my hosting skills - I was quite pleased with how I did in the end.\n\n\"It was very nerve-wracking for me at first, but to sit there with the lads was phenomenal.\n\n\"It is two of my favourite things in one place: AFC Bournemouth and Chicken & Blues.\"\n\nA closer relationship with the team has inspired Billam-Smith to consider which players would make the best boxers.\n\n\"Looking at the strength of Antoine [Semenyo], I think he'd be pretty handy, pretty powerful,\" he said.\n\n\"Then you've got workhorses like Lewis Cook and Ryan Christie. I'm sure they'd be able to turn their hands to it as well.\"\n\nWith an array of talent in both football and boxing, professional sport on the south coast has never shone brighter.\n\nIt is perhaps, for this reason, that Billam-Smith feels an added desire - beyond wishing to exact revenge on a former opponent - to come through his next fight in comprehensive fashion.\n\nWhile it was Riakporhe who emerged victorious following their first encounter back in 2019, a much-improved version of 'The Gentleman' will be looking to put on a more refined performance when they clash for the second time.\n\n\"[Riakporhe] is not a high work-rate fighter, and he won't want to be that against me because I'd just tire him out,\" he said.\n\n\"It'll be interesting to see how he deals with my pace, which is always intense.\"\n\nRiakporhe has ruthlessly stopped his last five opponents, but, come fight night, Billam-Smith is confident he will negate his rival's devastating power.\n\n\"I can just keep a really high work-rate, for a really long time,\" he said. \"My engine, my fitness and my heart is all there, and a lot of cruiserweights can't live with that pace.\n\n\"Anyone in the world would struggle with that [pace], I believe.\"\n\nFinal remaining tickets for Billam-Smith vs Riakporhe available via Boxxer.com.", "source": {"uri": "skysports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SkySports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Bournemouth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AFC Bournemouth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Riakporhe", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Richard Riakporhe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Billam-Smith", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chris Billam-Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Boxing_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Boxing Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruiserweight_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cruiserweight (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparring", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sparring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxytocin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oxytocin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Testosterone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selhurst_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Selhurst Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_living", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cost of living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Breast cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Okolie", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawrence Okolie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Semenyo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antoine Semenyo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Cook_(footballer,_born_1997)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Cook (footballer, born 1997)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Christie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Christie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Physical fitness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Gyms", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Gyms", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Promotions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Promotions", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://e0.365dm.com/24/06/1600x900/skysports-chris-billam-smith_6580636.jpg?20240613134029", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9649073", "eventUri": "eng-9649073", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

They fight at Crystal Palace's Selhurst Park, and in south London, which Riakporhe considers his territory.\n\nIt is ultimately tempting to see in Saturday's fight similar conditions for Riakporhe that existed for Billam-Smith for his fight with Okolie, but the champion has questioned the challenger's conviction, on the grounds that he considers it \"forced\".\n\n\"He might be thinking it in his head that it's going to be this amazing night,\" said Billam-Smith. \"It might be a great atmosphere for him.\n\n\"But it's definitely not going to be the same as what I had. There's so many things that make it different.\n\n\"It's definitely different. I just sense it's so much different. It feels so much forced, this one, from his side of things. He's trying to talk about it being 'fate' and 'destiny' - almost relying on it. That's how I feel the energy's coming across. The 'destiny' talk is he hopes it's destiny, because he hasn't had the experience that I had before the Lawrence fight.\n\n\"I had a lot of good, important fights, which built me. I had a perfectly managed career up to that point, including the first fight with Richard - I built on that. He hasn't really had too many acid tests or gruelling fights. Especially not to prepare himself for me.\"\n\nBillam-Smith knocked Okolie down in the fourth, 10th and 11th rounds, before earning a majority decision that ought to have been unanimous.\n\n\"It was a dream occasion,\" he regardless said. \"The perfect fight for me at the stadium - it was a dream fight - and I had to just come through it and perform on the night and get the victory. It became the perfect night.\n\n\"The whole town got behind me, so I had my whole town to fight for. I had my family to fight for - my mum was ill at the time - and she gave me huge positivity, even when she told me her diagnosis [Carol had been diagnosed with breast cancer for the second time]. I just thought, 'Get through the fight', and deal with it after. My boy [Frank's] first birthday was the day before the fight. It was a lot of things to fight for. I was at my weigh-in on his first birthday, so I definitely owe him one for that, but it was a phenomenal night, for all those reasons.\n\n\"When you're hit with adversity you can deal with it in two ways. It's about using it, and then it makes the win all the sweeter - you've got problems with your family, or whatever it may be. It just adds more motivation, so it makes the victory all the sweeter.\n\n\"That's how I've always been. 'Focus on the task at hand.'

He plans being anything but cute on Saturday.\n\nWhittaker has taken a disliking to the ease at which Arenyeka was able to secure a spot on his stage, the latter having gate-crashed the Olympian's press conference ahead of his last fight against Leon Willings in order to call out Britain's rising star.\n\nHe has a demolition job in mind.\n\n\"You'll see I'm no undercard, I'm the main event on Saturday,\" said Whittaker. \"Every time you walk to the ring just know it's going to get scarier.\n\n\"When you're getting your hands wrapped take a deep breath, when you're tying your boots and putting your shorts on it will get scarier, it's ok.\n\n\"I'll take you through a couple rounds, it will be painful, every time you stumble I'll pick you back up, but don't worry it will be over before you know it.\n\n\"He's 12-0, 10 knockouts, more knockouts than I've got fights, but you'll see why I'm different to these guys. He's talked the talk, Saturday he's got to walk the walk.\"\n\nIt beckons as the biggest stage of Arenyeka's career, perhaps the biggest he will ever experience as he seeks to make the most of a surprise opportunity.\n\nWhile he has previously criticised Whittaker for disrespecting opponents with his showboating style, he too remains under no illusions as to the enormity of the task facing him.\n\n\"A new light heavyweight prospect is going to be born, British fans are in for a treat,\" he said on Thursday. \"Gate-crashing a press conference has got me here today. The hard work has been done, I have a great task to accomplish.\n\n\"He's a great fighter, an Olympian, slick, has good skills. I have good power, it's going to be a different ball game.\n\n\"I feel like a kid at Disney Land, this is what dreams are made of. I can't wait to perform, see what I'm made of and see what Ben is made of.\"\n\nBoxxer CEO Ben Shalom alluded towards a headline show for Whittaker later this year should all go to plan and he comes through Saturday with another commanding win.\n\nWhittaker hasn't come through a glistening amateur career and Olympic representation to take an opponent lightly, but knows bigger days lie ahead.\n\n\"If I'm honest, I'm in great spirits, when you have that feeling you know something special is going on,\" he said.\n\n\"He's taken his opportunity, but there's too much he has bitten off. On paper he might bang, but there are levels in this game for a reason.\n\n\"I'm always in the future, I like to look at the landscape but if you do that you forget the now, he might still be dangerous so I have to go out there and perform.\"\n\nSuited and booted with WBO cruiserweight world title in hand, Chris Billam-Smith cut a figure of confidence as he reiterated his intentions to conquer the power of Richard Riakporhe in this weekend's main event.\n\n\"I believe I'll stop him inside the distance. He's in for a shock,\" said the defending champion.\n\nBillam-Smith defends his title for the second time after dethroning Lawrence Okolie to become world champion in Bournemouth last year.\n\nIt featured among an emphatic response to suffering his first career loss to Riakporhe back in July 2019.\n\n\"The experience is everything, even the experience before that stadium fight where I'd headlined shows back home and had the big occasion which was the experience I needed.\n\n\"I'm different in so many ways, it (the first fight) is so irrelevant, I see it as a different person, it's almost like 20 years ago in boxing terms because I'm such a different fighter.\n\n\"It's been a great journey from then to now, the growth I've had is massive.\"\n\nNew territory comes in familiar territory for Riakporhe, his first world title shot coming in south London and at the home of his beloved Crystal Palace.\n\n\"It's a privilege, to have that south London support where we can resonate with each other, it's bred us and it's conditioned us for these moments, given us a different type of mentality,\" said Riakporhe.\n\n\"It's why we say we're cut from a different cloth. I get random people saying 'Rich I know you'll do it' because once we get these opportunities we take them with both hands.\n\n\"I'm very excited, I've been waiting for a very long time, I'm hungry and ready to challenge and take this title, then win some more.\"\n\nBoth Billam-Smith and Riakporhe have downplayed the idea their first fight will provide any inkling towards the outcome on Saturday.\n\nBut Riakporhe knows he can hit, and hit hard. He says he is ready for any version of Billam-Smith.\n\n\"The win is the most important thing, I'm a power puncher and look for knockouts, I always want to finish within the distance which is why people have grown to like me.\n\n\"We know how to skin a cat, there's many different ways.\"", "source": {"uri": "skysports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SkySports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Whittaker", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ben Whittaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_heavyweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Light heavyweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selhurst_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Selhurst Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxxer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boxxer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amateur boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disneyland", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disneyland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Riakporhe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Richard Riakporhe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Billam-Smith", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Billam-Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruiserweight_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cruiserweight (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Boxing_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Boxing Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crystal Palace F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South London"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Okolie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawrence Okolie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bournemouth", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bournemouth"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bournemouth"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Spirit/Fight_Songs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Spirit/Fight Songs", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Boxers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Boxers", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://e0.365dm.com/24/06/1600x900/skysports-ben-whittaker-boxxer_6580748.jpg?20240613154821", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9649073", "eventUri": "eng-9649073", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-07-", "textStart": 3576, "textEnd": 3585}], "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Okolie paused for thought and added: \"Lately, when I've been thinking about it, I think Chris has been to the well a few too many times. I think even in our fight, although he was able to come out with a win and got some knockdowns, it would have taken a lot more out of him than me. Since then, you've seen his eye continuously [cut] open, he boxed against [Mateusz] Masternak and it seemed like Masternak was winning that fight comfortably until Chris managed to find the two great body shots that put him out.\n\n\"It kind of begs the question, is he going to be able to go to that point again, to beat a tall, strong, good puncher like Riakporhe?\"\n\nOkolie admits that, having fought his former sparmate, Billam-Smith has improved over time and that surprised him. Riakporhe defeated Billam-Smith in a 10-rounder five years ago, but Okolie believes that the Shane McGuigan-trained champion has vastly improved.\n\n\"Agreed. I think it's something I took for granted because I was there thinking, I do this all the time, and all of a sudden it's a different kind of atmosphere [from sparring to actually fighting CBS] and a different kind of energy and even being in there with him, he felt different.\n\n\"He felt very much like he was [boxing] out of himself, just pushing. No matter how hard I pushed, even if I got knocked down, I was just like, 'Don't worry. Later, I'm going to get him'.\n\n\"But when we did get to the later rounds, and I started trying to push it, and [throw] more shots and go through the gears, he was able to grit it and sort of rally through those times when I thought they'd be enough to break him. It would have broken most people. It didn't. But I don't know if he will be able to do that again and again. Masternak was another one. Can he do it against Riakporhe again? I don't know.

Riakporhe came out victorious in a split decision to remain undefeated and give Billam-Smith his first career loss. The decision could have gone either way, but since then, Billam-Smith has had a better career. Billam-Smith has won ten on the bounce, which took him to his first world title by beating Lawrence Okolie last year.\n\nIt was a huge milestone to beat his former sparring partner, as Billam-Smith was seen as a massive underdog. A successful defense followed against Mateusz Masternak in his last fight. However, the performance left little to be desired. Billam-Smith was being outboxed before Masternak retired with a rib injury.\n\nRiakporhe's record is 17-0, with 13 stoppages. He has knocked out his last five opponents, as he will fancy his chances again. Riakporhe's last fight was a knockout victory against Dylan Bregeon. Riakporhe is fighting in front of his fans at Crystal Palace's Selhurst Park football stadium. Much like Billam-Smith who won his world title at Bournemouth Football Club's stadium against Okolie, Riakporhe will hope to do the same. FIGHT SPORTS caught up with Billam-Smith ahead of his fight.\n\nInterview\n\nInterviewer: What will be the biggest difference in fighting Richard this time around?\n\nChris: \"I think for me, just my development as an athlete and as a fighter, you know, the experience I've had since that's my first 50-50, fight...I watched it back, and I looked a boy in there compared to how I look now in the ring. So that is, yeah, huge, huge difference. But all the experience I've had since then, had 10 fights since then, loads of 12 rounders and, yeah, just the development I've had, the confidence, and just the experience has been invaluable.\"\n\nInterviewer: And how important is it for you to get revenge?\n\nChris: \"Yeah, I mean, it's important, important to me. You know, any athlete in any sport that loses wants to, wants to get one back, right? You see in the NBA, you know, teams getting beat in the playoffs one year, they use that as fuel for the next year...But I think more so in boxing than any other sport is people want to avenge their losses. So it's a great opportunity for me to do that.\"\n\nInterviewer: How are you keeping your emotions in check while chasing this revenge?\n\nChris: \"It's just motivation. Really, the revenge aspect, I'm very good at focusing on the task at hand and finite emotions don't come into it. It's just about doing, doing the job, following the game plan and getting the job done.\"\n\nInterviewer: And why do you feel you will get the job done this time around?\n\nChris: \"I think because the way I've developed since the first fight...The work I've put in over the years...So not only do I think I can beat Richard, I believe I can beat anyone.\"\n\nInterviewer: How tough is the mental aspect of your training camp?\n\nChris: \"I think the mental aspect of boxing is the most important. I think you can you see fighters that are physically talented and have everything, but the mentality side is the toughest part, and it's probably my best attribute...You just block out all the noise and then focus on the task at hand. But yeah, the mentality side is always the hardest. You always have up and down days. We're only human at the end of the day.\"\n\nInterviewer: Do you have any fight night superstitions at all?\n\nChris: \"No, not really just warm up routine. That's about it. No, no. I put my my wedding ring on. I tie that to my boots. But I do that every training session, mainly because I know I've got to take my boots off so I know I lose it. It's probably the only thing that I would definitely make sure that I do. But it's not necessarily superstition. It's just, so I don't lose my wedding ring.\"\n\nInterviewer: What's the difference for you in fighting in a stadium as opposed to, like, say, in an arena?\n\nChris: \"I won my world title in a football stadium back home in Bournemouth, and then, obviously, it's time to fight in another football stadium. And yes, it's different, but it's, it's an honour for me. I'm a football fan..Once upon a time, I was wanting to play in the Premier League, but wasn't quite good enough. I'm going to be fighting at my second Premier League football stadium. So it's a real honour for me, and something that, yeah, I'm going to, you know, really relish that, that opportunity. And obviously, stadium's got so many more more people than, you know, most arenas. So, yeah, so it's amazing. It creates a great atmosphere.\"\n\nInterviewer: And how important was it for you to make sure a percentage of every ticket sold went towards the Palace of Light Foundation?\n\nChris: \"I mean, to be fair, that was, that was Richard side of things. But I'm really glad that, you know, something like that is, is in place. I donate, usually some money from my five purses to my own charity, which I'm an ambassador for...If you with events like this, you've got to do more than just sell tickets and make money. You've got to try and make a difference when there's such a big event. And if you know, with it being at Crystal Palace, obviously, with that foundation there, it's great.\"\n\nInterviewer: Are there any boxers first that you emulate your style around?\n\nChris: \"Not necessarily, I take bits of of all different boxers, but you've got also be yourself. You know, so many people have tried to be Floyd Mayweather and failed. You've got to know your own strengths and weaknesses and do that. You know, I'm a fan of many fighters. George Groves is one of my favourite fighters, but I wouldn't say we box very similar. You know, we've got quite different but Andre Ward, this stuff that he does, which I love watching, you know, that he used to do in his career, and he adapted really well in all his fights. And I think the big factor is being able to adapt to each opponent.\"\n\nInterviewer: Are there any athletes that you learn from that aren't boxers?\n\nChris: \"And, yeah, there's, you know, LeBron James. I'm a fan of him, the way he sort of looks after himself, you know, outside of doing all the recovery stuff and all those sort of things, there's Roger Federer, the way he carries himself. Such a class act. Justine, there's a documentary coming out on him. A lot of inspiration from a lot of great athletes, you know, like I said, Roger Federer, but also Serena Williams, what she did in in tennis, yeah. Then, you know, obviously, I've always been inspired by footballers as well, because that was always my sport...like Frank Lampard. I remember he was a footballer for Chelsea back in the day and England, and I read his autobiography and his his work ethic and everything really resonated with me and something that I've sort of lived by. So yes, there's plenty of phenomenal athletes, and you just try and learn from as many people as you can.\"\n\nInterviewer: One year from now, where do you want to be in the sport?\n\nChris: \"Politics can get in the way of timings of fights and stuff. But yeah, I want to have at least, at least two bouts a year from now.\"\n\nInterviewer: And do you see yourself as a lifetime cruiserweight, or will you think you're about maybe moving up to heavyweight at some point?\n\nChris: \"I think I'll probably stay at cruiserweight realistically. The heavyweights now are giants, and you have to be generational talent like Usyk, I think, to be able to be able to go up and deal with those boys so and, you know, I'm, no Usyk...I've grown into the weight I was naturally a cruiserweight...Now I feel really comfortable.\"\n\nWhere To Watch Info\n\nYou can watch the fight in the following territories\n\nJapan\n\nFiji/Pacific Islands - Kiribati,

He came through with a split decision win, which could have gone either way. Since then, Riakporhe's career has gone from strength-to-strength. He has developed a reputation for being one one of the biggest punchers in the division. Riakporhe has stopped his last five opponents. The cruiserweight will hope to do the same in front of a home crowd at Crystal Palace's Selhurst Park football stadium.\n\nBillam-Smith is the champion. Since his defeat to Riakporhe, he has won ten consecutive fight. He picked up the belt by beating his former sparring partner Lawrence Okolie in 2023. He followed it up with a successful title defense against Mateusz Masternak. However, the performance was below-par. Billam-Smith was being outboxed before Masternark retired with a rib injury. FIGHT SPORTS caught up with Riakporhe ahead of his fight.\n\nInterview\n\nInterviewer: What's the biggest difference in fighting Chris Bill Smith this time around?\n\nRichard: \"The biggest difference is he's a champion. So the mentality would have changed to some extent, and it's about overcoming that. He probably believes that he's going to be reigning champion after this fight and going to do all the things that he's planned for himself, and that's something that I have to deal with when it comes to fighting.\"\n\nInterviewer: Is it important to get a knockout?\n\nRichard: \"Yes, that's important. I put a lot of pressure on myself to perform, and we did everything that we need to do to believe we'll get the victory in devastating fashion.\"\n\nInterviewer: How are you keeping your emotions in check?\n\nRichard: \"Just really enjoying the moment. When it comes to fight week, I'm always chilled, relaxed, happy, because I've done the hard part. The easy part for me is always performing. The fights are always easy for me, because I always see my opponent as myself. When I'm in camp, I aim to conquer myself. Every single day, when I conquer myself, I believe I'm unbeatable. Nobody can beat me, and that's what we did in this family.\"\n\nInterviewer: Why do you feel you'll beat him this time around for a second time?\n\nRichard: \"I just believe I have everything it takes. I think the preparation has been excellent. I've prepared meticulously. I pushed myself past my limits and did everything I need to do to win.\"\n\nInterviewer: How is it different preparing for a rematch than preparing for someone you've never fought before?\n\nRichard: \"I think preparing for somebody you've never fought before is a bit different, because you have to gauge their timing. You have to understand how they move. You get comfortable with them, and then you can step on the gas. When you've fought someone before, you understand how they move, what they did in the fight, things that you noticed on that night. It's all about just dealing with those things if they happen again.\"\n\nInterviewer: What's different about fighting in a stadium, and you're in your home, you're in your backyard. Does that give you an advantage?\n\nRichard: Yeah, fighting in your backyard definitely gives you an advantage. When you have your own support, they're lifting your energy. They bring a different energy, which in my opinion, is momentum. When people are cheering you on, you might be tired, you might be having tough times in a fight, and that extra push, those roars and shouts, will push you a bit further to do things you didn't realize you were capable of doing. Chris Billam-Smith knows exactly what I'm talking about, because he won the title at the Bournemouth Vitality Stadium, his favorite football team's stadium. He had that support behind him. I felt like it was his time, but on the 15th, it's going to be my time.\n\nInterviewer: Are there any boxers you emulate your fighting style on?\n\nRichard: I think I have a unique, rough, and rugged style. It's a mixture of different fighters that I watch. The ones I mention are Mike McCallum, Sugar Ray. I don't like to have a particular style to be honest. I like to be able to change it in any way I can, so I'm not predictable.\n\nInterviewer: One year from now, where do you see yourself?\n\nRichard: I see myself on top of the world, and I see myself as a heavyweight fighter.\n\nInterviewer: Who do you see yourself facing when you move up to heavyweight?\n\nRichard: You know, the landscape of the heavyweights changes quite frequently. But I want to get right in the mix. Anybody, I don't really mind who I face. The only thing will be dependent on the size of the fighters, but I feel like the heavyweights are coming back to that size like myself. I'm about six foot five. Most of them, like Usyk for example, are around 220 pounds. You obviously have bigger ones like Zhang, who's 260, but I reckon I'll be around 230 to 240 pounds and mixing it with the guys that are on the fringe of world-level.\n\nWhere To Watch Info\n\nYou can

He lost the 2019 clash as Riakporhe won in a split decision. The fight could have gone either way. However, Billam-Smith had to contend with his first loss. He bounced back, winning ten on the spin, to acquire the belt from Lawrence Okolie. He made the first defense of his belt with an unconvincing win over Mateusz Masternak.\n\nRiakporhe is a heavy handed fighter, who will fight in front of his home fans. He has 17 wins in his undefeated record. 13 of those are by knockout, with five stoppage wins in a row. His last fight was a victory over Dylan Bregeon. If he wins, Riakporhe will have fulfilled a life long dream of becoming a world champion.\n\nYou can watch the fight in the following territories\n\nJapan\n\nFiji/Pacific Islands - Kiribati, Tonga,

Mr Fleming was speaking during a debate calling on the Government to withdraw plans for legislation to end the triple lock which requires UN approval as well as that of the Government and the D\u00e1il before the Defence Forces are sent on peacekeeping missions. Mr Fleming had asked PBP \u201cwhat planet are you living on? The world has changed since the last general election,\u201d as he cited the war in Ukraine. When he made reference to \u201cpuppets of Putin\u201d, People Before Profit TD Paul Murphy intervened and demanded that he withdraw the comment. Mr Fleming insisted when he was asked by acting chair Michael Ring if he would withdraw the remark that he was \u201creferring to no Deputy\u201d and \u201cI didn\u2019t mention any names\u201d. But Mr Murphy and party colleague Br\u00edd Smith insisted he had and demanded he withdraw the remark. Mr Murphy said it was in Oireachtas regulations that it was forbidden to accuse a TD of being under the influence of outside interests. In the uproar acting chair Michael Ring suspended the House. When it resumed Mr Fleming was asked if he was withdrawing his comment and said that while he was not referring to any TDs \u201cif the cap fits they can wear it\u201d. After another request from the chair he said he withdrew the remark for any TD who \u201cfeels the comments were directed at them\u201d. Earlier, opening the debate Ms Smith said T\u00e1naiste Miche\u00e1l Martin insists on inserting the word \u201cmilitary\u201d before the word \u201cneutrality\u201d because \u201cyou want to ignore how the Irish people think of neutrality and to gut the word of its real meaning\u201d. The Dublin South-Central TD said neutrality for the majority of Irish people \u201carises from our experience of colonialism. It is linked to an anticolonial sentiment. We do not want to support any empire. We know that behind the sweet talk of defending small nations lies a brutal arrogance.\u201d She said \u201cthere are still colonies left, Palestine being one of them. There is a hierarchy in this world and it is based on military and economic power. That hierarchy is called imperialism.\u201d Ms Smith said \u201cthe plain reality is that you want to remove the triple lock because you want us to move from a sideline substitute in US imperialism to a full player. That is what you want. You want to send Irish troops abroad to fight wars on behalf of the US and the European Union.\u201d But Mr Fleming insisted that her party were \u201con the wrong side of history\u201d and said he had never in his lifetime an invasion of Russia into Europe. He said PBP talked about neutrality or military neutrality. \u201cYou know and we all know the Irish people are not one bit neutral when it comes to Israel and the Palestinians. We are not a neutral country politically or ideologically.\u201d Ireland is not neutral when it comes to an aggressive country \u201ckilling innocent people who are powerless to defend themselves. Similarly Irish people are not one bit neutral it comes to Russia and Ukraine and what Putin has done in Ukraine.\u201d But Ms Smith reiterated that she was opposed to \u201cthe US empire and I equally oppose their Russian and China rivals\u201d. Her party colleague Richard Boyd Barrett said that \u201cFianna F\u00e1il leaders had gone over and hobnobbed with Putin. We never have. In fact we have comrades languishing in Russian prisons at the moment because they oppose Putin\u2019s bloody war in Ukraine.\u201d Sign up for push alerts and have the best news, analysis and comment delivered directly to your phoneJoin The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to dateListen to our Inside Politics podcast for the best political chat and analysis", "summary": "Se\u00e1n Fleming subsequently withdrew remark in case anyone \u2018felt the comments were directed at them\u2019", "url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/politics/2024/05/29/dail-suspended-as-pbp-claim-minister-of-state-called-them-puppets-of-putin/", "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/SMizUvunNanLQHM2URLFqOPRPPM=/1600x900/filters:format(jpg):quality(70):focal(2504x1560:2514x1570)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/2U4UB6SCA5OJHOQOXGMZLXLXUA.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:53:08", "author": "Marie O'halloran", "authors": ["Marie O'halloran"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": 0.014}

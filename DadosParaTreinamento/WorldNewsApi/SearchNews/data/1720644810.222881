(Photo by Stacy Revere/Getty ... [+] Images) Getty Images As the 2024 NFL season approaches, the NFC North is gaining support as either the strongest or second-strongest division in the league. Much of that is due to the improvement that the Detroit Lions demonstrated last season in winning the division and two playoff games before falling short to the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Championship Game. One of the other factors resulting in greater respect for the division was the late-season surge of the Green Bay Packers. The 2023 season was supposed to be something of a bridge year for the Packers with Jordan Love taking over for Aaron Rodgers. Love improved steadily as he gained more experience under center, and the Packers made the playoffs as the No. 7 seed when they won their final three games of the regular season. A beat down by the second-seeded Dallas Cowboys was expected in the Wild-Card round, but the opposite happened. The Packers rolled to a 48-32 victory and it took a late Dallas surge to get the score that close. Love was sensational against the Cowboys, completing 16 of 21 passes for 272 yards with 3 touchdowns and no interceptions. Green Bay followed with another excellent game in the divisional playoffs against the 49ers, but they fell just short in a 24-21 loss. Jared Goff of the Lions and Love are two of the better quarterbacks in the league, and both Detroit and Green Bay have Super Bowl aspirations. The Chicago Bears and Minnesota Vikings are hoping to show significant growth this year at the quarterback position after making huge changes in the offseason.

(Photo by ... [+] Michael Reaves/Getty Images) Getty Images The Bears have been waiting for a top of the line signal caller since Jim McMahon led the legendary Monsters of the Midway to the 1985 Super Bowl. They used the No. 1 pick in the draft to select Caleb Williams as their QB1, and he is already listed as the starter after they sent Justin Fields to the Pittsburgh Steelers in an offseason trade. The Vikings let Kirk Cousins leave through free agency and they did not shed any tears when he signed with the Atlanta Falcons. The Vikings drafted Michigan quarterback J.J. McCarthy to serve as their quarterback of the future. They also signed veteran Sam Darnold to play the position until McCarthy is ready. The presence of a quarterback guru in head coach Kevin O\u2019Connell should give the Vikings some decent play at the position, and it would not be a shock if the ultra-competitive McCarthy took over as the starter before midseason. While the Lions and Packers are clearly the two best teams in the division, both the Bears and the Vikings are expected to put a much better product on the field in 2024 than they did last year. Whether that results in improved won-loss records \u2013 both teams were 7-10 last year \u2013 is debatable. However, both teams appear more complete than they were in 2023. The fantasy rankings of NFL quarterbacks at Bettor In Green will be informative as the season progresses. Can Goff continue to lead the Lions on a consistent basis as he did last year? Will Love become a superstar at the position for the Packers. Can Williams come in and provide the Bears with the competent quarterback play that has been missing for decades? When will McCarthy take over for Darnold in Minnesota, and can he win games consistently in the NFL? Quarterback play is dependent on far more than just the signal caller\u2019s ability. The No. 1 factor is the health and effectiveness of the offensive line that is required to protect the quarterback. The talent and depth at the receiver position is the No. 2 factor. A complementary running game is also needed to take the pressure off the quarterback and the passing game. All four of these teams can at least make the argument that they have the quarterbacks and the other factors needed to become winners on the field and from a fantasy perspective. The collective optimism within the division is quite unusual, but it is justified as the 2024 season looms. Follow me on Twitter. Check out some of my other work here.

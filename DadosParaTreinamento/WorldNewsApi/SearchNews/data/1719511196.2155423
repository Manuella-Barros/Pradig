But a rising number are now doing so, and \"some major retailers are starting to implement the ability to do this in the future,\" said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. The average cash discount has been about 5 cents to 10 cents per gallon, De Haan said. Meanwhile, more stations are also offering their own payment platform \u2014 like branded debit and credit cards \u2014 that yield even more savings than cash, he added. Discounts are also \"very prevalent\" when paying for health care, said Carolyn McClanahan, a certified financial planner and physician based in Jacksonville, Florida. McClanahan is also a member of the CNBC Financial Advisor Council. Some big-ticket spending \u2014 like tax bills and college tuition \u2014 is also generally best accomplished with cash, said Schulz. The IRS and many universities pass on payment-processing costs to the consumer. (In these cases, that might mean writing a check.) \"There are certainly some bigger times when you should probably not use credit cards because of the fees involved,\" he said.", "summary": "More merchants are giving discounts to consumers who pay with cash, or putting surcharges on credit card purchases.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/26/when-paying-with-cash-can-be-better-than-credit-card.html", "image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107419513-1716496417225-gettyimages-170955646-000021899071_Unapproved.jpeg?v=1716496450", "video": "https://pdl-iphone-cnbc-com.akamaized.net/VCPS/Y2024/M05D09/7000339737/1715255290-34454294830-hd_L.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-05-26 15:53:40", "author": "Greg Iacurci", "authors": ["Greg Iacurci"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.151}

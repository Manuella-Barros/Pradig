{"id": 223712816, "title": "PICTORIAL: Gaya Residents Protest Dissolution Of Emirate", "text": "Some residents of Gaya who oppose the disbandment of their Emirate, on Sunday trooped to the streets, protesting the repeal of the Kano Emirates Council Law 2019. The recent repeal of the law by the Kano House of Assembly and its subsequent assent by Governor Abba Yusuf has sparked controversies among the residents across the state. The abolished law, initially established by former Governor Abdullahi Ganduje in 2020, led to the creation of additional four new emirates comprising Rano, Gaya, Karaye, and Bichi after the dethronement of Muhammadu Sanusi II in 2020. Four years later however, the Kano State government\u2019s decision to dissolve these emirates has been greeted with reactions from the affected communities, particularly, in Gaya. A resident of the dissolved emirate, Nura Zafi Gaya, reacting to the development said, \u201cWe, the people of Gaya, are not happy. The government deposed our emir. We wish they would reconsider this injustice.\u201d Another resident, Adam, highlighted the positive impact of the emirates, saying, \u201cThe emirates have brought about a lot of positive change to the community, yet for no reason, they decided to dissolve them.\u201d Also speaking to LEADERSHIP, Musa Da\u2019u Gaya expressed his disapproval to the abolished law, noting that the emirate provided jobs and amenities for Gaya, and argued that the personal discontent of a few should not outweigh the will of the many. The demonstrators who conducted themselves peacefully, emphasised their belief that the dissolution was politically motivated. The deposed Emir of Gaya, Alhaji Aliyu Ibrahim Abdulkadir, had stated in an interview with BBC that he has complied with the governor\u2019s order and vacated the palace. \u201cI see this decision as fate and I accept it. If I say I will challenge it in court, it means I am fighting against what has already been destined,\u201d he said, indicating his decision to avoid confrontation with the government. Residents confirmed that the former Emir left the palace at midnight on Thursday. After the protest, the demonstrators gathered at the Gaya Eid Mosque grounds to perform two Raka\u2019ats prayers, seeking the continued sustenance of peace and harmony in their region. Meanwhile, life in Kano metropolis continued as usual despite the controversies surrounding the dethronement of Alhaji Aminu Ado Bayero. Business activities at motor parks and filling stations have remained open as residents go about their engagements without any hitch. There was however noticeable security presence around the Nasarawa mini palace where the deposed Emir resides as well as the main palace where the reinstated Emir of Kano, Muhammad Sanusi II and Governor Yusuf are accommodated as the standoff between the two parties continues.", "summary": "&#160; Some residents of Gaya who oppose the disbandment of their Emirate, on Sunday trooped to the streets, protesting the repeal of the Kano Emirates Council Law 2019.

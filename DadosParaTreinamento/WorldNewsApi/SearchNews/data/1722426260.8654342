Emily, 26, is stepping up to the plate to allow her parents, Neil and Muriel Elford a \u201cwell-deserved step back\u201d. One of the new boss\u2019s first acts will be launching a new \u201ccosy and comfortable\u201d cafe, serving loaded fries, burgers and more. This week, they brought in friends and family to sample the food at the new Pie Bob\u2019s cafe before they open to the public this coming Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s been really exciting, and quite emotional,\u201d says Emily. \u201cOn Monday, we had some tables in and I actually had to walk away for a minute because I got quite emotional about it.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve had the business for about 23 years now, and I\u2019ve always been in about it. \u201cBeing around it for so long, I\u2019ve seen the business go through all these highs and lows. \u201cSo to have it get to the point it is now and have people so excited, it\u2019s really an overwhelming thing.\u201d Pie lovers do not fret, you are not losing the takeaway bakery. The new cafe is in the same building as Pie Bob\u2019s bakery, with nine tables and some benches where guests can enjoy the brand new menu. Emily\u2019s Pie Bob\u2019s journey started at 4 years old Emily\u2019s family has been running Pie Bob\u2019s for the last 23 years. \u201cI was always in here,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019d finish school and I\u2019d be straight into the bakery. \u201cProbably bumbling about, annoying people,\u201d Emily laughs. \u201cI\u2019d have been about four or five.\u201d \u201cThe first thing I remember doing, is we used to do Cornish pasties, handmade ones. \u201cAnd because I had such little hands, I used to crimp the pasties. \u201cThere\u2019s a really specific way you have to do it, and the smaller your hands, the better. \u201cSo I used to do that a lot. And I must have been about six or seven when I did that. \u201cI used to wear the big blue hair nets and everything.\u201d \u2018I have had to work for it\u2019 Emily is excited about taking the reins for this new chapter for Pie Bob\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019ve been around it for so long, it\u2019s like second nature to me,\u201d she adds. \u201cAnything that I\u2019ve tried outside the business, I\u2019ve always ended up coming back here. \u201cI do get a lot of people with the argument \u2018you\u2019ve just had it handed it to you\u2019 or \u2018you\u2019ve not really had to work for it. \u201cBut I have had to work for it. \u201cMy dad is one of these people that if he didn\u2019t think I was working for it, he would point blank say to me \u2018this is not for you, go do something else\u2019.\u201d Emily says her husband, Gabriel, has been a great help along the way. \u201cHe has come from a military background and he has been very much thrown into it. \u201cI bounce absolutely everything off of him.\u201d The team at the Pie Bob\u2019s is what Emily enjoys most about the business. \u201cThis is going to sound cheesy,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re a family business, and a lot of the people that work here have been working for us for quite a long time. \u201cAnd we really are like a little family. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice group of people we\u2019ve got here. \u201cIt\u2019s a comforting place to be. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, the place drives me mad sometimes, but it\u2019s something that I love.\u201d What\u2019s on the menu at the new Pie Bob\u2019s cafe? The menu at the Pie Bob\u2018s cafe includes some set dishes, like burgers, loaded fries, cooked breakfast, and macaroni and cheese, as well as daily specials. Emily\u2019s personal favourite is one of the loaded fries dishes. \u201cWe\u2019ve got three different types of loaded fries,\u201d she says. \u201cOne of them is skin-on fries, salt and pepper Chinese chicken, a cheese sauce, and topped with spring onion. It\u2019s so good!\u201d Pie Bob\u2019s new cafe will open to the public on Monday July 1.", "summary": "Pie Bob's bakery has opened a new cafe onsite, serving loaded fries, burgers and more.", "url": "https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/lifestyle/5023318/new-cafe-arbroath-pie-bobs-rising-star/", "image": "https://www.thecourier.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2024/06/KCes_Pie_Bobs_Cafe_Rising_Star_Arbroath_27.06.24-69_58702131-3960upyzs-scaled-e1719494151989.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 05:00:07", "author": "Joanna Bremner", "authors": ["Joanna Bremner"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.297}

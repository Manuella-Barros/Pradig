The case, filed on April 17, 2024, at the Lagos State High Court, through his lawyers, Dr. Olaniyi Arije, Okey Barrah, and others, stated Davido's requests for joint custody or, alternatively, unfettered and unrestricted access to his daughter.\n\nAccording to a 44-paragraph affidavit deposed to by Davido, he stated that while he had a relationship with Momodu that resulted in the birth of their child on May 14, 2015, the relationship ended several years ago \"while we resolved to take care of our child as biological father and mother.\"\n\nDavido stated that he has been the one responsible for Imade's school fees and the rent for the flat where Sophia and Imade live and claims to have purchased a N200 million apartment at Oniru, Victoria Island, Lagos for them, which Momodu rejected and instead demanded annual rent payments of N5 million.\n\n\"That it is on record that I have been responsible for the payment of all the school fees of my daughter to provide her with the best education possible and to meet all her educational needs without a hitch,\" Davido stated.\n\n\"That I have also been providing money for the rent of the apartment where the respondent resides with our daughter.\"\n\n\"The respondent rejected the offer to stay and live at the above-described secured Oniru apartment, which had been purchased already, but demanded that I continue to pay N5,000,000 annually for a rented facility as my own contribution towards my daughter's accommodation.\"\n\nThe Grammy nominee added that to ensure that Imade was well-catered for, he provided vehicles for transportation, including a Range Rover Sport Utility Vehicle and a Highlander SUV, alongside funds for vehicle maintenance.

anguish.\n\n\"That sequel to the information about the said condition of the vehicle, I provided another vehicle, Highlander SUV, and in addition, the sum of N5.8m as requested by her for the repair

When he asked Ms Momodu about it, she said the Range Rover SUV was faulty.\n\nHowever, he noted that she only informed him of the issue after the school contacted him.\n\n\"That sequel to the information about the said condition of the vehicle, I provided another vehicle, Highlander SUV, and in addition, the sum of N5.8m as requested by her for the repair of the Range Rover SUV, making it two vehicles in the custody and use of the respondent and our daughter.\"\n\n\"I also made commitments to pay for living expenses, the nanny's fees to our child, provide medical and health care, insurance, periodic international travel expenses, and tickets.

I still think Momodu is perfect, as I'm both Mom and Dad.\"\n\nHowever, in 2021, the entrepreneur posted on her Instagram page that she was hurt when her daughter took Davido's last name instead of hers.\n\nShe wrote, \"I remember my Mom and aunties laughing at me when I was crying because my daughter's last name wasn't going to be Momodu.\n\n\"I was genuinely distraught.

Despite his efforts to provide for his child's well-being, Davido alleges that Momodu has been making unreasonable demands, seemingly designed to harass and frustrate him.\n\nNotably, she allegedly rejected his offer to provide a luxurious apartment worth N200 million in a gated community on Victoria Island, Lagos, which features amenities like a swimming pool, 24-hour power and water supply, and round-the-clock security.\n\nHe said, \"The respondent rejected the offer to stay and live at the above-described secured Oniru apartment, which had been purchased already, but demanded that I continue to pay N5,000,000 annually for a rented facility as my own contribution towards my daughter's accommodation.\"\n\nDavido further emphasized his commitment to his daughter's well-being by purchasing a Range Rover SUV to cater to her transportation needs, including daily trips to and from school. However, his efforts were met with resistance.\n\nHe revealed that he received a concerning call from Imade's school last year, informing him that she had been absent for two weeks. Upon inquiring about the situation from Momodu, she made excuses and complained about the condition of the Range Rover, yet failed to notify him about the issue beforehand, further frustrating his attempts to provide for his child's needs.\n\nDavido further stated that upon learning of the Range Rover's condition, he promptly provided an additional vehicle, a Highlander SUV, and also gave Momodu N5.8 million to repair the Range Rover, effectively putting two vehicles at her and their daughter's disposal. He emphasized his dedication to their child's well-being by committing to cover various expenses, including living costs, nanny fees, medical and healthcare costs, insurance, and international travel expenses, ensuring their daughter's needs are comprehensively met.\n\nHe added that \"notwithstanding my efforts in the overall interest of my daughter, the respondent has continued to make outlandish and Utopian demands to frustrate me.\"\n\nDavido also alleged that Momodu demanded he pay the nanny she hired a monthly salary of $800, equivalent to $19,600 annually, which he deemed excessive.\n\nDespite his efforts to provide for their daughter's well-being, Davido claimed that Momodu has consistently treated him with cruelty and caused him significant emotional pain.\n\nIn light of these circumstances, Davido is seeking a court order granting him joint custody of their daughter, Imade Adeleke, to ensure a more collaborative and harmonious approach to her care and upbringing.\n\nFollow the Sahara Reporters channel on WhatsApp: https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029VaFClvtH5JM6SSsP7M2Y", "source": {"uri": "saharareporters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sahara Reporters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davido", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Davido"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quality of life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P.M._News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "P.M.

The model and her superstar husband, Justin Bieber, have been dodging baby speculation for more than a year. However, after a recent trip to Hawaii where Hailey was seen wearing a flowy white dress, fans were convinced she was concealing a baby bump. Although neither Bieber has confirmed any news about starting a family, their followers believe that they may be getting ready to make a big announcement at none other than the star-studded Met Gala. A red carpet statement would be huge from the couple, who are also at the center of marriage and divorce rumors.\n\nAccording to The U.S. Sun, fans who think that Hailey may be expecting are hoping to see some definitive proof when she attends the Met Gala. The celebrity event is set to take place in the coming days, and if she wears a form-fitting gown, a baby bump could be easy to spot. Hailey has already confirmed that she'll be at the ball, but it's currently unclear whether Justin will accompany her.\n\n\"I guess we'll know for sure Monday,\" one person stated, referencing Hailey Bieber's appearance at the upcoming Met Gala.\" Met Gala Monday! Coming up soon. I'm very curious to see will these rumors be true or will they finally fizzle out because she won't be pregnant at the met. We shall see soon!\" another fan said. Meanwhile, a third person claimed that they would be \"shocked\" if the model was expecting after seeing her with Justin Bieber at Coachella last month.\n\nIn addition, fans have noticed that Hailey has been rocking baggy clothes lately. However, the pregnancy rumors have only been overshadowed by rumors that she and Justin are having marital issues. Headlines about a possible divorce have taken over. The singer's behavior has also fueled the gossip.\n\nPreviously, it appeared that Justin may not be living with Hailey on a regular basis. He also took off for a boys' weekend shortly after being seen with his wife at Coachella. Of course, the rumors are pure speculation at this time.\n\nWhatever the future holds for Justin Bieber, fans are wishing him well.

Watch the video (below):\n\n@symonhits1\n\nBreaking Bieber news!!!! #haileybieber #justinbieber\n\n\u266c original sound - Symon\n\nOf course, take the pregnancy allegation with a grain of salt. Neither Hailey nor Justin confirmed their having a baby. And we could be dealing with a Daniel Tosh situation here! As you may recall, the comedian recently claimed he heard from a \"random grocery store person\" that the Kardashians filmed their season finale at the store, during which it revealed Kylie Jenner was pregnant with Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet's baby. However, production for The Kardashians fired back!Us Weekly reported the famous family's Hulu show never filmed any scenes in a grocery store this season. Notably, they didn't shut down the baby claim. But then, Kylie entered the chat! She shut down the pregnancy rumors by grabbing a sushi meal in a crop top that showed off her flat tummy.\n\nSo with all that in mind, proceed with caution when it comes to the new claim about Justin and Hailey! Whether the pair will confirm or deny the allegations soon, we'll see! However, you may recall the 27-year-old model once told W Magazine last year she would pull a Kylie and keep her pregnancy a secret!

His marriage with Hailey Bieber is under strain, his career is experiencing a downturn, he's coping with the loss of a dear friend, and his name has resurfaced in connection with rapper Sean Diddy Combs's legal troubles. The cumulative effect of these events could be taking a toll on him, potentially more than initially perceived.\n\nWhen Justin Bieber first took over the music world with his massive hit song Baby, he was 14. His Belieber fans were crazy over the pop star. Despite his incredible musical talent, one of the things his fans loved the most about him was his signature Justin Bieber hair. His long, swept-to-the-side hairstyle was the envy of all teen boys and quickly became his trademark.\n\nOf course, Justin Bieber has grown up, and his hairstyle has changed several times. But he always took great pride in his hair. Now that he is 30, and life happens, recent reports reveal that stress and genetics may have taken a toll on the one thing the singer loved most: his hair.\n\nThe Daily Mail reports that Dr. Gary Linkov has outed Justin Bieber's secret transformation. The doctor claims that there are signs that Justin recently underwent a hair transplant. The New York City plastic surgeon states that, in his professional opinion, Justin Bieber has undergone a hair transplant to restore volume in his locks.\n\nDr. Linkov states that photo evidence reveals that Justin's hairline has miraculously changed within two years. He also claims that hair transplant surgery could explain why Justin Bieber was rarely seen without a hat or hoodie covering his head.\n\n\"There's no medication that's going to turn a receding hairline around. I think, based on [photos], I would say, he has likely had a hair restoration surgery, \" stated the doctor.\n\nThe plastic surgeon also adds that it takes at least a year before hair transplant surgery begins to replace the lost hair. That, along with the fact that Justin and Hailey Bieber's marital problems have likely added an enormous amount of stress, he believes the timing and signs all add up.\n\nJustin and Hailey are currently on a Hawaiian getaway. Sources close to the couple claim they are dedicated to working through their marital differences. Rumors circulate that the pair may make a big announcement soon. According to their fans, they believe that Hailey and Justin are expecting a Baby Bieber. This is another crucial reason they want to work through their relationship issue.\n\nRegarding Justin's alleged secret hair transplant surgery, his fans would care less if it were true. They say they want him to have a happy life and hopefully get back to recording his music. As for the baby rumors, time will soon tell, even if Hailey and Justin Bieber don't.", "source": {"uri": "thenerdstash.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Nerd Stash"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joann_scheffler@thenerdstash.com", "name": "Joann Scheffler", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Bieber", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Justin Bieber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_transplantation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hair transplantation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hairstyle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hairstyle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hailey_Bieber", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hailey Bieber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sean Combs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Outing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trademark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_surgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plastic surgery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surgery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://media.thenerdstash.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Justin-Bieber.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537932", "eventUri": "eng-9537932", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

The custom piece features a large oval-cut diamond set on a simple gold band. Solow told PEOPLE Justin had \"a hand in selecting the diamond\" and put a lot of thought into the design of the ring.\n\nThe \"Baby\" singer proposed to his bride-to-be in July 2018 at a local restaurant in The Bahamas. While the pair had newly rekindled their relationship a month before, a source told PEOPLE at the time that Justin was deeply committed to the relationship.\n\n\"This is not a joke to him. He proposed because he truly feels Hailey is the love of his life,\" the insider said. \"He had a rough time last year, but he worked very hard to change and find more meaning in his life. Hailey couldn't make him happier.\"\n\nRelated: Justin Bieber and Hailey Bieber's Relationship Timeline\n\nThe couple tied the knot a few months later in September 2018, at a courthouse in New York City.

Though the ring features a massive oval-cut diamond -- estimated to be between 6 to 10 carats -- it's set on a plain 18K gold band.\n\nThe engagement ring was designed by Solow, a private jeweler based at N.Y.C.'s family-run jewelry store Solow & Co. The jeweler met Justin through his manager, Scooter Braun, who recommended that the singer visit Solow to choose the perfect stone for Hailey.\n\nJustin chose the ring to \"accentuate Hailey's beautifully shaped hands\"\n\nSpeaking with PEOPLE in July 2018, Solow said that Justin carefully planned his future wife's ring and was very involved in the process that took a \"few weeks\" to complete.\n\n\"In the end, Justin wanted something that would gracefully accentuate Hailey's beautifully shaped hands. We settled on an oval stone that was just exceptional in its length and grace,\" he said. \"Justin gave this a lot of thought. When I saw him, I think he was very happy about what we did together. He was in a very good head space for the decision he was making.\"\n\nSolow added, \"I showed him all the details and all the intricacies like I would give any other 25-year-old boy who would come to the office to buy an engagement ring. He seemed really excited. He was looking inside the diamond with the [jeweler's] loupe, and said, 'I think I see Hailey's face.' \"\n\nThe pair were on a romantic vacation in The Bahamas when the singer got down on one knee. They intended to keep the engagement a secret, but the happy news spread quickly, and two days later, Justin made the official announcement on his Instagram.\n\n\"Was gonna wait a while to say anything but word travels fast, listen plain and simple Hailey I am soooo in love with everything about you!\" he wrote in the caption. \"My heart is COMPLETELY and FULLY YOURS and I will ALWAYS put you first! You are the love of my life Hailey Baldwin and I wouldn't want to spend it with anybody else. You make me so much better and we compliment each other so well!! Can't wait for the best season of life yet!\"\n\nThe singer also revealed the significance of their engagement date in his post, as they \"got engaged on the seventh day of the seventh month,\" and the number seven is the \"number of spiritual perfection.\"\n\nShortly after, Hailey posted on X (formerly Twitter): \"Not sure what I did in life to deserve such happiness but I am so utterly grateful to God for giving me such an incredible person to share my life with! No words could ever express my gratitude.\"\n\nWhile their whirlwind engagement seemed sudden to the public, the couple had been friends for years and previously dated. \"He knew a couple of weeks ago that he wanted to propose,\" a source told PEOPLE at the time. \"He sees marriage as something very special. He would never propose if he wasn't crazy about Hailey. It might seem spontaneous, but it wasn't. He felt in his heart that this was right. He doesn't want Hailey to ever be the one that got away.\"\n\nHailey wears two wedding bands\n\nThe model completed her wedding ring set with two bands from Tiffany & Co. She wears both the Tiffany Soleste 18-karat gold diamond-encrusted band (valued at $3,125) and the Tiffany Soleste 18-karat gold and diamond V-ring (valued at $2,150). The set matches Justin's simple Tiffany Classic 18-karat gold wedding band ring.\n\nA day after their wedding in September 2019, Justin gave fans a first glimpse at their wedding bands when he posted two black-and-white snaps of the pair on Instagram. He captioned the shots, \"Looking forward to forever with you @haileybieber.\"\n\nHailey and Justin previously wore matching silver wedding bands\n\nThough the couple exchanged new bling at their South Carolina wedding, they previously wore matching silver wedding bands.

Other times, it looks like Hailey's paying Selena the sincerest form of flattery -- by copying everything from her tattoos to her makeup business.\n\nEver since Hailey Bieber launched Rhode, fans and critics have been comparing the two beauty brands.\n\nThere are many aspects of Hailey's choices where she has seemed to follow in Selena Gomez's footsteps. Most obviously, her husband dated Selena off and on for years.\n\nHailey also has a tattoo that is eerily similar to one of Selena's. A number of her choices on social media have seemed to mirror Selena's.\n\nIn a recent Reddit post, the social media site's denizens noted that Hailey's product line, promotional photos, and even Rhode offices bear a striking similarity to Selena's.\n\n\"Is Hailey Bieber's Rhode Skin copying Selena Gomez's Rare Beauty?\" the original poster asked.\n\nThough some nuanced replies suggested that beauty companies tend to use similar marketing strategies, most of the replies were a chorus of affirmative answers. Many redditors believe that Hailey is a total copycat.\n\nAs we said, there were many nuanced replies.\n\nNot everyone was on board with the idea that Hailey Bieber has a pathological drive to copy Selena Gomez in whatever she does.\n\n\"Even if I think Rare made an amazing trendy and cozy puffy makeup bag, I think it's something that other brands did,\" commented one Reddit user. \"But I agree with you on the fact that Rhode released the exact same not so long after.\"\n\nMeanwhile, other comments accused Hailey Bieber of being unable to have an \"original thought.\" There were also some instances of name-calling among the comments.\n\nEven defenders who note that Hailey is likely just following beauty industry trends -- trends that Rare got to first, or even started -- note that it seems to be part of a pattern.\n\nThe name-calling is probably unwarranted, as Hailey doesn't seem to be hurting anyone. But it does give a lot of fans an uneasy feeling to see what looks like mirroring of Selena's personal and professional choices.\n\nRepeatedly, Selena Gomez has made it clear that she does not want her fans attacking Hailey Bieber.\n\nSelena has stated this on social media. She has even graciously posed with Hailey to show the world that they don't have a beef.\n\nGiven the ongoing success of Rare Beauty, it doesn't appear that Selena's business is hurting. With that in mind, fans should keep their cool over Hailey copying Selena -- whether it's real or imagined.

As Bieber's career progressed, his fashion sense evolved dramatically, defying traditional labels and embracing a diverse blend of styles from various influences. The music artist's outfits have continued to make headlines for their bizarre statement. \"He is fearless. I've worked with Justin Bieber for a decade. It's been the most formative relationship creatively that I've ever had. There were those horrible 'Worst Dressed' lists, and you never wanted to land on them, but Justin didn't care,\" his stylist Karla Welch told E! News. Here's looking at six such moments that continue to live on.\n\nIn August 2023, Bieber joined Hailey Bieber at her Rhode beauty event alongside Krispy Kreme in New York City, celebrating the launch of her Strawberry Glazed lip treatment. While Hailey dazzled in a vibrant red designer ensemble paired with elegant accessories, Justin opted for a more casual look, sporting a gray hoodie, a pink cap, sweat shorts, and yellow crocs. His hoodie was uniquely styled, with the hood tied around his face and the zipper partially undone, creating a distinct fashion statement. In an interview with GQ Hailey justified his action as his choice.\n\nBieber's signature style often involves wearing clothing several sizes larger than necessary, but this can pose a challenge when it comes to loose-fitting sweatpants, as evident in this instance. While out and about in Los Angeles with a friend, the Never Say Never singer was seen donning a black leather jacket layered over a hoodie and sweatpants that appeared excessively oversized, nearly reaching his knees per Nicki Swift. While '90s fashion has made a resurgence, some trends, such as the peekaboo underwear trend, may not be universally embraced.\n\nThe US Open has become the hub of celebrities making fashion statements from their VIP seats. However, Bieber appeared in a bizarre ensemble that made headlines, as he was photographed sitting beside his wife Hailey. The yesteryear teen music sensation and singer adorned a white vest with a unique pair of glasses that caught the attention of many at the 2023 championships in Queens, New York. Despite coordinating with his wife, Hailey, in a sleek black leather jacket, his choice of accessories veered into unconventional territory as reported by Fox News.\n\nBieber, known for his preference for comfortable attire, often gravitates towards hoodies for his everyday wear. However, at a recent outing, his fashion choice raised eyebrows. While it's common to wear both arms through the sleeves of a hoodie, Bieber opted for a different approach. He carried his iced coffee through the bottom of his sweatshirt, leaving one sleeve dangling by his side, creating an illusion of having three arms. According to the Mirror, Bieber previously experimented with the one-armed shirt trend back in 2015. While skateboarding in New York City, the Favorite Girl singer was seen sporting a white shirt with one of his tattooed arms fully exposed outside the sleeve.\n\nBieber's street style has often been described as eclectic, sometimes giving off the impression of pieces assembled without much coordination. While strolling alongside Hailey, he opted for a bold ensemble comprising a bright pink knit hat, a slate gray sweatshirt paired with a light blue frayed jacket, and notably oversized jeans that nearly engulfed his shoes. While oversized fashion remains on-trend, some onlookers couldn't help but question the practicality and hygiene considerations associated with Bieber's ensemble. Bieber was spotted wearing the wide-leg jean vintage color block, a style featured on the brand's website with a retail price of $175.\n\nIn a departure from his usual style, the singer donned a particularly eccentric ensemble consisting of colorful quilted pants paired with a large multi-colored crochet blanket draped over his shoulders. Completing the look was a plaid bucket hat from his clothing line, Drew House. It seemed Bieber was embracing a rainbow-inspired mood, evident even in his sneakers adorned with multiple colors. In March 2023, he eschewed the red carpet and discreetly entered the Vanity Fair Oscars party donning yet another crochet blanket, this time featuring prominent floral designs, as reported by Page Six.", "source": {"uri": "inquisitr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Inquisitr"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hailey_Bieber", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hailey Bieber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoodie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hoodie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Bieber", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Justin Bieber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweatpants", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sweatpants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archetype", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Archetype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krispy_Kreme", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Krispy Kreme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leather_jacket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leather jacket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strawberry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strawberry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shorts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shorts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E!_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "E!

The custom piece features a large oval-cut diamond set on a simple gold band. Solow told PEOPLE Justin had \"a hand in selecting the diamond\" and put a lot of thought into the design of the ring.\n\nThe \"Baby\" singer proposed to his bride-to-be in July 2018 at a local restaurant in The Bahamas. While the pair had newly rekindled their relationship a month before, a source told PEOPLE at the time that Justin was deeply committed to the relationship.\n\n\"This is not a joke to him. He proposed because he truly feels Hailey is the love of his life,\" the insider said. \"He had a rough time last year, but he worked very hard to change and find more meaning in his life. Hailey couldn't make him happier.\"\n\nThe couple tied the knot a few months later in September 2018, at a courthouse in New York City. They later celebrated with a larger ceremony in front of family and friends at the Montage Palmetto Bluff in Bluffton, S.C., where they exchanged Tiffany & Co. wedding bands.\n\nFrom the design process to the proposal, keep reading for everything to know about Hailey Bieber's engagement ring.\n\nHailey's custom diamond sparkler falls right in line with her minimalist aesthetic. Though the ring features a massive oval-cut diamond -- estimated to be between 6 to 10 carats -- it's set on a plain 18K gold band.\n\nThe engagement ring was designed by Solow, a private jeweler based at N.Y.C.'s family-run jewelry store Solow & Co. The jeweler met Justin through his manager, Scooter Braun, who recommended that the singer visit Solow to choose the perfect stone for Hailey.\n\nSpeaking with PEOPLE in July 2018, Solow said that Justin carefully planned his future wife's ring and was very involved in the process that took a \"few weeks\" to complete.\n\n\"In the end, Justin wanted something that would gracefully accentuate Hailey's beautifully shaped hands. We settled on an oval stone that was just exceptional in its length and grace,\" he said. \"Justin gave this a lot of thought. When I saw him, I think he was very happy about what we did together. He was in a very good head space for the decision he was making.\"\n\nSolow added, \"I showed him all the details and all the intricacies like I would give any other 25-year-old boy who would come to the office to buy an engagement ring. He seemed really excited. He was looking inside the diamond with the [jeweler's] loupe, and said, 'I think I see Hailey's face.' \"\n\nJustin proposed to Hailey on July 7, 2018.\n\nThe pair were on a romantic vacation in The Bahamas when the singer got down on one knee. They intended to keep the engagement a secret, but the happy news spread quickly, and two days later, Justin made the official announcement on his Instagram.\n\n\"Was gonna wait a while to say anything but word travels fast, listen plain and simple Hailey I am soooo in love with everything about you!\" he wrote in the caption. \"My heart is COMPLETELY and FULLY YOURS and I will ALWAYS put you first! You are the love of my life Hailey Baldwin and I wouldn't want to spend it with anybody else. You make me so much better and we compliment each other so well!! Can't wait for the best season of life yet!\"\n\nThe singer also revealed the significance of their engagement date in his post, as they \"got engaged on the seventh day of the seventh month,\" and the number seven is the \"number of spiritual perfection.\"\n\nShortly after, Hailey posted on X (formerly Twitter): \"Not sure what I did in life to deserve such happiness but I am so utterly grateful to God for giving me such an incredible person to share my life with! No words could ever express my gratitude.\"\n\nWhile their whirlwind engagement seemed sudden to the public, the couple had been friends for years and previously dated. \"He knew a couple of weeks ago that he wanted to propose,\" a source told PEOPLE at the time. \"He sees marriage as something very special. He would never propose if he wasn't crazy about Hailey. It might seem spontaneous, but it wasn't. He felt in his heart that this was right. He doesn't want Hailey to ever be the one that got away.\"\n\nThe model completed her wedding ring set with two bands from Tiffany & Co. She wears both the Tiffany Soleste 18-karat gold diamond-encrusted band (valued at $3,125) and the Tiffany Soleste 18-karat gold and diamond V-ring (valued at $2,150). The set matches Justin's simple Tiffany Classic 18-karat gold wedding band ring.\n\nA day after their wedding in September 2019, Justin gave fans a first glimpse at their wedding bands when he posted two black-and-white snaps of the pair on Instagram. He captioned the shots, \"Looking forward to forever with you @haileybieber.\"\n\nThough the couple exchanged new bling at their South Carolina wedding, they previously wore matching silver wedding bands.

Hailey thinks highly of her parents, as is evident in her 2015 social media post in which she said;\n\nMy parents are absolutely everything to me.

You fantasize about having the same thing. I do think it influenced me to want to be married young.\n\nHailey's father also commented on why he thinks his marriage has lasted that long during a 2012 interview with CBS News. He said,\n\nI have a lot of young people say to me, 'You're the youngest Baldwin and you've been married the longest. How does that work?' The truth is my wife's awesome. She puts up with me. We're meant to be together. More than anything when those interactions occur that rub you the wrong way you just learn to let it go.

However, according to Celebrity Net Worth, SCMP and The Richest, Hailey's father, Stephen Baldwin, has an alleged net worth of between $500,000 and $1 million.\n\nStephen's source of wealth is his extensive career as an entertainer and various business ventures.\n\nHailey has a diverse heritage, thanks to her parents.

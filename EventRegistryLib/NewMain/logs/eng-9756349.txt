They will therefore participate in each of the five events.\n\nExperienced athletes Tarundeep Rai and Deepika Kumari, who are competing in their fourth Olympics, will guide their younger comrades in the hopes of qualifying for the main draw by placing at least one of them in the top ten.\n\nThe scores of 128 athletes from 53 countries in the qualification round will determine the starting positions for the main knockout tournament, which starts with the women's team finals on Sunday. Each archer will shoot 72 arrows.\n\nFor the Indians, who have frequently fallen in the rankings and lost to heavyweights Korea, who are predicted to win the qualifications, the qualifying round will be vital.\n\nThe male archers collectively received the ninth seeding at the Tokyo Olympics after finishing outside the top-30. The only female archer there, Deepika, came in ninth in the standings as well. In the end, both lost to Koreans ranked #1 in their respective quarterfinals.\n\nRegarding performance, India's men's team, who upset Korea in the final for the first time this year and won a historic World Cup in Shanghai, will be looked at with great anticipation.\n\nRai and Tokyo Olympian Pravin Jadhav will provide experience, and rookie Dhiraj Bommadevara will be feeling very confident after defeating Italy's Mauro Nespoli, who finished second in the Tokyo Olympics, to win bronze at the World Cup Stage-3 in Antalya barely a month ago.\n\nDhiraj, making his debut, is regarded as a promising individual since, although playing with new teammates last year, he had success as a member of a winning Asian Games squad.\n\nDhiraj, who is renowned for remaining \"ice cool\" under pressure, would try to get over his painful memories of the Hangzhou Asian Games, where he mishandled his release twice and lost in the individual quarters.\n\nDeepika's atonement act will involve her fighting against herself.\n\nAll eyes would be on her, particularly following her incredible comeback to capture a silver medal at the World Cup Stage-1 in Shanghai in April of this year, less than 16 months after giving birth.\n\nAn San of Korea, who went on to win the gold medal, was her opponent the last time she competed in Tokyo.\n\nThis time, they don't have An, but they do have another Korean, Lim Si-hyeon, who beat Deepika twice already this year, most notably in the Shanghai World Cup final.\n\n\"If she gets going, Deepika churns out perfect 10s at ease. But at the same time, she suffers from inconsistency and makes silly mistakes at crunch times. If she overcomes her mental blockade, there is no stopping her,\" India's high performance director Sanjeeva Singh said, as per PTI.\n\nFor the recurve mixed team, Dhiraj and Deepika would be a thrilling prospect if they could win their ranking rounds.\n\nAt the top level, Dhiraj's poise and Deepika's abilities would work well together.\n\nWith the exception of Deepika, the women's team will lack experience.\n\nBoth Ankita Bhakat and Bhajan Kaur, who have represented India frequently in this Olympic cycle and who took home a bronze medal in the World Cup Stage 4 in 2023, will be making their respective Games debuts.\n\nWith the exception of Deepika, the women's team will lack experience.\n\nBoth Ankita Bhakat and Bhajan Kaur, who have represented India frequently in this Olympic cycle and who took home a bronze medal in the World Cup Stage 4 in 2023, will be making their respective Games debuts.\n\nThey will try to take inspiration from their joint bronze medal from the Asian Games last year.\n\nAnkita, a 26-year-old from Bengal who plays for Tata Academy, has a lot more experience than most because she has won multiple World Cup team medals, including gold and silver in Paris in 2021 and 2022, respectively.\n\nControversial build-up\n\nThe foreign coach of the archers, Baek Woong Ki, returned to India without receiving accreditation to compete, which ruined their Olympic preparation.\n\nThe South Korean had traveled with the team to their 10-day training camp in Jaux after signing an Olympic contract with the Archery Association of India for almost Rs one lakh per year.\n\nHowever, he was forced to return after AAI got involved in a blame game with the national federation (IOA) and was unable to secure an accreditation for him.\n\nIndia would have men's and women's team coaches in Sonam Singh Bhutia (Army) and Purnima Mahato (Tata), whose archers had made the side, even if Baek would not be present.\n\nIt is unclear how the Indians will handle pressure while facing their bitter rivals Korea in the knockout stages without Baek.\n\nQuarterfinal jinx\n\nIndian archers have never advanced past the quarterfinal stage of competition.\n\nWith the exception of Sydney 2000, when India was unable to qualify for the Games, the script has remained unchanged over the years.\n\nWhen it comes to overall performance, the most impressive display was during the last Olympics in Tokyo, where Deepika as an individual, the mixed team, and the Indian men's team all failed to get past the quarterfinals.\n\nIndia won the men's and women's ranks among non-qualifying countries in the Olympic cycle, earning them the team quotas.\n\nOn Monday, the men's team finals will take place, and on Tuesday, the individual eliminations will begin.\n\nThe women's and individual finals are scheduled for the same weekend as the mixed team finals, which are scheduled for this Friday.\n\nThe TOI Sports Desk excels in a myriad of roles that capture the essence of live sporting events and deliver compelling content to readers worldwide.

This means they will compete in all the five events.\n\nAlso Read: Coffees, Gaming and Fijian Singing: Olympians Soak Up Social Village Life\n\nVeterans Tarundeep Rai and Deepika Kumari, appearing in their fourth Olympics, will lead their young teammates, hoping to securing at least a top-10 finish in the qualification round to ensure a favourable draw.\n\nEach archer will shoot 72 arrows and the scores in the qualification round of 128 athletes from 53 countries will decide the seeds for the main knockout competition beginning with the women's team finals on Sunday.\n\nThe qualifying round will be crucial for the Indians, who have often slipped in the seedings and ended up losing to heavyweights Korea, tipped to top the qualifications.\n\nAt the Tokyo Olympics, all the male archers finished outside the top-30 and got the ninth seeding as a team. Deepika, the sole woman archer there, also got a ninth place in rankings. Both ended up losing to top-seed Koreans in their respective quarters.\n\nOn form front, India will have high hopes from the men's team, which won a historic World Cup this year in Shanghai, upsetting Korea for the first time in a final.\n\nThey will have the experience in Rai and Tokyo Olympian Pravin Jadhav, while debutant Dhiraj Bommadevara will be on a high after beating Tokyo Olympics silver-medallist Mauro Nespoli of Italy en route a bronze at the World Cup Stage-3 in Antalya just a month back.\n\nIndividually, debutant Dhiraj is seen as a bright prospect as he has tasted success by winning the Asian Games team silver last year, albeit with different teammates.\n\nKnown to be \"ice cool\" in tough situations, Dhiraj would look to overcome the bitter memories of Hangzhou Asian Games where he botched up his release twice to exit in the individual quarters.\n\nDeepika will fight against herself in a redemption act.\n\nAll eyes would be on her especially after her stunning comeback to win a World Cup Stage-1 silver in Shanghai in April this year, less than 16 months after becoming a mother.\n\nLast time in Tokyo, An San of Korea was her nemesis as she went on to become the gold-medallist.\n\nThere is no An this time, but they have another Korean in Lim Si-hyeon who has defeated Deepika twice this year including in the Shanghai World Cup final.\n\n\"If she gets going, Deepika churns out perfect 10s at ease. But at the same time, she suffers from inconsistency and makes silly mistakes at crunch times. If she overcomes her mental blockade, there is no stopping her,\" India's high performance director Sanjeeva Singh said.\n\nDhiraj and Deepika, if they manage to top their ranking rounds, would be an exciting prospect for the recurve mixed team.\n\nDhiraj's composure and Deepika's skills would complement each other well at the highest level.\n\nThe women's team, on the other hand, will be low on experience barring Deepika.\n\nAnkita Bhakat and Bhajan Kaur, who have been Indian regulars in this Olympic cycle and won a World Cup Stage-4 bronze here in 2023, are slated for their respective Games debut.\n\nThey have together won the Asian Games bronze last year and will look to draw inspiration from that.\n\nTwenty-six-year-old Ankita, who hails from Bengal but represents Tata Academy, is relatively more experienced having won a clutch of World Cup team medals including a gold and silver, both in Paris in 2021 and 2022 respectively.\n\nThe archers Olympic build-up was marred by their foreign coach Baek Woong Ki's return to India after not getting accreditation to enter the Games.\n\nThe South Korean, who was contracted by the Archery Association of India for the Olympics at an approximate annual contract of Rs one crore, had accompanied the team to their 10-day preparatory camp in Jaux.\n\nBut he had to return after AAI failed to procure an accreditation for him as the sports body was engaged in a blame game with national federation (IOA).\n\nWhile there would be no Baek, India will have men's and women's team coaches in Sonam Singh Bhutia (Army) and Purnima Mahato (Tata) whose archers have made the side.\n\nIn absence of Baek, it remains to be seen how the Indians will cope with crunch moments especially while taking on arch-nemesis Korea in the knockouts.\n\nIndian archers have never been able to go past the quarterfinal hurdle.\n\nThe script has been the same all these years, barring in Sydney 2000 where India could not qualify for the Games.\n\nIn terms of cumulative performance, the best ever show was at the last Olympics in Tokyo where the India men's team, mixed team and Deepika individually, all fell by the wayside in the quarters.\n\nIndia were awarded the team quotas after topping the men's and women's rankings among non-qualified nations in the Olympic cycle.\n\nThe men's team finals will be on Monday, while the individual eliminations will get underway on Tuesday.\n\nThe mixed team finals are slated for next Friday, followed by women and individual finals over the same weekend.", "source": {"uri":

This means they will compete in all the five events.\n\nVeterans Tarundeep Rai and Deepika Kumari, appearing in their fourth Olympics, will lead their young teammates, hoping to securing at least a top-10 finish in the qualification round to ensure a favourable draw.\n\nEach archer will shoot 72 arrows and the scores in the qualification round of 128 athletes from 53 countries will decide the seeds for the main knockout competition beginning with the women's team finals on Sunday.\n\nThe qualifying round will be crucial for the Indians, who have often slipped in the seedings and ended up losing to heavyweights Korea, tipped to top the qualifications.\n\nAt the Tokyo Olympics, all the male archers finished outside the top-30 and got the ninth seeding as a team. Deepika, the sole woman archer there, also got a ninth place in rankings. Both ended up losing to top-seed Koreans in their respective quarters.\n\nOn form front, India will have high hopes from the men's team, which won a historic World Cup this year in Shanghai, upsetting Korea for the first time in a final.\n\nThey will have the experience in Rai and Tokyo Olympian Pravin Jadhav, while debutant Dhiraj Bommadevara will be on a high after beating Tokyo Olympics silver-medallist Mauro Nespoli of Italy en route a bronze at the World Cup Stage-3 in Antalya just a month back.\n\nIndividually, debutant Dhiraj is seen as a bright prospect as he has tasted success by winning the Asian Games team silver last year, albeit with different teammates.\n\nKnown to be \"ice cool\" in tough situations, Dhiraj would look to overcome the bitter memories of Hangzhou Asian Games where he botched up his release twice to exit in the individual quarters.\n\nDeepika will fight against herself in a redemption act.\n\nAll eyes would be on her especially after her stunning comeback to win a World Cup Stage-1 silver in Shanghai in April this year, less than 16 months after becoming a mother.\n\nLast time in Tokyo, An San of Korea was her nemesis as she went on to become the gold-medallist.\n\nThere is no An this time, but they have another Korean in Lim Si-hyeon who has defeated Deepika twice this year including in the Shanghai World Cup final.\n\n\"If she gets going, Deepika churns out perfect 10s at ease. But at the same time, she suffers from inconsistency and makes silly mistakes at crunch times. If she overcomes her mental blockade, there is no stopping her,\" India's high performance director Sanjeeva Singh said.\n\nDhiraj and Deepika, if they manage to top their ranking rounds, would be an exciting prospect for the recurve mixed team.\n\nDhiraj's composure and Deepika's skills would complement each other well at the highest level.\n\nThe women's team, on the other hand, will be low on experience barring Deepika.\n\nAnkita Bhakat and Bhajan Kaur, who have been Indian regulars in this Olympic cycle and won a World Cup Stage-4 bronze here in 2023, are slated for their respective Games debut.\n\nThey have together won the Asian Games bronze last year and will look to draw inspiration from that.\n\nTwenty-six-year-old Ankita, who hails from Bengal but represents Tata Academy, is relatively more experienced having won a clutch of World Cup team medals including a gold and silver, both in Paris in 2021 and 2022 respectively.\n\nControversial build-up =============== The archers Olympic build-up was marred by their foreign coach Baek Woong Ki's return to India after not getting accreditation to enter the Games.\n\nThe South Korean, who was contracted by the Archery Association of India for the Olympics at an approximate annual contract of Rs one crore, had accompanied the team to their 10-day preparatory camp in Jaux.\n\nBut he had to return after AAI failed to procure an accreditation for him as the sports body was engaged in a blame game with national federation (IOA).\n\nWhile there would be no Baek, India will have men's and women's team coaches in Sonam Singh Bhutia (Army) and Purnima Mahato (Tata) whose archers have made the side.\n\nIn absence of Baek, it remains to be seen how the Indians will cope with crunch moments especially while taking on arch-nemesis Korea in the knockouts.\n\nQuarterfinal jinx =========== Indian archers have never been able to go past the quarterfinal hurdle.\n\nThe script has been the same all these years, barring in Sydney 2000 where India could not qualify for the Games.\n\nIn terms of cumulative performance, the best ever show was at the last Olympics in Tokyo where the India men's team, mixed team and Deepika individually, all fell by the wayside in the quarters.\n\nIndia were awarded the team quotas after topping the men's and women's rankings among non-qualified nations in the Olympic cycle.\n\nThe men's team finals will be on Monday, while the individual eliminations will get underway on Tuesday.\n\nThe mixed team finals are slated for next Friday, followed by women and individual finals over the same weekend.

Sanjeeva Singh reckons India's six archers are exceptionally prepared to help Team India win their first-ever Olympic medal in the sport. In a significant milestone, the Indian archery team has arrived in Paris with high hopes, marking the first time in 12 years that both the men's and women's teams have secured their Olympic quotas. After a remarkable performance in the recent World Cup, the team is eager to achieve a breakthrough in an event where they have yet to claim a medal.\n\nTopping the rankings amongst nonqualified nations in both sections, India will compete in all five medal events in Paris: men's and women's teams, individual, and mixed categories. Forty-year-old Army veteran Tarundeep Rai, who made his Olympic debut at Athens 2004, will be making his fourth Games appearance. Former world No. 1 Deepika Kumari will also compete in her fourth Olympics, having debuted in London 2012. Dhiraj Bommadevara, Ankita Bhakat, and Bhajan Kaur will make their Olympic debuts, while Pravin Jadhav will return for his second successive Games after Tokyo.\n\nArchery's roots run deep in the traditions of North-East India, where the bow and arrow have long been integral to the lives of the Khasis and other indigenous communities. This rich heritage has now flourished into a nationwide passion for the sport. With six talented archers representing India in Paris, the stage is set for a momentous chapter in the nation's Olympic history.\n\nIndia have never won an Olympic medal in archery, and this marks only the third time, and the first in 12 years, that India has clinched both men's and women's team quotas for the Olympics. In the Tokyo 2020 edition, the men's team fell to South Korea in the quarter-finals, with individual archers Atanu Das, Tarundeep Rai, and Pravin Jadhav exiting early. Deepika Kumari reached the quarter-finals in both her individual event and the mixed team event with Jadhav, yet fell short of a medal.\n\nIndia's archery team is poised to make history at the Paris Olympics, with athletes showing significant progress. The men's archers - Dhiraj Bommadevara (693), Tarundeep Rai (684), and Pravin Jadhav (676) - have achieved personal best scores in the qualifying rounds. In April, they stunned world champion South Korea to win team gold at the World Cup Stage 1 in Shanghai. Additionally, the mixed team of Ankita Bhakat and Bommadevara won bronze at the same event, while Bommadevara and Bhajan Kaur secured mixed team bronze at World Cup Stage 3 in Antalya, Turkey.\n\nAt the Paris Olympics, India will compete in all five archery events: Men's individual, Women's individual, Men's team, Women's team, Mixed team event, Olympic Schedule The archery events at the Paris Olympics will commence with the individual ranking round on July 25. The main events are scheduled from July 28 to August 4. It is important to note that recurve is the only accepted form of archery at the Olympics.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Photograph: World Archery/Instagram\n\nA different year and another Games, but for Indian archers, the target will be the same -- winning their first ever medal at the Olympics.\n\nMore or less regular at the Olympics since debuting back in 1988, the archers will kick off India's Paris campaign on Thursday with the qualification rounds at the Les Invalides gardens.\n\nFor the first time after London 2012, India will have a full six-member squad after both the men's and women's teams qualified on the basis of rankings. This means they will compete in all the five events.\n\nVeterans Tarundeep Rai and Deepika Kumari, appearing in their fourth Olympics, will lead their young teammates, hoping to securing at least a top-10 finish in the qualification round to ensure a favourable draw.\n\nIMAGE: For the first time after London 2012, India will have a full six-member squad after both the men's and women's teams qualified on the basis of rankings. Photograph: World Archery/Instagram\n\nEach archer will shoot 72 arrows and the scores in the qualification round of 128 athletes from 53 countries will decide the seeds for the main knockout competition, starting with the women's team finals on Sunday.\n\nThe qualifying round will be crucial for the Indians, who have often slipped in the seedings and ended up losing to heavyweights Korea, tipped to top the qualifications.\n\nIMAGE: Deepika Kumari, appearing in her fourth Olympics, will be hoping to securing at least a top-10 finish in the qualification round to ensure a favourable draw. Photograph: World Archery/Instagram\n\nAt the Tokyo Olympics, all the male archers finished outside the top-30 and got the ninth seeding as a team. Deepika, the sole woman archer there, also got a ninth place in rankings. Both ended up losing to top-seed Koreans in their respective quarters.\n\nOn the form front, India will have high hopes from the men's team, which won a historic World Cup this year in Shanghai, upsetting Korea for the first time in a final.\n\nThey will have the experience in Rai and Tokyo Olympian Pravin Jadhav, while debutant Dhiraj Bommadevara will be on a high after beating Tokyo Olympics silver-medallist Mauro Nespoli of Italy en route a bronze at the World Cup Stage-3 in Antalya just a month back.\n\nIMAGE: Debutant Dhiraj Bommadevara will be on a high after beating Tokyo Olympics silver-medallist Mauro Nespoli of Italy en route a bronze at the World Cup Stage-3 in Antalya just a month back. Photograph: World Archery/Instagram\n\nIndividually, debutant Dhiraj is seen as a bright prospect as he has tasted success by winning the Asian Games team silver last year, albeit with different teammates.\n\nKnown to be \"ice cool\" in tough situations, Dhiraj would look to overcome the bitter memories of Hangzhou Asian Games where he botched up his release twice to exit in the individual quarters.\n\nDeepika will fight against herself in a redemption act.\n\nAll eyes would be on her especially after her stunning comeback to win a World Cup Stage-1 silver in Shanghai in April this year, less than 16 months after becoming a mother.\n\nLast time in Tokyo, An San of Korea was her nemesis as she went on to become the gold-medallist.\n\nThere is no An this time, but they have another Korean in Lim Si-hyeon who has defeated Deepika twice this year including in the Shanghai World Cup final.\n\n\"If she gets going, Deepika churns out perfect 10s at ease. But at the same time, she suffers from inconsistency and makes silly mistakes at crunch times. If she overcomes her mental blockade, there is no stopping her,\" India's high performance director Sanjeeva Singh said.\n\nIMAGE: Each archer will shoot 72 arrows and the scores in the qualification round of 128 athletes from 53 countries will decide the seeds for the main knockout competition, starting with the women's team finals on Sunday. Photograph: World Archery/Instagram\n\nDhiraj and Deepika, if they manage to top their ranking rounds, would be an exciting prospect for the recurve mixed team.\n\nDhiraj's composure and Deepika's skills would complement each other well at the highest level.\n\nThe women's team, on the other hand, will be low on experience barring Deepika.\n\nAnkita Bhakat and Bhajan Kaur, who have been Indian regulars in this Olympic cycle and won a World Cup Stage-4 bronze here in 2023, are slated for their respective Games debut.\n\nIMAGE: India will have high hopes from the men's team, which won a historic World Cup this year in Shanghai, upsetting Korea for the first time in a final. Photograph: World Archery/Instagram\n\nThey have together won the Asian Games bronze last year and will look to draw inspiration from that.\n\nTwenty-six-year-old Ankita, who hails from Bengal but represents Tata Academy, is relatively more experienced having won a clutch of World Cup team medals including a gold and silver, both in Paris in 2021 and 2022 respectively.\n\nThe archers Olympic build-up was marred by their foreign coach Baek Woong Ki's return to India after not getting accreditation to enter the Games.\n\nThe South Korean, who was contracted by the Archery Association of India for the Olympics at an approximate annual contract of Rs one crore, had accompanied the team to their 10-day preparatory camp in Jaux.\n\nBut he had to return after AAI failed to procure an accreditation for him as the sports body was engaged in a blame game with the Indian Olympic Association (IOA).\n\nWhile there would be no Baek, India will have men's and women's team coaches in Sonam Singh Bhutia (Army) and Purnima Mahato (Tata) whose archers have made the side.\n\nIn absence of Baek, it remains to be seen how the Indians will cope with crunch moments especially while taking on arch-nemesis Korea in the knockouts.\n\nIMAGE: India were awarded the team quotas after topping the men's and women's rankings among non-qualified nations in the Olympic cycle.. Photograph: World Archery/Instagram\n\nIndia's archers have never been able to go past the quarter-final hurdle at the Olympic Games.\n\nThe script has been the same all these years, barring in Sydney 2000 where India could not qualify for the Games.\n\nIn terms of cumulative performance, the best ever show was at the last Olympics in Tokyo where the India men's team, mixed team and Deepika individually, all fell by the wayside in the\n\nquarters.\n\nIndia were awarded the team quotas after topping the men's and women's rankings among non-qualified nations in the Olympic cycle.\n\nThe men's team finals will be on Monday, while the individual eliminations will get underway on Tuesday.\n\nThe mixed team finals are slated for next Friday, followed by women and individual finals over

The six-member Indian contingent of archers were among the first to enter the Games Village on Sunday, 21 July.\n\nThe six Indian archers in Paris are: Dhiraj Bommadevara, Pravin Jadhav, Tarundeep Rai, Deepika Kumari, Bhajan Kaur and Ankita Bhakat. The archery competition gets under way at the Esplanade des Invalides, a garden of Paris' most beautiful monuments, on Thursday, a day before the opening ceremony and will continue till 4 August.

Incidentally, both Singh and Korean coach Baek Woong Ki will not be present in Paris.\n\nThe sports ministry has spent a whopping Rs 39.18 crores on archery in the Paris Olympics cycle, while a total of 41 national camps and 24 foreign exposure trips were supported by the Indian government through its Target Olympics Podium Scheme (TOPS).", "source": {"uri": "nationalheraldindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "National Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Authority_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sports Authority of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Archery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonipat", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sonipat"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sonipat"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pravin_Jadhav", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pravin Jadhav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankita_Bhakat", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ankita Bhakat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Invalides", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Les Invalides"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarundeep_Rai", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tarundeep Rai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepika_Kumari", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deepika Kumari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archery_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Archery at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archery_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Mixed_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Archery at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Mixed team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archery_at_the_2016_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Men's_individual", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Archery at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's individual"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archery_at_the_2016_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_individual", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Archery at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's individual"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seoul"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seoul"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://media.assettype.com/nationalherald%2F2024-07%2Fd3db1cf2-79a7-4982-b1dd-c55f144d5b68%2FWhatsApp%20Image%202024-07-21%20at%2010.30.00.jpeg?rect=0%2C0%2C1280%2C672&w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9756349", "eventUri": "eng-9756349", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-21", "textStart": 425, "textEnd": 432}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-04", "textStart": 755, "textEnd": 763}], "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

Now, that dream is coming true. In past World Cups, we rarely played podium matches, but this time it's different. We learned from our early setbacks and improved significantly. Our performance has been consistently better in each competition, and I believe we will perform well at the Olympics,\" Bhakat stated.\n\nShe emphasised the importance of self-belief, adding, \"I know what level of performance I'm capable of. When I give my 100%, the medal will surely follow.\"\n\nBhajan echoed Bhakat's sentiments, stressing on the importance of continuous improvement and giving their best effort. \"My performance at the second World Cup was much better than the first one, so I started feeling victorious about my progress since the first World Cup,\" said Kaur.\n\n\"Whenever we go for a tournament, we focus on giving our best, no matter the magnitude of the tournament. Our aim is to leave no stones unturned for the Olympics as well and we are confident that we will return from Paris with a medal.\"\n\nBhakat also pointed out the invaluable experience of having a veteran like Deepika Kumari in the team. \"It's a great advantage that Deepika is going to the Olympics for the fourth time.

The archers, a consistent presence at the Games since their debut in 1988, will commence their campaign with the qualification rounds at Les Invalides gardens on Thursday.\n\nThis year marks a significant change for Indian archery. For the first time since London 2012, India will field a full six-member squad, with both men's and women's teams having qualified based on their rankings. This allows them to compete in all five events.\n\nVeteran archers Tarundeep Rai and Deepika Kumari, both appearing in their fourth Olympics, will lead their team. The focus for them and their young teammates will be to secure at least a top-10 finish in the qualification round to ensure a favorable draw for the knockout stages. Each archer will shoot 72 arrows, with the scores determining the seeds for the knockout competition, which begins with the women's team finals on Sunday.\n\nThe qualification round is critical for the Indians, who have historically struggled with seeding and have often been eliminated by top-ranked teams, particularly Korea. At the Tokyo Olympics, Indian male archers finished outside the top-30 and received the ninth seeding as a team. Deepika Kumari, the sole female archer at Tokyo, also ranked ninth and was eliminated by a top-seed Korean.\n\nDespite these setbacks, the Indian archers have reason to be optimistic. The men's team, which won a historic World Cup in Shanghai earlier this year by defeating Korea for the first time in a final, brings a wealth of experience. Rai, alongside Tokyo Olympian Pravin Jadhav and debutant Dhiraj Bommadevara, who recently secured a bronze medal at the World Cup Stage-3 in Antalya, promises a formidable challenge. Dhiraj, known for his composure, aims to overcome past disappointments and build on his success from the Asian Games.\n\nDeepika Kumari, who made a stunning comeback to win a World Cup Stage-1 silver in Shanghai after becoming a mother, will be a key player. Although she faced challenges against Korean archers in Tokyo, there is hope that she can overcome her inconsistencies and achieve a breakthrough in Paris.\n\nThe women's team, featuring Ankita Bhakat and Bhajan Kaur, will be competing in their Olympic debut. Bhakat, with her experience from previous World Cups and team medals, and Kaur, who has been a regular in this Olympic cycle, will draw inspiration from their past successes, including a bronze at the Asian Games.\n\nHowever, the build-up to the Olympics has not been without controversy. The Indian archers' preparation was marred by the return of their foreign coach, Baek Woong Ki, who was unable to secure accreditation for the Games. This issue arose amidst a blame game between the Archery Association of India and the Indian Olympic Association. Despite this setback, the team will be supported by men's coach Sonam Singh Bhutia and women's coach Purnima Mahato.\n\nHistorically, Indian archers have struggled to progress past the quarterfinals, with their best performance being at the Tokyo Olympics, where they fell at this stage in multiple events. The men's team finals are scheduled for Monday, with individual eliminations starting on Tuesday. The mixed team finals will follow on Friday, with the women's team and individual finals set for the same weekend.\n\nWith high hopes and a well-prepared squad, the Indian archers are set to make their mark in Paris, aiming to break their Olympic medal jinx and achieve a historic result.", "source": {"uri": "newindianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New Indian Express"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Archery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarundeep_Rai", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tarundeep Rai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepika_Kumari", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Deepika Kumari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Invalides", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Les Invalides"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shanghai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shanghai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pravin_Jadhav", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pravin Jadhav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asian Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antalya", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antalya"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Antalya"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archery_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Mixed_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Archery at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Mixed team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purnima_Mahato", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Purnima Mahato"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankita_Bhakat", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ankita Bhakat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archery_Association_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Archery Association of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Olympic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian Olympic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://media.assettype.com/TNIE%2Fimport%2F2018%2F10%2F26%2Foriginal%2FDeepika_Kumari_PTI.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9756349", "eventUri": "eng-9756349", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

approximate annual contract of Rs one crore, had accompanied the team to their 10-day preparatory camp in Jaux.\n\nBut he had to return after AAI failed to procure an accreditation for him as the sports body was engaged in a blame game with national federation (IOA).\n\nWhile there would be no Baek, India will have men's and women's team coaches in Sonam Singh Bhutia (Army) and Purnima Mahato (Tata) whose archers have made the side.\n\nIn absence of Baek, it remains to be seen how the Indians will cope with crunch moments especially while taking on arch-nemesis Korea in the knockouts.\n\nIndian archers have never been able to go past the quarterfinal hurdle.\n\nThe script has been the same all these years, barring in Sydney 2000 where India could not qualify for the Games.\n\nIn terms of cumulative performance, the best ever show was at the last Olympics in Tokyo where the India men's team, mixed team and Deepika individually, all fell by the wayside in the quarters.\n\nIndia were awarded the team quotas after topping the men's and women's rankings among non-qualified nations in the Olympic cycle.\n\nThe men's team finals will be on Monday, while the

Deepika Kumari, Ankita Bhakat, Bhajan Kaur, Pravin Jadhav, Tarundeep Rai and Dhiraj Bommadevara will be in action on Friday in the women's and men's individual ranking rounds.\n\nArchery will be held form July 25 to August 4 at the Paris Games. The ranking rounds on Thursday will be followed by women's team event on Sunday and the men's team event on Monday. This will be followed by the men's and women's individual knockout rounds from on July 30, 31 and August 1. The mixed team events are then scheduled to be held on August 2, followed by the women's and men's medal events on the subsequent two days. Let's take a look at the Indian archers who will be taking the field tomorrow.\n\nDeepika Kumari: The 30-year-old is making her fourth appearance at the Olympics and has been a constant fixture in Indian archery teams since the 2012 London Olympics. Deepika took a break in late 2022 and early 2023 upon becoming a mother. She was in a race against time to make it to the Olympics but a strong showing upon her comeback helped her qualify for Paris. This included an extraordinary comeback to win silver at World Cup Stage-1 in Shanghai in April this year, less than 16 months after giving birth.\n\nTarundeep Rai: Like Deepika, Tarundeep is making his fourth appearance at the Olympics. The 40-year-old has admitted that this Olympics is a \"now-or-never situation\". Tarundeep has two silver at the World Championships (2005, 2019), nine World Cup medals, including three gold, a silver and a bronze in Asian Games, two silver and a bronze in Asian Championships. The only trinket missing from his cabinet, is the one that has the Olympic rings engraved on it. The Sikkimese veteran was part of the Indian teams at the 2004 Athens, 2012 London and 2021 Tokyo Olympics. He exited in the first round in the individual event in Athens, and in the second round in both 2012 and 2021 editions. In Tokyo, he reached the quarterfinals of the men's team event.\n\nPravin Jadhav: Apart from Deepika and Tarundeep, Jadhav has the most experience in the Olympics among Indian archers, having played at the Tokyo Olympics. Jadhav finished above senior archers Atanu Das and Tarundeep in the ranking rounds and thus qualified for the knockouts where he lost to USA's Brady Ellison in the Round of 32. Jadhav later won silver at the Asian Archery Championship and was in the men's team alongwith Tarundeep and Dhiraj Bommadevara that won gold at the 2024 Archery World Cup in Shanghai. This was India's first World Cup gold medal in men's recurve team archery in 14 years.\n\nDhiraj Bommadevara: 22-year-old Dhiraj Bommadevara is making his Olympic debut in Paris. Bommadevara made his international debut in 2017 and won gold at the World Archer Youth Championships in 2021. In 2023, he was part of men's team that won silver at the 2023 Asian Games. Bommadevara earlier won the men's team gold at the World Cup in Shanghai, India's first in 14 years.\n\nAnkita Bhakat: One of three archers in the Indian team to make their Olympic debut in Paris, 26-year-old Ankita Bhakat qualified for the Games quarterfinals of the Final World Archery Olympic Qualifier 2024. She shot to prominence when she won gold in the mixed team event at the 2017 youth archery World Championships. Ankita was also part of the Indian women's team that won bronze at the Asian Games.\n\nBhajan Kaur: 18-year-old Bhajan Kaur sealed her place at the Paris Olympics by winning gold at the at the final Olympic qualifier in Antalya, Turkey last month. She had earlier been part of the women's team that won bronze at the 2023 Asian Games and also won bronze at the youth World Championships in 2023.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com",

Reuters\n\nThe Paris Olympics 2024 officially starts on 26 July but the action for the Indian contingent begins on Thursday, 25 July, with the archers getting the competition underway. This will be the only sports competition for India on Thursday.\n\nThe country has sent six archers to the Paris Games including a three-member men's and women's team respectively. This is the first time since the London 2012 Olympics that India will have a complete six-member contingent in archery.\n\nParis Olympics Complete Coverage: Click here for news, schedule, explainers and more\n\nThe men's and women's teams qualified for the Paris Olympics through rankings. Dhiraj Bommadevara and Bhajan Kaur were the first quota winners, in individual events, but they were upgraded to team quotas as per World Archery rankings as of 24 June 2024.\n\nFormer world No.1 Deepika Kumari and Tarundeep Rai are set for their fourth Olympics while Pravin Jadhav is returning after the Tokyo 2020 Games. Dhiraj, Bhajan, and Ankita Bhakat are going to make their Olympic debuts.\n\nRoad to Paris, Archery: How quotas were won, who is going, and what are the medal chances?\n\nWhat will happen on 25 July?\n\nAll the archers will compete in the individual ranking rounds on Thursday in which each archer will shoot 72 arrows. The final scores in the qualification round will decide the seeds for the main knockout events which will begin with the women's team finals on Sunday.\n\nThe qualification round will include 128 athletes from 53 countries.\n\nEarning a good seeding in the qualification round will help Indian archers avoid strong competitors in the opening rounds of the knockout competitions.\n\nThe main archery events will take place from 28 July to 4 August at Les Invalides.\n\nThe men's team was seeded ninth at Tokyo 2020 after male archers finished outside the top 30 in the ranking round. They lost to South Korea in the quarter-finals.\n\nDeepika Kumari, who was the only woman archer for India at Tokyo, also lost to An San fo Krea in the quarter-finals after receiving the ninth seed. An San went on to win the gold.\n\nIndia's medal chances in archery\n\nIndia have never won an Olympic medal in archery and their best has been a run to the quarter-finals. They have been a regular at the Summer Games since making their debut in 1988, however, they did not qualify for Sydney 2000.\n\nThis time the men's team enters with a gold medal win in World Cup Stage 1 earlier this year in which they defeated the world champion Korean team. At the same World Cup, Deepika won silver in the individual event.\n\nThe archers have some good outings to show in preparation for the Olympics but it will all eventually come down to how well they handle the nerves.\n\nIndia at Paris Olympics 2024\n\nOverall, India have sent 117 athletes to the Paris Olympics who will take part in 16 sports: Archery, athletics, badminton, boxing, equestrian, golf, hockey, judo, rowing, sailing, shooting, swimming, table tennis and tennis.\n\nThe first medal event for India will be the mixed team air rifle event which will take place after the opening ceremony on 27 July at the National Shooting Centre in Chateauroux.\n\nIndia won seven medals at the previous Olympics in Tokyo which is their best-ever medal haul.\n\nArchery events timings:\n\nWomen's individual ranking round: 1 PM IST\n\nMen's individual ranking round: 5.45 PM IST\n\nLIVE streaming: The Paris Olympics 2024 will be broadcast live on the Sports 18 channels and

Indian archers will compete in all five medal events in Paris: men's and women's teams, individual, and mixed categories.\n\nThe women's team boasts exceptional talent including the 2022 Asian Games bronze medallists Ankita Bhakat and Bhajan Kaur, apart from Deepika.\n\n\"The strength of any team lies in its communication and combination. It's essential to support each other in various situations. We talk a lot and discuss how to handle different scenarios. Clear communication, especially in tough situations, is a huge strength for us.

If she overcomes her mental blockade, there is no stopping her,\" India's high performance director Sanjeeva Singh said.\n\nDhiraj and Deepika, if they manage to top their ranking rounds, would be an exciting prospect for the recurve mixed team.\n\nDhiraj's composure and Deepika's skills would complement each other well at the highest level.\n\nThe women's team, on the other hand, will be low on experience barring Deepika.\n\nAnkita Bhakat and Bhajan Kaur, who have been Indian regulars in this Olympic cycle and won a World Cup Stage-4 bronze here in 2023, are slated for their respective Games debut.\n\nThey have together won the Asian Games bronze last year and will look to draw inspiration from that.\n\nTwenty-six-year-old Ankita, who hails from Bengal but represents Tata Academy, is relatively more experienced having won a clutch of World Cup team medals including a gold and silver, both in Paris in 2021 and 2022 respectively.\n\nControversial build-up =============== The archers Olympic build-up was marred by their foreign coach Baek Woong Ki's return to India after not getting accreditation to enter the Games.\n\nThe South Korean, who was contracted by the Archery Association of India for the Olympics at an approximate annual contract of Rs one crore, had accompanied the team to their 10-day preparatory camp in Jaux.\n\nBut he had to return after AAI failed to procure an accreditation for him as the sports body was engaged in a blame game with national federation (IOA).\n\nWhile there would be no Baek, India will have men's and women's team coaches in Sonam Singh Bhutia (Army) and Purnima Mahato (Tata) whose archers have made the side.\n\nIn absence of Baek, it remains to be seen how the Indians will cope with crunch moments especially while taking on arch-nemesis Korea in the knockouts.\n\nQuarterfinal jinx =========== Indian archers have never been able to go past the quarterfinal hurdle.\n\nThe script has been the same all these years, barring in Sydney 2000 where India could not qualify for the Games.\n\nIn terms of cumulative performance, the best ever show was at the last Olympics in Tokyo where the India men's team, mixed team and Deepika individually, all fell by the wayside in the quarters.\n\nIndia were awarded the team quotas after topping the men's and women's rankings among non-qualified nations in the Olympic cycle.\n\nThe men's team finals will be on Monday, while the individual eliminations will get underway on Tuesday.\n\nThe mixed team finals are slated for next Friday, followed by women and individual finals over the same weekend.

She said clear communication in tough situations will benefit them in the quadrennial event. Indian archers will compete in all five medal events in Paris: men's and women's teams, individual, and mixed categories. The women's team boasts exceptional talent including the 2022 Asian Games bronze medallists Ankita Bhakat and Bhajan Kaur, apart from Deepika.\n\n\"The strength of any team lies in its communication and combination. It's essential to support each other in various situations. We talk a lot and discuss how to handle different scenarios. Clear communication, especially in tough situations, is a huge strength for us. We are confident about our chances at the Olympics,\" Deepika said on JioCinema's 'The Dreamers'.\n\nBhakat, who is fulfilling a lifelong dream of competing in the Olympics, expressed her confidence in the team's progress.\n\n\"Since I started archery, I have always dreamt of playing in the Olympics. Now, that dream is coming true. In past World Cups, we rarely played podium matches, but this time it's different. We learned from our early setbacks and improved significantly. Our performance has been consistently better in each competition, and I believe we will perform well at the Olympics,\" Bhakat stated.\n\nShe emphasised the importance of self-belief, adding, \"I know what level of performance I'm capable of. When I give my 100%, the medal will surely follow.\"\n\nBhajan echoed Bhakat's sentiments, stressing on the importance of continuous improvement and giving their best effort. \"My performance at the second World Cup was much better than the first one, so I started feeling victorious about my progress since the first World Cup,\" said Kaur.\n\n\"Whenever we go for a tournament, we focus on giving our best, no matter the magnitude of the tournament. Our aim is to leave no stones unturned for the Olympics as well and we are confident that we will return from Paris with a medal.\"\n\nBhakat also pointed out the invaluable experience of having a veteran like Deepika Kumari in the team. \"It's a great advantage that Deepika is going to the Olympics for the fourth time. She understands the challenges we might face in Paris,\" she explained.\n\nBhajan added, \"Deepika's experience, along with Ankita's, is our biggest strength. They help us understand and rectify any issues in our game. Our ability to communicate and support each other is crucial.\"\n\nDeepika, one of India's most decorated archers, has been a beacon of excellence in the sport.

Korean chief coach Baek Woong Ki was excluded from the contingent, while their psychologist Gayatri Madkekar is still awaiting her visa to join the group here, said Mahato on Wednesday. And then there's the history with Indian archery, the \"bhaar\" (weight). It's a term Rai used more than a couple of times in a chat after their practice session, and on which Indian archers have crumbled over the last few Games.\n\n\"Olympics aate hi medal ka bhaar aa jata tha (The moment the Olympics come, we feel the weight of a medal),\" Rai, in his fourth Olympics, said.\n\nThe Olympics are upon the archers again, and Rai swears the \"bhaar\" feels lighter this time. The first test of that statement will arrive on Thursday, when the three men and women line up for the ranking rounds. How the Indians shoot there could give an indication on how their Games, once it opens on Friday, goes.\n\nMore so in the team events. The top four seeded teams -- taking into account combined individual scores of the three archers in the ranking round -- will get a direct spot in the quarter-finals. Eyeing that spot will be the men's team, on which added spotlight rests. Ranked world No. 2 with fairly consistent results in the recent past, it won gold stunning powerhouses South Korea in the final of the Shanghai World Cup in April. In that World Cup, the same trio of Rai, Dhiraj and Pravin Jadhav finished second in qualification, and carried the momentum into the elimination rounds.\n\n\"Qualifying with a good ranking is really important for us. The target will be to finish in the top 4 or 6,\" Rai said. \"All six of us (men and women) have to take the good form into it and shoot well in order to earn a better spot in the draw.\"\n\nThe ranking rounds will also determine the seedings in the individual event and which pair will combine for the mixed team event (the top male Indian from the ranking round, for example, will team up with the top female). The women's team of experienced Deepika Kumari, young Bhajan Kaur and Ankita Bhakat carry more subdued expectations this time. And women's coach Mahato prefers it that way. \"Let them go about their thing quietly,\" she said.\n\nDeepika has lived through her share of Olympic hopes built dizzyingly high and shattered into dramatic pieces at rock bottom. First round shocks, quarterfinal near-misses. It mirrors Indian archery's past few Olympics, and it all comes back to how this bunch can handle that \"bhaar\".\n\n\"Earlier, we would invest a lot of our minds in thinking about medals at the Olympics. We wouldn't think like that in training, or in other tournaments like World Cups,\" Rai said. \"But come the Olympics, we would take it (the weight) upon ourselves -- no one else would put it on us.\n\n\"Now we have moved on from those things. Our only target here is to put on the best performances of our life. We've worked on the processes to do that, and not bypassing them to think straight about medals.\"\n\nThe archery squad has been in France for about a fortnight now, keeping at it in terms of training and intensity. It's a lesson from the previous Olympic experiences, a member of the contingent said, where archers would often tail off closer to the start of the Games on the back of World Cup medals.\n\nAt Esplanade des Invalides where archery will be held, Indians have had two practice sessions in the main competition arena, which is slightly different in design and wind resistance compared to the adjacent training venue. Even though weather and wind can be quite fickle in Paris, acclimatisation objective has been met, said Rai.\n\nThe addition of Dhiraj -- Jadhav and Rai also competed in Tokyo -- adds solidity to the men's team, with his growth and consistency over the last year reflecting on the team performances that included a silver medal at the Hangzhou Asian Games (the women's team also won bronze there).\n\n\"This year's medals have kept the team's self-belief high.

Evidently, all the effort paid off as she is now on her way to the 2024 Paris Olympics to participate in the women's archery events. Her archery journey began when she had not even hit her teenage years, and now at 26 she finally gets the opportunity to represent her country at the sport she loves.\n\nBhakat was first introduced to archery at only 10 years old when she was living in Calcutta. She entered a local archery competition in Kolkata's Circus Maidan but did not have the expertise nor could afford the proper equipment at the time, being born into the family of a milkman.\n\nDespite her financial constraints, she began to practice at a local club by borrowing equipment and honing her skills and then eventually became a part of the Tata Archery Academy in 2014. She trained at the academy in Jamshedpur under the guidance of her coaches Dharmendra Tiwari, Purnima Mahato, and Ram Awdesh.\n\nOnly a year later, Bhakat was selected to be part of the team that would represent India at the World Archery Youth Championships 2015 in Yankton, South Dakota. At the time, she was barely an adult but managed to qualify for the trials held by the Archery Association of India (AAI) to select athletes for the international tournament.\n\nAfter this international debut, Bhakat did not stop making her country proud. She won a silver and a bronze medal at the Seoul International Youth Archery Festa in 2015 and then reached the finals at the Asia Cup 2017 and the Indian Senior National Championships, also in 2017.\n\nSince then, Bhakat has participated in several tournaments and has won laurels in most of them. She won her first gold medal at the 2022 Khelo India Women's National Ranking Archery Tournament at the JRD Tata Sports Complex.\n\nBhakat is a first-time Olympian who is a gold medallist in the mixed team (with Jemson Singh Ningthoujam) at the 2017 U21 World Championships, according to the Olympics website.\n\nShe is also a team recurve bronze medallist at the Hangzhou 2022 Asian Games (with Bhajan Kaur and Simranjeet Kaur) and a three-time Asian championships team medallist - silver in 2021, bronze in 2019 and 2023.\n\nShe finished in the top eight at the Final World Archery Olympic Qualifier 2024, managed to secure her spot on the Indian Olympic team for archery, and will be making her debut appearance at the Paris Olympic Games 2024. She will be competing in the Archery women's individual event of the Olympics on July 25.", "source": {"uri": "shethepeople.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "SheThePeople"}, "authors": [{"uri":

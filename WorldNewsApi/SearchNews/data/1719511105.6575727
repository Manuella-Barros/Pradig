{"id": 223741978, "title": "Inland Hospital in Waterville debuts high-tech surgical tool", "text": "WATERVILLE \u2014 Northern Light Inland Hospital officials have announced the addition of a new high-tech tool called the da Vinci Xi surgical system. The system features 3D robotic equipment that is controlled by the surgeon and is considered an extension of their hands, according to a press release. The surgeon guides the robot to make tiny incisions and provides high-definition 3D vision with the ability to magnify up to 10 times the normal size. It will be used for a variety of minimally invasive surgical procedures at Inland Hospital, including gynecology, urology, and general surgeries. \u201cThis state-of-the-art tool for our surgeons is amazing technology. It provides a minimally invasive approach and extreme precision during the surgery. This means that patients who have surgery with this equipment will typically have less pain, a quicker recovery and return to work, and less risk for wound infections,\u201d Nick Chobanian, MD, senior physician executive and a gynecologic surgeon, said in the release. Adding robotic equipment helps recruit surgeons, which has been an ongoing challenge in rural areas like Maine, Chobanian noted.

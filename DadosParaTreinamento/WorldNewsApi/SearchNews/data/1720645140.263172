You can\u2019t let the left get away with it just because their cheating did not work.\u201dThe report adds, \"Nearly every leader who matters in various state GOPs, the national Republican Party, and within the conservative movement is playing part in a well-funded, coordinated attempt to corrupt American elections in a way so transparently cynical, so authoritarian, that it makes the right\u2019s 'voter fraud\u201d'crackdowns of the pre-Trump era look like a flicker of intellectual calm by comparison.\"You can read more here.", "summary": "<img src=\"https://www.rawstory.com/media-library/a-trump-themed-flag-is-flown-by-supporters-across-the-street-from-trump-tower-before-former-u-s-president-donald-trump-holds-a.jpg?id=52364616&width=2000&height=1500&coordinates=44%2C0%2C45%2C0\"/><br/><br/><p>According to a report from Rolling Stone, lawyers and <a href=\"https://www.rawstory.com/trump-felony-2668483297/\" target=\"_blank\">pro-Donald Trump conservative activists</a> have been busy at work turning Georgia into a laboratory testing out how to make sure they don't lose elections with plans to <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-georgia-laboratory-rig-2024-1235034510/\" target=\"_blank\">export their successes to other states.</a><br/><br/>As Roling Stones' Adam Rawsley and Asawin Suebsaeng are reporting, since <a href=\"https://www.rawstory.com/trump-judge-juan-merchan-2668483497/\" target=\"_blank\">Donald Trump's loss</a> of the pivotal state in the 2020 presidential election \u2014 which led him to attempt to subvert the ele", "url": "https://www.rawstory.com/trump-georgia-fraud/", "image": "https://www.rawstory.com/media-library/a-trump-themed-flag-is-flown-by-supporters-across-the-street-from-trump-tower-before-former-u-s-president-donald-trump-holds-a.jpg?id=52364616&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C66%2C0%2C67", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 16:55:26", "author": "Tom Boggioni", "authors": ["Tom Boggioni"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.201}

{"id": 231243254, "title": "1st public tours of Michigan Central Station: 'Spectacular,' 'off the charts,' 'so cool'", "text": "Like pilgrims in a cathedral, thousands of visitors from metro Detroit and beyond trekked to the Michigan Central Station on Friday to marvel at the restored beauty of the longtime eyesore. They took in every detail from the polished floors to the majestic ceilings to the craftsmanship that went into the original clock. The mood was festive as people moved through the building. Dramatic music played in a loop ending with a voice telling them that trains were pulling into the station. \"You see the work they did out here: They re-created everything the right way,\u201d said Tom Toft, as he waited outside for his tour to begin. \"It's spectacular.\" Toft toured with his wife, Renee, and her cousin, Sylvia Ross-Schultz and her husband, Tom Schultz. The families had relatives who worked in the building back in the day. \u201cWe\u2019re so glad to see it getting so much better, and it's beautiful. \u2026 It\u2019s just in my heart, it\u2019s been the neatest thing,\u201d said Ross-Schultz. \u201cIt\u2019s another crown jewel in the renovation of Detroit.\u201d Her husband agreed. \u201cI made the statement, and I was wrong, that (the comeback) would never happen in my lifetime,\u201d said Schultz. \u201cThe rebirth is off the charts.\u201d 'People are coming in here awestruck' By midafternoon, about 1,800 people had toured the building and that number was expected to grow to about 5,000 by the time the tours ended at 10 p.m., Michigan Central spokesman Dan Austin said. Paul Wilson, 42, of Detroit, said he\u2019s just thought of the station as a ruin his whole life \u2014 until now. \u201cIt\u2019s so cool how they refurbished everything and still kept a whole lot of the building intact,\u201d Wilson said. John Martin is a new Michigan Central ambassador after an advertising career and a couple years working part-time gigs. He snagged the job just in time for the station's reopening and Friday was just his second day of work. Martin grew up in Lincoln Park, later worked in downtown and spent most of his life watching the city up close. He toured Michigan Central\u2019s open house back in 2018 after it was acquired by Ford and has since been stunned by Detroit\u2019s numerous and gorgeous renovations. On Friday, Martin stood at the doors of the Grand Hall, greeting people as they entered with smiles widening and eyes lighting up at their first sight of the hall. \u201cPeople are coming in here awestruck, they\u2019re not complaining,\u201d he said. More: Michigan Central Station tours: How to visit Ford's renovated train depot More: Michigan Central Station: What you'll see on the tour Christina Roki, of Sterling Heights, and Grant Sloan, of West Bloomfield, are two automotive content creators who were invited to opening day by Ford. They said they were brought to tears by the stories preserved inside Michigan Central Station. \u201cWhat we appreciate about it most is how much detail Ford cared to preserve to show the story. They kept part of the graffiti on the walls, they preserved a lot of the tickets they found. \u2026 Even the brick, all the chisels we see on the brick, they didn\u2019t try to make fine cut lines, they still want to show all the history that this building has,\u201d said Roki. As they walked from room to room, they remained at a loss for words. \u201cThe inside was literally mind-blowing. I feel like I was walking in on such a big piece of history that\u2019s been preserved for so long, so it\u2019s crazy to think that this is something they\u2019ve been working on in the past few years,\u201d said Roki. But the pair said one of the most significant parts was just to see how Michigan Central had been given new life, narrowly dodging demolition. Sloan remembered times passing the station with friends just before the renovation began. He saw graffiti and decay. Now, to see the modern history meshed with its historical past was an awesome experience. \u201cAny Detroiter will agree that this building was such an eyesore for such a long time. Growing up in Detroit and knowing its history but never seeing it operational. \u2026 But now seeing it up in running, it\u2019s really touching to see that Ford took on such a large project,\u201d said Sloan. \u201cIt\u2019s early but I think it\u2019s safe to say that the investment already paid off.\u201d 'Not enough wonderful words to describe it' Bob and Shari Bilkie, of Northville, have deep family ties to Detroit. They often went on dates downtown before marrying almost 41 years ago. On Friday, they walked the side streets surrounding Michigan Central Station as they waited for the public tours to begin at noon. They parked at 10 a.m. and took in the sights of the Corktown neighborhood on the cool, cloudy day. \u201cIt is so cool, the fact that they took something decrepit, falling apart, an eyesore and turned it into something absolutely beautiful,\u201d Shari Bilkie said. Southwest Detroit resident Jennifer Serra set an alarm in hopes of scoring tickets to see the train station on its first day of public tours. \u201cThere's just not enough wonderful words to describe it,\u201d Serra, 45, said after taking the tour. Her only problem? She had somewhere else to be Friday afternoon and wanted to spend more time in the station. She has already made plans to come back for another tour in a few days. Pro tip: How to get into a popular Berlin bar \u201cI feel like it's like a symbolic representation of what goes on in our city,\u201d she said of Michigan Central Station. \u201cI feel like there's just these landmarks in certain cities \u2026 that just really kind of embody the overall history of what's going on. I feel like this helps us bring a little bit of closure to some tough times and shows renewal.\u201d People's excitement was obvious, even before they got inside. NPR reporter Bobby Allyn, 35, walked quickly toward Michigan Central Station as he prepared to interview President Joe Biden\u2019s director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, Arati Prabhakar, at Newlab, which is next door to the station. He said he was super excited to be in Detroit, having heard so much about the city when he lived in Berlin. \u201cBerliners are obsessed with Detroit because of techno music,\u201d Allyn said. \u201cIt\u2019s the birthplace of techno. Look up Jeff Mills, of Detroit, and techno. You\u2019ll see. When you go to Club Berghain in Berlin, it\u2019s impossible to get in but if you wear a hat that says, \u2018Detroit,\u2019 they let you in.\u201d Allyn, a technology correspondent, reports on startups, artificial intelligence, privacy issues and tech litigation. While he was directed to the neighboring building, the whole site is part of the mobility hub led by Ford Motor Co. Allyn said he couldn\u2019t wait to see the inside of the restored train depot after the interview.", "summary": "<a href=\"https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVwLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL21pY2hpZ2FuL2RldHJvaXQvMjAyNC8wNi8wOC9taWNoaWdhbi1jZW50cmFsLXB1YmxpYy10b3Vycy1yYXZlLXJldmlld3MvNzQwMTMzMjAwMDcv0gEA?oc=5\" target=\"_blank\">Michigan Central Station draws rave reviews from first visitors</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">Detroit Free Press</font>", "url": "https://eu.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2024/06/08/michigan-central-public-tours-rave-reviews/74013320007/", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/07/PDTF/74020096007-060724-dfp-mcs-tour-rg-06.jpg?auto=webp&crop=2399,1350,x0,y265&format=pjpg&width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 13:24:55", "author": "Detroit Free Press", "authors": ["Detroit Free Press"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.05}

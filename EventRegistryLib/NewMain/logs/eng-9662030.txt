by 2030s", "body": "Australian homes could be powered by nuclear energy by 2035 at the earliest under the coalition's election plan.\n\nOpposition Leader Peter Dutton has unveiled details of his much-anticipated nuclear energy policy, which will put nuclear power plants in Australia's former fossil fuel heartlands if the coalition wins the federal election.\n\nHe said a coalition government would build seven plants at existing coal-fired power stations, with the assets to be owned by the Commonwealth.\n\nThis includes Loy Yang Power Station in Victoria's Gippsland area, Callide and Tarong in Queensland, Mount Piper at Lithgow in central west NSW and Liddell in NSW's Hunter region.\n\nThe coalition would also build small modular reactors at Northern Power Station in Port Augusta, South Australia and at Muja Power Station, south of Perth.\n\nSMRs are supposedly cheaper and quicker to build than their larger counterparts but no projects have been completed globally and the CSIRO warned it would be \"very unlikely\" one would be up and running as quickly as 2038.\n\n\"We want to utilise the existing assets that we've got, and the poles and wires that are used at the moment on the coal-fired power station sites ... to distribute the energy generated from the latest-generation nuclear reactors,\" Mr Dutton told reporters in Sydney on Wednesday.\n\n\"We have the ability to do that in a way that renewables can't.\"\n\nGoing nuclear will require lifting current bans on the energy source, setting up potential political battles with the states, where some political leaders have already said they won't allow atomic plants.\n\nThe nuclear power plants will form part of an \"energy mix\" that also includes gas and renewables, which the opposition claims will help provide a round-the-clock source of baseload power.\n\n\"It allows us to put enough nuclear into the system such that it provides the firming power and such that it brings downward pressure on prices,\" Mr Dutton said.\n\nBut even if the opposition wins government, according to their plan, it will take another 10 to 12 years from an official decision for nuclear electricity to enter the grid with the first two nuclear plants expected to be completed between 2035 and 2037.\n\nThis means Australia could still reach net-zero emissions by 2050, Mr Dutton said.\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese has slammed the plan and says it overlooks Australia's renewable energy potential.\n\n\"It'll be a taxpayer funded nuclear fantasy,\" he told ABC radio.\n\n\"Here in Australia, we have the best solar resources in the world.\n\n\"This makes no economic sense, as well as leaving us in a position of energy insecurity because of the time that it will take to roll out a nuclear reactor.\"\n\nThe latest edition of the benchmark GenCost report, released by the CSIRO and the Australian Energy Market Operator in May, found the cost of building a large-scale nuclear power plant would be at least $8.5 billion.\n\nMr Dutton said he will have more to say about his plan's cost \"in due course\".\n\nThe coalition is also attempting to assuage health concerns by insisting modern nuclear power plants are \"incredibly safe\".\n\nThe nuclear reactor in the southern Sydney suburb of Lucas Heights, for example, has been used in medical and material science research for years, rather than larger-scale power generation.\n\nA 470-megawatt reactor produces waste equivalent to the size of a soda can which could be stored on site and moved to a permanent home, Mr Dutton said.\n\nBut state leaders have already objected to nuclear plants in their jurisdictions.\n\nNSW Premier Chris Minns says he would not lift the state's nuclear prohibition on energy production.\n\n\"If all of a sudden you were to introduce nuclear power, that investment is at real risk,\" he told reporters.\n\n\"It costs a lot of money and second, it takes a lot of time and we don't have a day to wait.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, leader of the Queensland Liberal National party David Crisafulli - who is tipped win the state's election - said he would not repeal his state's nuclear prohibition either.", "source": {"uri":

His proposal for seven nuclear power stations is, at present, legally impossible, technically improbable, economically irrational and environmentally irresponsible.\n\nAuthor\n\nIan Lowe\n\nEmeritus Professor, School of Environment and Science, Griffith University\n\nGiven the repeated community objections to much more modest nuclear proposals, such as storage of low-level radioactive waste, there is almost certainly no social licence for nuclear power stations.\n\nDutton promises that, if elected, he would make nuclear power a reality within a a little over ten years. Given the enormous obstacles even to turn the first sod, this seems like a pipe dream.\n\nHere's why.\n\nLegal status: seemingly impossible\n\nSome 25 years ago, the Howard Coalition government legislated a ban on nuclear energy in its environment laws. Coalition governments have been in power federally for most of the time since, but have made no attempt to repeal the ban.\n\nEven a sweeping victory in the forthcoming federal election would not give the Coalition the Senate majority necessary to change the ban in the next term of parliament. As is usually the case, only half the Senate will be elected, so simple arithmetic shows no prospect of a Coalition majority. The only possibility would be negotiating with the crossbench.\n\nOf the seven nuclear power stations Dutton is proposing to build on the site of old coal stations, five would be in the eastern states: two in Queensland at Tarong and Callide, two in New South Wales at Mount Piper and Liddell, and one in Victoria at Loy Yang.\n\nEach of these states have their own laws banning nuclear power. The eastern premiers have made clear they will not change their laws. Even Dutton's Queensland Liberal National Party colleagues, who face a state election in October, do not support the plan.\n\nSo the proposal does not satisfy current laws and there is no realistic possibility of these changing in the timeframe Dutton would need to get the first reactors built (he says the first would be operating by the mid-2030s).\n\nDutton could try to bypass the states by building on Commonwealth land. But this would mean missing the supposed benefit of locating reactors next to existing transmission lines at old coal plant sites.\n\nCost: astronomical\n\nCost is a huge problem. Dutton has promised nuclear will deliver cheap power. But CSIRO's latest GenCost study on the cost of different power generation technologies shows there is no economic case for nuclear power in Australia. Nuclear power would cost at least 50% more than power produced by renewables and firmed with storage.\n\nThis estimate is conservative - in reality nuclear would likely cost even more, as GenCost relies on the nuclear industry's cost estimates. All recent projects have gone way over budget.\n\nThe three nuclear power stations being built in western Europe are all costing two to four times the original budget estimate.\n\nIt is true a renewables-dominated grid will require more storage, which means building more grid batteries and pumped hydro schemes. It is also true we'll need to expand our existing 40,000 kilometres of transmission lines by 25% to get renewable electricity to consumers.\n\nBut even when we add these extra costs, and even when we accept industry figures, nuclear still cannot compete with solar farms or wind turbines. CSIRO costs nuclear at between A$8 and $17 billion for a large-scale reactor.\n\nThere are no private investors lining up to build nuclear. Overseas, nuclear has always been heavily bankrolled by the taxpayer. Dutton's plan would either require a huge spend of public money or a major increase to power bills. In the United Kingdom, for example, the government has assured the developer of its Hinckley Point C reactor they will be able to recoup the cost by charging higher rates for the power.\n\nWhile Dutton is promoting nuclear as a way to avoid building expensive and often unpopular new transmission lines, this is not true. Several proposed reactors would need their own lines built, as coal transmission capacity is rapidly being taken up by renewables, as South Australia's energy minister Tom Koutsantonis has pointed out.\n\nTime: we're out of it\n\nBuilding a nuclear reactor takes years or even decades. Dutton has promised Australia would have its first nuclear power station operational in a decade, assuming his party is elected and their scheme implemented without delay in 2025.\n\nThis claim is wholly without merit. In 2006, the Coalition government commissioned a study on whether nuclear power was viable in Australia, which found it would likely take 15 years to build a reactor here. The timeframe today would be similar, because we don't have a workforce with experience of building large nuclear reactors. We also don't have the regulatory framework needed to give the community confidence nuclear power stations could be built and operated safely.\n\nEven in the United States, the UK and France - three countries with long experience with nuclear - no recent project has been completed within ten years.\n\nIt defies logic to suggest we could start with a blank sheet of paper and build complex systems faster than countries with long-established industries and regulatory regimes.\n\nNuclear backers often point to examples in China and the United Arab Emirates, which have both built reactors within about a decade. But these countries do not tolerate the community objections which would be inevitable. In Australia, consultation, legal challenges and protests often delay far less controversial projects.\n\nWhy does this matter? Dutton's push for nuclear isn't happening in a vacuum. This is the crucial decade for action on climate change. As Australian climate scientist Jo\u00eblle Gergis has written, we are now paying the cost of long inaction on climate change in damage from more severe bushfires, floods and drought.\n\nLet's say the Coalition is elected and sets about making this plan a reality. In practice, this would commit us to decades more of coal and gas, while we wait for nuclear to arrive. We would break our Paris Agreement undertaking to make deep cuts to emissions, and keep making climate change worse.\n\nI was president of the Australian Conservation Foundation from 2004 to 2014.

unveiled", "body": "The proposed sites for multiple nuclear power plants could soon be unveiled as Opposition Leader Peter Dutton prepares to announce his much-anticipated energy policy.\n\nMr Dutton is set to hold a press conference on Wednesday alongside Nationals leader David Littleproud and deputy Liberal leader Sussan Ley after briefing his party.\n\nAccording to media reports, he is expected to reveal the location of up to three sites for nuclear energy plants should the coalition win the next federal election.\n\nAsked about the announcement on Wednesday morning, Ms Ley remained tight-lipped.\n\n\"I'm not naming them,\" she told Sky News.\n\n\"We've said that it makes sense to connect new nuclear technologies to existing brownfield sites where you already have the grid in place.\"\n\nMr Dutton has said he will oppose Australia's legally binding 2030 climate target, a 43 per cent emissions reduction on 2005 levels, if he is elected.\n\nThe coalition remains committed to reaching net-zero emissions by 2050, senior party members have said.\n\nA report by the CSIRO found nuclear power plants wouldn't be built at the earliest until 2040.\n\nThough Ms Ley said the community would be consulted, state leaders including NSW Premier Chris Minns have already objected to nuclear power in their jurisdictions.\n\n\"There's a few questions about whether this is a fantasy or a pipe dream or it's a legitimate energy policy,\" he told ABC.\n\n\"We've got a prohibition on nuclear power in the state - my government's not going to waive that, my understanding is that the Queensland opposition and government won't waive it either.\"\n\nThough Ms Ley noted NSW had a nuclear reactor in Sydney's outer suburbs that is used in medical and material science research.\n\nThe latest report on the technology's feasibility has found nuclear power is a \"dangerous distraction\" to Australia's renewable energy transition because it would take too long and cost too much to build.\n\nEven if nuclear restrictions were lifted tomorrow, it would still be at least 20 years before a reactor could be operational, the paper released by the Australian Conservation Foundation says.\n\nBy that time, all or nearly all Australia's remaining coal-fired power plants will be closed, meaning carbon emissions-intensive fossil fuels will likely have to be prolonged.\n\nEven ignoring the lead time required to establish a nuclear industry, it would be unable to compete financially with renewables and require taxpayer subsidies worth tens or hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\nAnother hurdle is convincing Australians nuclear poses no safety risk.\n\nMajor insurers, including AAMI, Allianz and NRMA, specifically exclude coverage to homes, cars or possessions from nuclear accidents.\n\n\"Proposals to introduce nuclear power to Australia make no sense,\" concludes the report, which was led by anti-nuclear campaigner Jim Green and released on Wednesday.\n\nThe paper was written in response to a federal coalition plan to replace coal-fired power stations with nuclear, rather than relying on increased investment in renewable energy and storage to reach net zero.\n\nMr Dutton argues baseload nuclear is necessary to achieve the energy transition without sacrificing affordability or reliability.\n\n\"I want to make sure that we've got renewables in the system,\" he told reporters on Tuesday.\n\n\"I'm happy for batteries, but we can't pretend that batteries can provide the storage.\n\n\"We need to make sure that as we decarbonise and as the economy transitions, that we do it in a sensible way.\"\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers has called the plan \"economic insanity\".\n\n\"It is the worst combination of economic and ideological stupidity,\" he told ABC radio.\n\n\"Nuclear takes longer, it costs more, and it will squander Australia's unique combination of advantages.\"\n\nThe latest edition of the benchmark GenCost report, released by the CSIRO and Australian Energy Market Operator in May, found the cost of building a large-scale nuclear power plant would be at least $8.5 billion.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk",

But on Thursday the opposition leader received some welcome backing.\n\nZiggy Switkowski, who headed John Howard's 2006 nuclear inquiry that reported favourably on the potential for nuclear energy in Australia, described Dutton as \"a person of conviction\" and said his blueprint was feasible.\n\nWhile acknowledging details were needed, including costings, Switkowski, a former chairman of the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (and a nuclear physicist), said the scepticism about the plan was misplaced. \"The strong positions some critics have taken in the last 24 hours are ridiculous.\"\n\nHe said in the last 20 years the nuclear debate had been shaped by academics, the commentariat and junior politicians. Now it was being shaped by the leader of the opposition with an emerging coherent plan.\n\nPeter Dutton and energy spokesman Ted O'Brien \"are as well informed on things nuclear as any group I've talked to in the last 20 years in Australia,\" Switkowski said, adding Dutton was \"exactly right\" in saying the nuclear generators should be government-owned.\n\nIn the timing of his announcement, Dutton is putting his nuclear power policy through an early stress test.\n\nPolitics often swings to and fro on the \"vibe\". The vibe has recently been running against the Labor government, with polls in Nine newspapers this week suggesting Anthony Albanese doing poorly.\n\nParliament is about to start its final fortnight before a winter break, giving the government the chance for sustained king hits on the nuclear policy. If Labor can use the sitting to its advantage, and Dutton also takes a knock in the next polls, the \"vibe\" will change. The government could regain some momentum. It should be helped in this by the July 1 start of the tax cuts.\n\nLabor is galvanised by the need to win the early post-announcement clash. Albanese is energised, with crafted lines. \"This is just a fantasy,\" he said on Thursday. \"Instead of Snow White and the seven dwarves, this is Peter Dutton and the seven nuclear reactors.\"\n\nAnd, \"you would have us believe that a mob who'd struggle to assemble an IKEA flat-pack are going to start from scratch and be able to develop a nuclear energy industry in Australia\". It's unclear whether he crafts his own zingers.\n\nBoth sides claim to welcome the election being a referendum on energy. It'll be about much more than that but energy - the government's transition progress, the opposition's response - will be a central battleground. With nuclear firmly out there, the weaponry is being marshalled.\n\nBy announcing the seven proposed sites for reactors, Dutton is attempting to reduce uncertainty, and counter the \"would you want a reactor in your backyard?\" scare.\n\nIndeed the Coalition proposes to put the reactors - all on sites of former or current power stations - in its own backyards.\n\nOf the seven seats involved, five are Coalition (three held by the Nationals, two Liberal). The affected part of the one Labor seat, Hunter, would transfer under the draft redistribution boundaries into the New England electorate of former Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce (a great fan of nuclear). The remaining seat, Calare, is held by independent Andrew Gee, formerly a National.\n\nOf the seats, only one is on a margin of less than 5 per cent (Flynn in Queensland).\n\nOpposition sources say that in its polling, nuclear had more than 50 per cent support in all these electorates. But the polling hasn't been released.\n\nCommunities affected will be offered packages but there will still be local dissent over the plan. So local divisions will be running on two tracks in coming months - in the Dutton areas over the nuclear proposal, and in various other places over the rollout of transmission infrastructure and big renewable projects.\n\nWhile naming the sites early is sensible, holding back the plan's cost leaves the Coalition open to attack, especially given a major question over nuclear is that it's so expensive.\n\nThere's also the criticism the Coalition's plan is pitched so far into the future it could create a big gap in the middle of Australia's energy transition.\n\nDutton has abandoned Australia's 2030 emissions reduction target; the renewed climate and energy wars are likely to hit investor confidence; and it's not clear to what degree a Coalition government would slow the renewables rollout. All this could leave Australia in a limbo land in the late 2020s-early 2030s.\n\nAnd history tells us it would be a miracle if the nuclear projects were on time or on budget (think Snowy Hydro 2).\n\nThe Coalition can thank Labor's embrace of AUKUS for undercutting the safety argument. The planned nuclear-powered submarines with their attendant needs, facilities and waste have bipartisan support.\n\nNevertheless safety will be an issue for some people. In vox pops this week, there were mentions of Chernobyl and Fukushima.\n\nOn the other hand, views about nuclear have substantially softened over the years. In the 2024 Lowy poll 61 per cent supported Australia using nuclear power to generate electricity. In 2011, in a related question, 62 per cent were against Australia building nuclear power plants as part of its plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nRegardless of polling, given the danger of big-target election pitches, Dutton's nuclear radicalism is remarkable, albeit that it's partly driven by a risk-averse desire to keep some climate-doubting Nationals in the tent.\n\nOne mark of this radicalism is the pledge the generators would be government-owned. It's a reminder the Coalition easily shrugs off its \"small government\" cloak, just like it did with all that spending during the pandemic.\n\nDutton's nuclear plan has been likened to John Hewson's Fightback, despite the many differences (including in the leader's electoral prospects). Fightback might have prevailed if it had not been for then prime minister Paul Keating's demolition skills. Labor has a similar mission now. It doesn't have a Keating.\n\nThe government has to convince the public Dutton's nuclear option is policy on the never-never, in cost and timing, plus being a form of climate-change denialism.\n\nBeyond that, however, between now and the election Labor will face many questions on its own energy transition, which is inevitably more bumpy than promised. The better it can credibly defend its record, the easier it will be to discredit the opposition alternative.\n\nIt's too early to predict how voters will judge the energy face-off. Nationals MP Darren Chester, who holds the Victorian seat of Gippsland, which would host a nuclear plant where the Loy Yang coal-fired power plant is located, puts it this way: \"We've run out on to the field, maybe tossed the coin, but we haven't even played the first quarter yet\".", "source": {"uri": "citynews.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Canberra CityNews"}, "authors": [],

They have the technical attributes needed for a nuclear plant, including transmission infrastructure, cooling water capacity and a skilled workforce, the opposition policy says.\n\nThe program would consist of two phases, starting with two establishment projects in the mid-2030s followed by a build of others through to 2050.\n\nMost sites would have larger reactors, with two - in South Australia and Western Australia - having small modular reactors. All mainland states would eventually have reactors.\n\nDutton said the generators would be owned by the Commonwealth government.\n\nThe first could begin operating in 2035 if small modular reactors are used, or 2037 \"if modern larger plants are found to be the best option\", the opposition says.\n\nThis is much earlier than the CSIRO has estimated that an initial plant could begin.\n\nThe CSIRO said in its May assessment of generation technology costs for Australia, that \"due to the current state of the development pipeline in Australia, that the earliest deployment would be from 2040\".\n\nDutton said he would be \"very happy for the election to be a referendum on energy, on nuclear, on power prices, on lights going out, on who has a sustainable pathway for our country going forward\".\n\n\"We are going to the next election seeking a mandate from the Australian people, a very clear mandate that we want support to modernise our energy system ... which is about economic growth and jobs for decades and generations to come,\" Dutton said. said.\n\nThe opposition says the timeline for nuclear energy including building two establishment projects is ten to 12 years, \"from the government making a decision until zero-emissions nuclear electricity first enters the grid\".\n\nThe Coalition policy says a key advantage of the nuclear energy plants was they could be plugged into existing grids. \"This means they can effectively replace retired or retiring coal plants and avoid much of the new spending needed for Labor's 'renewables-only' system, including new transmission poles and wires.\"\n\nThe government would partner with nuclear companies from aboard on development and operation.\n\nEach community around a site would receive a benefits package enshrined in legislation.\n\nIt would include:\n\nEstablishing a civil nuclear programme would require an expanded Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency to license and regulate the power stations, a Nuclear Energy Coordinating Authority, and a government business enterprise to be called Affordable Energy Australia.\n\nDutton could not give a cost for the nuclear plan, saying only it would be \"a fraction\" of the government's energy transition plan costing $1.2 trillion to $1.5 trillion. He said the opposition would have more to say on cost \"in due course\".\n\nThe opposition leader announced his plan at a news conference in Sydney, after a pre-budget announcement had been deferred. He was flanked by a bevy of colleagues including Nationals leader David Littleproud.\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers said in a social media post: \"With Australia's advantages and opportunities, nothing could be more economically irrational or fiscally irresponsible\" than the nuclear policy\".\n\nChalmers told the ABC: \"Peter Dutton's nuclear negativity is economic insanity, pure and simple. Nuclear takes longer, it costs more and it will squander Australia's unique combination of advantages\".\n\nApart from a fierce campaign from federal Labor, Dutton faces attacks from the states. His plan is opposed by the Liberal-National opposition in Queensland where there is a state election within months.\n\nTony Wood, energy program director at the Grattan Institute, said it was \"more than strange that we have a Coalition proposal for public ownership while Labor is looking to drive private investment\" in the energy transition.\n\n\"This proposal for nuclear energy is not a climate change policy and the opposition must be clear on what it plans are for the rest of the economy's emissions to meet net-zero by 2050,\" Wood said.\n\n\"All our emissions targets are actually carbon budgets, so while Dutton is correct that it doesn't have to be a straight line reduction to 2050, all emissions that occur between now and then must come out of the carbon budget.\"\n\nHe said the opposition \"has not been clear on what sort of energy mix they see over the next 25 years. How will renewables figure and what about gas?\n\n\"The costs and timing are both very unclear, with no figures on the former and the prospect of a big gap in aligning the departure of coal with the arrival of nuclear\".", "source": {"uri": "home.nzcity.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NZCity"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Dutton", "type":

But on Thursday the opposition leader received some welcome backing.\n\nZiggy Switkowski, who headed John Howard's 2006 nuclear inquiry that reported favourably on the potential for nuclear energy in Australia, described Dutton as \"a person of conviction\" and said his blueprint was feasible.\n\nWhile acknowledging details were needed, including costings, Switkowski, a former chairman of the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (and a nuclear physicist), said the scepticism about the plan was misplaced. \"The strong positions some critics have taken in the last 24 hours are ridiculous.\"\n\nHe said in the last 20 years the nuclear debate had been shaped by academics, the commentariat and junior politicians. Now it was being shaped by the leader of the opposition with an emerging coherent plan.\n\nPeter Dutton and energy spokesman Ted O'Brien \"are as well informed on things nuclear as any group I've talked to in the last 20 years in Australia,\" Switkowski said, adding Dutton was \"exactly right\" is saying the nuclear generators should be government-owned.\n\nIn the timing of his announcement, Dutton is putting his nuclear power policy through an early stress test.\n\nPolitics often swings to and fro on the \"vibe\". The vibe has recently been running against the Labor government, with polls in Nine newspapers this week suggesting Anthony Albanese doing poorly.\n\nParliament is about to start its final fortnight before a winter break, giving the government the chance for sustained king hits on the nuclear policy. If Labor can use the sitting to its advantage, and Dutton also takes a knock in the next polls, the \"vibe\" will change. The government could regain some momentum.

But on Thursday the opposition leader received some welcome backing.\n\nZiggy Switkowski, who headed John Howard's 2006 nuclear inquiry that reported favourably on the potential for nuclear energy in Australia, described Dutton as \"a person of conviction\" and said his blueprint was feasible.\n\nWhile acknowledging details were needed, including costings, Mr Switkowski, a former chairman of the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (and a nuclear physicist), said the scepticism about the plan was misplaced.\n\nHe said in the past 20 years the nuclear debate had been shaped by academics, the commentariat and junior politicians.\n\nNow it was being shaped by the leader of the opposition with an emerging coherent plan.\n\nPeter Dutton and energy spokesman Ted O'Brien \"are as well informed on things nuclear as any group I've talked to in the last 20 years in Australia,\" Mr Switkowski said, adding Dutton was \"exactly right\" is saying the nuclear generators should be government-owned.\n\nIn the timing of his announcement, Mr Dutton is putting his nuclear power policy through an early stress test.\n\nPolitics often swings to and fro on the \"vibe\".\n\nThe vibe has recently been running against the Labor government, with polls in Nine newspapers this week suggesting Anthony Albanese doing poorly.\n\nParliament is about to start its final fortnight before a winter break, giving the government the chance for sustained king hits on the nuclear policy.\n\nIf Labor can use the sitting to its advantage, and Mr Dutton also takes a knock in the next polls, the \"vibe\" will change.\n\nThe government could regain some momentum. It should be helped in this by the July 1 start of the tax cuts.\n\nLabor is galvanised by the need to win the early post-announcement clash. Albanese is energised, with crafted lines.\n\n\"This is just a fantasy,\" he said on Thursday.\n\n\"Instead of Snow White and the seven dwarves, this is Peter Dutton and the seven nuclear reactors.\"\n\nAnd, \"you would have us believe that a mob who'd struggle to assemble an IKEA flat-pack are going to start from scratch and be able to develop a nuclear energy industry in Australia\".\n\nIt's unclear whether he crafts his own zingers.\n\nBoth sides claim to welcome the election being a referendum on energy.\n\nIt'll be about much more than that but energy - the government's transition progress, the opposition's response - will be a central battleground.\n\nWith nuclear firmly out there, the weaponry is being marshalled.\n\nBy announcing the seven proposed sites for reactors, Mr Dutton is attempting to reduce uncertainty, and counter the \"would you want a reactor in your backyard?\" scare.\n\nIndeed the Coalition proposes to put the reactors - all on sites of former or current power stations - in its own backyards.\n\nOf the seven seats involved, five are Coalition (three held by the Nationals, two Liberal).\n\nThe affected part of the one Labor seat, Hunter, would transfer under the draft redistribution boundaries into the New England electorate of former Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce (a great fan of nuclear).\n\nThe remaining seat, Calare, is held by independent Andrew Gee, formerly a National.\n\nOf the seats, only one is on a margin of less than five per cent (Flynn in Queensland).\n\nOpposition sources say that in its polling, nuclear had more than 50 per cent support in all these electorates. But the polling hasn't been released.\n\nCommunities affected will be offered packages but there will still be local dissent over the plan.\n\nSo local divisions will be running on two tracks in coming months - in the Dutton areas over the nuclear proposal, and in various other places over the rollout of transmission infrastructure and big renewable projects.\n\nWhile naming the sites early is sensible, holding back the plan's cost leaves the Coalition open to attack, especially given a major question over nuclear is that it's so expensive.\n\nThere's also the criticism the Coalition's plan is pitched so far into the future it could create a big gap in the middle of Australia's energy transition.\n\nDutton has abandoned Australia's 2030 emissions reduction target; the renewed climate and energy wars are likely to hit investor confidence; and it's not clear to what degree a Coalition government would slow the renewables rollout.\n\nAll this could leave Australia in a limbo land in the late 2020s -- early 2030s.\n\nAnd history tells us it would be a miracle if the nuclear projects were on time or on budget (think Snowy Hydro 2).\n\nThe Coalition can thank Labor's embrace of AUKUS for undercutting the safety argument. The planned nuclear-powered submarines with their attendant needs, facilities and waste have bipartisan support.\n\nNevertheless safety will be an issue for some people.\n\nIn vox pops this week, there were mentions of Chernobyl and Fukushima.\n\nOn the other hand, views about nuclear have substantially softened over the years.\n\nIn the 2024 Lowy poll, 61 per cent supported Australia using nuclear power to generate electricity. In 2011, in a related question, 62 per cent were against Australia building nuclear power plants as part of its plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nRegardless of polling, given the danger of big-target election pitches, Mr Dutton's nuclear radicalism is remarkable, albeit that it's partly driven by a risk-averse desire to keep some climate-doubting Nationals in the tent.\n\nOne mark of this radicalism is the pledge the generators would be government-owned. It's a reminder the Coalition easily shrugs off its \"small government\" cloak, just like it did with all that spending during the pandemic.\n\nMr Dutton's nuclear plan has been likened to John Hewson's Fightback, despite the many differences (including in the leader's electoral prospects). Fightback might have prevailed if it had not been for then prime minister Paul Keating's demolition skills. Labor has a similar mission now.

And it comes as we can now expect the \"climate wars\" to be ignited once again after Dutton said last week that he would not support the nationally legislated 2030 emission reduction target.\n\nAustralia doesn't have time for yet more climate wars, nor for putting off the energy transition another generation.\n\nAccording to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius will require significant and rapid reductions in emissions this decade.\n\nAccording to the Coalition, the first two nuclear reactor sites will be operational between 2035 and 2037. However, the CSIRO-Gencost report says that once a decision to pursue such technology is agreed upon, a 15-year development timeframe should be expected for nuclear in Australia.\n\nBut it could be even longer, especially when considering just how many unknowns and hurdles are ahead.\n\nEstablishing a nuclear industry in Australia would require the Coalition to win the election, including a majority in the Senate or incredibly favourable terms with a crossbench. It would require repealing a ban on nuclear energy in Australia, getting the cooperation of the states and removing state nuclear bans (with premiers already declaring their opposition to the plan this morning). It would involve getting past the inevitable community backlash at proposed locations, building up the workforce capacity for an industry that doesn't exist in Australia, and actually securing the appropriate sites for the nuclear. We're also going to need plans for waste management, disaster insurance and some kind of idea on who is going to run these reactors and how.\n\nIt's going to require a lot of the \"hope\" Littleproud says they are going to restore. And a lot of billions.\n\nEven the most conservative costings suggest a massive financial blowout in a plan that will not only put our emissions reduction efforts off for another generation but will also significantly cost Australian taxpayers.\n\nThe CSIRO says it would cost at least $8.5 billion to build a large-scale nuclear power plant in Australia, and estimates nuclear power is at least 50 per cent more expensive than wind and solar power backed by batteries. The CSIRO also says that nuclear power could not be an option for Australia if we hope to meet deadlines on ending coal-fired power.\n\n\"We'll deal with the cost in the next stage of our policy

to reveal the location of up to three sites for nuclear energy plants should the coalition win the next federal election, according to media reports.\n\nMr Dutton is set to hold a press conference on Wednesday alongside Nationals leader David Littleproud and deputy Liberal leader Sussan Ley.\n\nHis party's MPs are expected to be briefed on the plans that morning.\n\nMr Dutton has said he will oppose Australia's legally binding 2030 climate target, a 43 per cent emissions reduction on 2005 levels, if he is elected.\n\nThe coalition remains committed to reaching net-zero emissions by 2050, senior party members have said.\n\nA report by the CSIRO found nuclear power plants wouldn't be built at the earliest until 2040.\n\nThe latest report on the technology's feasibility has found nuclear power is a \"dangerous distraction\" to Australia's renewable energy transition because it would take too long and cost too much to build.\n\nEven if nuclear restrictions were lifted tomorrow, it would still be at least 20 years before a reactor could be operational, the paper released by the Australian Conservation Foundation says.\n\nBy that time, all or nearly all Australia's remaining coal-fired power plants will be closed, meaning carbon emissions-intensive fossil fuels will likely have to be prolonged.\n\nEven ignoring the lead time required to establish a nuclear industry, it would be unable to compete financially with renewables and require taxpayer subsidies worth tens or hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\nAnother hurdle is convincing Australians nuclear poses no safety risk.\n\nMajor insurers, including AAMI, Allianz and NRMA, specifically exclude coverage to homes, cars or possessions from nuclear accidents.\n\n\"Proposals to introduce nuclear power to Australia make no sense,\" concludes the report, which was led by anti-nuclear campaigner Jim Green and released on Wednesday.\n\nThe paper was written in response to a federal coalition plan to replace coal-fired power stations with nuclear, rather than relying on increased investment in renewable energy and storage to reach net zero.\n\nMr Dutton argues baseload nuclear is necessary to achieve the energy transition without sacrificing affordability or reliability.\n\n\"I want to make sure that we've got renewables in the system,\" he told reporters on Tuesday.\n\n\"I'm happy for batteries, but we can't pretend that batteries can provide the storage.\n\n\"We need to make sure that as we decarbonise and as the economy transitions, that we do it in a sensible way.\"\n\nThe latest edition of

They have the technical attributes needed for a nuclear plant, including transmission infrastructure, cooling water capacity and a skilled workforce, the opposition policy says.\n\nThe program would consist of two phases, starting with two establishment projects in the mid-2030s followed by a build of others through to 2050.\n\nMost sites would have larger reactors, with two - in South Australia and Western Australia - having small modular reactors. All mainland states would eventually have reactors.\n\nDutton said the generators would be owned by the Commonwealth government.\n\nThe first could begin operating in 2035 if small modular reactors are used, or 2037 \"if modern larger plants are found to be the best option\", the opposition says.\n\nThis is much earlier than the CSIRO has estimated that an initial plant could begin.\n\nThe CSIRO said in its May assessment of generation technology costs for Australia, that \"due to the current state of the development pipeline in Australia, that the earliest deployment would be from 2040\".\n\nDutton said he would be \"very happy for the election to be a referendum on energy, on nuclear, on power prices, on lights going out, on who has a sustainable pathway for our country going forward\".\n\n\"We are going to the next election seeking a mandate from the Australian people, a very clear mandate that we want support to modernise our energy system ... which is about economic growth and jobs for decades and generations to come,\" Dutton said. said.\n\nThis is the concept design of a zero emissions small modular reactor.\n\nNuclear energy has proven to get electricity prices and emissions down all over the world.\n\nOut of the world's 20 largest economies, Australia is the only one not using nuclear energy or moving towards it.... pic.twitter.com/BN00QxQMmd -- Peter Dutton (@PeterDutton_MP)\n\nJune 19, 2024\n\nThe opposition says the timeline for nuclear energy including building two establishment projects is ten to 12 years, \"from the government making a decision until zero-emissions nuclear electricity first enters the grid\".\n\nThe Coalition policy says a key advantage of the nuclear energy plants was they could be plugged into existing grids. \"This means they can effectively replace retired or retiring coal plants and avoid much of the new spending needed for Labor's 'renewables-only' system, including new transmission poles and wires.\"\n\nThe government would partner with nuclear companies from aboard on development and operation.\n\nEach community around a site would receive a benefits package enshrined in legislation.\n\nIt would include:\n\nEstablishing a civil nuclear programme would require an expanded Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency to license and regulate the power stations, a Nuclear Energy Coordinating Authority, and a government business enterprise to be called Affordable Energy Australia.\n\nDutton could not give a cost for the nuclear plan, saying only it would be \"a fraction\" of the government's energy transition plan costing $1.2 trillion to $1.5 trillion. He said the opposition would have more to say on cost \"in due course\".\n\nThe opposition leader announced his plan at a news conference in Sydney, after a pre-budget announcement had been deferred.

Still visible today, it was the foundation for what would have been Australia's first nuclear power plant. The project had just been cancelled by then-prime minister Billy McMahon who had recently replaced John Gorton. A Treasury analysis showed coal-fired power was much cheaper.\n\nThat long-ago episode is still relevant to Australia's policy choices. Today, Opposition leader Peter Dutton revealed seven sites across Australia where the Coalition, if elected, would build nuclear power stations. Unsurprisingly, the plan has already run into opposition from state politicians, both Labor and the LNP.\n\nThe announcement answers a few basic questions about the Coalition's nuclear plans. For example, Dutton said the plants would be Commonwealth-owned, and built at the site of decommissioned coal plants. But central issues remain unaddressed. Exactly what kind of reactors will be built? Who will build them? And how much they will cost?\n\nAs the Jervis Bay experience shows, nuclear energy can be a hard sell in Australia. Times have obviously changed since the 1970s, but significant political and economic barriers remain - and the problem of cost is still unsolved.\n\nThe seven sites for nuclear power plants mooted by the Coalition are:\n\nAt a press conference in Sydney, Dutton said:\n\nWe know the government has [a] renewables only policy which is not fit for purpose. No other country in the world can keep the lights on 24/7 with the renewables only policy.\n\nWe want to utilise existing assets that we have got [...] new poles and wires that are used at the moment on the coal-fired power station sites can be utilised to distribute the energy generated from the latest generation nuclear reactors.\n\nUnder the Coalition plan, the federal government would own and pay for the plants. In this respect, Dutton is following the precedent set by the Snowy Scheme - and more recently, by the National Broadband Network.\n\nThis is a welcome acknowledgement of the reality that, whatever technology we adopt, private investment is likely insufficient to manage the transition away from coal and gas in the electricity sector - let alone the massive electrification in other sectors needed to meet Australia's 2050 emissions targets.\n\nDutton says he remains committed to the 2050 target for now, despite flagging the Coalition will abandon Australia's 2030 emissions goal.\n\nThe Coalition says it will develop two \"establishment projects\" using either small modular reactors or larger plants. It claims the small reactors will start producing electricity by 2035, and the larger plants by 2037.\n\nThese timeframes are at odds with analysis by the CSIRO, which recently found reactors could not be operational in Australia until 2040 at the earliest.\n\nThe same report found construction of a large-scale nuclear power facility would cost at least A$8.6 billion, and possibly up to $17 billion. It said the electricity produced would be about 50% more costly than renewable energy.\n\nOn Wednesday, Dutton refused to provide a price tag for the Coalition policy. But he claimed it would be a \"fraction\" of Labor's renewable energy policy.\n\nDutton this week ruled out Jervis Bay as a nuclear reactor location, should the Coalition win the next federal election. But the 1970s experience still holds valuable lessons.\n\nThe Jervis Bay territory was ruled directly by the federal government - circumventing any potential state opposition. The Coalition faces a different battle with regards to its proposed sites.\n\nQueensland LNP Leader David Crisafulli on Wednesday said he did not support Dutton's plan for a nuclear power station in Central Queensland, and has previously ruled out lifting a state ban on nuclear power if elected in October.\n\nNSW Labor Premier Chris Minns says building a nuclear reactor in the Hunter Valley is impossible under existing laws, and would disrupt the renewable energy transition.\n\nDutton pledged to work with state premiers to resolve such issues, and suggested financial incentives would be offered.\n\nIt's unclear whether existing coal plant owners, including state-owned generators, will be willing to sell the sites to the federal government. However, Dutton said on Wednesday that, according to legal advice, the government could compulsorily acquire the sites if needed.\n\nWhen Jervis Bay was on the table as a nuclear site, there was no question the federal government would build, own and operate it. The idea that something as crucial as a nuclear power plant might be entrusted to a state government, let alone a foreign corporation, was never entertained.\n\nThe national government was at the postwar height of its power and confidence. It employed the best and brightest, and was expanding the scope and scale of its activity. The Snowy Mountains Scheme, a massive engineering endeavour built under the Commonwealth's defence power, was nearing completion.\n\nDutton says the government will own the proposed nuclear plants, but form partnerships with nuclear companies to build and operate them. But which companies?\n\nInternationally, about 60 nuclear plants are under construction, mostly in Asia. The vast majority are Chinese and Russian designs, built by Chinese and Russian firms. Presumably, for national security reasons, that is not an option for Australia.\n\nThe only real contenders for large modern projects in Australia are South Korea's KEPCO, and Electricity de France (EDF).\n\nKEPCO built four plants at Barakah, in the United Arab Emirates, between 2009 and 2024. But no new orders for KEPCO plants outside South Korea have been announced since 2009.\n\nEDF is building a reactor at Flamanville in France and two at Hinkley Point in the United Kingdom. The projects have suffered massive delays and cost overruns. The UK government is also struggling to organise finance for an additional EDF reactor proposed at the existing Sizewell plant.\n\nAnd what about the so-called small modular reactors suggested by Dutton? This term is applied to two types of technology.\n\nFirst, there are reactors of less than 100 megawatt capacity, which would be built in a factory and shipped to the required site where they would be installed as individual modules.\n\nThe most promising contender was the NuScale Voygr design, however its pilot project has been abandoned. Similarly, Rolls Royce has spiked its plans for a factory in Wales that would have progressed technology used in small modular reactors.\n\nThe term is also applied to cut-down versions of existing large-scale designs: reactors of 300 to 500 megawatt capacity compared to the traditional 1,000 to 1,500 megawatts. These are \"modular\" only in the sense that most parts are built in factories and assembled onsite.\n\nThe government of Ontario in Canada has announced plans for four such reactors to be built by GE-Hitachi, but no final commitment has been made.\n\nAs the next federal election rolls closer, Dutton will come under pressure to reveal crucial details underpinning the Coalition's nuclear plan - most importantly, how much it will cost.\n\nNothing announced by Dutton today changes the fact that nuclear energy is, according to reams of expert analysis, economically unfeasible in Australia. This is as true today as it was in the 1970s.\n\nMeanwhile, the climate crisis continues to worsen. Solar panels, wind turbines and energy storage must be rolled out as rapidly as possible - and we must not allow Dutton's policy detour to distract from the task.\n\nJohn Quiggin is a former Member of

Mr Dutton proposes one site in South Australia in Port Augusta, and another in Collie in WA.\n\nCoalition MPs were briefed on the plan at 8.30am and details started to trickle out immediately afterwards, with hopes to have the first plant up and running by 2035 and the second just two years later.\n\nLabor argues Mr Dutton's plan amounts to a 'stupendous act of economic self-sabotage'.\n\nFollow Daily Mail Australia's live blog as Mr Dutton reveals new details about Australia's nuclear future - if he becomes Prime Minister at the next election.\n\nSee where Dutton intends to open seven nuclear power plants Happening now: Peter Dutton unveils vision for Australia's future if he's elected PM\n\n'We need to ensure hospitals can stay on 24/7, we need to ensure that cold rooms can stay on 24/7, we need to make sure that our economy could function 24/7 and we can only do that with a strong baseload power.\n\n'I want to make sure that the Australian public understand today that we have a vision for our country to deliver cleaner electricity, cheaper electricity and consistent electricity.\n\n'This is a plan for our country which will underpin a century of economic growth and jobs for these communities.\n\n'There is no sense of pretending that our economy can operate without the stable energy system and our plan today which will include these seven sites is integral to the energy roadmap for our country into the future.\n\n'The assets will be owned by the Commonwealth, very important point, and work with experts to deliver these programs.'\n\nMr Dutton took a swipe at the Premiers who have already announced they won't support nuclear.\n\n'We'll work with the state premiers, some debate about that I see, as you know, somebody famously said I would not stand between the Premier and a bucket of money.\n\n'We've seen the premiers in different debates before where they've been able to negotiate with the Commonwealth and will be able to address those issues.'\n\nAussie towns which could go nuclear: New details of proposal begin to trickle out\n\nIn spite of Mr Dutton's best efforts, reported details of his nuclear proposal are starting to trickle out.\n\nNSW, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia are all earmarked for nuclear reactor sites if the Coalition wins the next election.\n\nLithgow and the Hunter Valley are the proposed NSW sites, Mount Murchison and Tarong in Queensland and Traralgon in Victoria.\n\nMr Dutton proposes one site in South Australia in Port Augusta, and another in Collie in WA.\n\nHe hopes to have at least two up and running by 2037, with the first set to be established in 2035 - 11 years away.\n\nAll of the sites which have been identified are within Coalition-held seats.\n\nClimate groups slam Dutton's proposal\n\nClimate Council CEO Amanda McKenzie described the proposal as a 'smokescreen for its commitment to climate pollution' and a 'clear case of radioactive greenwashing'.\n\n'The winners from this scheme are the multinational coal and gas corporations who will keep polluting until well past mid-century. On the other hand, as a result of this scheme, Australians will suffer from worsening unnatural disasters due to climate pollution.\n\n'Communities are being pummelled by heatwaves and dangerous bushfires one week, and extreme rainfall and flooding the next.\n\n'Dutton's scheme is: let the climate burn, let the mega fires burn, let the sea levels rise, let the heat become unbearable.'\n\nAnd Solutions for Climate Australia director Dr Barry Traill said 'nuclear reactors are not a plan for climate, they're a fantasy that serves to delay and distract from getting on with climate action.\n\n'This shows a huge failure of leadership by Mr Dutton to come up with a plan to keep Australians safe.'\n\nDutton draws clear battle lines: Coalition vs Labor and 'green millionaires'\n\nThroughout the hour-long press conference, Mr Dutton made several references to 'Labor and those green millionaires' who stand opposed to nuclear energy.\n\nBy doing so, he drew a clear line in the sand and offered an insight into how he plans to win this battle.\n\n'There are so many people conflicted in this space because they're investors in clean energy or a particular technology. I'm agnostic to all that,' he said.\n\n'I want to deliver a system which will bring prices down and help pensioners keep their heating on. I want to keep small business alive.\n\n'I can't stand the thought that in a country with an abundance of national resource we're paying the highest electricity prices in the world.'\n\nBut Mr Dutton accused the Labor party and Greens of having ulterior motives to rejecting his proposal.\n\nHe said: 'Of course, the Labor Party and those green millionaires we were talking about before, who have made their money off the backs of electricity prices going up and people paying more - they'll come out with a scare campaign.\n\n'I want a mature conversation in our country.'\n\nAustralia is behind the rest of the world's 20 largest economies on nuclear, Dutton says\n\nMr Dutton argued that out of the world's 20 largest economies, Australia 'is the only one not using nuclear energy or moving towards it'.\n\nThe Coalition cited nuclear energy policies which are either in place or committed to in the United States, France, Canada, China, Brazil, Russia, Switzerland, Mexico, Japan, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom.\n\nPictured: An infographic from the Coalition's new website providing information on nuclear\n\nLittleproud reassures Teal MPs and voters 'we're all on the same journey'\n\nNationals leader David Littleproud said despite the differences in opinion about Australia's energy future, the Coalition still remains committed to net zero by 2050.\n\nHe said Australia will still meet its obligations to the Paris Agreement under the Coalition's nuclear proposal, despite failing to acknowledge interim targets.\n\n'I'll just say while the ideology of our Teal members - I don't disagree.\n\n'We're all on the same journey. It's just how we get there.'\n\nDutton says he's 'happy' for next election to be a 'referendum on energy'\n\nOn the back of Labor's loss with the Indigenous Voice referendum, Mr Dutton has invoked the term during his speech.\n\nHe said: 'I'm very happy for the election to be a referendum on energy, on nuclear, on power prices, on lights going out, on who has a sustainable pathway for our country going forward.'\n\nDutton takes swipe at PM Anthony Albanese\n\n'If the Labor Party chooses a leader with back bone, somebody like Bob Hawke, as opposed to their current leader, then we'd have a mature debate about this,' he said.\n\n'But the Prime Minister wants to put out photos of fish and pictures of beaches and pretend in his nirvana that the wind turbines spin around when the wind is not blowing. And he pretends that the solar panels can work of a night time.\n\n'We need a Prime Minister who can stand up for our country. And this Prime Minister can't do that.'\n\nDutton lashes 'green millionaires'\n\n'I'm not interested in lining the pockets of rich green millionaires, I want to bring down the price of electricity for average mums and dads.\n\n'If we look at the international experience, let me answer that question because if international experience as we know, electricity is cheaper where there is a presence of nuclear energy.\n\n'That is the fact. So we can rely on the international experience.'\n\n'We are going to the next election seeking a mandate from the Australian people, a very clear mandate that we want support to modernise our energy system.\n\n'That's the mandate that we seek and that's the mandate that I believe that we will act on the Parliament and we will work with the premiers in a constructive way.'\n\nDutton grilled about cost of his plan\n\nDutton has refused to go into detail today about the cost of his proposal, arguing that today is simply about revealing the proposed locations.\n\n'As we know the government's transition [will cost] about $1.2 - $1.5 trillion and that will be passed to consumers.\n\n'Our proposal will cost a fraction of that, we will have more to say in relation to the cost in due course and as you know we've done this in a step-by-step process.\n\n'The focus today is on the sites.'\n\nBut Mr Dutton said international experience indicates that nuclear energy will always be cheaper than the alternative.\n\n'It's time for the Coalition to lead our nation away from this madness': Nationals leader David Littleproud celebrates nuclear proposal\n\nDavid Littleproud said today is a 'proud day for the Nationals', who have long championed the benefits of nuclear energy.\n\nHe said a nuclear approach moving forward is a 'win for the regions' and will be the legacy of the Coalition if they win the next election.\n\n'It's time for strength and leadership, time for the Coalition to take over to lead our nation away from this madness of renewables approach.'\n\nState premiers vow not to repeal nuclear bans\n\nBoth Chris Minns in NSW and Jacinta Allan in Victoria have this morning doubled down on their states' nuclear bans, in spite of Peter Dutton's impending announcement.\n\n'Our ban stays in place, we're not repealing it. I'd be surprised if the NSW Liberal and National party want to repeal it as well,' Mr Minns said.\n\nAnd Ms Allan was adamant there would be no nuclear sites in Victoria while she remained premier.\n\n'They want to bring more expensive, more risky, more toxic energy solutions to the people of this country. We won't stand for that. We absolutely will not stand for that,' she said.\n\n'What works is exactly what we're doing now. investing in renewable energy, solar in wind and battery storage.'\n\n'Trainwreck': Sussan Ley slams Labor's energy policy and notes 'we are paying the highest electricity prices in the world'\n\nSussan Ley appeared on Sky on Wednesday morning where she promoted the impending nuclear energy announcement.\n\n'Let's face it, policy in this country around energy under this government is an absolute trainwreck.\n\n'We are paying the highest electricity prices in the world. You've just noted on your program, that today is the coldest day so far this year.\n\n'There will be Australians who are choosing between heating and eating.'\n\nClimate warrior businessman\n\nSimon Holmes \u00e0 Court's blunt questions he says Dutton must answer about nuclear\n\nClimate warrior Simon Holmes \u00e0 Court has issued a series of 18 questions he says Mr Dutton must answer if he wants the Australian public to support nuclear energy.\n\nMr Holmes \u00e0 Court has a \u00adClimate 200 fund which backed the 'Teal' independents in the last election - many of whom snatched previously safe Liberal seats in affluent parts of Sydney.\n\n- Where nuclear reactors will be located\n\n- How the Coalition intends to remove state bans given nuclear is currently banned in Victoria, NSW and Queensland\n\n- What will happen if locals object\n\n- When will the reactors begin generating power\n\n- How much will they cost\n\n- How will the waste be managed\n\n- Who will provide disaster insurance\n\n- What will be the emissions impact\n\nHe said: 'Without good answers to the questions above, the Coalition cannot be taken seriously.\n\n'Any plan that has us paying more and blowing our carbon budget is a toxic joke.'\n\nAnnouncement to be made at 10am\n\nPeter Dutton will hold a joint press conference at 10am to make his pitch to the Australian public.\n\nIt is understood he'll be joined by Nationals leader David Littleproud, and Liberal deputy leader Sussan Ley.\n\nLabor comes out swinging against nuclear\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers on Wednesday trashed Mr Dutton's nuclear ambitions, describing it as 'economic insanity, pure and simple'.\n\nDr Chalmers told ABC Radio: 'Nuclear takes longer, it costs more, and it will squander Australia's unique combination of advantages. It is the worst combination of economic and ideological stupidity.'\n\nKey Updates Dutton draws clear battle lines: Coalition vs Labor and 'green millionaires'\n\nView post\n\nAustralia is behind the

This means they can effectively replace retired or retiring coal plants and avoid much of the new spending needed for Labor's 'renewables-only' system, including new transmission poles and wires,\" Dutton said in his statement.\n\nAccording to the plan, if elected, the Coalition government would initially develop two establishment projects using either small modular reactors or modern larger plants such as the AP1000 or APR1400. \"They will start producing electricity by 2035 (with small modular reactors) or 2037 (if modern larger plants are found to be the best option),\" Dutton said.\n\nDutton said he is expecting scare campaigns opposing nuclear, but \"we believe Australians are up for this discussion and are open-minded about including zero-emissions nuclear technology as part of a balanced energy mix\".\n\nThe GenCost economic report released by CSIRO in May included nuclear costs for the first time. While the report found no technical barriers to large-scale nuclear power generation in Australia's electricity system, it determined that nuclear power was more expensive than renewables and would take at least 15 years to develop, including construction.\n\nSo what do mining, climate and engineering academia representatives think of the Coalition's nuclear plan?\n\nThe Mining and Energy Union said the proposed plan would be no help for coal power workers and it was \"disappointed the Coalition has announced this policy with no consultation with these coal power regions about whether they want a nuclear future\".\n\n\"Power stations in the proposed sites for nuclear would be long closed before the plants would become operational, and if no support is provided, those workers and communities will have already packed up their lives and moved on,\" the union said.\n\nSolutions for Climate Australia Director Dr Barry Traill views this announcement as a dangerous distraction from the urgent need to take action to reduce climate pollution this decade.\n\n\"Nuclear reactors are the most expensive energy source for Australia, produce toxic waste and would take literally decades to build, during which coal and gas giants would continue to produce billions of tonnes of additional climate emissions,\" Traill said.\n\n\"Our recent report showed that conservatively at least 2.3 billion tonnes of additional climate pollution would be released if this nuclear reactor fantasy was pursued.\"\n\nDr Asma Aziz, senior lecturer in power engineering from the School of Engineering at Edith Cowan University, said Australia needs diverse generation and storage but also requires proper assessments before making any decisions.\n\n\"Nuclear energy's carbon footprint is comparable to wind and less than solar, but it faces high capital costs, long build times, substantial operating expenses and integration difficulties, making it impractical for addressing the climate crisis,\" Aziz said. \"Integrating nuclear power plants (NPPs) into the grid involves complex regulatory and engineering challenges due to their constant 'baseload' supply, which requires other plants to be load following'.\n\n\"Other major drawbacks include safety concerns, high costs and long-term radioactive waste storage. Japan, Germany, Belgium, Spain and Switzerland are phasing out nuclear power due to these issues. In the USA, aging reactors are being retired early due to high costs. France's reactor in Flamanville is significantly delayed and over budget. Small modular reactors (SMRs) are not yet viable, with recent cost estimates at $20,100 per kW compared to $700-$1700 for solar and wind.\"", "source": {"uri": "sustainabilitymatters.net.au",

They're not fit to cover the local flower show, let alone federal politics.\n\nDutton's press conference yesterday purported to announce \"details\" of his \"plan\" to build seven nuclear power plants across Australia. It provided none of these things. He named seven supposed sites and said that the Australian government would own the theoretical nuclear power plants.\n\nTwo of them would be built by 2035, apparently, although the AFR's Phil Coorey promptly reported this on X as \"Seven nuclear plants operating from 2035\". Simon Benson at The Australian was immediately proclaiming Dutton had \"reshaped the election and the path to net zero\" with his bold plan, with News Corp colleagues already touting \"growing optimism in the Coalition ranks\" due to the opposition leader's \"nuclear-framed energy and climate policy\". The ABC news homepage reported that \"Nuclear power plants would be built at seven locations in five states under the opposition's nuclear policy, opposition leader Peter Dutton has confirmed.\" Will they really? Has he really?\n\nDutton's press conference was farcical. He provided no costings, no plan for the nuclear waste involved, no detail on what specific type of nuclear reactors would be built, nor how much power they would generate, nor how they will be budgeted or financed. His team hasn't done any community consultations in the areas named, and would need to change a raft of laws and regulations to begin planning these mythical reactors. Environmental approvals? What are they? Dutton acknowledged that the states' cooperation would be required, yet leaders in key states including Victoria, New South Wales, Western Australia and Queensland immediately came out against his plan.\n\nDutton proposes \"small modular reactors\" for Australia. Fun fact: no small modular reactors currently operate commercially anywhere in the world. Only two currently exist -- in China and Russia. The latter took two decades to construct, and neither are prototypes for more models because there is no current market for such things. They're even more expensive than conventional nuclear reactors. Is Dutton planning to source nuclear tech from China or Russia?\n\nEven conventional nuclear power, on best current estimates, costs between four and six times solar and wind power. Have these journalists had some kind of collective seizure that makes them suddenly believe in expensive energy, in \"picking winners\", in giant, open-ended public spending on unproven technology, on unlegislated white-rabbit schemes requiring (but not having) broad public and political support? Or is now not a good time to mention these objections?\n\nThe sites Dutton named would need to be acquired, in some cases from private companies, and in others from planned or existing ventures. The man who isn't even in government is going to oversee the introduction of an entirely new industry in Australia, create the (as yet non-existent) local professional expertise, then contract secure and competent construction companies, consult with the community and other stakeholders, finance, legislate, build and operate new plants within 10 and a half years. (For what it's worth, the CSIRO estimates that nuclear couldn't be deployed before 2040.)\n\nIn its recent nine years of government, the Coalition couldn't even build the carparks it promised, let alone complex projects like fast rail or Snowy 2.0. If News Corp journalists in particular were honest, they'd hound Dutton more than they ever hounded Kevin Rudd over the NBN, which was the picture of fiscal rectitude in comparison. They won't, of course.\n\nHere are some questions that Dutton must be asked, and must answer, if he's to be taken seriously: How would his government overcome the state bans on nuclear power? How would he get Senate support for legislative change, given it's been almost two decades since the Coalition had Senate control, and the Greens, Labor and most independents don't support nuclear? What does the staged timeline look like? What will the reactors cost? Were will the money come from? Who would buy more expensive power anyway? Who will insure such a venture? How can a decades-long project be responsibly mounted without bipartisan support -- or does he expect the Coalition to be in power from next year until beyond 2040? How can he seriously argue that it's irresponsible to have even short-term climate targets, and then go all-in on an uncosted nuclear fantasy?\n\nApart from anything else, why would a government \"cap\" investment in renewables (as the Coalition promised this week) while spending vastly more on something unproven, unsafe, uninsurable and toxic? Why would a nation already blessed with cheap, sustainable renewable energy sources embark on something so ludicrous?\n\nWe won't, of course, and that's the nub of the issue.\n\nThese nuclear plants will never be built, and everyone knows it. The point of the exercise is for Dutton to present himself as a man with a \"strong plan\", a \"visionary policy\" to talk about so he can avoid the fact that he has no climate policy -- and in fact not many policies at all. (The other tragic aspect of this game is that Labor will see a policy platform even worse than its own pro-gas vandalism, and present itself as the responsible option by comparison. Thankfully the public has better climate choices.)\n\nThere is no nuclear plan, and journalists reporting the announcement seriously are participants in the charade. They're misleading the public.\n\nHow can journalists do a better job covering Peter Dutton's nuclear plan? Let us know your thoughts by writing to letters@crikey.com.au.

But he can't say how he'll build them, or how much it will cost.\n\nDespite Peter Dutton this morning unveiling \"details\" of his plan to build a fleet of nuclear power plants across the country by 2040, we're still no closer to understanding exactly how the Liberal leader will achieve such an improbable feat.\n\nDutton has committed the Coalition to building seven reactors on the sites of coal-fired power stations: two in Queensland, at Tarong and Callide, two in NSW, at Liddell and Lithgow, one at Port Augusta in SA, one at the current Loy Yang A site in the Latrobe Valley in Victoria, and one at Muja in south-western WA.\n\nThere is a little detail in the timing. The glossy brochure handed out by the Coalition claims \"the timeline for establishing a civil nuclear program in Australia including building two establishment projects is 10 to 12 years from the government making a decision until zero emissions nuclear electricity first enters the grid.\"\n\nSeparately, it also states \"a federal Coalition government will initially develop two establishment projects using either small modular reactors or modern larger plants such as the AP1000 or APR1400. They will start producing electricity by 2035 (with small modular reactors) or 2037 (if modern larger plants are found to be the best option).\"\n\nThat timeline is at odds with the CSIRO's estimate that nuclear could not be deployed until 2040 at the earliest. There are no small modular reactors currently in operation in any developed country, and the US project touted by the Coalition, NuScale in Idaho, was shut down in November due to soaring costs.\n\nAccording to the CSIRO's costings, seven reactors at $8.6 billion each for a 1000MW reactor, would cost $60.2 billion, however the first build would suffer a first of a kind premium of up to 100% in addition to that. That does not include a cost blow-out of 20-30% of a kind that has characterised nearly all major infrastructure projects in Australia over the past two decades.\n\nAccording to the CSIRO, small modular reactors will cost two to three-and-a-half times more than large-scale nuclear plants per unit of output.\n\nDutton has also confirmed what Crikey has long pointed out -- the reactors will have to be publicly owned, meaning taxpayers will fund the $60-90 billion cost.\n\n\"The Australian government will own these assets, but form partnerships with experienced nuclear companies to build and operate them,\" Dutton said this morning.\n\nThis reduces, but does not remove, one of the key impediments to any nuclear build -- that companies will refuse to invest in their construction because of a potential change in government, with a new government restoring a nuclear ban. The Coalition would likely offer onerous break fees as part of any deal with companies interested in building reactors, in order to deter future governments from halting construction.\n\nIt will also mean the Commonwealth will enter the power generation industry at a truly colossal scale, far beyond what any state government has ever managed. Dutton has made a commitment to a radical expansion in the size and role of the federal government.\n\nHowever, there remains the biggest hurdle of all: state governments. The Coalition might be able to purchase existing sites from private companies to build the reactors -- though not in Queensland, where Callide and Tarong are government-owned. But it will not be able to build reactors without state cooperation, including the repeal of state prohibitions on nuclear power. Dutton joked this morning about premiers and buckets of money, but his chances of convincing Labor governments in NSW, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia to allow nuclear power plants appear slim.\n\nDutton may have more luck in Queensland, with his own party, the Liberal Nationals, set to take power in October. However, state LNP leader David Crisafulli appeared to kill that off this week, saying when asked about repealing Queensland's ban on nuclear power \"the answer is no, and I've made my view very clear on that.\"\n\nCrisafulli is likely to come under more pressure between now and the state election to categorically rule out cooperating with Dutton.\n\nDutton has refused to offer any costing of his plan, but Crikey's CSIRO-based costing this week -- just over $70 billion for six (not seven) large-scale nuclear power plants by 2040 -- now looks too modest: the addition of small modular reactors will increase the cost, and the extremely rapid timeframe for deployment will likely require greater expenditure.\n\nAnd if Dutton really thinks he can bribe Labor premiers to open themselves up to a world of political hurt by agreeing to nuclear power plants, he will need a very large bucket of money indeed. That doesn't feature in the costings -- and will likely be in the billions as well.\n\nMore realistically, it's all intended as a distraction from abandoning climate action and maintaining fossil fuel-based power. Dutton and his colleagues were in power for nine years and never expressed the slightest interest in pursuing nuclear power -- or even removing the Howard government's ban on it. There's a reason for that -- in Australia, it's a ludicrously expensive fantasy.\n\nDo you back Dutton's nuclear plan? How would you feel about a nuclear power plant near your home?

Still visible today, it was the foundation for what would have been Australia's first nuclear power plant. The project had just been cancelled by then-prime minister Billy McMahon who had recently replaced John Gorton. A Treasury analysis showed coal-fired power was much cheaper.\n\nThat long-ago episode is still relevant to Australia's policy choices. Today, Opposition leader Peter Dutton revealed seven sites across Australia where the Coalition, if elected, would build nuclear power stations. Unsurprisingly, the plan has already run into opposition from state politicians, both Labor and the LNP.\n\nThe announcement answers a few basic questions about the Coalition's nuclear plans. For example, Dutton said the plants would be Commonwealth-owned, and built at the site of decommissioned coal plants. But central issues remain unaddressed. Exactly what kind of reactors will be built? Who will build them? And how much they will cost?\n\nAs the Jervis Bay experience shows, nuclear energy can be a hard sell in Australia. Times have obviously changed since the 1970s, but significant political and economic barriers remain - and the problem of cost is still unsolved.\n\nWhat the Coalition has revealed\n\nThe seven sites for nuclear power plants mooted by the Coalition are:\n\nTarong and Callide in Queensland Liddell and Mount Piper in NSW Port Augusta in South Australia Loy Yang in Victoria Muja in Western Australia.\n\nAt a press conference in Sydney, Dutton said:\n\nWe know the government has [a] renewables only policy which is not fit for purpose. No other country in the world can keep the lights on 24/7 with the renewables only policy.\n\nWe want to utilise existing assets that we have got [...] new poles and wires that are used at the moment on the coal-fired power station sites can be utilised to distribute the energy generated from the latest generation nuclear reactors.\n\nUnder the Coalition plan, the federal government would own and pay for the plants. In this respect, Dutton is following the precedent set by the Snowy Scheme - and more recently, by the National Broadband Network.\n\nThis is a welcome acknowledgement of the reality that, whatever technology we adopt, private investment is likely insufficient to manage the transition away from coal and gas in the electricity sector - let alone the massive electrification in other sectors needed to meet Australia's 2050 targets.\n\nDutton says he remains committed to the 2050 target for now, despite flagging the Coalition will abandon Australia's 2030 emissions goal.\n\nThe Coalition says it will develop two \"establishment projects\" using either small modular reactors or larger plants. It claims the small reactors will start producing electricity by 2035, and the larger plants by 2037.\n\nThese timeframes are at odds with analysis by the CSIRO, which recently found reactors could not be operational in Australia until the 2040 at the earliest.\n\nThe same report found construction of a large-scale nuclear power facility would cost at least A$8.6 billion, and possibly up to $17 billion. It said the electricity produced would be about 50% more costly than renewable energy.\n\nOn Wednesday, Dutton refused to provide a price tag for the Coalition policy. But he claimed it would be a \"fraction\" of Labor's renewable energy policy.\n\nLessons from Jervis Bay\n\nDutton this week ruled out Jervis Bay as a nuclear reactor location, should the Coalition win the next federal election. But the 1970s experience still holds valuable lessons.\n\nThe Jervis Bay territory was ruled directly by the federal government - circumventing any potential state opposition. The Coalition faces a different battle with regards to its proposed sites.\n\nQueensland LNP Leader David Crisafulli on Wednesday said he did not support Dutton's plan for a nuclear power station in Central Queensland, and has previously ruled out lifting a state ban on nuclear power if elected in October.\n\nNSW Labor Premier Chris Minns says building a nuclear reactor in the Hunter Valley is impossible under existing laws, and would disrupt the renewable energy transition.\n\nDutton pledged to work with state premiers to resolve such issues, and suggested financial incentives would be offered.\n\nIt's unclear whether existing coal plant owners, including state-owned generators, will be willing to sell the sites to the federal government. However, Dutton said on Wednesday that, according to legal advice, the government could compulsorily acquire the sites if needed.\n\nWhen Jervis Bay was on the table as a nuclear site, there was no question the federal government would build, own and operate it. The idea that something as crucial as a nuclear power plant might be entrusted to a state government, let alone a foreign corporation, was never entertained.\n\nThe national government was at the postwar height of its power and confidence. It employed the best and brightest, and was expanding the scope and scale of its activity. The Snowy Mountains Scheme, a massive engineering endeavour built under the Commonwealth's defence power, was nearing completion.\n\nDutton says the government will own the proposed nuclear plants, but form partnerships with nuclear companies to build and operate them. But which companies?\n\nInternationally, about 60 nuclear plants are under construction, mostly in Asia. The vast majority are Chinese and Russian designs, built by Chinese and Russian firms. Presumably, for national security reasons, that is not an option for Australia.\n\nThe only real contenders for large modern projects in Australia are South Korea's KEPCO, and Electricity de France (EDF).\n\nKEPCO built four plants at Barakah, in the United Arab Emirates, between 2009 and 2024. But no new orders for KEPCO plants outside South Korea have been announced since 2009.\n\nEDF is building a reactor at Flamanville in France and two at Hinkley Point in the United Kingdom. The projects have suffered massive delays and cost overruns. The UK government is also struggling to organise finance for an additional EDF reactor proposed at the existing Sizewell plant.\n\nAnd what about the so-called small modular reactors suggested by Dutton? This term is applied to two types of technology.\n\nFirst, there are reactors of less than 100 megawatt capacity, which would be built in a factory and shipped to the required site where they would be installed as individual modules.\n\nThe most promising contender was the NuScale Voygr design, however its pilot project has been abandoned. Similarly, Rolls Royce has spiked its plans for a factory in Wales that would have progressed technology used in small modular reactors.\n\nThe term is also applied to cut-down versions of existing large-scale designs: reactors of 300 to 500 megawatt capacity compared to the traditional 1,000 to 1,500 megawatts. These are \"modular\" only in the sense that most parts are built in factories and assembled onsite.\n\nThe government of Ontario in Canada has announced plans for four such reactors to be built by GE-Hitachi, but no final commitment has been made.\n\nMeanwhile, the climate crisis continues\n\nAs the next federal election rolls closer, Dutton will come under pressure to reveal crucial details underpinning the Coalition's nuclear plan - most importantly, how much it will cost.\n\nNothing announced by Dutton today changes the fact that nuclear energy is, according to reams of expert analysis, economically unfeasible in Australia. This is as true today as it was in the 1970s.\n\nMeanwhile, the climate crisis continues to worsen. Solar panels, wind turbines and energy storage must be rolled out as rapidly as possible - and we must not allow Dutton's policy detour to distract from the task.", "source": {"uri":

They have the technical attributes needed for a nuclear plant, including transmission infrastructure, cooling water capacity and a skilled workforce, the opposition policy says.\n\nThe program would consist of two phases, starting with two establishment projects in the mid-2030s followed by a build of others through to 2050.\n\nMost sites would have larger reactors, with two - in South Australia and Western Australia - having small modular reactors. All mainland states would eventually have reactors.\n\nThe proposed sites are\n\nLiddell Power Station, New South Wales\n\nMount Piper Power Station, New South Wales\n\nLoy Yang Power Stations, Victoria\n\nTarong Power Station, Queensland\n\nCallide Power Station, Queensland\n\nNorthern Power Station, South Australia (small modular reactor only)\n\nMuja Power Station, Western Australia (small modular reactor only)\n\nDutton said the generators would be owned by the Commonwealth government.\n\nThe first could begin operating in 2035 if small modular reactors are used, or 2037 \"if modern larger plants are found to be the best option\", the opposition says.\n\nThis is much earlier than the CSIRO has estimated that an initial plant could begin.\n\nThe CSIRO said in its May assessment of generation technology costs for Australia, that \"due to the current state of the development pipeline in Australia, that the earliest deployment would be from 2040\".\n\nDutton said he would be \"very happy for the election to be a referendum on energy, on nuclear, on power prices, on lights going out, on who has a sustainable pathway for our country going forward\".\n\n\"We are going to the next election seeking a mandate from the Australian people, a very clear mandate that we want support to modernise our energy system ... which is about economic growth and jobs for decades and generations to come,\" Dutton said. said.\n\nThe opposition says the timeline for nuclear energy including building two establishment projects is ten to 12 years, \"from the government making a decision until zero-emissions nuclear electricity first enters the grid\".\n\nThe Coalition policy says a key advantage of the nuclear energy plants was they could be plugged into existing grids. \"This means they can effectively replace retired or retiring coal plants and avoid much of the new spending needed for Labor's 'renewables-only' system, including new transmission poles and wires.\"\n\nThe government would partner with nuclear companies from aboard on development and operation.\n\nEach community around a site would receive a benefits package enshrined in legislation.\n\nIt would include:\n\nmulti-billion dollar facility guaranteeing high-paying jobs for generations to come\n\nan integrated economic development zone attracting manufacturing, value-add and high-tech industry\n\na regional deal unlocking investment in modern infrastructure, services and community priorities.\n\nEstablishing a civil nuclear programme would require an expanded Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency to license and regulate the power stations, a Nuclear Energy Coordinating Authority, and a government business enterprise to be called Affordable Energy Australia.\n\nDutton could not give a cost for the nuclear plan, saying only it would be \"a fraction\" of the government's energy transition plan costing $1.2 trillion to $1.5 trillion. He said the opposition would have more to say on cost \"in due course\".\n\nThe opposition leader announced his plan at a news conference in Sydney, after a pre-budget announcement had been deferred. He was flanked by a bevy of colleagues including Nationals leader David Littleproud.\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers said in a social media post: \"With Australia's advantages and opportunities, nothing could be more economically irrational or fiscally irresponsible\" than the nuclear policy\".\n\nChalmers told the ABC: \"Peter Dutton's nuclear negativity is economic insanity, pure and simple. Nuclear takes longer, it costs more and it will squander Australia's unique combination of advantages\".\n\nApart from a fierce campaign from federal Labor, Dutton faces attacks from the states.

David Crisafulli, the LNP state leader, said on Tuesday he would not repeal the state's nuclear ban if elected and nuclear was \"not on our plan, not on our agenda\".\n\nOther areas raised as potential sites included Port Augusta in South Australia, Collie, south of Perth, the Hunter Valley and Mt Piper in New South Wales, and the Latrobe Valley in Victoria.\n\nThe Australian newspaper reported the reactors would be Commonwealth owned, in a similar structure to the Snowy Hydro 2.0 scheme.\n\nDutton and the Coalition leadership were hoping to capitalise on strong showings in recent opinion polls, which showed voters viewed nuclear power favourably as part of Australia's energy mix.\n\nDutton had previously said the Coalition would only be looking at sites where there was already an \"end-of-life coal fired power station\".\n\nBut some critics questioned whether \"anyone had looked at a map\" when choosing sites, noting there were different requirements for a coal-fired power station and even a small nuclear plant.\n\n\"I don't know how seriously they will have looked at some of these sites,\" one Coalition MP said, under the condition of anonymity.\n\nWater was one of the key issues, given its use in cooling, meaning any potential plant would be best situated along the coast or near a large body of water. Geographic faultlines were also a consideration - central Queensland, where much of Queensland's existing coal-fired power stations are situated has several faultlines recorded by Geoscience Australia, an issue given the stability needed for a nuclear plant.\n\nThere was also the question of where Australia would store the waste.\n\nDutton has said the Coalition's nuclear plan is required to deal with ageing and retiring coal power plants.\n\nThe Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF), in a Wednesday report assessing the Coalition's plans, found the plan to install nuclear power plants around the country would require billions of dollars in government subsidies.\n\nWhile the cost of other energy technologies had decreased over time, the report found nuclear costs had increased because of safety improvements and persistent flaws in management, design, and supply chains, citing a 2020 MIT study.\n\nThe ACF's report, co-authored by anti-nuclear campaigners Dr Jim Green and Dave Sweeney, also concluded additional taxpayer subsidies would be needed to cover insurance for nuclear accidents or incidents.\n\nSome of Australia's major insurers, such as AAMI, CGU, Allianz, QBE and NRMA, also won't insure homes, cars or possessions against a nuclear accident, the report said.\n\nCost blowouts and multi-year delays experienced by the US, the UK and Europe are also likely to occur in Australia, the report found. A number of projects around the world reached commercial operation about two decades after being announced.\n\nAccording to the report's findings, a nuclear power reactor in Australia could only begin operating in about the mid-2040s, if a federal ban on nuclear power was overturned, and would only begin to contribute to emissions reductions by around 2050.\n\nThe ACF's chief executive, Kelly O'Shanassy, said promoting nuclear was prolonging the use of fossil fuels.\n\n\"Major solar and wind projects can be conceived, constructed and connected much quicker,\" she said.\n\n\"Nuclear is an energy source the market doesn't want. The big electricity utilities are not interested, nor are most private investors, so nuclear would require huge public subsidies.\n\n\"We cannot afford to squander more time in moving our economy away from its reliance on climate-damaging coal and gas. Nuclear is a dangerous distraction to effective climate action.\"\n\nThe Albanese government on Wednesday announced it was investing up to $100m in grant funding to lower deployment and operation costs for Australia's solar industry.\n\nThe \"international challenge\", which is open for eight weeks, will invite innovators, customers, financiers and those in construction, operation or maintenance to pitch ideas aimed at slashing the costs of a solar project installation to 30 cents per watt and to reduce electricity costs to below $20 per megawatt hour by 2030.\n\nThe climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, said the modern solar panel was, in effect, an Australian invention and he wanted to see more breakthroughs locally.\n\n\"The world added 445 gigawatts of solar [power] last year, more than all other power sources combined, because the world is rapidly moving to renewable energy, the cheapest form of energy,\" he said.", "source": {"uri":

Instead, he said it would \"cost a fraction\" of Labor's power plans, adding that the cost would be released \"in due course.\"\n\nBlasting the opposition's \"nuclear fantasy,\" Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said it did not make economic sense as Australia had the best \"renewable energy potential,\" AAP reported.\n\n\"It'll be a taxpayer funded nuclear fantasy,\" Albanese told ABC radio. \"Here in Australia, we have the best solar resources in the world. \"This makes no economic sense, as well as leaving us in a position of energy insecurity because of the time that it will take to roll out a nuclear reactor.\"\n\nThe sites located in Coalition-held electorates have been chosen for water availability, connection to the grid and the closure date of existing coal power plants. As the sites were held by private ownership now, Dutton said they would be acquired by the government for setting up the power plants.\n\nOn the energy sources during the interim period while the construction of nuclear power plants is in progress, Dutton said, \"The seven locations can host new nuclear sites and that'll be part of an energy mix with renewables and significant amounts of gas ... particularly in the interim period. During the construction of nuclear power plants, would utilize the existing distribution networks when coal power plants reach the end of their life.\"\n\nThe Opposition leader said two plants would be completed by 2035-37 and the remaining five would be built in the 2040s were \"achievable\" and a \"sensible rollout.\"\n\nPower stations suggested to be built in Western and South Australia could be \"small modular reactor (SMR) only,\" and they are reportedly not commercially viable.\n\nCSIRO had warned against completing an SMR as quickly as 2038. Though cheaper and quicker to build, no SMR projects have been completed globally yet.\n\nDutton will have to counter a long battle on his plans to go nuclear, as it means lifting current bans on the energy source and confronting the states, because several politicians have refused to permit atomic plants in their jurisdictions.\n\nNSW Premier Chris Minns and leader of the Queensland Liberal National party David Crisafulli stated they would not repeal the nuclear prohibition in their states.\n\n\"If all of a sudden you were to introduce nuclear power, that investment is at real risk,\" Minns told reporters. \"It costs a lot of money and second, it takes a lot of time and we don't have a day to wait.\"\n\nIn May, CSIRO and the Australian Energy Market Operator released the GenCost

election race", "body": "The coalition has lifted the lid on its nuclear plans, presenting a list of potential sites for power stations in a move that could make or break its electoral campaign.\n\nWith tens of thousands of Australians learning they could be living next to a nuclear reactor, a chorus of opposition grew on social media and talkback radio while Labor came out swinging on the \"economic insanity\" of the move.\n\nOpposition Leader Peter Dutton's much-anticipated energy policy will place nuclear power plants in Australia's former fossil-fuel heartlands if the coalition wins the federal election.\n\nHe said a coalition government would build seven plants at existing coal-fired power stations, with the assets to be owned by the Commonwealth.\n\nNo costings were provided for the policy even as Mr Dutton said consumers and business were suffering from high energy costs.\n\nThe sites include Loy Yang Power Station in Victoria's Gippsland area, Callide and Tarong in Queensland, Mount Piper at Lithgow in central west NSW and Liddell in NSW's Hunter region.\n\nThe coalition would also build small modular reactors at Northern Power Station in the South Australian city of Port Augusta and at Muja Power Station, southeast of Perth.\n\n\"We want to utilise the existing assets that we've got, the poles and wires that are used at the moment on the coal-fired power station sites ... to distribute the energy generated from the latest-generation nuclear reactors,\" Mr Dutton told reporters in Sydney on Wednesday.\n\nThe Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said its core policy position was that any energy source should compete in the market while aiming for agreed emissions targets.\n\n\"As we go down the path to net zero it is important that we focus on real-world consequences and keep costs minimised for business and the broader community,\" ACCI chief of policy and advocacy David Alexander said.\n\nThe power plants will form part of an \"energy mix\" that also includes gas and renewables, which the opposition claims will help provide around-the-clock baseload power and drive down prices.\n\nThe first two plants are expected to be completed between 2035 and 2037, as it will take at least a decade from a government decision for nuclear electricity to enter the grid.\n\nThis meant Australia could still reach net-zero emissions by 2050, Mr Dutton said.\n\nBut environmental advocates say the plan will delay an urgently needed shift away from fossil fuels, with Climate Council CEO Amanda McKenzie calling it a commitment to coal and gas.\n\n\"(It's) a clear case of radioactive greenwashing and a scheme for more climate pollution,\" she said.\n\nEven if the small modular reactors end up cheaper and quicker to build than their larger counterparts, no projects have been completed globally and the CSIRO warned it would be \"very unlikely\" one would be up and running as quickly as 2038.\n\nEnergy Minister Chris Bowen decried the proposal as a \"nuclear scam\".\n\n\"It's risky because it undermines investment in renewable energy, it's risky because it means relying on ageing coal-fired power ... which is increasingly unreliable,\" he told reporters.\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese said the plan made \"no economic sense\" and would put Australia in a position of energy insecurity, while Treasurer Jim Chalmers labelled it \"economic insanity\".\n\nA report released by the CSIRO and the Australian Energy Market Operator in May revealed a large-scale nuclear power plant would cost at least $8.5 billion.\n\nMinerals Council executive Tania Constable backed the plan, claiming nuclear power would help decarbonise the economy while maintaining its competitiveness.\n\nTo assuage safety concerns, Mr Dutton said a 470-megawatt reactor would produce waste equivalent to the size of a soda can, which could be stored on site and moved to a permanent home.\n\nEven if the federal election turns in the coalition's favour, the opposition will still have to battle it out against the states.\n\nNSW Premier Chris Minns said he would not lift the nuclear prohibition in NSW, Victoria's government is strongly opposed and Queensland Liberal National leader David Crisafulli - who is tipped win the state's election - has ruled out nuclear energy.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType":

Dutton now refers to Commonwealth ownership and investment in nuclear generation as a \"national asset\".\n\nThe government's relentless attacks on this will all be variations of Treasurer Jim Chalmers' condemnation that the Coalition's \"nuclear road to nowhere ... might be the dumbest policy ever put forward by a major party\".\n\nThis new front in Australia's perpetual energy wars - combined with Dutton's rejection of 2030 emissions targets - will also dismay business leaders yearning for some policy stability and reliable power supply over this decade at least.\n\nLabor, Greens and teals are relishing the prospect of fighting over this territory.\n\nBut while such arguments may be persuasive in teal seats and the inner city, Dutton is targeting struggling households in outer suburbia as well as regional Australian seats where people need skilled jobs to replace those disappearing in coal-fired power.\n\nHe wants to combine this with a younger generation of voters not as spooked by the record of nuclear accidents and more open to the long-term environmental appeal of nuclear's zero-emissions power.\n\nA typically aggressive sounding Dutton dismisses criticism by those he derides as \"green millionaires\" with huge investments in green energy.\n\n\"I'm not interested in lining the pockets of rich green millionaires, I want to bring down the price of electricity for average mums and dads,\" he said.\n\nNor is he deterred by expert analysis of the high cost of building nuclear power plants, particularly in a country with no experience of its use. He prefers to cite the much greater disruption and equally uncertain price of building 28,000 kilometres of new transmission lines as well as the cost of wind turbines that must be dismantled after a much shorter life span than nuclear power.\n\nHis retort to how realistic all this is includes questioning why ambitions for green hydrogen can be regarded as realistic when that technology has yet to be proven at scale in contrast to modern nuclear technology in use in many countries.\n\nLikewise, he ignores the CSIRO's prediction that the 2040s will be the earliest possible timing for nuclear power, maintaining the first two nuclear generators will be built between 2035 and 2037.\n\nThe local communities at these sites he expects to be supportive given the economic boost and jobs, promising to work closely with them about the best options. That will certainly be a test for the Coalition given the inevitability of plenty of local antagonism as well.\n\nThe premiers, he insists, will also be \"pragmatic\" given that Western Australia and South Australia are already willing to host nuclear-powered submarines under the AUKUS agreement while NSW has had a medical nuclear facility operating at Lucas Heights in Sydney since 1958.\n\nFederal Labor's embrace of AUKUS has allowed him to argue the Albanese government clearly has no fears about the safety of nuclear reactors or the disposal of nuclear waste.\n\nNot that such logic will persuade Labor premiers or even the probably new Liberal National premier of Queensland, David Crisafulli. The Coalition is expected to win the state election but Crisafulli doesn't want to campaign supporting his federal leader's plans for two nuclear power plants in Queensland.\n\nThe Coalition argues it will negotiate co-operatively with both the private owners and the states over the sites but that its legal advice is that it has the power to compulsorily acquire them if necessary \"in the national interest\".\n\n\"We go to the next election seeking a clear mandate from the Australian people ... to modernise our energy system,\" Dutton said. The country, he suggests, is ready for a mature debate.\n\nIt still leaves the Coalition banking on its ability to sell an obviously high-risk \"vision\", contrasting it with a prime minister who Dutton argues has neither vision nor the ability to manage day to day government.", "source": {"uri": "afr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian Financial Review"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

"Column-Australia's Nuclear Power Proponents Have Questions to Answer: Russell", "body": "LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - Australia's main opposition party wants a sensible debate about nuclear power as it commits to build seven plants to replace coal generation if it wins the next federal election.\n\nThe conservative Liberal Party and its junior regional partner National Party announced plans on Wednesday for five large-scale nuclear plants in the eastern Australian states of Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, as well as small modular reactors for South Australia and Western Australia.\n\nIf there is to be a genuine debate on what form of generation is best to replace Australia's ageing and increasingly unreliable fleet of coal generators, there are two main questions that need to be answered.\n\nThe first is the cost of the replacement generation and the second is whether it can be delivered quickly enough to not only replace coal plants, but also to meet Australia's commitment to net-zero emissions by 2050.\n\nThe Liberal and National parties, together known as the Coalition, declined to provide any costings for the their plans, but Liberal leader Petter Dutton did acknowledge it would be expensive, while still claiming it would deliver cheaper power for Australians.\n\nNo credible analyst supports Dutton's assertion, with estimates varying as to the cost of building nuclear generation, but all of them coming in well above the cost of solar and wind firmed by battery storage and pumped hydropower.\n\nThe government's science agency, the CSIRO, estimated that new nuclear power would be twice as expensive as renewables backed by storage, and this was a best case scenario predicated on achieving economies of scale from a long-term and continuous building programme.\n\nThe Coalition said it would be able to have nuclear plants up and running between 2035 and 2037, assuming it started implementing its policy if it defeats the ruling Labor Party in a federal election due in the first half of 2025.\n\nIn theory it would be possible to build the seven gigawatts (GW) of nuclear plants on that time scale, but doing so would be an incredible achievement at odds with the recent experiences of other Western countries.\n\nNuclear plants are notorious for blowing out both on budget and time, with Britain's under-construction Hinkley Point C one such example, where the cost has more than doubled and the start date pushed back at least seven years.\n\nOBSTACLES ABOUND\n\nThe Coalition also did not elaborate on how it would overcome several political and social obstacles to nuclear power.\n\nCurrently nuclear generation is prohibited by federal law, meaning the Coalition would have to pass enabling legislation through both the lower chamber and the upper house Senate.\n\nWhile it may win the election and control the lower house, it would take a massive victory for it to take control of the Senate.\n\nThis means Dutton as prime minister would have to negotiate with cross-bench senators, and given the majority of those are either from the Australian Greens or are progressive independents, it's likely his nuclear plan would fail at the first hurdle.\n\nThere are also prohibitions on nuclear power in several states, and so far the leaders of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland have rejected any nuclear plants.\n\nBuilding a nuclear industry from scratch would also require importing a skilled workforce of nuclear engineers and other experts, something that seems at odds with the Coalition's plans to reduce migration and its increasing anti-immigrant rhetoric.\n\nWinning a social licence from the communities where the nuclear plants are planned to be located may also present challenges, even if the facilities bring jobs to replace those lost when the coal-fired generators close.\n\nThere is also the question of scale, with the Coalition planning on 7 GW of nuclear plants, which is only a third of Australia's current coal-fired capacity of about 22 GW.\n\nThis means that nuclear won't come close to replacing coal, which in turn means that renewables and storage will be needed as well, or there will be more reliance on costly natural gas.\n\nThe question of funding nuclear is also unresolved, especially since no Australian utility has shown any interest in going nuclear.\n\nThe Coalition has implied that a government-owned corporation will be set up and presumably funded by taxpayers, a position that seems to contradict the underlying philosophy of at least the Liberal part of the Coalition that governments should play a limited role in the economy.\n\nInitial reaction to the Coalition's nuclear plans has been overwhelmingly negative, with one of the few supportive voices coming from the Minerals Council of Australia, a lobby group that includes coal miners.\n\nWhile the council doesn't say it in their media release, part of their support for nuclear is because they recognise that going down that path most likely means coal remains in the generation mix for a much longer period than currently expected.\n\nOverall, it's tempting to dismiss the Coalition's nuclear plans as an expensive fantasy, especially in a country so ideally suited to develop solar and wind.\n\nHowever, the real damage from the nuclear proposal is likely that the energy debate in Australia will descend into a partisan political slanging match, with nuclear and fossil fuels being championed by the right-wing and renewables and storage by their left opponents.\n\nThe

"Opposition leader Peter Dutton has intensified his pro-nuclear energy campaign by unveiling seven potential sites for nuclear power plants across the country.\n\nMr Dutton has positioned the switch to nuclear power as a central element of the opposition's energy policy in the lead-up to the next Federal election.\n\nThe eagerly-awaited announcement of his preferred sites for new nuclear power stations has elicited a mixed response of anti-nuclear outcry and support.\n\nMr Dutton stated that the seven sites would be situated at power stations that have either closed or are scheduled to close, with two located in both New South Wales and Queensland and one each in Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia.\n\nHis favoured locations include the Liddell and Mount Piper power stations in NSW, the Tarong and Callide power stations in Queensland, the Loy Yang power station in Victoria, the Northern power station in SA and WA's Muja power station.\n\nBoth Muja and Northern have been designated as small modular reactor sites only.\n\n\"Nuclear energy for Australia is an idea whose time has come,\" Mr Dutton declared..\n\nEvery Australian deserves and should expect access to cheaper, cleaner and consistent electricity but, under Labor, this isn't happening.\"\n\n\"Right now, households and businesses around the country are suffering from Labor's expensive renewables-only approach.\"\n\nMr Dutton questioned the current government's target of achieving 65% to 75% in emissions reduction by 2035, noting that they have yet to release modelling and future power price estimates.\n\n\"Power bills have already increased by up to $1,000 for many Australians, despite promises of a $275 reduction.\"\n\n\"Moreover, Labor's climate target of 43% emissions reduction by 2030 has become unachievable.\"\n\nMr Dutton - who is about to embark on a nationwide tour to outline the merits of the plan - emphasised that nuclear power must play an integral role if Australia is to achieve a balanced and consistent energy mix.\n\nHe noted that with 90% of baseload electricity - predominantly from coal-fired power stations - nearing the end of life within the next decade, nuclear energy has proven effective in reducing electricity prices and emissions globally, complementing renewable energy and gas.\n\n\"A key advantage of modern zero-emissions nuclear plants is that they can be integrated into existing grids,\" he said.\n\n\"This means they can effectively replace retired or retiring coal plants and avoid much of the new expenditure required for Labor's 'renewables-only' system including new transmission poles and wires, costs that will ultimately be passed on to consumers in the form of higher bills.\"\n\nHe declared that Labor's strategy would require 58 million solar panels, 3,500 new industrial wind turbines and up to 28,000 kilometres of new transmission lines across the country.\n\n\"Energy experts have warned that the cost of Labor's rollout will be between $1.2 and $1.5 trillion,\" Mr Dutton said.\n\n\"No country in the world relies solely on solar and wind as Labor is proposing.\"\n\n\"By contrast, 32 countries are operating zero-emissions nuclear plants and another 50 are looking to do so.\"\n\n\"Of the world's 20 largest economies, Australia is the only one not using nuclear energy or moving towards using it.\"\n\nThe Minerals Council of Australia (MCA) immediately expressed support for the nuclear power plans.\n\n\"The coalition's nuclear policy provides a crucial pathway for Australia's industries to reduce emissions cost-effectively while maintaining access to reliable baseload power,\" said MCA chief executive officer Tania Constable.\n\n\"High future demand for reliable and clean energy means that all energy types, including nuclear power, will be indispensable in meeting Australia's future energy needs.\"\n\nMs Constable highlighted Australia's strong global reputation for non-proliferation and its world-class uranium industry that includes almost a third of global uranium reserves and supplies around 10% of global uranium used for zero-emissions electricity, positioning it well to lead in nuclear energy development.\n\n\"Nuclear energy stands out as a reliable, zero-emissions, 24/7 baseload energy source that can deliver long-term stability and support for Australia's miners, manufacturers and communities,\" she said.\n\nFor once, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and the Greens are in agreement, both describing the nuclear plan as \"fantasy.\"\n\nSpeaking on local radio while in Perth, the PM remarked, \"the market has sorted it out.\"\n\n\"That's why they're saying not just that they'll have this nuclear fantasy but it'll be a taxpayer-funded nuclear fantasy as well because the markets won't fund something that is 15 years away, something that is the most expensive form of new energy.\"\n\n\"We know that the energy transition is necessary,\" he added.\n\n\"Fourteen coal-fired power plants announced their closures under the former coalition government.\"\n\n\"It's a matter of whether the rollout of renewables with solar continues in order to secure energy supply, or whether we just stop all that happening and wait 15 years for the most expensive form of energy to come back online.\"", "source": {"uri": "smallcaps.com.au", "dataType":

describing it as good leadership.\n\nThe 80-year-old philanthropist and adventurer has likened the Opposition Leader's plan to have nuclear power in Australia by 2035 to former Liberal prime minister John Howard's successful re-election campaign for the GST in 1998.\n\n'I've never used the word risk at all, I think it's just leadership,' he told Daily Mail Australia from the remote Birdsville Track in South Australia.\n\n'It will be like John Howard's successful GST entry, that's what I compare it with and that's why I think Peter Dutton is showing showing some really good leadership.'\n\nThe Liberal Party leader is proposing to have Australia's first nuclear reactor by 2035 with a second one operating by 2037, and has announced seven possible sites in every mainland state.\n\nMr Smith predicted the ALP federally and at state level would come around to backing nuclear power - arguing Prime Minister Anthony Albanese now supported nuclear-powered submarines as part of the AUKUS deal.\n\nEntrepreneur Dick Smith (pictured left with wife Pip) is backing Peter Dutton 's plan to build seven nuclear reactors in little more than a decade -

it is the only way you can go forward.'\n\nTarong and Callide in Queensland, Liddell and Mount Piper in NSW, Port Augusta in South Australia, Loy Yang in Victoria, and Muja in Western Australia have been flagged as the locations for the stations.\n\nLabor state governments in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria have laws blocking nuclear power but Mr Smith said they would end up legislating to overturn these bans as they realised renewable energy was unreliable.\n\nRead MoreLIVE All you need to know as Peter Dutton goes nuclear\n\n'They will be convinced because there is simply no alternative,' Mr Smith said.\n\n'We will have blackouts - you can't run a country on intermittent solar and wind, it is impossible.\n\n'I understand every state has a ban on nuclear power, as well we have a federal ban on nuclear power, so those bans will have to be lifted.\n\n'We're one of the largest sellers of uranium in the world but we have legislation stating you can't even consider it and that is completely ridiculous.\n\n'We'll have to change legislation in each state and federal.'\n\nMr Smith said that while it made sense to convert coal-fired power stations into nuclear reactors, it could take longer to establish a nuclear power industry.\n\n'I think it could take 10 to 15 years,' he said.\n\n'Without doubt, the best thing to do is to put the nuclear power stations where the existing coal power stations are - in effect, all we're doing is instead of generating power by burning coal to heat water, we're going to use uranium to heat water.\n\n'You will need far less extra powerlines if we go to nuclear power.'\n\nThe 80-year-old philanthropist and adventurer has likened the federal Opposition Leader's (pictrured) plan to have nuclear power in Australia by 2037 to former Liberal prime minister John Howard's successful re-election campaign for the GST in 1998\n\nThe United Arab Emirates established a nuclear reactor at Barakah in 2020 after eight years of construction work using South Korean technology.\n\nMr Dutton on Wednesday tweeted an image of a Rolls Royce small nuclear reactor concept.\n\nBut no country in the world has yet operated small modular reactors that produce 300 megawatts, or 300million watts of power.\n\nCanada is not expected to have this technology until the late 2020s, when Ontario's state-run power company installs a reactor designed by General Electric and Hitachi.\n\nMr Smith said larger-scale reactors were probably more likely.\n\n'I'm not suggesting that we're going to have small modular reactors - my suggestion would be we just follow something like the Barakah one in the United Arab Emirates, get the South Koreans to build it, they're experts,' he said.\n\nLabor and the Greens want Australia to source 82 per cent of its energy from renewables by 2030 but Mr Smith predicted there would be more community opposition to wind turbines.\n\n'I think you'll find the majority of the population is sensible in this country and will become vocal supporters of nuclear - we don't want this incredible destruction of the environment that's happening because of these wind factory farms.\n\nMr Dutton on Wednesday tweeted an image of a Rolls Royce small nuclear reactor concept. But no country in the world has yet operated small modular reactors that produce 300 megawatts, or 300million watts of power\n\n'A nuclear power station means probably 2,000 less wind turbines so all of those people will be supporting nuclear.\n\n'The wind farms are intermittent and unpredictable so you could never run a country, especially now that Anthony Albanese is saying that we are going to industrialise more and make things like solar cells - you need an incredible lot of energy and that's impossible without nuclear power.'\n\nRead More Nuclear energy's six biggest myths busted as Australia seriously considers making the change - and why coal isn't necessarily the safe option\n\nAustralia banned nuclear power in 1998 after the Howard government agreed to a Greens amendment to get support for a new research reactor for nuclear medicine at Lucas Heights in Sydney's south.\n\nWhen it came to storing nuclear waste, Mr Smith suggested Olympic Dam in South Australia, which is also a known deposit for uranium.\n\n'I've been down in the mine at Olympic Dam - there's huge, great cavities where we took uranium out, that's where we should store the uranium,' he said.\n\nMr Smith was unsure if Mr Dutton would win the next election with a nuclear power policy.\n\n'I don't know that - I think he'll make a good prime minister,' he said.\n\n'I think we have a good Prime Minister now and I'm hoping, before the next election, that Labor will change its view and support nuclear power.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail

No details were released about costings and within costings, we are not going to know if there has been any provision for cost overruns.\n\nIts plan to own the plants also had Monash University associate professor Roger Dargaville pointing out that it was interesting that the party that \"worships the free market is proposing that the new infrastructure be paid for and owned by government.\"\n\nHe also rubbished Dutton's claims that the plants would reduce energy costs, saying that nuclear had been clearly shown to be more expensive than renewables plus storage and that choosing to go this route would result in higher energy prices.\n\nThere are other factors as well.\n\nWhile it is all very well that the Coalition has selected sites with \"skilled labour forces\", we have to question exactly what it means by a skilled labour force.\n\nAs far as we are aware, they are no labour forces with any skill in building nuclear reactors anywhere in Australia. If we are talking about operations, workers used to coal plants will need to be retrained - sometimes extensively - in order to be able to work at nuclear plants.\n\nThere's also the question of capacity.\n\nWhile Dutton has committed to the first two plants, nothing was said about how many reactors each will have or what kind of total production capacity.\n\nMore reactors will mean higher costs and longer lead times to producing electricity.\n\nAnd if we assume the absolutely bare minimum of one reactor per plant, using Dutton's example of the AP-1000 reactor, we are looking at just 2.2GW of power.\n\nThat is a fraction of the 32GW of renewable power - or half the current National Electricity Market capacity - that the Labor government is looking to add to the grid by 2030.\n\nAs for those expecting a domestic market for uranium, on average a 1GW reactor will use about 27t of uranium each year, meaning that the minimum capacity noted above would require 59.4t per annum, hardly a dent to the 4820t of U3O8 that Australia produced in 2022.\n\nBut wait, you say. What about Dutton's comment that we are already going to build nuclear submarines and how that means Labor has already signed off on its safety and disposal of waste?\n\nIt might sound similar, after all they are both nuclear power plants right?\n\nWell, it's yes and no.\n\nWhile the principles of nuclear power generation are broadly the same in that they both generate heat that boils water off into steam that in turn drives steam turbines - making nuclear plants essentially high-tech steam engines, they are different in other areas.\n\nAny future nuclear submarine operated by Australia will likely be akin to the Virginia-class attack submarines that we will acquire from the US, which have plants that generate 210MWth to power a 30MW pump jet propulsion system - ie they won't actually have 210MW of usable power.\n\nThat's at least an order of magnitude (closer to two really) less than the 1.1 gigawatts (GW) pumped out of the much larger AP-1000 reactor quoted by Dutton in his press release. Here's some reading material on this very topic.\n\nSubmarine reactors also use a far more highly enriched type of uranium fuel to generate power compared to their land-based counterparts.\n\nSubmarines, being surrounded by water at all times, have no issue with cooling while land-based power plants need a ready supply of cool water, something that can be a fair bit harder to get in Australia despite Dutton's claims that the selected sites have sufficient cooling water capacity.\n\nThere's also the niggling point about when they will be built. Australia will initially receive second-hand nuclear submarines and will only get around to building its own submarines in the early 2040s.\n\nNeedless to say, this is significantly more realistic than the Coalition's plans that call for the first plants to start producing electricity by 2035 or 2037, which would include the lengthy process of environmental clearance, community engagement, design work and securing long-lead items.\n\nAll this is before we consider that most of the arguments against nuclear in Australia is about the cost and timeframes, so we have to question what relevance the comparison actually has.\n\nThe conclusion is simple. The Coalition's nuclear policy, based on what has been released to date, doesn't add up and can be chalked up to more political hot air.", "source": {"uri": "stockhead.com.au", "dataType": "news",

research from the nation's top science agency showing it would cost more than $8.5 billion and take as long as 20 years to build just one plant.\n\nGet the latest news from thewest.com.au in your

None of the seven sites are currently owned by the commonwealth.\n\nThe CSIRO Gencost report advised a \"15+ year development time\" should be expected for nuclear in Australia, meaning if a decision to pursue the technology was made next year then a plant would be deployed \"no sooner than 2040\". Coalition MPs were told the aim would be to start two plants by 2035-37.\n\nFull details of the Coalition policy will be announced by Dutton at a press conference in Sydney at 10am.\n\nThe federal Coalition has attempted to ramp up pressure on Labor for refusing to lift the ban on nuclear energy, but faces opposition at the state level from its own side of politics, as Guardian Australia revealed in March.\n\nNuclear power is banned in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland, which prompted questions in party room on Wednesday. The Coalition would also require the Senate to overturn the federal ban.\n\nOn Tuesday the Queensland Liberal National Party leader, David Crisafulli, ruled out repealing Queensland's legislated ban on the construction and operation of nuclear reactors.\n\n\"The answer is no, and I've made my view very clear on that,\" he said, describing nuclear power as \"not on our plan, not on our agenda\".\n\nIn its latest GenCost report the CSIRO said electricity from nuclear energy would be at least 50% more expensive than solar and wind, with a theoretical 1,000MW nuclear plant built today to cost at least $8.6bn.\n\nAhead of the announcement the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, described the Coalition's policy as \"economic insanity\".\n\n\"Nuclear takes longer, it costs more and it will squander Australia's unique combination of advantages,\" he told Radio National.\n\n\"It is the worst combination of economic and ideological stupidity ... it is fiscally irresponsible.\"\n\nChalmers noted that the shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, had previously said nuclear power would have to be commercially viable, arguing this would be in contradiction with a plan for nuclear plants to be \"subsidised and owned by the commonwealth\".", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_karp@uk.news.yahoo.com", "name": "Paul

We won't stand for that,\" Ms Allan said.\n\nIn Queensland, where the Coalition has proposed establishing two nuclear power stations, the state Liberal-National Party has voiced its opposition to nuclear, leaving the opposition without allies at a state level.\n\nQueensland Opposition Leader David Crisafulli said his party had been \"clear\" nuclear was not part of their plan.\n\n\"That's a matter for Canberra. We've been consistent the whole way through,\" Mr Crisafulli said.\n\nA Liberal source told the ABC they believed Mr Crisafulli could be convinced to \"roll over\" on nuclear, \"as he did with the Voice ... and [the state Labor government's] budget\".\n\nIn New South Wales, however, the Liberal opposition said it would be open to lifting the state-level ban.\n\n\"The opposition is open to lifting the ban to allow nuclear power to be considered, if feasible, as a longer term supplement to continued deliver of reliable, affordable and clean energy ... and subject to rigorous environmental assessments,\" a spokesperson for NSW Liberal leader Mark Speakman said.\n\nClimate Change Minister Chris Bowen said the Coalition had delivered an \"alleged policy\" with no costings and no details.\n\n\"Even on their own timetable, which is hugely ambitious, they couldn't get a nuclear Australia until 2035 or 2037,\" Mr Bowen said.\n\n\"Now, that would be, in and of itself, the fastest nuclear rollout in the world in a country that doesn't have a nuclear industry.\n\nShadow Climate Change Minister Ted O'Brien said Australians would be won onside to the worth of nuclear power.\n\n\"I believe over time as we continue to point out what the rest of the world has found out, you need nuclear in the mix, we will carry the Australian people,\" Mr O'Brien told Sky News.\n\nAmong locals in the proposed nuclear communities, reaction has been more mixed.\n\nMuswellbrook man Mark said the announcement was \"the best thing to come out of Canberra in years\", while Nanango cafe owner Darren said a plant at Tarong was a \"great idea\".\n\n\"I think it's just where we have to head, coal is going to run out soon and nuclear is safe,\" Darren said.\n\nPort Augusta resident Paul said he supported nuclear power being part of Australia's energy mix, but did not think it should be built in populous areas, saying \"if they go wrong, it will go wrong in a big way\".\n\n\"It's easy to say for politicians to say let's put it somewhere but I'm pretty certain they don't want it in their backyard,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, early reactions from local representatives also illustrated the task for the Coalition to convince communities to take on nuclear.\n\nGladstone regional councillor Kahn Goodluck said his community was an industrial powerhouse of the nation, and \"getting on with the job of transitioning our economy from fossil fuels to renewable energy\".\n\n\"We don't need or want expensive, radioactive, nuclear energy here,\" he said.\n\nShooters, Fishers and Farmers party member and state representative for Eastern Victoria Jeff Bourman said he was pro-nuclear, but would still not consider a proposal in his region \"glibly\".\n\n\"I'd go and talk to the people -- the people that would live near it, the people that would live away from it, the for, the against, the scientists.

sites can be operational between 2035 and 2037, several years earlier than the timeframe the CSIRO and other experts believe is feasible.\n\nAs had been previously flagged, the stations are mostly slated for old coal sites.\n\nThe sites include Gladstone in Queensland, Liddell in the Hunter Valley in NSW, Port Augusta in South Australia, Loy Yang in the Latrobe Valley, and Muja in Western Australia.\n\nFurther details are expected later this morning, including about how much government funding would be required and whether the proposal is for large-scale nuclear reactors, small modular nuclear reactors, or a combination.\n\nThe Coalition had been promising a nuclear policy, including specific sites, for several months amid expert concerns over the cost and timeframe.\n\nLast week, Mr Dutton also revealed the Coalition would campaign against the Labor government's legislated target to reduce emissions by 43 per cent by 2030, and would not outline a 2030 emissions reduction target of its own before the election.\n\nCoalition energy spokesperson Ted O'Brien and Nationals leader David Littleproud will address an energy conference held by The Australian today.\n\nThis morning, Treasurer Jim Chalmers will tell that conference the Coalition's nuclear plan is \"the dumbest policy ever put forward by a major party\" and will seek to contrast the Coalition's plan, likely to require significant public funding, with Labor's plan to encourage private investment in renewables and gas.", "source": {"uri": "abc.net.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian

Those MPs have muted their criticism only because it is pointless to criticise a policy that will likely never come to fruition.\n\nOne federal Liberal MP, who spoke to Guardian Australia under the condition of anonymity, said the Liberals would struggle to campaign on the plan until there were more details and costings.\n\n\"If we don't see the detail of it before the election, the electorate won't take us seriously. Australians aren't stupid,\" they said.\n\n\"It's a bunch of statements without any detail.\n\n\"You can't turn off coal one day and start nuclear the next day like that. You can't unplug one and plug in the other and I think that's why conversations around nuclear are important to see where and how it might work.\"\n\nMost MPs accept the policy as a high-risk, high-reward manoeuvre that could wrong-foot Labor by offering low emissions power, but could also saddle the opposition with an unpopular and expensive policy akin to the tax changes former Labor leader Bill Shorten took the 2019 election or the former Liberal leader John Hewson's ill-fated Fightback! platform he proposed at the 1993 poll.\n\nBowen, the climate change and energy minister, said the policy \"fails at the first hurdle\". \"Mr Dutton needs to explain how he would overturn [state nuclear bans], not abuse the premiers, not berate and complain ... but outline what his own plan is,\" he told reporters in Sydney.\n\n\"The Australian people now have a very clear choice: stick with the plan or go with this un-costed, un-modelled fantasy that Mr Dutton is proposing today.\"\n\nBowen said the policy would cause \"a complete breakdown of investment in renewable energy and that's what the Liberal and National Party wants\".\n\nThe premiers of Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland reiterated on Wednesday that they would not lift their states' bans of nuclear power, as the Queensland Liberal National opposition leader, David Crisafulli, did earlier in the week.\n\nBut Dutton told reporters in Sydney he would negotiate with the states and joked that the proverbial \"bucket of money\" could overcome their objections.\n\nWith none of the sites currently owned by the commonwealth, Dutton also suggested they could be compulsorily acquired. AGL is turning Liddell into a battery, to start operations in 2026, and is planning to manufacture solar panels there.\n\nDutton had conceded that a \"significant amounts of gas\" would be used to generate electricity in the interim, before two plants he claims could be online by 2035-2037 and the rest to commence operations in the 2040s.\n\nThe shadow attorney general, Michaelia Cash, who is a senator for WA, suggested the power station at Collie would be built closer to 2050.\n\nRelated: The Coalition's nuclear power plan offers the worst of all energy worlds: higher emissions and higher electricity costs | Malcolm Turnbull\n\nThe CSIRO's Gencost report advised nuclear power could be set up in Australia no sooner than 2040 and would be at least 50% more expensive than solar and wind, even factoring in the costs of transmission and firming of renewables.\n\nBoyce, whose electorate of Flynn contains the site of the proposed Callide power station, suggested his community would welcome it as it has a \"proud heritage as an energy-producing region and there is a high level of 'energy literacy' in the community\".\n\nChester, who previously warned that his community would need to receive \"direct economic benefits\" if it were to host a power plants, on Wednesday welcomed the release of the plan.\n\n\"I will be listening to locals, consulting the experts, and putting the needs of Gippsland and Latrobe Valley first, and endeavouring to act in the national interest at all times,\" he said in a statement.\n\nThe NSW Liberal senator and former state party president Maria Kovacic said all resources should be leveraged, including wind and solar.\n\n\"An affordable, clean, balanced, stable and efficient energy mix is critical. We need to ensure that we set ideology aside as we deliver on this,\" she said.\n\nAndrew Bragg, the shadow assistant minister for home ownership and a leading Liberal moderate, backed the nuclear policy, labelling the federal nuclear ban \"thoroughly unscientific\" and a \"bizarre prohibition\".\n\nThe Liberal MP Rowan Ramsey, whose seat of Grey contains the Northern power station, said in March that any talk of where nuclear power plants would be built is \"conjecture\" that cannot sensibly be tackled until after the nuclear ban is lifted.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com",

They have the technical attributes needed for a nuclear plant, including transmission infrastructure, cooling water capacity and a skilled workforce, the opposition policy says.\n\nThe program would consist of two phases, starting with two establishment projects in the mid-2030s followed by a build of others through to 2050.\n\nMost sites would have larger reactors, with two - in South Australia and Western Australia - having small modular reactors. All mainland states would eventually have reactors.\n\nThe proposed sites are\n\nLiddell Power Station, New South Wales\n\nMount Piper Power Station, New South Wales\n\nLoy Yang Power Stations, Victoria\n\nTarong Power Station, Queensland\n\nCallide Power Station, Queensland\n\nNorthern Power Station, South Australia (small modular reactor only)\n\nMuja Power Station, Western Australia (small modular reactor only)\n\nDutton said the generators would be owned by the Commonwealth government.\n\nThe first could begin operating in 2035 if small modular reactors are used, or 2037 \"if modern larger plants are found to be the best option\", the opposition says.\n\nThis is much earlier than the CSIRO has estimated that an initial plant could begin.\n\nThe CSIRO said in its May assessment of generation technology costs for Australia, that \"due to the current state of the development pipeline in Australia, that the earliest deployment would be from 2040\".\n\nDutton said he would be \"very happy for the election to be a referendum on energy, on nuclear, on power prices, on lights going out, on who has a sustainable pathway for our country going forward\".\n\n\"We are going to the next election seeking a mandate from the Australian people, a very clear mandate that we want support to modernise our energy system ... which is about economic growth and jobs for decades and generations to come,\" Dutton said. said.\n\nThe opposition says the timeline for nuclear energy including building two establishment projects is ten to 12 years, \"from the government making a decision until zero-emissions nuclear electricity first enters the grid\".\n\nThe Coalition policy says a key advantage of the nuclear energy plants was they could be plugged into existing grids. \"This means they can effectively replace retired or retiring coal plants and avoid much of the new spending needed for Labor's 'renewables-only' system, including new transmission poles and wires.\"\n\nThe government would partner with nuclear companies from aboard on development and operation.\n\nEach community around a site would receive a benefits package enshrined in legislation.\n\nIt would include:\n\nmulti-billion dollar facility guaranteeing high-paying jobs for generations to come\n\nan integrated economic development zone attracting manufacturing, value-add and high-tech industry\n\na regional deal unlocking investment in modern infrastructure, services and community priorities\n\nEstablishing a civil nuclear programme would require an expanded Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency to license and regulate the power stations, a Nuclear Energy Coordinating Authority, and a government business enterprise to be called Affordable Energy Australia.\n\nDutton could not give a cost for the nuclear plan, saying only it would be \"a fraction\" of the government's energy transition plan costing $1.2 trillion to $1.5 trillion. He said the opposition would have more to say on cost \"in due course\".\n\nThe opposition leader announced his plan at a news conference in Sydney, after a pre-budget announcement had been deferred. He was flanked by a bevy of colleagues including Nationals leader David Littleproud.\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers said in a social media post: \"With Australia's advantages and opportunities, nothing could be more economically irrational or fiscally irresponsible\" than the nuclear policy\".\n\nChalmers told the ABC: \"Peter Dutton's nuclear negativity is economic insanity, pure and simple. Nuclear takes longer, it costs more and it will squander Australia's unique combination of advantages\".\n\nApart from a fierce campaign from federal Labor, Dutton faces attacks from the states. His plan is opposed by the Liberal-National opposition in Queensland where there is a state election within months.\n\nMichelle Grattan does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.\n\n/Courtesy of The Conversation.

2024 (BSS/AFP) - Australia's conservative opposition will build nuclear power plants across the country if it wins the next election, according to plans detailed Wednesday that have reignited debate over climate policy.\n\nOpposition leader Peter Dutton said he would overturn a 26-year nuclear ban to build seven government-owned reactors on the sites of ageing coal-fired power stations.\n\nCalling an election due within the next 11 months a \"referendum on nuclear\", Dutton said current policies to scale up renewables were ineffective and unreliable.\n\nAustralia's science agency has warned costly nuclear reactors would take at least 15 years to build, while critics have derided Dutton's plan as \"toxic\", \"risky\" and \"economic insanity\".\n\nThe shift to nuclear power would be a sharp departure from the energy policy of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's government, which aims to ramp up renewables and gradually wind back heavily polluting coal-fired power.\n\nUnder the opposition's plan, the first government-owned reactors would come online by 2035 at the earliest, Dutton said.\n\nEventually, five of Australia's eight states and territories would host a nuclear power plant.\n\nPolling released by the Lowy Institute think-tank earlier this month showed Australia's longtime scepticism about nuclear power had \"shifted markedly\", with six-in-10 Australians supportive of some form of nuclear energy.\n\nOver the past decade, an ideological brawl dubbed the \"climate wars\" has dominated Australian politics, repeatedly undermining attempts to reduce carbon emissions.\n\n\"We cannot afford to squander more time in moving our economy away from its reliance on climate-damaging coal and gas,\" said Australian Conservation Foundation boss Kelly O'Shanassy.\n\nClimate finance expert Tim Buckley said nuclear power in Australia was \"impossible\".\n\n\"The idea that nuclear could be up and running in 2035-37 is fanciful, and even that is too late given our concurrent climate and energy crises,\" he said.\n\nNuclear power generation has been banned in Australia since 1998.\n\nAustralia's renewable energy ambitions have grown in the past decade.\n\nMore than 30 percent of Australia's total electricity generation in 2022 came from solar and wind.", "source": {"uri": "bssnews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bangladesh Sangbad

They have the technical attributes needed for a nuclear plant, including transmission infrastructure, cooling water capacity and a skilled workforce, the opposition policy says.\n\nThe program would consist of two phases, starting with two establishment projects in the mid-2030s followed by a build of others through to 2050.\n\nMost sites would have larger reactors, with two - in South Australia and Western Australia - having small modular reactors. All mainland states would eventually have reactors.\n\nThe proposed sites are\n\nDutton said the generators would be owned by the Commonwealth government.\n\nThe first could begin operating in 2035 if small modular reactors are used, or 2037 \"if modern larger plants are found to be the best option\", the opposition says.\n\nThis is much earlier than the CSIRO has estimated that an initial plant could begin.\n\nThe CSIRO said in its May assessment of generation technology costs for Australia, that \"due to the current state of the development pipeline in Australia, that the earliest deployment would be from 2040\".\n\nDutton said he would be \"very happy for the election to be a referendum on energy, on nuclear, on power prices, on lights going out, on who has a sustainable pathway for our country going forward\".\n\nThe opposition says the timeline for nuclear energy including building two establishment projects is ten to 12 years, \"from the government making a decision until zero-emissions nuclear electricity first enters the grid\".\n\nThe Coalition policy says a key advantage of the nuclear energy plants was they could be plugged into existing grids. \"This means they can effectively replace retired or retiring coal plants and avoid much of the new spending needed for Labor's 'renewables-only' system, including new transmission poles and wires.\"\n\nThe government would partner with nuclear companies from aboard on development and operation.\n\nEach community around a site would receive a benefits package enshrined in legislation.\n\nIt would include:\n\nEstablishing a civil nuclear programme would require an expanded Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency to license and regulate the power stations, a Nuclear Energy Coordinating Authority, and a government business enterprise to be called Affordable Energy Australia.\n\nDutton could not give a cost for the nuclear plan, saying only it would be \"a fraction\" of the government's energy transition plan costing $1.2 trillion to $1.5 trillion. He said the opposition would have more to say on cost \"in due course\".\n\nThe opposition leader announced his plan at a news conference in Sydney, after a pre-budget announcement had been deferred. He was flanked by a bevy of colleagues including Nationals leader David Littleproud.\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers said in a social media post: \"With Australia's advantages and opportunities, nothing could be more economically irrational or fiscally irresponsible\" than the nuclear policy\".\n\nChalmers told the ABC: \"Peter Dutton's nuclear negativity is economic insanity, pure and simple. Nuclear takes longer, it costs more and it will squander Australia's unique combination of advantages\".\n\nApart from a fierce campaign from federal Labor, Dutton faces attacks from the states. His plan is opposed by the Liberal-National opposition in Queensland where there is a state election within months.\n\nMichelle Grattan does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding

Liberal-National Coalition, on Wednesday announced his plan to build seven nuclear power stations around Australia if elected Prime Minister at the next general election.\n\nUnder the plan, the first two plants would be operational by 2037, with the remaining five online by 2050.\n\nDutton said all the nuclear power plants would be built at locations where there are currently power stations that have closed or are scheduled to do so and that the facilities would be government-owned.\n\nAll the proposed sites are on the Australian mainland, with two each in the eastern states of New South Wales (NSW) and Queensland -- Dutton's home state -- and one each in south-eastern Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia.\n\nDutton said in a statement that the locations offered important attributes for a zero-emissions nuclear power plant, including cooling water capacity, existing transmission infrastructure and local communities with skilled workforces.\n\n\"Every Australian deserves and should expect access to cheaper, cleaner and consistent electricity,\" he said.\n\n\"Of the world's 20 largest economies, Australia is the only one not using nuclear energy, or moving towards it.\"\n\nThe federal government has had a ban on nuclear power in place in 1998 that would have to be overturned for Dutton's plan to go ahead.\n\nQueensland, NSW and Victoria also have their own bans in place, but Dutton said he would work with the state premiers on the issue.\n\nThe governing federal Labor Party as well as the incumbent leaders of all three states have previously ruled out repealing the bans.\n\nAppearing on state media Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio on Wednesday, PM Anthony Albanese said Dutton's plan overlooks Australia's renewable energy potential.\n\n\"It'll be a taxpayer funded nuclear fantasy,\" he said.\n\n\"Here in Australia, we have the best solar resources in the world.\"\n\nA report published by national science agency the

We need to ensure hospitals can stay on 24/7, we need to ensure that cold rooms can stay on 24/7, we need to make sure that our economy could function 24/7 and we can only do that with a strong baseload power,\" he said.\n\n\"We want to utilise existing assets that we have got, and the poles and wires that are used at a moment on the coal-fired power station sites can be utilised to distribute the energy generated from the latest generation nuclear reactors.\"\n\nHowever, the Coalition was unable to provide a detailed cost analysis of the project with Mr. Dutton saying it would \"cost a fraction\" of the government's net zero policy, which is slated to exceed $1 trillion ($US667 billion), including the building of new transmission infrastructure, wind turbines, solar panels, and battery storage.\n\n\"We will have more to say in relation to the cost in due course and as you know we've done this in a step-by-step process,\" Mr. Dutton said.\n\nHe also took aim at investors who have an interest in renewable energy companies, and said they would likely push hard against his party's policy.\n\nFurther, the opposition leader pointed to overseas experience saying countries with nuclear power enjoyed lower energy prices, and that it would be easier to transition coal-fired power plant workers into nuclear facilities.\n\nFor nuclear, the main difference to existing coal-fired power stations is how water is heated to generate steam that in turn, spins turbines that create electricity for use.\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese called it a \"fantasy.\"\n\n\"It'll be a taxpayer funded nuclear fantasy,\" he told ABC radio. \"Here in Australia, we have the best solar resources in the world.\n\n\"This makes no economic sense, as well as leaving us in a position of energy insecurity because of the time that it will take to roll out a nuclear reactor.\"\n\nClimate Minister Chris Bowen continued his line of criticism against nuclear calling it the \"most expensive form of energy.\"\n\n\"To date, we've seen no costs, no gigawatts, no detail. This is a joke but it's a serious joke because it threatens our transition,\" he told reporters.\n\nState leaders, who preside over proposed nuclear power sites, have been slow to give their endorsement.\n\n\"What we've heard this morning from Peter Dutton is not a plan. What it is, is an absolute fantasy. We know that renewable energy delivers the cheapest form of new electricity that you can build in this country,\" Victoria's Energy Minister Lily D'Ambrosio told reporters.\n\nShe also said she had yet to be consulted by the opposition on the adequacy of the site.\n\nMr. Dutton has said those consultations will come.\n\nNSW Premier Chris Minns was more moderated in his comments.\n\n\"There's a few questions about whether this is a fantasy or a pipe dream or it's a legitimate energy policy,\" he told ABC.\n\n\"We've got a prohibition on nuclear power in the state -- my government's not going to waive that, my understanding is that the Queensland opposition and government won't waive it either.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Origin Energy CEO Frank Calabria said there would be several challenges to work through.\n\n\"They are all considerations because I don't think we can see it being scalable for many years, probably well into the next decade,\" he told a business conference in Sydney.\n\nIn a speech last year at the ARC Conference, he said the value of wind turbine energy dropped 40 percent when it reached 30 percent of an electricity grid's mix.\n\nSolar's value declined 50 percent when it reached 15 percent of a grid.\n\nThe report estimated costs to be between $83/MWh and $120/MWh in 2030, if they account for 80 percent of variable generation.\n\n\"It provides a crucial pathway for Australia's industries to reduce emissions cost-effectively while maintaining access to reliable baseload power,\" Chief Executive Officer Tania Constable said.\n\n\"Building a diverse energy mix that meets both environmental and economic goals is essential for keeping vital industries competitive amidst significant cost pressures and ambitious emissions targets.\"\n\nGiven the growing demand for dependable and clean energy in the future, she said that all energy sources, including nuclear power, will play a crucial role in meeting Australia's energy requirements.\n\n\"A technology-neutral approach to energy solutions is necessary to tackle the substantial challenge of decarbonising the economy while maintaining its competitiveness and productivity,\" she said.", "source": {"uri":

Now, as he seeks to upend the transition to renewable energy in Australia and spend billions of dollars to build nuclear reactors instead, there is almost none.\n\nDutton and Nationals leader David Littleproud have selected seven locations around Australia for future nuclear reactors. On Wednesday, they finally named them.\n\nOn the sites of seven existing coal-fired power stations, they were chosen not because they are the safest or best-situated to manage nuclear technology but because they have infrastructure - poles and wires - already in place.\n\nThe Coalition says that avoids the need to build more of the transmission lines which are so unpopular, especially in regional areas.\n\nThis point is in dispute. And that's just the beginning.\n\nSome of the sites, particularly Loy Yang in the Latrobe Valley, are very close to earthquake fault lines. Several have no obvious water source, which is essential. They appear to have been chosen for political saleability, not science.\n\nMost are privately owned. Under the Coalition plan, the federal government would acquire them. This, from the parties most ideologically opposed to asset nationalisation.\n\nPutting that aside, what if the owners won't sell? The Coalition would force them. How? It's not clear.\n\nIf that problem could be overcome, the Coalition would then persuade state and territory governments to change the laws currently banning nuclear power. What if they didn't agree? Dutton would throw money at them because premiers can never resist federal cash. What if they still resisted? He insisted they wouldn't.\n\nWithin hours of the sites being named, the premiers of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and Queensland - all the states that would be housing the reactors - ruled it out. Queensland's Liberal National Party opposition leader, David Crisafulli, said he wasn't keen either and Victorian Liberal opposition leader John Pesutto had \"no plans for it\".\n\nBut if the states were somehow persuaded, the ban would also need to be overturned at the federal level. That would require negotiation in the Senate, where the Greens in particular would refuse.\n\nA few other issues arise from the few policy details which challenge credibility.\n\nJust last month, shadow treasurer Angus Taylor said nuclear power would not need to be subsidised.\n\n\"The key for me as someone who really believes that we should make sure that we have affordable, reliable power - and I don't want to commit subsidies that aren't necessary - is to make sure that it's commercially viable,\" Taylor told the National Press Club. \"And we think it can be.\"\n\nBut announcing the policy on Wednesday, Dutton confirmed the taxpayer would fund the lot. Perhaps reality dawned between 23 May and 19 June that finding private investors - and insurers - was going to be tricky.\n\nSo if the land acquisition and state and federal legislative hurdles were cleared, a Dutton government would then build, own and run the reactors and compensate affected residents in the form of subsidised power and other industry-transition assistance.\n\nSo how much would all this cost? Dutton had no answer. That would require modelling, he said, which is much easier when you're in government.\n\n\"But it will be a big bill, there's no question about that,\" he said, promising more on cost at the \"next stage\" of the policy rollout.\n\nThe opposition leader insisted it would be a fraction of what the energy transition is currently costing. He provided no evidence to support this. In its recent analysis of the cost of a nuclear industry, Csiro said it would be at least double the cost of renewables. It put the pricetag of building reactors at between $8bn and $17bn each. Its analysis was also at odds with the Coalition's promise that the first reactor could be online by 2037.\n\nDutton could not say definitively what kind of reactors would be built - only that as-yet-undeveloped small modular reactors would be among them - or how much of Australia's power they would generate.\n\nHe was also asked - twice - if all seven sites would definitely proceed. He declined to confirm it.\n\nLater, deputy Nationals leader Perin Davey suggested that unhappy locals could veto the plans.\n\n\"If the community is absolutely adamant, we will not proceed,\" Davey told Sky News.\n\nWithin hours, her leader David Littleproud said she was wrong, telling ABC TV that he and Dutton were demonstrating \"strong leadership\" and that they were \"prepared to make the tough calls in the national interest\". There would be more than two years of consultations to \"design local solutions\" to ease concerns but no reversal.\n\nThere was some more definitive guidance on the transitional implications of the nuclear plan. The Coalition's policy would lean more heavily on gas.\n\n\"The gas that will be required will be significantly more than what it is now,\" David Littleproud told Sky News, although he didn't clarify where it would come from.\n\nAnd shadow energy minister Ted O'Brien suggested coal would not phase out fully before nuclear power came online.\n\n\"As coal retires from the system, it will be replaced with zero emissions nuclear energy,\" he said.\n\nBut \"zero emissions nuclear\" alone cannot achieve net zero emissions by 2050. What about the emissions from the transport sector? What about agriculture? This has not been explained.\n\nA few things about the policy have, however, become clearer.\n\nIt is designed primarily for political purposes, not to address climate change. The number of ifs cast serious doubt over whether it can actually be delivered.\n\nBut just announcing it has the effect of undermining certainty and disrupting investment in cheaper renewables. And some in the clean energy sector are wondering if that is actually the point.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri":

That description appears particularly apt in Dutton's nuclear power plans. The Coalition's nuclear project is opposed by state Labor governments in each of the five states being targeted. Victoria, NSW and Queensland have laws banning nuclear power. The Labor governments in SA and WA may follow suit if they think state legislation will give them some legal protection, or any political advantage. Could a Dutton government override state laws banning nuclear power? Anne Twomey, a Sydney University Professor Emerita with lengthy experience teaching and practising in constitutional law, argues that states probably could not prevent the Commonwealth establishing a nuclear power plant, nor could they prevent necessary associated operations such as transmission lines and nuclear waste transport.\n\nRenew Economy 20th June 2024 read more \"\n\nThe Peter Dutton-led Coalition has announced that, if elected, the government will build seven nuclear power stations located across every mainland state. One can understand the appeal of nuclear power to those who are unfamiliar with the history of the technology. Nuclear power has been with us for many decades, supplying large amounts of emission-free power across a wide number of democratic, developed countries in Europe and North America. Why wouldn't we make use of a power source that can be turned up and down independent of the weather and which other developed nations have used for decades? What many Australians probably don't realise is that almost all of these nuclear power plants were constructed in the 1970s and 1980s. The technology was then largely abandoned as an option for new power supply. Over the 2000s there was talk of a renaissance of the technology as concerns around global warming grew, and the industry unveiled new \"generation 3\" designs to address nuclear meltdown risks. Yet this expected renaissance never eventuated, with just five generation 3 nuclear power plants under construction over the past decade across Europe and North America.\n\nGuardian 20th June 2024 read more \"\n\n'No credible reason' to expect cheaper power bills under Peter Dutton's nuclear energy plan, experts say. Peter Dutton's claim that nuclear energy would lead to cheaper power bills has been rejected by energy experts, with one saying there was \"no credible reason\" to think adding \"the most expensive form of bulk electricity\" would cut prices. They said a range of evidence, including a recent CSIRO analysis, suggested nuclear power would be more expensive than other options, and that the solar and wind system under construction - supported by firming technology - was the cheapest option.", "source": {"uri": "no2nuclearpower.org.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "No2NuclearPower"}, "authors": [{"uri": "pete@no2nuclearpower.org.uk",

He will also be at the announcement press conference.\n\nOther areas raised as potential sites include the Hunter Valley and Mt Piper in New South Wales, Port Augusta in South Australia, Collie, south of Perth, and the Latrobe Valley in Victoria.\n\nHowever, the La Trobe option appears unlikely.\n\nSpeaking on ABC radio, Treasurer Jim Chalmers slammed the plan as \"economically irrational\" and \"fiscally irresponsible.\"\n\n\"Peter Dutton's nuclear negativity is economic insanity, pure and simple,'' he said.\n\n\"Nuclear takes longer, it costs more, and it will squander Australia's unique combination of advantages. It is the worst combination of economic and ideological stupidity.\n\n\"It is economically irrational, it is fiscally irresponsible. And it means if it's implemented, Australia would fail that grab these vast economic and industrial opportunities with a net zero transformation in the most effective way.\n\n\"Only a couple of weeks ago, the Shadow Treasurer was saying he would only support them on the basis that they were commercial. Now we know that they're proposing for the government to run them so he's obviously been rolled in quite a public and humiliating fashion here.\"\n\nIt comes after news.com.au first revealed Mr Dutton's plan to announce the nuclear sites.\n\nIn recent weeks Mr Dutton told The Weekend Australian that he would oppose the legislated 2030 emissions target, a 43 per cent cut compared with 2005 levels, at the next election but remain committed to reaching net zero emissions by 2050.\n\nHe conceded that the coalition's commitment to introduce nuclear power in Australia would not lead to plants being built before 2040.\n\nNationals leader David Littleproud confirmed those nuclear power plants would be in Nationals electorates.\n\n\"We will be very upfront and honest. They will be in National Party seats,\" he said before attacking Labor's renewables approach to green energy.\n\n\"We've been very clear that they will be limited to where existing coal power stations are, so we don't need the extra 28,000 of transmission lines to plug the renewables in which tears up the food security and pushes up the food prices.\"\n\nCritics claimed that Mr Dutton's new position could break Australia's 2015 commitment to the Paris agreement, under which nearly 200 countries said they would aim to limit global heating to well below 2C and attempt to limit it to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.\n\nAnthony Albanese then called Mr Dutton's stance \"absurd\" and suggested he would be \"walking away from the Paris agreement\".\n\nMr Dutton said this was not the case and he would not be walking away from the Paris agreement.\n\nThe Liberal leader later told 2GB radio: \"It's very hard in opposition - without all the modelling and the advice from government - to put an exact figure on the table.\"\n\nMr Dutton also said Labor's targets, which he previously supported, would \"trash\" the economy.\n\n\"I think it's very clear that we have absolute commitment to Paris and our commitment for net zero by 2050,\" he said.\n\n\"It's important, it doesn't need to be linear, as we've pointed out, and we're not going to send the economy into freefall and families bankrupt through an ideologically based approach, which is what Anthony Albanese is doing at the moment.\"", "source": {"uri": "news.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "News.com.au"}, "authors":

Those MPs have muted their criticism only because it is pointless to criticise a policy that will likely never come to fruition.\n\nOne federal Liberal MP, who spoke to Guardian Australia under the condition of anonymity, said the Liberals would struggle to campaign on the plan until there were more details and costings.\n\n\"If we don't see the detail of it before the election, the electorate won't take us seriously. Australians aren't stupid,\" they said.\n\n\"It's a bunch of statements without any detail.\n\n\"You can't turn off coal one day and start nuclear the next day like that. You can't unplug one and plug in the other and I think that's why conversations around nuclear are important to see where and how it might work.\"\n\nMost MPs accept the policy as a high-risk, high-reward manoeuvre that could wrong-foot Labor by offering low emissions power, but could also saddle the opposition with an unpopular and expensive policy akin to the tax changes former Labor leader Bill Shorten took the 2019 election or the former Liberal leader John Hewson's ill-fated Fightback! platform he proposed at the 1993 poll.\n\nBowen, the climate change and energy minister, said the policy \"fails at the first hurdle\". \"Mr Dutton needs to explain how he would overturn [state nuclear bans], not abuse the premiers, not berate and complain ... but outline what his own plan is,\" he told reporters in Sydney.\n\n\"The Australian people now have a very clear choice: stick with the plan or go with this un-costed, un-modelled fantasy that Mr Dutton is proposing today.\"\n\nBowen said the policy would cause \"a complete breakdown of investment in renewable energy and that's what the Liberal and National Party wants\".\n\nThe premiers of Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland reiterated on Wednesday that they would not lift their states' bans of nuclear power, as the Queensland Liberal National opposition leader, David Crisafulli, did earlier in the week.\n\nBut Dutton told reporters in Sydney he would negotiate with the states and joked that the proverbial \"bucket of money\" could overcome their objections.\n\nWith none of the sites currently owned by the commonwealth, Dutton also suggested they could be compulsorily acquired. AGL is turning Liddell into a battery, to start operations in 2026, and is planning to manufacture solar panels there.\n\nDutton had conceded that a \"significant amounts of gas\" would be used to generate electricity in the interim, before two plants he claims could be online by 2035-2037 and the rest to commence operations in the 2040s.\n\nThe shadow attorney general, Michaelia Cash, who is a senator for WA, suggested the power station at Collie would be built closer to 2050.\n\nRelated: The Coalition's nuclear power plan offers the worst of all energy worlds: higher emissions and higher electricity costs | Malcolm Turnbull\n\nThe CSIRO's Gencost report advised nuclear power could be set up in Australia no sooner than 2040 and would be at least 50% more expensive than solar and wind, even factoring in the costs of transmission and firming of renewables.\n\nBoyce, whose electorate of Flynn contains the site of the proposed Callide power station, suggested his community would welcome it as it has a \"proud heritage as an energy-producing region and there is a high level of 'energy literacy' in the community\".\n\nChester, who previously warned that his community would need to receive \"direct economic benefits\" if it were to host a power plants, on Wednesday welcomed the release of the plan.\n\n\"I will be listening to locals, consulting the experts, and putting the needs of Gippsland and Latrobe Valley first, and endeavouring to act in the national interest at all times,\" he said in a statement.\n\nThe NSW Liberal senator and former state party president Maria Kovacic said all resources should be leveraged, including wind and solar.\n\n\"An affordable, clean, balanced, stable and efficient energy mix is critical. We need to ensure that we set ideology aside as we deliver on this,\" she said.\n\nAndrew Bragg, the shadow assistant minister for home ownership and a leading Liberal moderate, backed the nuclear policy, labelling the federal nuclear ban \"thoroughly unscientific\" and a \"bizarre prohibition\".\n\nThe Liberal MP Rowan Ramsey, whose seat of Grey contains the Northern power station, said in March that any talk of where nuclear power plants would be built is \"conjecture\" that cannot sensibly be tackled until after the nuclear ban is lifted.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Party_of_Australia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Party of Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Dutton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peter Dutton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_(Australia)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coalition (Australia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Power station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Australia", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Liberal Party of Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Queensland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Queensland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Victoria (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perin_Davey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Perin Davey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Littleproud", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Littleproud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Augusta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Port Augusta"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Port Augusta"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Callide", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district of Callide"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Gee_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Gee (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_Calare", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Division of Calare"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backbencher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Backbencher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Bowen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chris Bowen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowen,_Queensland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bowen, Queensland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bowen, Queensland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New South Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New South Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Australia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Australia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Australia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Western Australia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Boyce", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colin Boyce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardian_Australia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guardian Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fightback!_(policy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fightback!

I won't be negotiating.\"\n\nOn June 20, she said she would \"stand with the Victorian community,\" particularly in Gippsland.\n\n\"When you think about the future of our state, when you think about the future we want our kids to grow up in ... I want it to be a state where the energy source is clean, secure, and cheaper,\" she told reporters outside Parliament House in Melbourne.\n\n\"And what's really important about our pathway that we're already on with renewable energy is that we know that it works. We have the lowest wholesale prices here in Victoria in that nation.\"\n\nOpposition State Liberal Leader John Pesutto said he had \"no plans for nuclear as a state opposition,\" but left the door open for future discussions.\n\n\"It may well be that a future federal government initiates a national discussion on nuclear power noting that there is a moratorium currently in place nationally,\" he told reporters on June 19.\n\n\"We know this will cost hundreds of billions of dollars and that will mean people's electricity bills will be higher and I'm concerned about the future generations of Queenslanders who will need to manage this dangerous radioactive waste forever,\" he told ABC Radio on June 20.\n\n\"We just don't need it. We have a detailed, costed plan to get to net zero emissions in our energy system through renewable, through solar and wind, and pumped hydro storage in particular, and that's the plan we're pursuing here.\"\n\nMr. Miles also said it was not assured his government would sell the designated sites for nuclear power plants to the federal government.\n\n\"We still own those generators and we own that land and we own the transmission network from there and so without our cooperation it's very hard to see how he can do it,\" the premier said.\n\n\"I tell you what -- if Labor is in government we will do everything that we can to block his plan to build expensive nuclear reactors on sites we own here in Queensland.\"\n\nThe LNP opposition meanwhile, left the matter for future discussion.\n\n\"It's not on our agenda, because quite frankly, that's a matter for Canberra,\" Opposition Leader David Crisafulli told reporters.\n\n\"Firstly, it costs a lot of money. Secondly, it takes a lot of time and we don't have a day to wait, and I don't think NSW consumers can pay any more when it comes to energy prices,\" he told reporters.\n\n\"The last estimate I saw was that nuclear power generation in this state to replace coal-fired power would cost between $70-$200 billion. Who are they going to send that bill to?\"\n\nHe also said there was significant investment in renewable developments and changing course now would be a \"sovereign risk.\"\n\n\"We've got $30-odd billion of private capital invested in renewable energy,\" he said. \"If all of a sudden you were to introduce nuclear power, that investment is at real risk.\"\n\nNSW Opposition Leader Mark Speakman said he did not have \"enough detail,\" but was open to nuclear.\n\n\"My concern is exclusively around cost. What we know from all the independent research that is out there is that nuclear power in the context of the Australian energy market is actually going to drive up prices rather than driving down,\" he told Sky News on June 20.\n\n\"There's only one or two things that have happened. Either Peter Dutton knows how much the cost is and he's refusing to tell us -- or, even more scary, he's announced a policy without even knowing how much it's possible.\"\n\nHowever, state Opposition Leader David Speirs was one of the few leaders to display overt support for nuclear.\n\n\"If elected in 2026, the South Australian Liberal Party is committed to establishing a Royal Commission into the potential for civil nuclear energy generation in South Australia, so that we can make informed decisions about the future of energy in our state, and create a long-term plan to make electricity more affordable and reliable for all South Australians.\"\n\nMayor Dean Johnson said a local ballot conducted to gauge support found 61.6 percent of voters in favour of the site, compared to 38.4 percent.\n\n\"This is a recipe for disaster. It's a recipe for massive increases in power bills. On any measure it simply does not make sense,\" he told ABC Radio Perth.\n\n\"In Australia, we have no legislative or regulatory framework. We have no workforce. We have no experience. It's going to take years and years and years, and billions of dollars of taxpayer subsidies to support this.\n\n\"You've got more chance of seeing a unicorn trotting down St Georges Terrace than you have of nuclear power being a feasible and reliable option for our energy system.\"\n\nThe opposition again left the door open.\n\n\"I've always said I'm not afraid of nuclear energy,\" said opposition energy spokesperson Steve Thomas.\n\n\"But the business case has to stack up and the community support has to be there to go ahead.\"", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType":

He lost.\n\nDutton is hoping for a different outcome at the next federal election but if he wins, he'll still need to convince federal parliament to lift the ban.\n\nHe won't be able to count on the support Labor or the Greens, meaning, in the event of a minority government, nuclear power could hinge on the likes of Bob Katter or Pauline Hanson.\n\nNo.\n\nThe states are crucial because under Dutton's plan, nuclear power plants would be built in every state except Tasmania. However, as we mentioned above, several states currently have bans on nuclear power.\n\nHistorically, Labor and the trade union movement have been firmly opposed to nuclear, even for civil uses like energy.\n\nVictoria's Premier Jacinta Allan gave Dutton's plan to build two reactors in the Latrobe Valley short shrift.\n\n\"They want to bring more expensive, more risky, more toxic energy solutions to the people of this country. We won't stand for that,\" Ms Allan said.\n\nWhen asked how he'd overcome this hurdle, Dutton was rather blunt, referencing a famous Paul Keating quote.\n\n\"Somebody famously said 'I would not stand between a premier and a bucket of money', and we've seen the premiers in different debates before where they've been able to negotiate with the Commonwealth, and we'll be able to address those issues,\" he told reporters.\n\nDutton is promising \"integrated economic development zones\" and \"regional deals\" for the seven communities earmarked for reactors, hoping it might help sway some state leaders too.\n\nWith wall-to-wall Labor state governments, the Coalition is preparing for a hostile reaction but it has an ace up its sleeve: constitutional powers of compulsory acquisition.\n\n\"We will work with the owners of the sites, and if we find a situation where we apply a national interest test and we require that site to be part of the national grid, then the legal advice we have is that the Commonwealth has ample powers to compulsorily acquire that, with compensation,\" Dutton said.\n\nDutton reckons the AUKUS deal is a game-changer.\n\nAustralia is acquiring a fleet of nuclear-power (conventionally-armed) submarines from the US and UK, and as part of that deal, will need to find a site to store high-grade nuclear waste.\n\nIn other words, future governments will have to address this issue regardless of whether Australia embraces nuclear power.\n\n\"Would the prime minister have signed an agreement with the United States and the United Kingdom which requires Australia to dispose of the waste from the submarines and the reactors, at end of life, if he thought or she thought that it wasn't safe to do so?\" Dutton asked.\n\nUntil a permanent solution is found, he's flagged storing the waste on the site of the seven proposed nuclear power plants.\n\n\"If you look at a 470-megawatt reactor, it produces waste equivalent to the size of a can of coke each year,\" he said.\n\n\"It's stored on site under our proposal and then at the end of the life of that asset, it's a move to a permanent home.\"\n\nThe regulator, Australia's Radiation, Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA), said \"permanent disposal is considered, internationally, to be the safest long-term management option for radioactive waste\".\n\nIn the US, which has more than 90 nuclear reactors, the waste is stored mainly in dry casks on the locations of current and former nuclear power plants.\n\nARPANSA itself has said it would take between 10 to 15 years to have a nuclear power plant up and running in Australia, due to the need for a significant review of regulation, as well as a skilled workforce.\n\n\"If there was a change in government policy to establish a civil nuclear power program in Australia, ARPANSA notes that further reforms would be required to the national regulatory arrangements to enable its deployment,\" a spokesperson said in a statement.\n\n\"This would include the management of radioactive waste and spent fuel, transport of radioactive materials and for emergency preparedness and response.\"\n\nThis is uncharted territory and challenges abound, but it'll all come to nothing if the Coalition falls at the first hurdle: the next federal election.", "source": {"uri": "abc.net.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian

They will be in National Party seats,\" he said before attacking Labor's renewables approach to green energy.\n\n\"We've been very clear that they will be limited to where existing coal power stations are, so we don't need the extra 28,000 of transmission lines to plug the renewables in which tears up the food security and pushes up the food prices.\"\n\nCritics claimed that Mr Dutton's new position could break Australia's 2015 commitment to the Paris agreement, under which nearly 200 countries said they would aim to limit global heating to well below 2C and attempt to limit it to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.\n\nMr Albanese then called Mr Dutton's stance \"absurd\" and suggested he would be \"walking away from the Paris agreement\".\n\nMr Dutton said this was not the case and he would not be walking away from the Paris agreement.\n\nThe Liberal leader later told 2GB radio: \"It's very hard in opposition - without all the modelling and the advice from government - to put an exact figure on the table.\"\n\nMr Dutton also said Labor's targets, which he previously supported, would \"trash\" the economy.\n\n\"I think it's very clear that we have absolute commitment to Paris and our commitment for net zero by 2050,\" he said.\n\n\"It's important, it doesn't need to be linear, as we've pointed out, and we're not going to send the economy into freefall and families bankrupt

While the final cost has not been revealed, it is estimated that a nuclear power plant in Australia would cost at least $8.5 billion.\n\nJacynta Fa'amau, 350.org Pacific Campaigner says,\n\n\"This nuclear fantasy is a distraction from genuine climate action on Australia's part.

But swapping out one destructive energy source for another is not the answer. A \"Just Transition\" means no one is left behind and from what we've seen, coal workers have not been consulted, communities near proposed plant sites are worried, and the nuclear timeline does not keep us below the target of 1.5 degrees.\"", "source": {"uri": "scoop.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Scoop"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Dutton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peter Dutton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_plant", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear power plant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_(Australia)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coalition (Australia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy_commercialization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy commercialization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canberra", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canberra"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Canberra"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_territories_of_Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "States and territories of Australia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/350.org", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "350.org"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Climate change mitigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_transition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Just transition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris Agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Solar power"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear Pharmacy", "wgt": 25}], "image": "http://img.scoop.co.nz/stories/images/1908/scoop_image.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662030", "eventUri": "eng-9662030", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Canberra"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 21, "textEnd": 28}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

Only it won't be great. Opposition Leader Peter Dutton has announced his plans to campaign for introducing nuclear power into Australia's energy mix at the next election.\n\nThere is so much to unpack surrounding what happens next: the political implications, the policy feasibility of 'going nuclear', what it means for energy prices and emissions reductions targets, as well as what the chances are of it ever happening.\n\nUnfortunately, however, all we are going to get from here is a Seinfeld election campaign about nothing. Labor will focus in on the mother of all scare campaigns, which will be divorced from reality. And the Coalition, even if it can win the election on its big nuclear policy, won't be able to implement it anyway because of opposition across the states.\n\nAustralia is destined to lack the maturity to discuss the viability of nuclear energy free of partisan fights and ideological support or opposition towards the technology, irrespective of whether going nuclear is realistic or not.\n\nSo the central issue for the looming election campaign - nuclear vs renewables - which will likely dominate the next federal election will be a distraction from what the majority of Australians want to focus on: cost of living pressures, the challenges of immigration and housing, as well as how the economy can be reshaped to solve such problems.\n\nPeter Dutton (pictured) is going all in on nuclear power as his solution to energy shortages and to achieve emissions reductions\n\nNonetheless, we need to explain why the nuclear debate is a red herring that will catch so much attention.\n\nLets start with the scare campaign Labor is about to ramp up, coupled with the Coalition's decision to put a massive policy target on its back.\n\nThe last two times an opposition set itself up to impose a massive policy shift if it wins an election was 1993 and 2019. John Hewson's Fightback campaign to introduce a GST and Bill Shorten's attempt to reform negative gearing and franking credits. Both men lost elections judged to be unloseable. Both policy agendas were targeted with brutal scare campaigns.\n\nThe lesson Dutton has decided to ignore is that campaigning on big reforms while in opposition is a recipe for failure.\n\nRead MoreLIVE All you need to know as Peter Dutton goes nuclear\n\nWe know scare campaigns work, not only because of these two historical examples but also because they have worked against incumbents too.\n\nPolitical advertising executives will all tell you until they are blue in the face that negative campaigning is more successful than positive campaigning. Dutton needs to positively explain why his nuclear policy is a good idea, the Labor government only has to go negative and outline all the reasons it is bad policy.\n\nThe worst part of this reality if you're Dutton is that the scare campaign doesn't even have to be true. Just look at the 2016 Mediscare campaign Malcolm Turnbull was up against at the 2016 election.\n\nLabor's claims at the time that Turnbull planned to 'abolish Medicare' were completely untrue and unachievable even if he'd wanted to do it. But that didn't stop Labor campaigning on the issue and voters being frightened.\n\nTurnbull won but only just. The closeness of the election result ended his prime ministership soon enough.\n\nThe degree of difficulty repelling a scare campaign is that much harder in opposition. So why did Dutton embark on the course that he has?\n\nNuclear technology has come a long way, but at the moment there is a ban on introducing it in Australia and the state's would need to get on board to change that\n\nHe can't let the Nationals go off on a campaign arguing against renewables without some sort of alternative to help bring down emissions. Nuclear gives him that. He ideologically believes the state based bans all around the country, as well as nationally, is silly policy, which he's right about. It's policy retrofitted to a 1970s attitude about nuclear power.\n\nDutton also knows that the last (and only) serious independent study analysing nuclear power's viability was handed down back in 2006. It found that yes it is viable, but only if steps to implement the policy shift happen right away.\n\nThat never happened.\n\nSo if you're energy agnostic, as I am, and pro a technology neutral approach to emissions reductions, as I also am, the problem with going nuclear is that Australia may have left its run too late. But we don't know that because we need an up-to-date independent study.\n\nThe problem with Dutton announcing his intention to go nuclear the way that he has is that he really shouldn't be doing so without a proper feasibility study independently and rigorously carried out. What he has commissioned doesn't amount to that level of detailed analysis. You need to be in government first to do that.\n\nThe Labor government won't do it, and for some reason Dutton wants to do more than commit to doing such a study if he wins the next election. Probably because he wants to say he has a tangible solution to energy needs and emissions reductions, not just a thought bubble of doing a study before making a decision.\n\nDutton might also be worried that without details, Labor's scare campaign could go off in any number of directions he hopes today's details will counter. But the scare campaign will do all of that anyway, because as already noted, political scare campaigns aren't rooted in fact.\n\nAn election about nothing on nuclear power is on the cards, just like the Seinfeld show 'about nothing'\n\nEverything from protestors in hazmat suits to images of the Simpsons and the leaky unsafe nuclear reactor that their town of Springwood depended on will come up during the campaign.\n\nLabor will argue that reactors might pop up all over the country, not just in the electorates the Coalition nominates. It will point to international reactor failures, even if the technologies have advanced since then and Australia's topography is very different.\n\nThen we have the final issue which is the reason this whole debate that is about to start in earnest is a waste of time. A campaign about nothing.\n\nThe state's won't approve the policy and the senate probably won't approve the legislation before we even get to the states.\n\nThe Greens look set to control the Senate's balance of power after the next election and they are utterly opposed to going nuclear.\n\nIf state governments stand by their nuclear bans there isn't much the Commonwealth can do to get around that. And state premiers and even Coalition opposition leaders are already lining up to say there is no way they will lift nuclear bans. It might become a constitutional fight.\n\nThis policy is dead on arrival.\n\nThe good news in this should be that the states might be saving Dutton from himself politically, but the dye has been cast already. Even though the fact there is virtually no chance of Dutton's nuclear policy going live - because of the hurdles he has to overcome but can't - should reduce the potency of a Labor scare campaign, it probably won't.\n\nBecause Dutton won't want to accept that he can't get this policy past the states, and it suits the Labor government to pretend that he might to service the potency of its scare campaign.\n\nAt his media conference Dutton noted that Paul Keating once said that it is dangerous to get between a Premier and a bag full of money, suggesting that he can win the states over by bribing them with handouts.\n\nBut it would need to be so much money (or arm twisting via denying Commonwealth grants) that the sheer quantum of what would be required might bankrupt the federal treasury. I can't even reach a lofty financial figure that, in my mind, might get them on board. Politically it also dangerously opens Dutton up to attacks that he is a risky fiscal option to support. Given that is a problem for Labor right now, Dutton risks turning the economic debate around if he keeps suggesting he'll just buy the premiers off.\n\nPolitical scare campaigns work, and Anthony Albanese (pictured) is about to unleash the mother of all scare campaigns against Dutton's nuclear policy\n\nSo here we are as a nation: in need of nuclear but long before now. Unable to overcome the barriers to its consideration, much less implementation.\n\nLabor strategists are utterly convinced their scare campaign against Dutton's nuclear policy will work and at the same time, fix their current political problems.\n\nCoalition strategists are divided as to whether 'going nuclear' will work or not. Some believe they are writing their own political death warrant and never should have gone down this path because the Labor government is teetering on the edge of political oblivion. It wasn't when Dutton first flagged going nuclear.\n\nOthers say modern Australia is ready for this debate and an old fashion scare campaign won't work. We will soon find out.\n\nNo first term government has defeated a first term opposition since 1931, and that election was fought in the midst of The Great Depression. Winning in the circumstances the Coalition is in now was already going to be hard, but the degree of difficulty just went up courtesy of today's policy announcement.\n\nIrrespective of whether going nuclear is good, and irrespective of the failures of this incompetent Labor administration.\n\nOkay, so even though this nuclear debate is ultimately about nothing for the reasons explained, on the assumption anyone has read this far and wants to weigh up the policy pros and cons of going nuclear anyway, to conclude, here they are.\n\nThe pros include that nuclear power helps achieve emissions reductions. They are comparable to renewables in this respect but with base load power renewables currently can't achieve. In theory phasing out coal fired power and introducing nuclear could make a lot of sense.\n\nNuclear power when viable is highly efficient, isn't weather dependent and can operate around the clock. Australia's safe climate and topography makes us ideally suited to housing nuclear reactors.\n\nHigh quality regulatory systems and environmental standards would help ensure safety standards prevent problems. As a well developed nation, we also have the technological capacity to provide the workforces that nuclear reactors require.\n\nAnd Australia has one of the world's largest supplies of yellowcake, the ingredient which fuels nuclear energy.\n\nThe cons are that Australia may have left its run too late, damaging the business case of going nuclear. Even smaller reactors might take more than a decade to build, by which time other technologies have filled the gap they were designed to fill. Turning newly built nuclear power plants into expensive white elephants.\n\nBuilding such controversial technology across political cycles is also a risk. And of course the risk of disasters like those we have seen overseas is always present when nuclear technology is embraced, despite Australia's natural advantages.\n\nAnd with that, let the next round of the climate wars begin!", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._P._Dutton", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "E.

Peter Dutton said he would overturn a 26-year nuclear ban to build seven government-owned reactors on the sites of ageing coal-fired power stations.\n\nCalling an election due within the next 11 months a \"referendum on nuclear\", Dutton said current policies to scale up renewables were ineffective and unreliable.\n\nAustralia's science agency has warned costly nuclear reactors would take at least 15 years to build, while critics have derided Dutton's plan as \"toxic\", \"risky\" and \"economic insanity\".\n\nThe shift to nuclear power would be a sharp departure from the energy policy of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's government, which aims to ramp up renewables and gradually wind back heavily polluting coal-fired power.\n\nUnder the opposition's plan, the first government-owned reactors would come online by 2035 at the earliest, Dutton said.\n\nEventually, five of Australia's eight states and territories would host a nuclear power plant.\n\nPolling released by the Lowy Institute think-tank earlier this month showed Australia's longtime scepticism about nuclear power had \"shifted markedly\", with six-in-10 Australians supportive of some form of nuclear energy.\n\nOver the past decade, an ideological brawl dubbed the \"climate wars\" has dominated Australian politics, repeatedly undermining attempts to reduce carbon emissions.\n\n\"We cannot afford

nuclear power plants would be operational by 2037 under a plan put forward by the nation's opposition leader.\n\nPeter Dutton, leader of the Liberal-National Coalition, on Wednesday announced his plan to build seven nuclear power stations around Australia if elected Prime Minister at the next general election.\n\nDutton said in a statement that the locations offered important attributes for a zero-emissions nuclear power plant, including cooling water capacity, existing transmission infrastructure and local communities with skilled workforces\n\nUnder the plan, the first two plants would be operational by 2037, with the remaining five online by 2050.\n\nREAD MORE: Australia earmarks billions for naval infrastructure, nuke sub\n\nDutton said all the nuclear power plants would be built at locations where there are currently power stations that have closed or are scheduled to do so and that the facilities would be government-owned.\n\nAll the proposed sites are on the Australian mainland, with two each in the eastern states of New South Wales (NSW) and Queensland -- Dutton's home state -- and one each in south-eastern Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia.\n\nDutton said in a statement that the locations offered important attributes for a zero-emissions nuclear power plant, including cooling water capacity, existing transmission infrastructure and local communities with skilled workforces.\n\n\"Every Australian deserves and should expect access to cheaper, cleaner and consistent electricity,\" he said.\n\n\"Of the world's 20 largest economies, Australia is the only one not using nuclear energy, or moving towards it.\"\n\nThe federal government has had a ban on nuclear power in place in 1998 that would have to be overturned for Dutton's plan to go ahead.\n\nQueensland, NSW and Victoria also have their own bans in place, but Dutton said he would work with the state premiers on the issue.\n\nAppearing on state media Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio on Wednesday, PM Anthony Albanese said Dutton's plan overlooks Australia's renewable energy potential\n\nThe governing federal Labor Party as well as the incumbent leaders of all three states have previously ruled out repealing the bans.\n\nAppearing on state media Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio on Wednesday, PM Anthony Albanese said Dutton's plan overlooks

Is it genius or career self-destruction? - ExBulletin", "body": "Peter Dutton has broken every single rule when it comes to unveiling radical politics as opposition leader, tearing up the script and gambling with his party's chances at the next election with his nuclear policy.\n\nIf he can pull it off and convince enough voters that his plan for an Australian nuclear future is feasible and preferable, it will be the most unorthodox approach we've seen from an opposition leader in recent memory. It will rewrite our understanding of how modern politics works and reshape Australia.\n\nDutton has just put a target on his back, and many of his state and even federal colleagues are scratching their heads trying to figure out what the bigger strategy is here. Is cunning genius or political self-destruction longer?\n\nFor months, reporters have been asking when and why the nuclear policy announcement was being delayed. Senior Coalition figures informed me that the opposition, knowing full well that Labor and others would throw everything to tear it apart, were doing their best to deliver a \"bulletproof\" policy that could 'resisted dissection and constant attack.\n\nHowever, when Dutton and his colleagues appeared before the media yesterday, they described a policy with many unanswered questions, including, most importantly, the actual cost of their nuclear proliferation. The coalition says it will reveal the cost in due course. But to leave such an important detail unanswered when the entire debate centers around the cost of energy leaves the policy vulnerable and impossible to critically assess.\n\nIt is amazing and unheard of for a major political party to put forward such a significant and important policy plan without the numbers attached.\n\nA senior Liberal suggested the delay in releasing the figures was to rob Labor of the ability to question the economic basis of policy that you can't pull back and choose the numbers that weren't given. Conventional policy would involve robust independent modeling and accounting disclosures to explain the cost to taxpayers.\n\nTony Barry, director of political research organization RedBridge Research and a former Liberal Party strategist, says the way the policy was announced leaves the Coalition vulnerable to criticism.\n\n\"It's not so much 'bulletproof' as wearing a high vest with a pin on it,\" Barry told me. \"The Coalition has to try to sell its product, while Labor just has to convince people not to buy it, and in that scenario, Labor has the easier job.\"\n\nAmong the many hurdles for the coalition to jump before it can develop a nuclear site will be state premiers, who have lined up against the plan to set up nuclear power plants at seven locations across the country. Peter Dutton says states' concerns were easy to address.\n\n\"Someone famously said, 'I would not stand between the Prime Minister and a bucket of money', and we have seen Prime Ministers in various debates before where they have been able to negotiate with the Commonwealth and will to be able to address those issues,\" he says.\n\nA coalition government would also be needed convince the federal parliament The Senate also lifts restrictions on nuclear power and finds a solution to nuclear waste. It will also have to build a nuclear workforce from scratch.\n\nIs it accessible? It would be a big departure from the usual Australian way of doing business.\n\nAnd then there is the issue of social license. Communities will need to get on board and provide support to build nuclear facilities in their neighborhood. The coalition says polls in some of these seats show support, if narrow.\n\nA survey published by the Lowy Institute Earlier this month out of 2,000 voters showed 61 per cent said they supported Australia including nuclear generation in its energy mix. Public opinion towards nuclear power in Australia has shifted over time. A significant minority (37 percent) \"somewhat\" or \"strongly\" oppose it. Those who \"strongly support\" nuclear power generation (27 percent) outnumber those who \"strongly oppose\" it (17 percent).\n\nBut on the issue of communities' rights to raise objections, nationalists were yesterday at odds.\n\nNationals leader David Littleproud contradicted his deputy, Perin Davey, who said that, \"if a community is absolutely determined then we will not continue\". But the Nationals leader later said Davey's claim was not \"correct\".\n\n\"Peter Dutton and David Littleproud, as part of a coalition government, are prepared to make tough decisions in the national interest. We will be consulting and making plenty of announcements.\"\n\nLoading\n\nPart of the motivation for this massive climate pivot is opposition to the spread of renewables. Given the controversy over poles and wires and their proliferation on the grounds that some communities don't want them, it seems likely that other communities will be pushed to accept the core.\n\nThe coalition is right to note some questions about the pace and cost of renewables deployment. But it's a big step to go from finding tepid support for renewables to assuming there will be full support for nuclear in the community.\n\nIf we accept that community opposition to the idea of nuclear is softening, though we cannot be sure by how much, then the struggle turns to cost.\n\nWill the Coalition be able to convince the public that nuclear will really give them cheaper bills? On this main issue, evidence has not been provided.\n\nTony Wood of the Grattan Institute says there are many unanswered questions about the Coalition's nuclear policy.\n\n\"This is such a fundamental change in direction that the opposition must provide a more compelling case than we might normally ask of opposition parties,\" he says.\n\n\"Everything we have so far says nuclear would be much more expensive. If the opposition gave a firm cost figure (even an order of magnitude) then others, including the Labor government, could compare it to plan A, which in itself is not free.\"\n\nWood says there's also a timing problem (as with Labour's 82 per cent renewables plan), which needs the shutdown of coal to match the start of nuclear.\n\n\"There seems to be a big gap here and it's not clear how the opposition plans to fill it.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nAn unusual part of the opposition's proposal is for the nuclear plants to be government owned and operated.\n\n\"Putting aside Labour's unusual position of pushing private capital and the Coalition pushing public capital, there are no numbers to back up the price claims,\" says Wood. \"I'm pretty sure that Dutton's claim that the high prices are due to Labour's renewables policies is simply wrong. Prices are coming down slightly from 1 July and they've gone up over the last two years for reasons that have little to do with renewable resources.\"\n\nHe added: \"If we abandon plan A, what will the opposition do about the emissions that will occur between now and when nuclear is in place?\"\n\nChris Bowen, the climate change and energy minister, branded Dutton's nuclear plan a \"dangerous nuclear hoax\" that raised more questions than answers.\n\nDutton says he is ready for the \"mother of all scare campaigns\" and welcomes a referendum on his nuclear plan.\n\nSo we are now in a new phase of the climate wars: the stakes are high for both Labor and the Coalition, and the debate will quickly move from atmosphere to detail.\n\nTony Barry points to a statistic he says should frame our thinking. When the debate on the Zeri referendum began, support was around 65 percent; by the time Australians voted, it was 39 percent.\n\nCampaigns matter, goodwill can be wasted.\n\nThere will now be months of debate about the merits of this big and controversial idea. Answers will be of great importance.\n\nPatricia Karvelas is the host of RN Breakfast and co-host of the Party Room podcast.

The parties have not gone to an election with the same carbon reduction policies since 2007.\n\n\"I'm very happy for the election to be a referendum on energy, on nuclear, on power prices, on lights going out, on who has a sustainable pathway for our country going forward,\" Liberal Party leader Peter Dutton told reporters.\n\nAustralia\u00b4s then defense minister Peter Dutton addresses Parliament House in Canberra (Rod McGuirk/AP)\n\nSeven government-owned reactors would be built on the sites of ageing coal-fired electricity plants in five of Australia's six states, Mr Dutton said.\n\nThe first two would be built from 2035 to 2037 and the last in the 2040s. The estimated costs would be announced at a later date, he said.\n\nThe current centre-left government has rejected nuclear power generation in Australia as too expensive. Too many coal-fired generators would have been decommissioned before nuclear power could fill the gap.\n\nClimate change and energy minister Chris Bowen accused the Liberal Party of serving Australia's coal and gas industry lobbies.\n\n\"It's not really an announcement. We know that Mr Dutton wants to slow down the rollout of renewables and he wants to introduce the most expensive form of energy that's slow to build,\" Mr Bowen told reporters.\n\n\"But today, we've seen no costs, we've seen no gigawatts, we've seen no detail. This is a joke. It's a serious joke because it threatens our transition\" from fossil fuels,\" Mr Bowen added.\n\nMr Bowen's Labor Party came to power in the 2022 elections, promising deeper cuts to Australia's greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 than the previous coalition government had committed to.\n\nThe previous Liberal Party-led government promised to reduce emissions by between 26% and 28% below 2005 levels by the end of the decade.\n\nLabor promised a 43% reduction, and the Parliament enshrined that target in law, creating difficulties for any future government that wanted to reduce it and offering certainty for investors.\n\nMr Dutton has ruled out announcing a new 2030 target before the next election. However, the major parties have agreed on a net-zero emissions target by 2050.\n\nMr Dutton said Labor could not reach its 2030 target with a policy toward relying solely on renewable energy.\n\nA Liberal Party-led government would use nuclear power, renewable energy sources and \"significant amounts of gas\", Mr Dutton said.\n\n\"I want to make sure that the Australian public understands today that we have a vision for our country to deliver cleaner electricity, cheaper electricity and consistent electricity,\" he added.\n\nAustralia has historically been one of the world's worst greenhouse gas emitters on a per capita basis because of its heavy reliance on abundant reserves of cheap coal and gas.\n\nThe constant conflict between the major parties over the past 17 years on how to reduce emissions led to a carbon tax introduced by a Labor Party government in 2012 being repealed by a Liberal Party-led government in 2014.\n\nAustralia's only reactor has produced nuclear isotopes for medical use in the Sydney suburb of Lucas Heights since 1958.\n\nMr Dutton said the country could only now consider introducing atomic power generation because the major parties had agreed in 2019 to the AUKUS partnership with the United States and Britain, which will deliver Australia a fleet of submarines powered by US nuclear technology.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType":

If we just dumped all of this information out at once, people wouldn't be able to consume it,\" Mr Dutton told 2GB.\n\n\"So we've deliberately taken it step by step.\"\n\nTheNightlyGet in front of tomorrow's news for FREE\n\nJournalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion.\n\nREAD NOW\n\nOn Wednesday, the Coalition unveiled plans to build seven nuclear power plants by 2050 with the first reactor slated to be operational in just over a decade in a move designed to deliver cheaper, zero-emissions and reliable power supply.\n\nNED-12332-The Coalitions-proposed-nuclear-power-stations\n\nContrasting with Labor's approach which will be largely reliant on renewable energy, Mr Dutton called for Australians to have an \"adult conversation\" on the merits of nuclear energy.\n\n\"I honestly believe it's in our country's best interest and we have the ability to set ourselves up economically for generations to come,\" Mr Dutton said.\n\n\"What we're proposing now shows a very stark contrast to the intermittent power and the continued increases in costs and blackouts and brownouts that will feature in the coming years under Labor policy.\"\n\nA recent report from Australia's peak scientific body CSIRO estimated that building a large-scale nuclear power plant in Australia would cost approximately $8.5bn and take at least 15 years to deliver, longer than the Coalition's 10-year timeline.\n\nResponding to the Coalition's intervention, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese labelled the proposal a \"fantasy\" which \"didn't make sense\".\n\n\"There's no costings, there's no serious time frame, there's no proportion of how much nuclear will be as part of their energy system, there's no details on what type of reactor,\" he said.\n\nThe Prime Minister also took aim at the Coalition's lack of community consultation, arguing it was unclear whether they would ignore the regional communities affected if they pushed back against hosting a nuclear power plant.\n\n\"Are these seven sites going to get nuclear reactors imposed on them, must be said, sometime two decades away?\" he said.\n\n\"Is the consultation process just going through the motions?

Secondly, it takes a lot of time and we don't have a day to wait, and I don't think NSW consumers can pay anymore when it comes to energy prices,\" he said.\n\n\"The last estimate I saw was that nuclear power generation in this state to replace coal-fired power would cost between $70 to $200bn. Who are they going to send that bill to?\"\n\nMr Minns said NSW would continue to prioritise investment into renewable energy, which aims to create at least 12 gigawatts of renewable energy and two gigawatts of long-duration storage by 2030.\n\nA sudden transition to nuclear energy would also threaten the $30bn of private capital investment in renewable energy, with Mr Minns labelling Mr Dutton's policy as a \"sovereign risk\".\n\n\"If all of a sudden you were to introduce nuclear power, that investment is at real risk, and I think that's a sovereign risk for energy and particularly for the narrow path we have to walk to revolutionise our energy sectors in the state.\"\n\nHis concerns were echoed by his fellow Labor premiers in Victoria and Queensland.\n\nVictorian Premier Jacinta Allen also lashed Mr Dutton's nuclear policy and vowed to stand with the Gippsland community.\n\n\"This is the Liberal Party solutions to the challenges of transitioning our energy mix in this country,\" he said.\n\n\"They want to bring more expensive, more risky, more toxic energy solutions to the people of this country. We won't stand for that. We absolutely will not stand for that.\"\n\nShe also called on the state opposition, including Victorian Opposition Leader John Pesutto, to denounce the policy.\n\n\"So unlike the Liberal and National parties who have abandoned time and again the Gippsland community, we will stand with them, we will support them in fighting against this proposal to bring toxic and risky nuclear reactors to the beautiful Gippsland community,\" she said.\n\n\"The question is will their state Liberal National Party representatives also do this?\"\n\nHistorically, Queensland Premier Steven Miles, who will face an election in November this year, has also dudded nuclear energy as financially untenable despite support from the state opposition.\n\n\"What we know about those nuclear reactors is that they will be much more expensive. As much as five times more expensive for your household power bills,\" he said in a May press release.\n\n\"We also know that as a result of those reactors, future generations of Queenslanders will have to manage nuclear waste forever.\"\n\nMr Dutton said he would be open to working with premiers in a \"constructive way\" if the Coalition was reinstalled at the next yet-to-be-announced federal election.\n\n\"As you know, somebody famously said I would not stand between the Premier and a bucket of money, and we've seen the premiers in different debates before where they've been able to negotiate with the Commonwealth and will be able to address those issues,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "news.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "News.com.au"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Is his nuclear policy cunning genius or political self-destruction?", "body": "Peter Dutton has broken every single rule when it comes to unveiling radical policy as opposition leader, tearing up the script and gambling with his party's chances at the next election with his nuclear policy.\n\nIf he can pull it off and convince enough voters that his blueprint for an Australian nuclear future is feasible and preferable, it will be the most unorthodox approach we've seen from an opposition leader in recent memory. It will rewrite our understanding of how modern politics works and radically Australia.\n\nDutton has just placed a target on his back -- and many of his state and even federal colleagues are scratching their heads trying to work out what the larger strategy here is. Is it cunning genius or the longest political self-destruction?\n\nFor months journalists have been inquiring about when and why the nuclear policy announcement was being delayed. Senior Coalition figures informed me that the Opposition -- knowing full well that Labor and others would throw everything at pulling it apart -- were doing their most comprehensive piece of work to deliver a \"bullet proof\" policy that could withstand dissection and sustained attack.\n\nYet when Dutton and his colleagues stood up before the media yesterday, they outlined a policy with many questions unanswered -- including, most crucially, the actual cost of their nuclear rollout. The Coalition says it will reveal the cost down the track. But to leave unanswered such a crucial detail when the entire debate is centred around the cost of energy leaves the policy vulnerable and impossible to critically assess.\n\nIt is stunning and unheard of for a mainstream political party to put forward such a significant and consequential policy blueprint without the numbers attached.\n\nOne senior Liberal suggested the delay in releasing the figures was to rob Labor of the ability to question the economic basis of the policy -- you can't pull and pick apart numbers that haven't been provided. Conventional politics would involve the unveiling of modelling and robust independent accounting to explain the cost for taxpayers.\n\nTony Barry, the director of political research organisation RedBridge Research, and a former Liberal Party strategist, says the way the policy had been announced made the Coalition vulnerable to criticism.\n\n\"It isn't so much 'bullet proof' but rather wearing a high-vis vest with a bullseye on it,\" Barry told me. \"The Coalition has to try and sell its product while Labor only has to convince people not to buy it, and in that scenario Labor has the easier job.\"\n\nAmong the many hurdles for the Coalition to jump before it can even develop a nuclear site will be the state premiers, who have lined up against this blueprint to establish nuclear power plants at seven locations across the country. Peter Dutton says the states' concerns were easy to deal with.\n\n\"Somebody famously said, 'I would not stand between the premier and a bucket of money', and we've seen the premiers in different debates before where they've been able to negotiate with the Commonwealth and will be able to address those issues,\" he says.\n\nA Coalition government would also have to convince federal parliament -- the Senate too -- to lift restrictions on nuclear power and find a solution for nuclear waste. It would also have to build a nuclear workforce from scratch.\n\nIs it achievable? It would be a big departure from the usual way Australia does business.\n\nAnd then there's the question of social license. Communities would need to get on board and provide support to build nuclear facilities in their neighbourhood. The Coalition says polling in some of these seats shows that there is support -- even if it's tight.\n\nA poll released by the Lowy Institute earlier this month of 2,000 voters showed 61 per cent said they supported Australia including nuclear generation in its energy mix. Public opinion towards nuclear power in Australia has shifted over time. A significant minority (37 per cent) \"somewhat\" or \"strongly\" oppose it. Those who \"strongly support\" nuclear power generation (27 per cent) outnumber those who \"strongly oppose\" it (17 per cent).\n\nBut on the question of the rights of communities to raise objections, the Nationals were at odds yesterday.\n\nNationals leader David Littleproud contradicted his deputy Perin Davey, who said that, \"if a community is absolutely adamant then we will not proceed\". But the Nationals leader later said Davey's claim was \"not correct\".\n\n\"Peter Dutton and David Littleproud, as part of a Coalition government, are prepared to make the tough decisions in the national interest. We will consult, and we will give plenty of notice.\"\n\nPart of the motivation for this massive climate pivot is the opposition to the rollout in renewables. Given the controversy on poles and wires and their rollout on the basis that some communities don't want them it seems a stretch that other communities would be pushed to accept nuclear.\n\nThe Coalition is right to observe some questioning of the pace and cost of the renewables rollout. But it's a big leap to go from detecting softening support for renewables to assuming there will be full-blown support of nuclear in the community.\n\nIf we accept that community opposition to the idea of nuclear is softening -- although we can't be sure of how much -- then the fight shifts to cost.\n\nWill the Coalition be able to convince the public that nuclear will really give them cheaper bills? On this pivotal question the evidence has not been provided.\n\nTony Wood from the Grattan Institute says there are many unanswered questions about the Coalition's nuclear policy.\n\n\"This is such a fundamental change in direction that the Opposition needs to provide a more compelling case than we might normally demand of opposition parties,\" he says.\n\n\"Everything we have so far says nuclear would be much more expensive. If the Opposition provided a supportable cost figure (even order-of-magnitude) then others, including the Labor government can compare that with Plan A, which itself is not cheap\".\n\nWood says there is also a timing problem (as with Labor's 82 per cent renewables plan) which needs the coal shutdown to align with the nuclear startup.\n\n\"There would seem to be a big gap here and it's not clear how the Opposition is planning to fill it.\"\n\nAn unusual part of the Opposition's proposal is that the nuclear plants would government-owned and operated.\n\n\"Putting aside the unusual position for Labor to be pushing private capital and the Coalition pushing public capital, there are no numbers to support the price claims,\" Wood says. \"I am pretty sure that Dutton's claim that high prices are down to Labor's renewables policies is just wrong. Prices are coming down a tad from July 1 and they went up over the last two years for reasons that had little to do with renewables.\"\n\nHe added: \"If we abandon Plan A, what will the Opposition do about the emissions that will occur between now and when the nuclear is in place\".\n\nChris Bowen, the minister for climate change and energy, labelled Dutton's nuclear plan as a \"risky nuclear scam\" that raised more questions than answers.\n\nDutton says he is ready for \"the mother of all scare campaigns\" and welcomes a referendum on his nuclear plan.\n\nSo we are now in a new phase of the climate wars: the stakes are high for both Labor and the Coalition and the debate will quickly move from the vibe to the detail.\n\nTony Barry points to one statistic that he says should be framing our thinking. When the Voice referendum debate started support was around 65 per cent; by the time Australians voted it was 39 per cent.\n\nCampaigns matter, good will can be squandered.\n\nThere will now be months of discussion about the merits of this big and controversial idea. The answers will matter enormously.", "source": {"uri": "abc.net.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Small mercy indeed.\n\nIt bears repeating that Dutton has undertaken a sizeable risk, on a par with John Hewson's release of Fightback! more than a year before the 1993 election.\n\nA key difference between then and now is that, at 650 pages, Fightback! contained an extraordinary amount of detail, allowing it to be skewered by Paul Keating.\n\nIt will further increase growing concerns inside Labor that it is the Coalition leader who has set the agenda.\n\nDutton's nuclear plan is light on detail. He revealed the proposed sites for five large-scale reactors and two small modular reactors, with a rough aim to have the first one running by either 2035 or 2037.\n\nAll would be government-owned, using the same model as the Commonwealth's Snowy Hydro Limited, but that's pretty much it.\n\nAnother more recent comparison is then-Labor leader Bill Shorten unveiling so much policy before the 2019 election, including franking credits and an uncosted climate policy, that it cost him the Lodge.\n\nBoth 1993 and 2019, however, were considered \"unlosable\" elections for Hewson and Shorten. This time, Dutton has nothing to lose.\n\nUnderstandably, the government zeroed in on Dutton's lack of costings and pointed to examples overseas where large-scale power stations were costing tens of billions of dollars to build.\n\nBut Dutton and his energy spokesman, Ted O'Brien, were quick to assure full costings - which would include a business case that would ameliorate the build costs - would be released before the election, as would the Coalition's plans for renewables, gas and batteries.\n\n\"Storage will be important,\" says O'Brien.\n\nThey are implying that people should reserve their judgment until the full policy, of which nuclear will be a key but not the sole component, is released.\n\nDutton is advancing his strategy in three stages.\n\nFirst, how to deal with nuclear waste, was done for him when Labor embraced the AUKUS pact and committed to setting up a high-level waste repository in Commonwealth land.\n\nThe second came on Wednesday when the object was to confirm the sites. Given the stigma that has been attached to nuclear power, it's always the easiest aspect of a scare campaign, and Labor was gaining traction with memes of pristine coastal landscapes being blighted by giant cooling towers.\n\nOn this front, Dutton as a minister, learnt the lesson in the run-up to the 2007 election when John Howard examined the feasibility of nuclear power by asking nuclear physicist and businessman Ziggy Switkowski to undertake a review.\n\nUltimately, Howard baulked at following through due to internal misgivings by climate-sceptical colleagues, and due to a very successful scare campaign led by a young shadow environment minister named Anthony Albanese, who produced maps showing the east coast festooned with nuclear power stations.\n\nThe Coalition polled the communities around the planned sites for its seven reactors and said support in all seven was above 50 per cent, with the highest being 60 per cent. Not overwhelming but better than expected, said a source.\n\nThis was backed by focus group research, the outtakes from which included \"these communities are used to having energy in their backyard, and shifting from coal to nuclear isn't difficult for them to consider\".\n\n\"They are worried about what happens when the coal plants close. These areas need industry. They don't understand how they will have jobs in solar or wind.\"\n\nThat's not to say it won't be difficult. Significant objections have already arisen in the West Australian town of Collie, the proposed site of a small modular reactor.\n\nNationally, Labor MPs are distributing memes of three-eyed fish to demonise nuclear energy, but Dutton believes this will fail.\n\nAfter all, South Australian Labor Premier Peter Malinauskas says his only concern with Dutton's proposal is the potential cost, not the technology.\n\nDutton believes that having neutralised as best as possible fears over waste and sites, the third and final stage will be to make it all about cost of living, and that will come when the costings are released. Because that is what the election will be all about.\n\nThe suggestion is that these costings will purport power prices to be cheaper than under Labor's model, once the thousands of kilometres of transmission infrastructure that Labor's plan will require are factored in.\n\nThe CSIRO argued the opposite in its GenCost report released last month, but O'Brien contends the CSIRO's assumptions were flawed because they understated both the life-span and operating frequency of the power plants.\n\nSwitkowski, who was consulted by Dutton before the plan was released, believes nuclear is feasible as part of the energy mix, and that the opposition leader was right to relate it to climate change.\n\nHis 2006 report concluded nuclear power would be 20 per cent to 50 per cent more expensive than coal-fired electricity, meaning it would not be viable without a price on carbon and the support of government subsidies.\n\nMuch has changed since then.\n\n\"There is no reason I can think of as to why it should be so uniquely difficult to build more nuclear reactors,\" Switkowski said.\n\nHe and O'Brien agree with the CSIRO's build cost estimates of $8.6 billion for large reactors and around $3 billion for an SMR.\n\nSwitkowski said the power plants could be successfully monetised and ultimately taxpayers would be better off.\n\nOnce up and running, they could be privatised, or the government could retain full ownership, or an equity stake.\n\nInevitably, all these arguments and more will be ventilated over coming weeks and months, which suits the Coalition fine.\n\nIt will further increase growing concerns inside Labor that ever since last month's federal budget, the Coalition leader has set the agenda.\n\nAnd hope as they might, he's not going to eat an onion.", "source": {"uri": "afr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian Financial Review"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fightback!_(policy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fightback!

scrutinised", "body": "Coalition promises that nuclear power will make for cheaper electricity prices don't stack up, according to a senior researcher who says there was no evidence anywhere in the developed world to suggest new reactors were lowering costs.\n\nDylan McConnell, a University of NSW energy analyst, said the federal opposition's assertions that nuclear plants could be up and running in Australia by the middle of next decade were unrealistic.\n\nIn a long-awaited announcement, the Coalition yesterday unveiled its plans for nuclear energy in Australia as part of efforts to decarbonise the economy by 2050.\n\nOpposition Leader Peter Dutton revealed the Coalition wanted to build seven reactors across the country on the site of former or retiring coal-fired power stations.\n\nOf these, large-scale reactors would be built in Queensland, NSW and Victoria, while so-called small modular units would be constructed in South Australia and Western Australia.\n\nThe plants would be owned and operated by the federal government.\n\nDr McConnell said there was merit to the idea that Australia should \"leave the door open\" to the use of nuclear power in future, but it was stretching credulity to argue it would lower power bills.\n\nHe said there was nowhere in the developed world that had built a nuclear reactor since the start of the century without incurring significant cost and time blowouts on the construction.\n\nAs a consequence, he said the electricity generated by those plants -- in countries from the US to Finland and the UK -- was or would be expensive by Australian standards.\n\nTed O'Brien, the opposition's energy spokesman, pointed to the Canadian province of Ontario to argue that nuclear power was delivering relatively cheap electricity to households.\n\nBut Dr McConnell said the wholesale cost of nuclear in Ontario -- at $110 a megawatt hour -- was comparable to or higher than the wholesale cost of energy across much of Australia.\n\nIf retail electricity prices were relatively low in Ontario, he said, it had little to do with cheap nuclear power and arguably more to do with other factors such as low poles-and-wires costs.\n\nWhat's more, he said the cost of nuclear power in Ontario reflected the nuclear plants had been running for a long time and had largely paid off their debts.\n\nThis, he said, meant its costs were likely to be far lower than for any new plant such as Hinkley Point C in England, where the government had agreed to buy power at $237MW/h for decades.\n\nSimilar high costs had blighted new nuclear plants in other developed countries, including the US, he said.\n\n\"The central claim (by the Coalition) seems to be that a nuclear-powered future will lower costs to Australian consumers,\" Dr McConnell said.\n\n\"And that doesn't really bear up to any sort of scrutiny.\n\n\"They point to the Ontario power grid as having lower retail electricity prices.\n\n\"The reality is that their wholesale cost of nuclear power is actually higher than many regions in Australia.\n\n\"So it's an absolute stretch to say that this will result in lower electricity prices, and certainly not on time frames that anyone will appreciate.\"\n\nUnder the Coalition's plan, the first nuclear plant would be a small modular reactor and it would be operational by 2035.\n\nNo small modular reactors currently operate in developed countries despite significant efforts to develop the technology.\n\nThe country to most recently establish a nuclear energy industry from scratch was the United Arab Emirates, an authoritarian regime that took 13 years to build its first reactor.\n\nMr Dutton said the policy put a sharp difference between the Coalition and Labor government, which has a target for Australia to produce 82 per cent of its electricity from renewable sources by the end of the decade.\n\nRobert Barr, a power industry veteran and member of lobby group Nuclear for Climate, welcomed the announcement, saying it was \"a very good first step\".\n\nDr Barr said trying to plug too much variable wind and solar power into the grid would ultimately run into limitations that nuclear power could overcome by being available around the clock.\n\n\"With a long-term nuclear plant ... it'll bring back some base-load capability that was provided by coal, which transition out of the system,\" Dr Barr said.\n\n\"And it can be integrated really well with wind and solar if you get the right balance.\"\n\nHe said the intermittent nature of solar and wind power made it hard to constantly match supply and demand all the time in a cost-effective way.\n\nHe argued the full costs of underpinning so much variable renewable energy -- through batteries, transmission lines and pumped hydro plants -- would likely be exorbitant.\n\nTo that end, he said nuclear plants that complemented green energy could be a cheaper and better alternative, provided they were able to run at or near full capacity most of the time to maximise their efficiency.\n\nAs things stood, Dr Barr argued, there would eventually be so much wind and solar power on the system that huge amounts of electricity would need to be wasted -- or curtailed -- during periods of abundance to avoid overloading the system.\n\n\"What the Coalition policy can do is work towards an optimum mix,\" Dr Barr said.\n\n\"If they do it well, they can drive down the cost of electricity from where we are at the moment.\"\n\nFor Dr McConnell, though, the opposition's nuclear plan fell flat in a key respect -- it would do nothing to help Australia manage the rapid retirement of its \"ancient\" fleet of coal plants.\n\nAccording to Dr McConnell, the suggestion by the Coalition that gas-fired power could help fill in the blanks as coal plants shut down ignored the structural shortage of supplies in the market.\n\n\"We have a very ancient fleet of existing coal-fired power stations that are rapidly approaching retirement,\" Dr McConnell said.\n\n\"And so we have to replace their output and capacity quick smart, plus the need to actually reduce emissions.\n\n\"They have two key drivers affecting dynamics in the industry at the moment. And the nuclear policy doesn't really address either of those. The timescale doesn't match.\"\n\nOn top of this, he said any gas that was used was almost certain to be expensive regardless of whether it was developed domestically or imported from overseas.\n\n\"That's not a cheap proposition,\" he said.\n\n\"Developing new gas -- assuming that's what they would want to or need to do -- that is not cheap. That would also add cost to electricity bills as well.\n\n\"So this is not some kind of cost-free exercise just to fill the gap with gas.\"\n\nStephanie Bashir from renewable energy industry advisor Nexa, echoed the comments, saying the Coalition's plan would take decades to deliver and do little to help Australia deal with its current problems.\n\n\"Australia is already powered with 40 per cent renewables, technology that is available now that is attracting significant domestic and international investment,\" Ms Bashir said.", "source": {"uri": "abc.net.au", "dataType": "news", "title":

Dutton named seven proposed sites for nuclear plants after boldly claiming the plan would cost less than Australia's renewable energy development.\n\nNuclear power plants are currently banned in all states and territories in Australia. While the final cost has not been revealed, it is estimated that a nuclear power plant in Australia would cost at least $8.5 billion.\n\nJacynta Fa'amau, 350.org Pacific Campaigner says:\n\n\"This nuclear fantasy is a distraction from genuine climate action on Australia's part. The Coalition claims to have the concerns of Australian people in mind, but we know for a fact that nuclear power is up to eight times more expensive than large-scale wind or solar power. As a Pacific Islander living in Australia, of course I want our government to meet their climate commitments and keep the hopes of the Paris Agreement alive. But swapping out one destructive energy source for another is not the answer. A \"Just Transition\" means no one is left behind and from what we've seen, coal workers have not been consulted, communities near proposed plant sites are worried, and the nuclear timeline does not keep us below the target of 1.5 degrees.\"\n\nAlisi Rabukawaqa, Pacific Climate Warriors Council Elder says:\n\n\"The Pacific has a painful and horrific nuclear history. Australia currently doesn't have a place to store its nuclear waste, and finding a spot has proved difficult. Why gamble on a dangerous industry when they have access to safer solutions like wind and solar? The fact that we share an ocean with this Coalition means that we will have to pay close attention to Australia's elections, and the direction that their energy transition takes.\"\n\n/Public Release.

In the other corner, the Coalition has gone nuclear.\n\nBoth insist their plan is the best way of achieving the holy trinity: cheaper, cleaner and reliable power.\n\nThere are too many unknowns to say, confidently, whether either will achieve it.\n\nWhat we do know is that power prices have risen sharply in recent years, driven largely by Russia's invasion of Ukraine which sent coal and gas prices soaring.\n\nPolitically, this is problematic for a Labor government which was elected on a promise to cut power bills by $275 -- on 2021 levels -- by 2025.\n\nAt least one energy boss has warned power prices are unlikely to fall any time soon because building the wind and solar farms at the scale required to replace coal, together with the batteries needed to store the power, and the new network of transmission lines to distribute that power to consumers will involve tens of billions of dollars' worth of investment.\n\nOpposition leader Peter Dutton has sought to directly link power price rises with the rollout of renewables, but building a fleet of nuclear power plants, from scratch, certainly won't come cheap either.\n\nThe CSIRO has crunched the numbers and estimates building a large-scale nuclear power plant in Australia would cost at least $8.5 billion and produce electricity at roughly twice the cost of renewable sources.\n\nIt noted this cost could only be achieved by building reactors one after the other and warned the first power plant would likely be subject to what's called a \"first of its kind\" premium, which could double the price from\u202f$8.5 billion to $17 billion.\n\nThis is not unique to nuclear power plants, though. It's applied to any technology a country hasn't built before, and we only have to look at the NBN or Snowy 2.0 (which has blown out to $12 billion) to see what could happen.\n\nBut even in the world of big projects, nuclear power stations have among the worst track records for running over time and over cost.\n\nThe Coalition is looking to build five large-scale reactors and two small modular reactors (SMRs), which according to the CSIRO would be even more expensive (mainly because it's new technology that's still being developed).\n\nBut because they'll be located on the site of end-of-life coal-fired power stations, there'd be no need for the new network of transmission lines that's central to Labor's plan.\n\nDutton has said a Coalition government would own these nuclear power stations \"but form partnerships with experienced nuclear companies to build and operate them\".\n\nWhen asked how much that would cost, he was less forthcoming.\n\nNot only for the capital costs, but for the anticipated subsidies too.\n\nDutton is promising \"integrated economic development zones\" and \"regional deals\" for the seven communities and suggested a \"bucket of money\" might help sway some state leaders too. How much? We don't know.\n\nMore than 30 countries are relying on nuclear power to decarbonise their electricity grids but most of these power plants were built before the 1990s and more recent projects have blown out in cost.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates is often put forward of an example Australia could follow. It took just 13 years to connect its first nuclear power plant, and is the only country in the world that has managed to successfully build nuclear from scratch in the last 30 years.\n\nBut from a cost perspective, there are more questions than answers. The cost, in 2018, was stated to be $US24 billion\u202f($36 billion).\n\nProfessor John Quiggin, an economist at UQ, says there's no clarity around what the final project costs are.\n\n\"Everything's kind of opaque. But the high number I've seen - and the high number is usually the right one - is $US30 billion. That's\u202f$50 billion Australian,\" he said.\n\n\"But of course, they had low-paid workers, there's been a fair bit of inflation since they started ... and they have a lot of advantages in siting because they can just plonk the thing in the desert, on the coast somewhere they didn't have to worry about, for example, emergency planning zones, and so forth.\n\nKorea's state-owned power company, which built the first reactor in the UAE, has never released final costings of the project.\n\nLabor is seeking to exploit one of Australia's greatest resources -- endless sunshine and wind.\n\nBy 2030, Labor wants 82 per cent of Australia's power to come from renewables, up from 39 per cent now -- requiring more than doubling of clean energy generation in just six years.\n\nMore than 90 per cent of coal power - the backbone of the power grid that's producing about 60 per cent of our electricity today - is set to be phased out in the next 10 years.\n\nDutton points to modelling by Net Zero -- a partnership between the University of Melbourne, the University of Queensland, Princeton University, and management consultancy Nous Group -- which estimates Australia will need $1.5 trillion in capital investment by 2030 to get there.\n\nLabor's never put a dollar figure on the total cost of the clean energy transition. It has put $20 billion on the table to help fund a new network of transmission lines and it's using taxpayer funds to underwrite new renewable energy projects under its Capacity Investment Scheme.\n\nAccording to the CSIRO, renewables are the lowest cost, new form of electricity generation -- in part because once the projects have been built, they require zero fuel costs.\n\nNuclear proponents argue it's not comparing apples with apples because reactors can last up to 80 years, compared to the 30-year life of a wind farm, and produce reliable power, regardless of the weather.\n\nAgain we have to look overseas.\n\nDutton uses France as an example because 70 per cent of the country's power comes from nuclear and its residents pay far less for energy than neighbouring Germany which relies on a mix of coal and renewables.\n\n\"[France] has got about 70 per cent nuclear in its system, it's the cheapest electricity in western Europe, it's the most stable electricity,\" Dutton said.\n\nThat is largely correct but according to the CSIRO, it's not the full story.\n\n\"While the technology can be identical, electricity generation costs vary widely between countries due to differences in installation, maintenance and fuel costs in each country. Other differences include unknown or known subsidies and different levels of state versus private ownership,\" it states in the latest GenCost report.\n\nNo one can say when, or if, our power bills are going to come down.\n\nWe're in the midst of a complex, once-in-a-century transition to wean ourselves off coal, and decarbonise our economy.\n\nBut given the build time required, if Dutton is trying to convince Australians to back his plan on the basis of affordability, he's asking voters to take a big bet on the future.", "source": {"uri": "abc.net.au", "dataType": "news", "title":

Gladstone's energy future doesn't have to be radioactive!\n\n\"Our community is the industrial powerhouse of the nation.\"\n\nMr. Goodluck said the region had been progressing with the switch to renewables.\n\n\"We don't need or want expensive, radioactive, nuclear energy here,\" he said.\n\nHowever, member for Callide Colin Boyce said the Callide power station would provide a lifeline for the nearby township of Biloela while helping to meet Australia's plan for net zero emissions by 2050.\n\n\"Without transitioning to nuclear, the Callide Power Station is set to close in the future and some 250 jobs will leave that economy, that means less children at the school,\" he said in a statement provided to The Epoch Times.\n\n\"It means less groceries are sold at the store. It means less rate base for the local government authority.\"\n\nMember for Hinkler Keith Pitt, whose electorate sits beside the Gladstone region and Flynn electorate, has been a long-time advocate for nuclear and said renewables would only drive prices up.\n\n\"Intermittent wind and solar is already costing Australian taxpayers billions of dollars in renewable energy certificates and the Albanese government has committed another $40 billion to its green fantasy,\" he told The Epoch Times.\n\n\"That doesn't include the cost of transmission lines and other associated infrastructure needed.\n\n\"Australia will have a nuclear industry with the AUKUS agreement so why wouldn't we use the same technology that goes in a submarine to provide reliable and affordable energy to Australians?\"\n\nIn Victoria, the Latrobe City Council said it recognised the importance of diverse energy sources, but said the community would need to be consulted on all relevant factors.\n\nAs more operating coal-fired power plants get terminated -- including Mount Piper Station, which is set to close in 2040 -- nuclear may serve as an extra option for existing workers.\n\nThere is a skills overlap with existing workers in coal mines, who would be able to be transitioned to working with nuclear without the need for extensive retraining.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com",

Secondly, it takes a lot of time and we don't have a day to wait, and I don't think NSW consumers can pay anymore when it comes to energy prices,\" he said.\n\n\"The last estimate I saw was that nuclear power generation in this state to replace coal-fired power would cost between $70 to $200bn. Who are they going to send that bill to?\"\n\nMr Minns said NSW would continue to prioritise investment into renewable energy, which aims to create at least 12 gigawatts of renewable energy and two gigawatts of long-duration storage by 2030.\n\nA sudden transition to nuclear energy would also threaten the $30bn of private capital investment in renewable energy, with Mr Minns labelling Mr Dutton's policy as a \"sovereign risk\".\n\n\"If all of a sudden you were to introduce nuclear power, that investment is at real risk, and I think that's a sovereign risk for energy and particularly for the narrow path we have to walk to revolutionise our energy sectors in the state.\"\n\nHis concerns were echoed by his fellow Labor premiers in Victoria and Queensland.\n\nVictorian Premier Jacinta Allen also lashed Mr Dutton's nuclear policy and vowed to stand with the Gippsland community.\n\n\"This is the Liberal Party solutions to the challenges of transitioning our energy mix in this country,\" he said.\n\n\"They want to bring more expensive, more risky, more toxic energy solutions to the people of this country. We won't stand for that. We absolutely will not stand for that.\"\n\nShe also called on the state opposition, including Victorian Opposition Leader John Pesutto, to denounce the policy.\n\n\"So unlike the Liberal and National parties who have abandoned time and again the Gippsland community, we will stand with them, we will support them in fighting against this proposal to bring toxic and risky nuclear reactors to the beautiful Gippsland community,\" she said.\n\n\"The question is will their state Liberal National Party representatives also do this?\"\n\nHistorically, Queensland Premier Steven Miles, who will face an election in November this year, has also dudded nuclear energy as financially untenable despite support from the state opposition.\n\n\"What we know about those nuclear reactors is that they will be much more expensive. As much as five times more expensive for your household power bills,\" he said in a May press release.\n\n\"We also know that as a result of those reactors, future generations of Queenslanders will have to manage nuclear waste forever.\"\n\nMr Dutton said he would be open to working with premiers in a \"constructive way\" if the Coalition was reinstalled at the next yet-to-be-announced federal election.\n\n\"As you know, somebody famously said I would not stand between the Premier and a bucket of money, and we've seen the premiers in different debates before where they've been able to negotiate with the Commonwealth and will be able to address those issues,\" he said.\n\nOriginally published as NSW, Victoria, Qld premiers denounce Peter Dutton's nuclear plan\n\nGet the latest news

the Allan government would not repeal Victoria's nuclear ban if the federal opposition takes office and dubbed Mr Dutton's plan a \"fantasy\".\n\nNSW Premier Chris Minns said his state's nuclear prohibition would not be removed under his watch either and suggested the proposal would stymie investment in solar and wind.\n\n\"We've got $30-odd billion of private capital invested in renewable energy,\" he said.\n\n\"If all of a sudden you were to introduce nuclear power, that investment is at real risk.\"\n\nQueensland Premier Steven Miles claimed the prohibitive cost of establishing nuclear energy in Australia would push up power bills.\n\n\"That is not to mention how future generations, my kids, your kids will need to manage dangerous radioactive nuclear waste forever,\" he said in Cairns.\n\nVictorian Liberal Leader John Pesutto said the state coalition had no plans for nuclear, but hasn't ruled out changing his mind.\n\nHe would not be drawn on whether he would lift Victoria's nuclear energy moratorium or if he would stand in the way of Mr Dutton's plan if elected premier in 2026 or if he'll campaign against it at the next federal election.\n\nQueensland Liberal National Party leader David Crisafulli was more definitive, ruling out nuclear energy should his party win the state election in October.\n\n\"We've been very consistent, it's not part of our plan,\" he said. \"Peter knows my position on it and there's no secret about that.\"\n\nWA Energy Minister Reece Whitby said the plan makes no sense.\n\n\"It is a recipe for a massive increases in everyone's household power,\" he said.\n\n\"Nuclear is hugely expensive (and) Peter Dutton is talking about massive taxpayer subsidies of billions of dollars will go on and on and on.\"\n\nWA opposition energy spokesman Steve Thomas said there was a long way to go before nuclear energy would be pumping energy into any grid, especially in his state.\n\n\"I am not frightened of nuclear energy, but it has to stack up economically and there has to be community acceptance,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "perthnow.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Perth Now"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It's a huge cost,\" he said.\n\nThe Grattan Institute's energy and climate change program director, Tony Wood, said the Coalition had not backed up its claim that nuclear generation would be a cheaper option. \"There's nothing in what we've seen so far that would substantiate the claims that it's going to be a certain price at a certain time,\" he said.\n\nWood rejected the Coalition's claim that electricity was expensive today due to Labor's renewable energy policies. \"It's not true,\" he said.\n\nHe said electricity prices leapt 20% last year due to Russia's assault on Ukraine pushing up fossil fuel prices, a lack of available gas, old coal plants having unscheduled outages and extreme weather leading to some coalmines being flooded. He said they had since started to come back down.\n\nWood said the Coalition's climate policy would probably lead to it having to pay coal-fired power plants to stay open longer than planned, a step already being taken by the New South Wales and Victorian governments, and that relying on gas power would be \"more likely to lead to more expensive electricity\".\n\nMcConnell said claims by the Coalition that nuclear power had led to lower prices in other jurisdictions - including Canada and France - were misleading, and irrelevant to the costs that would be faced in Australia. He said both had established nuclear industries decades ago, but the cost of wholesale electricity from nuclear generation in Ontario was still higher than the wholesale cost in some Australian states from new, firmed renewable energy.\n\nMcConnell said it was \"extremely dubious\" that nuclear plants could be built in Australia before 2040, as the Coalition claimed. \"Nuclear is just not able to address the things we need to do in the electricity sector in the timeframes they need to be addressed,\" he said.\n\nWood said this particularly applied to the Coalition's plan to potentially use small modular nuclear reactors, a technology that is not yet proven commercially viable, in South Australia and Western Australia by 2035. \"The timeframe there seems remarkable,\" he said.\n\nThe Coalition wants to build the plants on the site of existing or past coal-fired plants at Tarong and Callide in Queensland, Mount Piper and Liddell in New South Wales, Collie in Western Australia, Loy Yang in Victoria, and near Port Augusta in South Australia.\n\nThe advocacy group Solutions for Climate Australia said the Coalition's nuclear proposal was a \"fantasy\". The group's director, Dr Barry Traill, said its analysis found the Coalition's approach would lead to at least 2.3bn tonnes of heat-trapping carbon dioxide being pumped into the atmosphere as the country used more fossil fuels and less renewable energy in the decades ahead.\n\n\"We can't afford to wait,\" he said. \"Action this decade is critical.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com",

The facts you need to navigate the energy debate", "body": "Teased and speculated for more than two years, Peter Dutton has finally revealed his nuclear power policy.\n\nThere is still a lot we don't know -- the Coalition still hasn't said how much it will cost, how much of the bill taxpayers will foot, or when all the nuclear plants would be built.\n\nBut we do now have seven sites scattered across five states, all of them home to former or soon-to-be-former coal plants.\n\nThat is no coincidence: it will be key to Peter Dutton's pitch to voters that nuclear, not renewable energy, is the smoothest way to replace coal.\n\nIt might sound like a clean switch, but standing in the way are thorny questions of politics, economics, engineering and timing.\n\nWhy has the Coalition opened the floodgates to a nuclear conversation, and what lies ahead?\n\nAustralia is undergoing an energy transition.\n\nThe main reason is to reduce emissions -- both major parties are committed to zero net emissions by 2050, and Labor has legislated a 2030 target consistent with global climate agreements.\n\nBut a secondary reason is that Australia's coal plants are fading fast. Several plants have closed in recent years. Eleven of the 18 coal plants we have left are set to close over the next decade.\n\nAnd those that remain are creaky and increasingly unreliable. Unexpected coal plant closures have been a significant contributor to recent high power prices.\n\nSo far, the main alternatives have been renewable -- solar, wind and hydro power -- and gas, which Labor says will be needed throughout the transition.\n\nBut the pace of the renewable rollout has been slow, something the Labor government has blamed on its predecessor's lack of firm national targets and supporting policies.\n\nThat is something Labor hopes it is changing with its Capacity Investment Scheme, which underwrites renewable projects to improve their commercial viability and provide investors with certainty. Labor points to figures showing that renewables are now rolling out at a record pace.\n\nBut there is still a mountain of work to be done, including new transmission lines and storage capability needed to make renewables work year-round. Labor is just shy of being on track for its 2030 emissions target and local community objections are threatening to obstruct the process.\n\nIt is in that context that the Coalition now proposes nuclear power.\n\nPeter Dutton and Nationals leader David Littleproud say nuclear would be an alternative to renewables, delivering zero-emissions energy on ready-made sites using existing transmission lines, and therefore avoiding the need for the geographical footprint of renewable projects.\n\nThey propose to build on seven sites:\n\nThey are undecided between two types of nuclear power: large-scale reactors, like the ones that have long been operational in Europe, or small 'modular' reactors, an emerging but as-yet unproven technology.\n\nThe distinction is an important one. Large-scale plants are a 'base load' power source, hard to turn on and off so best deployed as primary, constant generators.\n\nConversely, small modular reactors could be more easily switched on and off and so could play a supplementary 'firming' role alongside base load renewables, coal or gas.\n\nThe Coalition says five of the sites could host either large or small, but the sites in WA and SA could only host small.\n\nThis poses the first challenge: even if it's assumed that five large plants and two small plants are built, that would add up to just over 6 gigawatts (GW) of generation capacity. That's compared to 22 GW of coal used currently, and well over 50 GW of generation capacity currently needed for the National Electricity Market (excluding WA).\n\nThat casts doubt over whether nuclear power would alone be a sufficient replacement for coal. The Coalition has sent mixed signals on that front -- for example, David Littleproud said today he believed renewables had a role to play, but also said nuclear was \"visionary\" because it would mean a country \"not covered in solar panels and wind turbines\".\n\nThere would also need to be extensive studies to confirm that the nominated areas are actually suitable. Mr Dutton has pointed out that coal sites have some of the necessary attributes for nuclear, such a proximity to water for cooling.\n\nBut other attributes remain to be seen -- for example, the likelihood of earthquakes in the proposed areas and how this might affect safety.\n\nCloser examination of the sites would also shed light on another unknown: the cost.\n\nAll available evidence suggests it will be expensive. According to CSIRO and the Australian Energy Market Operator's cost study ('GenCost'), large-scale nuclear is more expensive than renewables and small-scale nuclear is dramatically more expensive than anything else.\n\nCoalition politicians have quibbled with the assumptions of that study, but it includes the cost of construction, generation and transmission and is the most detailed study available in the Australian context.\n\nA Coalition business case would need either to come up with a convincing lower number or else argue that the hefty bill is worthwhile.\n\nAnd that bill looks likely to be paid by taxpayers. Despite Shadow Treasurer Angus Taylor's insistence last month that the Coalition would only pursue nuclear if it was \"commercially viable\" and needed \"no subsidies\", the proposal is for the government to own the plants.\n\nThe Coalition has not said who would pay for the construction, but government ownership would generally require partial or full public subsidy -- though the taxpayer could recoup the benefits in future if it retained ownership when the plants turn a profit.\n\nNext there is the question of timing. The Coalition says it could have the first two plants operational between 2035 and 2037 - the former date if it opts for small reactors and the latter date if it opts for large reactors.\n\nThat is more than a decade away, but it still falls short of the timeline suggested in GenCost, which puts the earliest possible date in the 2040s.\n\nEither way, this would represent a very different trajectory for emissions reduction compared to Labor's plans, especially if it is accompanied by a scaling back of renewable energy ambition.\n\nWhile Peter Dutton says he remains committed to net zero by 2050, he has discarded Labor's 2030 target and with it Australia's global climate commitments, dismissing the Paris climate accords as \"Anthony Albanese wanting to be a Parisian.\"\n\nPeter Dutton believes voters will not be troubled by this shift on climate targets. But the move has angered Labor, the Greens and teal independents, which points to difficulties ahead for a future Coalition government to legislate its plan.\n\nNew laws would be needed to remove the current ban on nuclear energy, enact safety regulations and waste disposal arrangements, and establish the financial arrangements for government ownership.\n\nThose would be complicated pieces of legislation likely requiring years of consultation. But they also may struggle to get through the parliament. Even if the Coalition were to win a majority in the House of Representatives, it would need to defy two decades of history to win control of the Senate.\n\nWith the current Senate make-up, it is four shy of a majority even if it could count on right-wing crossbenchers, with Labor and the Greens implacably opposed.\n\nThen there is the question of state laws -- Queensland, NSW and Victoria all have state bans on nuclear power which would also need to be overturned, and so far no major party leader in any state has given Mr Dutton's plan public support.\n\nFinally and most significantly, there is the political question: will voters be happy with nuclear, especially those in seats tapped to host nuclear plants, given six of the seven were won by the Coalition at the last election?\n\nLabor is confident it can tap into community discontent, but the Coalition is confident it can get communities onside by emphasising the jobs associated with nuclear plants and has flagged extensive community consultation.\n\nWhether it will have to offer communities other financial incentives to get them over the line remains to be seen.", "source": {"uri": "abc.net.au", "dataType": "news", "title":

"The battle for nuclear power could play out in court as state leaders revolt against the federal opposition's energy policy.\n\nOpposition Leader Peter Dutton on Wednesday vowed to build seven nuclear power plants in five states if the coalition win the federal election.\n\nBut three of those states have bans on nuclear power and Victoria Energy Minister Lily D'Ambrosio said she would take the issue to court if the Commonwealth tried to force her hand.\n\n\"We have very clear laws in Victoria that date back to 1983; we will not change those,\" she told reporters on Thursday.\n\n\"We will take every step necessary and if that includes legal steps, we'll do that to stop Peter Dutton's fantasy of dumping nuclear energy and nuclear waste in Victoria.\"\n\nThe sites nominated for nuclear plants include Loy Yang Power Station in Victoria, Callide and Tarong in Queensland, Mount Piper at Lithgow in central west NSW and Liddell in NSW's Hunter region.\n\nSmall, modular reactors would also be built at Northern Power Station in Port Augusta and at Muja Power Station, southeast of Perth.\n\nBut NSW Premier Chris Minns maintained he would not lift the state's ban either.\n\n\"If any prospective Commonwealth government was to come in and say 'we're going to knock over local community concerns and pursue nuclear power in the face of objections from every level of government', I think it's bold and I think it's pretty disrespectful,\" he told reporters.\n\nLeaders of both major parties in Queensland are also against nuclear, with Premier Steven Miles threatening to launch his own battle as well.\n\n\"We will use the fact that we own these sites and the transmission networks to stop the (federal opposition's) plans to build nuclear reactors,\" he told ABC.\n\nBut University of Sydney's constitutional law expert Anne Twomey says there are ways the Commonwealth could get around the states' objections.\n\n\"Co-operation is always helpful,\" she told ABC radio.\n\n\"(But) even when states are ideologically opposed to things, the Commonwealth can frequently persuade them to be helpful because they know that, legally, they're not going to win.\"\n\nIn Victoria's case, the federal opposition would likely lure them in with promises of money, Prof Twomey said.\n\nFailing that, it could take the \"nuclear option\" and compulsorily acquire the land needed.\n\nSouth Australia's leader, Peter Malinauskas, said he was not worried about the safety of nuclear power, given nuclear-powered submarines would be built in his state.\n\nBut costs remain a source of concern.\n\n\"If nuclear power was going to make the energy bills of Australians cheaper, then I would support it, but we know it's not,\" Mr Malinauskas told Sky.\n\nEven Tasmania's Resources Minister Eric Abetz, a member of Australia's only Liberal state government, said his state would remain a \"renewable energy powerhouse\".\n\n\"Mr Dutton has put forward a proposal and that is for those on the mainland to consider,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "perthnow.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Perth Now"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

If we just dumped all of this information out at once, people wouldn't be able to consume it,\" Mr Dutton told 2GB.\n\n\"So we've deliberately taken it step by step.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the Coalition unveiled plans to build seven nuclear power plants by 2050 with the first reactor slated to be operational in just over a decade in a move designed to deliver cheaper, zero-emissions and reliable power supply.\n\nContrasting with Labor's approach which will be largely reliant on renewable energy, Mr Dutton called for Australians to have an \"adult conversation\" on the merits of nuclear energy.\n\n\"I honestly believe it's in our country's best interest and we have the ability to set ourselves up economically for generations to come,\" Mr Dutton said.\n\n\"What we're proposing now shows a very stark contrast to the intermittent power and the continued increases in costs and blackouts and brownouts that will feature in the coming years under Labor policy.\"\n\nA recent report from Australia's peak scientific body CSIRO estimated that building a large-scale nuclear power plant in Australia would cost approximately $8.5bn and take at least 15 years to deliver, longer than the Coalition's 10-year timeline.\n\nResponding to the Coalition's intervention, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese labelled the proposal a \"fantasy\" which \"didn't make sense\".\n\n\"There's no costings, there's no serious time frame, there's no proportion of how much nuclear will be as part of their energy system, there's no details on what type of reactor,\" he said.\n\nThe Prime Minister also took aim at the Coalition's lack of community consultation, arguing it was unclear whether they would ignore the regional communities affected if they pushed back against hosting a nuclear power plant.\n\n\"Are these seven sites going to get nuclear reactors imposed on them, must be said, sometime two decades away?\" he said.\n\n\"Is the consultation process just going through the motions?

Dutton has advocated shifting to nuclear energy if his government assumes office after the next elections. However, there has been widespread criticism against his nuclear power plan.\n\nOn Wednesday, Dutton named seven sites for building nuclear power plants, which he stated would be owned by the commonwealth. However, his nuclear power plan has several hurdles such as high cost, lifting state bans on nuclear energy, acquiring lands and meeting the stipulated deadline of completing the plants. He claimed to complete setting up two plants by 2035-2037, which most experts pointed out is not achievable.\n\nMcConnell said gas power is also not cheap when compared with solar and wind energy. \"Gas is not cheap. It's a huge cost,\" he said. He said Australia should explore the option of generating nuclear power, but pointed to global examples like the U.S., Finland and the U.K., where building nuclear plants has been costly and power has been expensive by Australian standards, ABC News reported.\n\nGrattan Institute's energy and climate change program director, Tony Wood, refuted the claim that power was expensive due to renewable energy policies. He added that the Coalition was yet to substantiate their claim nuclear power is cheaper.\n\n\"There's nothing in what we've seen so far that would substantiate the claims that it's going to be a certain price at a certain time,\" he said.\n\nMcConnell countered opposition's energy spokesman Ted O'Brien's argument that Ontario in Canada has been supplying cheap electricity. He stated that the wholesale cost of AU$110 a megawatt hour in Ontario was similar or higher than many areas in Australia. The reason for cheaper power could be due to low poles and wires, he said, and added that nuclear plant in Ontario has been operating for long enough to pay off most of their debts.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times AU"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vidhya_ck@ibtimes.com.au", "name": "Vidhya Ck", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_New_South_Wales", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of New South Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Dutton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peter Dutton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_(Australia)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coalition (Australia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commonwealth of Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilowatt-hour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kilowatt-hour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_plant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear power plant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wind power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ontario"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ontario"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Finland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Finland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 44}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Management", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "wgt": 27}], "image": "https://d.ibtimes.com.au/en/full/1851325/nuclear-power-plant.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662030", "eventUri": "eng-9662030", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

Happy to take that off your hands, I believe there might be a market,' one critic said.\n\n'No information? If you don't know, vote No,' another said.\n\nDuring the Voice campaign, that phrase was constantly used by Coalition politicians during interviews, shared on Liberal party social media pages and even turned into merchandise by the official No campaign.\n\nThe Voice referendum's six-word slogan is once again trending on X, with hundreds of Australians arguing Mr Dutton has not provided enough detail to warrant a mandate to shift to nuclear\n\nThe Yes camp attempted to defuse the sting of the slogan with their own, telling the public 'if you don't know, find out'.\n\nBut Mr Dutton and the No camp argued there was no detail available to 'find out', given many of the specifics weren't to be established until after the referendum result.\n\nNow, Mr Dutton has walked right into a similar trap, failing to provide sufficient answers to several key questions in the nuclear debate.\n\nMr Dutton spoke at length on Wednesday about his plan to open seven nuclear reactors across Australia if he's elected at the next election.\n\nLithgow and the Hunter Valley are the proposed NSW sites, Mount Murchison and Tarong in Queensland and Traralgon in Victoria. Mr Dutton proposes one site in South Australia in Port Augusta, and another in Collie in WA.\n\nEach of the locations are sites of current coal plants due to be shut down or decommissioned.\n\nCritics are now encouraging Aussies to vote against Mr Dutton's plan due to a lack of detail\n\nLabor have already come out swinging against Mr Dutton's proposal, describing it as 'economic insanity' and 'ideological stupidity'\n\nMr Dutton said these would be owned and operated by the government, but he had no answers as to how the government would go about acquiring them, given they're all currently privately owned and some have already been identified as future renewables sites.\n\nBut the primary concern amongst critics and the government is that Mr Dutton did not reveal any costings for the ambitious project.\n\nEnergy Minister Chris Bowen said: 'The reason Mr Dutton didn't release the costs of his nuclear fantasy yesterday is that he knows it would drive up bills. Nuclear is the most expensive form of energy available.'\n\nAnd Labor MP Julian Hill added: 'The biggest con in decades! Peter Dutton wants Australians to pay for his nuclear reactors, and pay more for electricity.\n\n'Nuclear energy is the MOST expensive form of power. He won't even say how many hundreds of billions of your dollars this fantasy would cost.'\n\nThe slogan was a highly effective tool throughout the campaign\n\nThe Yes camp struggled to win over Australians who felt there wasn't enough detail in the proposal\n\nMr Dutton also failed to go into detail about how he intends to win over state Premiers who remain staunchly opposed to nuclear in their backyards.\n\nNuclear reactors are banned in NSW, Queensland and Victoria, and each of the Labor premiers in those states have categorically ruled out overturning that for Mr Dutton.\n\nWhen asked about that hurdle, the Opposition Leader said: 'We'll work with the state premiers, some debate about that I see, as you know, somebody famously said I would not stand between the Premier and a bucket of money.'\n\nRead MoreLIVE How nuclear power plant neighbours could be in for a cash windfall under Dutton's new energy plan\n\nFinally, the government of the day would need a majority in the Senate - or a policy supported by the crossbench - to pass any legislation.\n\nThe Greens are opposed to nuclear energy and will not make any concessions to aid the passage through the chamber.\n\nLabor have already come out swinging against Mr Dutton's proposal, describing it as 'economic insanity' and 'ideological stupidity'.\n\nLabor's Julian Hill became the first Labor MP to utilise Mr Dutton's famous phrase, sharing a picture of a nuclear reactor overlaid with the message, 'don't know? Vote no'.\n\nThe Opposition Leader is already bracing for 'the mother of all scare campaigns' on the back of his announcement.\n\n'We know the Prime Minister and his Government will mount the mother-of-all scare campaigns on zero-emissions nuclear energy,' he said.\n\n'But we believe Australians are up for this discussion and are open-minded about including zero-emissions nuclear technology as part of a balanced energy mix.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Nuclear energy for Australia is an idea whose time has come. Today, we are announcing that a future Federal Coalition Government will introduce zero-emissions nuclear energy in Australia, which has proven to get electricity prices and emissions down all over the world, to work in partnership with renewable energy and gas as part of a balanced energy mix.\"\n\nTheir government would initially develop two projects using either small modular reactors (SMRs) or larger plants such as the AP1000 or APR1400, to be in operation by 2035 if SMR plants are built or 2037 for larger plants if these \"are found to be the best option\". These assets would be owned by the Australian government, but would be built and operated in partnership with \"experienced nuclear companies\".\n\nThe sites identified by the coalition are:\n\nThe sites in South Australia and Western Australia are earmarked for SMRs only.\n\n\"Each of these locations offer important technical attributes needed for a zero-emissions nuclear plant, including cooling water capacity and transmission infrastructure, that is, we can use the existing poles and wires, along with a local community which has a skilled workforce,\" the leaders said. Replacing retired or retiring coal plants would avoid much of the spending that would be needed for a 'renewables-only' system, including new transmission poles and wires, and host communities would also benefit from high paying, multi-generational jobs and other regional economic benefits.\n\nAustralian national science agency CSIRO, in its annual GenCost report, recently estimated the capital cost for Australian deployment of a large-scale nuclear plant to be AUD8665 (USD5775) per kilowatt, and says it is not economically competitive with renewables. Dutton told journalists that the Coalition's plan would come in cheaper than what he said was the AUD1.2-1.5 trillion price of the current Labor Party-led government's renewable-based proposals. \"Our proposal will cost a fraction of that cost. We'll have more to say in relation to the cost in due course,\" he said.\n\nAustralia's Minister for Climate Change and Energy Chris Bowen described the opposition's plan as \"risky\", with no detail, costs or modelling. \"It's too slow, too expensive and too risky for Australia,\" he said on X.\n\nReferring to earlier comments by Bowen, Dutton told journalists he would be happy for the next Australian election - which must take place before 27 September 2025 - to be \"a referendum on energy, on nuclear, on power prices, on lights going out, on who has a sustainable pathway for our country going forward\".\n\nThe Liberal-National Coalition, also known as the LNP, is a long-running alliance of the Liberal Party of Australia, led by Dutton, and the National Party, led by Littleproud.\n\nColin Boyce is the member of parliament for the electorate of Flynn in Queensland, where one of those sites - the Callide Power Station - is situated. He welcomed the announcement, saying such a project would provide jobs and opportunities to the local community while also providing 24/7 reliable baseload power for Central Queensland.\n\n\"Without transitioning to nuclear, the Callide Power Station is set to close in the future and some 250 jobs will leave that economy,\" he said.\n\n\"The Callide Power Station site offers important technical attributes needed for a zero-emissions nuclear plant, including cooling water capacity and transmission infrastructure, that is, we can use the existing poles and wires, along with a local community

scepticism from business groups", "body": "The Coalition's promise to build seven nuclear power plants starting as soon as 2035 has been met with widespread skepticism by Australia's energy sector and industry groups, who have warned about the risks of cost blowouts and destroying private sector investment.\n\nAGL Energy and Origin Energy, two of Australia's largest power producers, also reiterated their concerns about the proposed government intervention.\n\nThe opposition leader, Peter Dutton, announced key details of the nuclear policy on Wednesday, including the location of seven proposed nuclear power plants to be owned by the commonwealth government, a similar model to NBN Co and Snowy Hydro.\n\nFrank Calabria, Origin's chief executive, said time, cost and compatibility would all be challenges of introducing nuclear, particularly if small modular reactors are the starting point. \"I don't think we can see it being scalable for many years, probably well into the next decade,\" Calabria told an energy conference on Wednesday.\n\nAGL, which owns two of the proposed seven sites, re-issued comments from March by its chief executive, Damien Nicks, that nuclear energy was not a part of its plans.\n\nRelated: Peter Dutton names seven potential nuclear power station sites but avoids questions on cost\n\n\"There is no viable schedule for the regulation or development of nuclear energy in Australia and the cost, build time and public opinion are all prohibitive,\" Nicks said.\n\n\"Policy certainty is important for companies like AGL and ongoing debate on the matter runs the risk of unnecessarily complicating the long-term investment decisions necessary for the energy transition.\"\n\nIndustry groups offered mixed views, with the mining sector in favour but others demanding details about how much the opposition thought the seven reactors would cost and what interim measures - and costs - might be needed in the meantime since most of the coal-fired power plants are scheduled to close over the next decade.\n\nGetting the states - and the Senate - to overturn bans on nuclear energy added to the uncertainty.\n\n\"The Coalition's vision needs over time to be fleshed out with more detail such as around cost, viability and timelines, especially given the long delays and cost blowouts in delivering nuclear in other western economies,\" said Innes Willox, chief executive of national employer association Ai Group.\n\n\"With no delivery projected until the middle of the next decade, the proposal does not immediately help with short-term emissions reduction or the cost and reliability of energy in the short term,\" Willox said.\n\n\"The proposition too that the federal government own and operate the bulk of electricity generation in Australia raises some red flags,\" he said. \"If it effectively re-nationalises electricity in Australia, there is a risk that private sector investment gets killed off.\"\n\nHowever, Tania Constable, chief executive of the Minerals Council, supported the plans, saying nuclear energy offered industry \"a crucial pathway ... to reduce emissions cost-effectively while maintaining access to reliable baseload power\".\n\n\"Australia's strong global reputation for non-proliferation and its world-class uranium industry, which includes almost a third of global uranium reserves and supplies around 10% of global uranium used for zero-emissions electricity, positions it well to lead in nuclear energy development,\" Constable said.\n\nKane Thornton, chief executive of the Clean Energy Council, said \"building new reactors would take at least 20 years and cost six times more\" than renewables.\n\nThe policy would \"result in much higher power prices and risk the lights going out as coal power stations continue to close,\" Thornton said, predicting that no community would want a reactor and to share their \"roads with truckloads of nuclear waste\".\n\nMarilyne Crestias, interim chief executive of the Clean Energy Investors Group, said directing resources towards nuclear energy development did not \"align with the urgency of transitioning to cleaner energy sources in a timely and cost-efficient manner\".\n\n\"Given the immense complexities and expenses involved, venturing into nuclear energy projects in Australia now would fall short of our imperative to decarbonise our economy in a timely and cost-efficient manner,\" she said.\n\nTim Buckley, director of thinktank Climate Energy Finance, said Australians would be paying \"a multi-billion dollar 'nukebuilder' tax for generations to come by being forced to front the cash for a national buildout of government-owned nuclear reactors\".\n\n\"Electricity prices would skyrocket as private investment in new replacement capacity is crowded out, resulting in undersupply for the next 15-25 years while we wait for the LNP's nuclear white elephants to arrive,\" Buckley said.\n\n\"The international experience shows that the western nuclear industry is plagued with massive delays and cost blowouts,\" Buckley said, noting the Vogtle nuclear power plant expansion in the US blew out to cost $35bn, while Britain's Hinkley Point C plant has been delayed to 2031 and is on track to cost \u00a333bn pounds ($63bn).\n\n\"There is zero reason to expect Australia would be any different when the risks for us are higher, as we have no history of deployment of nuclear energy generation here,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The parties have not gone to an election with the same carbon reduction policies since 2007.\n\n\"I'm very happy for the election to be a referendum on energy, on nuclear, on power prices, on lights going out, on who has a sustainable pathway for our country going forward,\" Liberal Party leader Peter Dutton told reporters.\n\nSeven government-owned reactors would be built on the sites of ageing coal-fired electricity plants in five of Australia's six states, Mr Dutton said.\n\nThe first two would be built from 2035 to 2037 and the last in the 2040s. The estimated costs would be announced at a later date, he said.\n\nThe current centre-left government has rejected nuclear power generation in Australia as too expensive. Too many coal-fired generators would have been decommissioned before nuclear power could fill the gap.\n\nClimate change and energy minister Chris Bowen accused the Liberal Party of serving Australia's coal and gas industry lobbies.\n\n\"It's not really an announcement. We know that Mr Dutton wants to slow down the rollout of renewables and he wants to introduce the most expensive form of energy that's slow to build,\" Mr Bowen told reporters.\n\n\"But today, we've seen no costs, we've seen no gigawatts, we've seen no detail. This is a joke. It's a serious joke because it threatens our transition\" from fossil fuels,\" Mr Bowen added.\n\nMr Bowen's Labor Party came to power in the 2022 elections, promising deeper cuts to Australia's greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 than the previous coalition government had committed to.\n\nThe previous Liberal Party-led government promised to reduce emissions by between 26% and 28% below 2005 levels by the end of the decade.\n\nLabor promised a 43% reduction, and the Parliament enshrined that target in law, creating difficulties for any future government that wanted to reduce it and offering certainty for investors.\n\nMr Dutton has ruled out announcing a new 2030 target before the next election. However, the major parties have agreed on a net-zero emissions target by 2050.\n\nMr Dutton said Labor could not reach its 2030 target with a policy toward relying solely on renewable energy.\n\nA Liberal Party-led government would use nuclear power, renewable energy sources and \"significant amounts of gas\", Mr Dutton said.\n\n\"I want to make sure that the Australian public understands today that we have a vision for our country to deliver cleaner electricity, cheaper electricity and consistent electricity,\" he added.\n\nAustralia has historically been one of the world's worst greenhouse gas emitters on a per capita basis because of its heavy reliance on abundant reserves of cheap coal and gas.\n\nThe constant conflict between the major parties over the past 17 years on how to reduce emissions led to a carbon tax introduced by a Labor Party government in 2012 being repealed by a Liberal Party-led government in 2014.\n\nAustralia's only reactor has produced nuclear isotopes for medical use in the Sydney suburb of Lucas Heights since 1958.\n\nMr Dutton said the country could only now consider introducing atomic power generation because the major parties had agreed in 2019 to the AUKUS partnership with the United States and Britain, which will deliver Australia a fleet of submarines powered by US nuclear technology.", "source": {"uri": "irishnews.com", "dataType": "news",

Conventional facilities would be operational by 2037 \"if modern larger plants are found to be the best option\".\n\nThe large-scale plants - which would have a capacity of between 1 gigawatt and 1.4 gigawatts - would come online by the middle of the century.\n\nThe Coalition would need to convince state and territory governments to lift bans on nuclear power, and to pass legislation in the federal parliament to end a national ban.\n\nQueensland Premier Steven Miles said on Thursday he would oppose nuclear.\n\n\"The two big problems with this plan is the cost and how the waste will be managed,\" he said.\n\n\"We know this will cost hundreds of billions of dollars and that will mean people's electricity bills will be higher and I'm concerned about the future generations of Queenslanders who will need to manage this dangerous radioactive waste forever.\"", "source": {"uri": "afr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian Financial Review"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

scare campaign ramps up", "body": "Political battlelines are being drawn over the Coalition's new nuclear power push, with Australians receiving the first taste of an expected scare campaign in opposition to the controversial proposal in the run up to the next election.\n\nWithout revealing the multi-billion dollar price tag of its policy, the Coalition on Wednesday unveiled plans to build seven nuclear power plants by 2050, with the first reactor slated to be operational in just over a decade should the party win power.\n\nIn response, Labor politicians and the union movement launched a wave of attack ads against the Coalition's policy, predominantly highlighting the safety risks posed by nuclear energy.\n\nChannelling the imagery of the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant from American cartoon sitcom 'The Simpsons', Labor assistant minister Andrew Leigh shared a manipulated depiction of a three-eyed Blinky Bill standing in front of a nuclear reactor.\n\nThe ACTU took a similar line of attack, providing free stickers to members featuring the Simpsons' character of Blinky, the three-eyed fish, and emblazoned with the tag 'Danger Dutton' alongside radioactive symbols.\n\nSo too did Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan, sharing a doctored image of radiation affected animals in the state's Gippsland region, a proposed site for nuclear reactors under the Coalition's proposal.\n\nSpeaking on Thursday morning, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese also rubbished the Coalition's nuclear power plan, describing it as a \"fantasy\".\n\n\"Instead of 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs', this is 'Peter Dutton and the seven nuclear reactors',\" Mr Albanese told ABC Radio.\n\n\"This is just absurd to have a big build-up for an announcement and then say, 'Oh well, we'll give you the details [later]'.\"\n\nMr Albanese's comparison was circulated in picture form online by Labor backbencher Peter Khalil.\n\nIn a darker representation, the Australian Manufacturing Workers' Union shared pictures of individuals clothed in hazmat suits surrounded by nuclear waste.\n\nThe 1986 explosion at a reactor at Chernobyl in Ukraine and the 2011 meltdown of the Fukushima power plant in Japan have heightened community concerns about the safety of nuclear power, even as the track record of such technology shows it poses minimal danger to civilians.\n\nResponding to Labor's attacks, Opposition Leader Peter Dutton called for a more nuanced debate into the merits of his proposed nuclear rollout.\n\n\"From the Labor Party we get them posting cartoon figures and the rest of the nonsense so hopefully we can have an adult conversation because I honestly believe it's in our country's best interest,\" Mr Dutton told Nine Radio.\n\n\"We have the ability to set ourselves up economically for generations to come,\"\n\nA recent report from Australia's peak scientific body CSIRO estimated that building a large-scale nuclear power plant in Australia would cost approximately $8.5bn and take at least 15 years to deliver, longer than the Coalition's 10-year timeline.\n\nAcross advanced economies, the use of nuclear power has begun to fade, with little new investment due to significant costs and lengthy construction times required to build reactors.", "source": {"uri": "news.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "News.com.au"}, "authors": [],

No nuclear power plants will ever be built here. Avoiding questions about the exorbitant costs, electorate opposition, absence of technology and radioactive waste, Dutton is exploiting those worried about climate change and energy costs who haven't the time or ability to question his remedy. Unfortunately, this will then be followed by countless committees to look into the best way to implement such a \"ground-breaking\" and \"important\" policy for another election cycle or two until, finally, some election strategist decides that changes in policy may be needed. Ten years later Australia is left penniless, without enough energy, and polluting the world with the scraps of fossil fuels it is desperately burning to keep the lights on. Andrew Scott, Pymble\n\nCanada, a country similar to Australia, has five nuclear plants containing 22 reactors, built 40 to 60 years ago. They produce only 15 per cent of that nation's electricity requirements. This raises two issues: Firstly, if we could manage to build two reactors by 2037, as Dutton claims, Australia would still need to source more than 90 per cent of our electricity from fossil fuels or renewables. Secondly, the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission states on its website that each 600MW reactor produces 90 tonnes of high-level radioactive waste per year which has to be stored on-site in water-filled bays for six to 10 years until cooled enough to be moved to reinforced concrete canisters also on site. John Keene, Glebe\n\nBefore politicians offer their opinion on nuclear power stations I'd like them to convince us that they know how such reactors work, from the refining of uranium, the construction of the fuel rods, how the fission processes function, how they are controlled and through to the eventual disposal of used rods. If they are ignorant of these things, then perhaps they could, to put it bluntly, shut up. Bill Forbes, Medowie\n\nDavid Crowe (\"Seven sites and two black holes: voters deserve better\", June 20) highlights the lack of detail in Dutton's plan for nuclear power. However, we should allow for the possibility that Dutton thinks that nuclear power will probably never happen in Australia. His only plan is likely to be that of winning the next election by whatever means he can. As in the lead-up to the Voice vote, the aim will be to dominate the framing of the debate and spread division and strengthen tribal partisanship. We may expect a drip feed of bits of the nuclear plan over the coming months, each morsel lacking details. But that won't matter to Dutton as long as disinformation and division dominate the news cycle. Peter Thompson, Grenfell\n\nDutton doesn't care about nuclear. It's all theatre. What he does care about is causing division with the aim of winning power because the Coalition can't bear its current irrelevance. He does this via fear, obfuscation and a claim to care about \"battlers\". If we voters can't see through this then all Dutton's theatrics will pay off. Judy Hungerford, Kew (Vic)\n\nOne of the issues in centralising baseload power is national defence planning. Jump forward to 2050, any country threatening us needs just seven intercontinental ballistic missiles to cripple industry and transport over the entire country, never mind the spread of nuclear waste over land and water. Smaller countries could disable the plants effectively with a few drones. Mad Max is real!

Happy to take that off your hands, I believe there might be a market,' one critic said.\n\n'No information? If you don't know, vote No,' another said.\n\nDuring the Voice campaign, that phrase was constantly used by Coalition politicians during interviews, shared on Liberal party social media pages and even turned into merchandise by the official No campaign.\n\nThe Voice referendum's six-word slogan is once again trending on X, with hundreds of Australians arguing Mr Dutton has not provided enough detail to warrant a mandate to shift to nuclear\n\nThe Yes camp attempted to defuse the sting of the slogan with their own, telling the public 'if you don't know, find out'.\n\nBut Mr Dutton and the No camp argued there was no detail available to 'find out', given many of the specifics weren't to be established until after the referendum result.\n\nNow, Mr Dutton has walked right into a similar trap, failing to provide sufficient answers to several key questions in the nuclear debate.\n\nMr Dutton spoke at length on Wednesday about his plan to open seven nuclear reactors across Australia if he's elected at the next election.\n\nLithgow and the Hunter Valley are the proposed NSW sites, Mount Murchison and Tarong in Queensland and Traralgon in Victoria. Mr Dutton proposes one site in South Australia in Port Augusta, and another in Collie in WA.\n\nEach of the locations are sites of current coal plants due to be shut down or decommissioned.\n\nCritics are now encouraging Aussies to vote against Mr Dutton's plan due to a lack of detail\n\nLabor have already come out swinging against Mr Dutton's proposal, describing it as 'economic insanity' and 'ideological stupidity'\n\nMr Dutton said these would be owned and operated by the government, but he had no answers as to how the government would go about acquiring them, given they're all currently privately owned and some have already been identified as future renewables sites.\n\nBut the primary concern amongst critics and the government is that Mr Dutton did not reveal any costings for the ambitious project.\n\nEnergy Minister Chris Bowen said: 'The reason Mr Dutton didn't release the costs of his nuclear fantasy yesterday is that he knows it would drive up bills. Nuclear is the most expensive form of energy available.'\n\nAnd Labor MP Julian Hill added: 'The biggest con in decades! Peter Dutton wants Australians to pay for his nuclear reactors, and pay more for electricity.\n\n'Nuclear energy is the MOST expensive form of power. He won't even say how many hundreds of billions of your dollars this fantasy would cost.'\n\nThe slogan was a highly effective tool throughout the campaign\n\nThe Yes camp struggled to win over Australians who felt there wasn't enough detail in the proposal\n\nMr Dutton also failed to go into detail about how he intends to win over state Premiers who remain staunchly opposed to nuclear in their backyards.\n\nNuclear reactors are banned in NSW, Queensland and Victoria, and each of the Labor premiers in those states have categorically ruled out overturning that for Mr Dutton.\n\nWhen asked about that hurdle, the Opposition Leader said: 'We'll work with the state premiers, some debate about that I see, as you know, somebody famously said I would not stand between the Premier and a bucket of money.'\n\nFinally, the government of the day would need a majority in the Senate - or a policy supported by the crossbench - to pass any legislation.\n\nThe Greens are opposed to nuclear energy and will not make any concessions to aid the passage through the chamber.\n\nLabor have already come out swinging against Mr Dutton's proposal, describing it as 'economic insanity' and 'ideological stupidity'.\n\nLabor's Julian Hill became the first Labor MP to utilise Mr Dutton's famous phrase, sharing a picture of a nuclear reactor overlaid with the message, 'don't know? Vote no'.\n\nThe Opposition Leader is already bracing for 'the mother of all scare campaigns' on the back of his announcement.\n\n'We know the Prime Minister and his Government will mount the mother-of-all scare campaigns on zero-emissions nuclear energy,' he said.\n\n'But we believe Australians are up for this discussion and are open-minded about including zero-emissions nuclear technology as part of a balanced energy mix.'", "source": {"uri": "expressdigest.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "expressdigest.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The parties have not gone to an election with the same carbon reduction policies since 2007.\n\n\"I'm very happy for the election to be a referendum on energy, on nuclear, on power prices, on lights going out, on who has a sustainable pathway for our country going forward,\" Liberal Party leader Peter Dutton told reporters.\n\nSeven government-owned reactors would be built on the sites of ageing coal-fired electricity plants in five of Australia's six states, Mr Dutton said.\n\nThe first two would be built from 2035 to 2037 and the last in the 2040s. The estimated costs would be announced at a later date, he said.\n\nThe current centre-left government has rejected nuclear power generation in Australia as too expensive. Too many coal-fired generators would have been decommissioned before nuclear power could fill the gap.\n\nClimate change and energy minister Chris Bowen accused the Liberal Party of serving Australia's coal and gas industry lobbies.\n\n\"It's not really an announcement. We know that Mr Dutton wants to slow down the rollout of renewables and he wants to introduce the most expensive form of energy that's slow to build,\" Mr Bowen told reporters.\n\n\"But today, we've seen no costs, we've seen no gigawatts, we've seen no detail. This is a joke. It's a serious joke because it threatens our transition\" from fossil fuels,\" Mr Bowen added.\n\nMr Bowen's Labor Party came to power in the 2022 elections, promising deeper cuts to Australia's greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 than the previous coalition government had committed to.\n\nThe previous Liberal Party-led government promised to reduce emissions by between 26% and 28% below 2005 levels by the end of the decade.\n\nLabor promised a 43% reduction, and the Parliament enshrined that target in law, creating difficulties for any future government that wanted to reduce it and offering certainty for investors.\n\nMr Dutton has ruled out announcing a new 2030 target before the next election. However, the major parties have agreed on a net-zero emissions target by 2050.\n\nMr Dutton said Labor could not reach its 2030 target with a policy toward relying solely on renewable energy.\n\nA Liberal Party-led government would use nuclear power, renewable energy sources and \"significant amounts of gas\", Mr Dutton said.\n\n\"I want to make sure that the Australian public understands today that we have a vision for our country to deliver cleaner electricity, cheaper electricity and consistent electricity,\" he added.\n\nAustralia has historically been one of the world's worst greenhouse gas emitters on a per capita basis because of its heavy reliance on abundant reserves of cheap coal and gas.\n\nThe constant conflict between the major parties over the past 17 years on how to reduce emissions led to a carbon tax introduced by a Labor Party government in 2012 being repealed by a Liberal Party-led government in 2014.\n\nAustralia's only reactor has produced nuclear isotopes for medical use in the Sydney suburb of Lucas Heights since 1958.\n\nMr Dutton said the country could only now consider introducing atomic power generation because the major parties had agreed in 2019 to the AUKUS partnership with the United States and Britain, which will deliver Australia a fleet of submarines powered by US nuclear technology.", "source": {"uri": "hertsad.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

Only it won't be great. Opposition Leader Peter Dutton has announced his plans to campaign for introducing nuclear power into Australia's energy mix at the next election.\n\nThere is so much to unpack surrounding what happens next: the political implications, the policy feasibility of 'going nuclear', what it means for energy prices and emissions reductions targets, as well as what the chances are of it ever happening.\n\nUnfortunately, however, all we are going to get from here is a Seinfeld election campaign about nothing. Labor will focus in on the mother of all scare campaigns, which will be divorced from reality. And the Coalition, even if it can win the election on its big nuclear policy, won't be able to implement it anyway because of opposition across the states.\n\nAustralia is destined to lack the maturity to discuss the viability of nuclear energy free of partisan fights and ideological support or opposition towards the technology, irrespective of whether going nuclear is realistic or not.\n\nSo the central issue for the looming election campaign - nuclear vs renewables - which will likely dominate the next federal election will be a distraction from what the majority of Australians want to focus on: cost of living pressures, the challenges of immigration and housing, as well as how the economy can be reshaped to solve such problems.\n\nPeter Dutton (pictured) is going all in on nuclear power as his solution to energy shortages and to achieve emissions reductions\n\nNonetheless, we need to explain why the nuclear debate is a red herring that will catch so much attention.\n\nLets start with the scare campaign Labor is about to ramp up, coupled with the Coalition's decision to put a massive policy target on its back.\n\nThe last two times an opposition set itself up to impose a massive policy shift if it wins an election was 1993 and 2019. John Hewson's Fightback campaign to introduce a GST and Bill Shorten's attempt to reform negative gearing and franking credits. Both men lost elections judged to be unloseable. Both policy agendas were targeted with brutal scare campaigns.\n\nThe lesson Dutton has decided to ignore is that campaigning on big reforms while in opposition is a recipe for failure.\n\nWe know scare campaigns work, not only because of these two historical examples but also because they have worked against incumbents too.\n\nPolitical advertising executives will all tell you until they are blue in the face that negative campaigning is more successful than positive campaigning. Dutton needs to positively explain why his nuclear policy is a good idea, the Labor government only has to go negative and outline all the reasons it is bad policy.\n\nNuclear technology has come a long way, but at the moment there is a ban on introducing it in Australia and the state's would need to get on board to change that\n\nThe worst part of this reality if you're Dutton is that the scare campaign doesn't even have to be true. Just look at the 2016 Mediscare campaign Malcolm Turnbull was up against at the 2016 election.\n\nLabor's claims at the time that Turnbull planned to 'abolish Medicare' were completely untrue and unachievable even if he'd wanted to do it. But that didn't stop Labor campaigning on the issue and voters being frightened.\n\nTurnbull won but only just. The closeness of the election result ended his prime ministership soon enough.\n\nThe degree of difficulty repelling a scare campaign is that much harder in opposition. So why did Dutton embark on the course that he has?\n\nHe can't let the Nationals go off on a campaign arguing against renewables without some sort of alternative to help bring down emissions. Nuclear gives him that. He ideologically believes the state based bans all around the country, as well as nationally, is silly policy, which he's right about. It's policy retrofitted to a 1970s attitude about nuclear power.\n\nDutton also knows that the last (and only) serious independent study analysing nuclear power's viability was handed down back in 2006. It found that yes it is viable, but only if steps to implement the policy shift happen right away.\n\nThat never happened.\n\nSo if you're energy agnostic, as I am, and pro a technology neutral approach to emissions reductions, as I also am, the problem with going nuclear is that Australia may have left its run too late. But we don't know that because we need an up-to-date independent study.\n\nThe problem with Dutton announcing his intention to go nuclear the way that he has is that he really shouldn't be doing so without a proper feasibility study independently and rigorously carried out. What he has commissioned doesn't amount to that level of detailed analysis. You need to be in government first to do that.\n\nThe Labor government won't do it, and for some reason Dutton wants to do more than commit to doing such a study if he wins the next election. Probably because he wants to say he has a tangible solution to energy needs and emissions reductions, not just a thought bubble of doing a study before making a decision.\n\nDutton might also be worried that without details, Labor's scare campaign could go off in any number of directions he hopes today's details will counter. But the scare campaign will do all of that anyway, because as already noted, political scare campaigns aren't rooted in fact.\n\nAn election about nothing on nuclear power is on the cards, just like the Seinfeld show 'about nothing'\n\nEverything from protestors in hazmat suits to images of the Simpsons and the leaky unsafe nuclear reactor that their town of Springwood depended on will come up during the campaign.\n\nLabor will argue that reactors might pop up all over the country, not just in the electorates the Coalition nominates. It will point to international reactor failures, even if the technologies have advanced since then and Australia's topography is very different.\n\nThen we have the final issue which is the reason this whole debate that is about to start in earnest is a waste of time. A campaign about nothing.\n\nThe state's won't approve the policy and the senate probably won't approve the legislation before we even get to the states.\n\nThe Greens look set to control the Senate's balance of power after the next election and they are utterly opposed to going nuclear.\n\nIf state governments stand by their nuclear bans there isn't much the Commonwealth can do to get around that. And state premiers and even Coalition opposition leaders are already lining up to say there is no way they will lift nuclear bans. It might become a constitutional fight.\n\nThis policy is dead on arrival.\n\nThe good news in this should be that the states might be saving Dutton from himself politically, but the dye has been cast already. Even though the fact there is virtually no chance of Dutton's nuclear policy going live - because of the hurdles he has to overcome but can't - should reduce the potency of a Labor scare campaign, it probably won't.\n\nBecause Dutton won't want to accept that he can't get this policy past the states, and it suits the Labor government to pretend that he might to service the potency of its scare campaign.\n\nAt his media conference Dutton noted that Paul Keating once said that it is dangerous to get between a Premier and a bag full of money, suggesting that he can win the states over by bribing them with handouts.\n\nBut it would need to be so much money (or arm twisting via denying Commonwealth grants) that the sheer quantum of what would be required might bankrupt the federal treasury. I can't even reach a lofty financial figure that, in my mind, might get them on board.\n\nPolitical scare campaigns work, and Anthony Albanese (pictured) is about to unleash the mother of all scare campaigns against Dutton's nuclear policy\n\nSo here we are as a nation: in need of nuclear but long before now. Unable to overcome the barriers to its consideration, much less implementation.\n\nLabor strategists are utterly convinced their scare campaign against Dutton's nuclear policy will work and at the same time, fix their current political problems.\n\nCoalition strategists are divided as to whether 'going nuclear' will work or not. Some believe they are writing their own political death warrant and never should have gone down this path because the Labor government is teetering on the edge of political oblivion.\n\nOthers say modern Australia is ready for this debate and an old fashion scare campaign won't work.\n\nNo first term government has defeated a first term opposition since 1931, and that election was fought in the midst of The Great Depression. Winning in the circumstances the Coalition is in was already going to be hard, but the degree of difficulty just went up courtesy of today's policy announcement.\n\nIrrespective of whether going nuclear is good, and irrespective of the failures of this incompetent Labor administration.\n\nOkay, so even though this nuclear debate is ultimately about nothing for the reasons explained, on the assumption anyone has read this far and wants to weigh up the policy pros and cons of going nuclear anyway, to conclude, here they are.\n\nThe pros include that nuclear power helps achieve emissions reductions. They are comparable to renewables in this respect but with base load power renewables currently can't achieve. In theory phasing out coal fired power and introducing nuclear could make a lot of sense.\n\nNuclear power when viable is highly efficient, isn't weather dependent and can operate around the clock. Australia's safe climate and topography makes us ideally suited to housing nuclear reactors.\n\nHigh quality regulatory systems and environmental standards would help ensure safety standards prevent problems. As a well developed nation, we also have the technological capacity to provide the workforces that nuclear reactors require.\n\nAnd Australia has one of the world's largest supplies of yellowcake, the ingredient which fuels nuclear energy.\n\nThe cons are that Australia may have left its run too late, damaging the business case of going nuclear. Even smaller reactors might take more than a decade to build, but which time other technologies have filled the gap they were designed to fill.\n\nBuilding such controversial technology across political cycles is also a risk. And of course the risk of disasters like those we have seen overseas is always present when nuclear technology is embraced.\n\nAnd with that, let the next round of the climate wars begin!", "source":

That's a claim that would be music to most Australians' ears given the cost of gas and electricity has surged. But how likely is it? Today, energy reporter Daniel Mercer on what building nuclear reactors means for the household bottom line. I'm Sam Hawley on Gadigal land in Sydney. This is ABC News Daily. Dan, the coalition wants to go nuclear. It wants to build seven reactors in Australia and there's so much, I think, to discuss around this, like when they're going to be built, where the nuclear waste is going to go. But one of the big things is about power bills, about how much we pay for energy. Peter Dutton says his plan will make energy cheaper, doesn't he?\n\nDan Mercer: Yeah, he does and he was very clear on this, Sam, when he unveiled that policy.\n\nPeter Dutton: I want to make sure that the Australian public understands today that we have a vision for our country to deliver cleaner electricity, cheaper electricity and consistent electricity.\n\nDan Mercer: What's probably important to query though is whether he's saying it will cut electricity bills compared with what they are now or whether he just means his plans will be cheaper than Labor's. But certainly the coalition is bandying the word cheaper around with gusto.\n\nPeter Dutton: This is about modernising our energy system. It's about making sure that we have cheaper electricity. It's about making sure that we underpin economic growth and jobs growth for generations to come.\n\nSam Hawley: Yeah, absolutely, because we do want cheaper power bills, that's for sure, because I think most Australians at this point would agree that we are paying way too much.\n\nDan Mercer: Yeah, and I think Peter Dutton has tapped into something. You're right, power prices are high and they've rocketed about 40 per cent or more in the past two years and there's little relief in sight.\n\nSam Hawley: Absolutely. Alright, so Peter Dutton thinks the government's renewables policy is not fit for purpose and nuclear is a much better option and the assertion is that that will be great for our power bills. So let's just unpack this a bit more then, Dan. What exactly is the opposition arguing? How is this going to be cheaper?\n\nDan Mercer: I'm not sure it's exactly clear yet, Sam. Okay. I mean, I think the central tenet of the argument seems to be that nuclear is a like for like with coal in many ways. That's kind of my read on it. Coal was the bedrock, and still largely is, of our electricity system and certainly prices were cheap when coal predominated. Ipso facto nuclear power would lead to cheaper electricity. And it's on this ground that Peter Dutton has a point, is that nuclear plants would avoid the need for huge and costly additions to the high voltage transmission network, you know, those big, high steel lattice towers that march across the landscape, because these nuclear plants could be built on the sites of old coal plants and those old coal plants are the traditional hub in the hub and spoke electricity system that really characterised our electricity supply for so long. That's obviously not the case with large scale renewable energy though, which more often than not needs to be built in far flung places with lots of wind and lots of sunshine. And underlying all of this, I think, is a view by the Coalition, which is shared by some others, it has to be said, that it's just too difficult to run a power system on green energy alone. But there's still so much detail we're yet to hear about the costs and the practicalities of their plan.\n\nSam Hawley: So let's then, I think, Dan, have a look at what experts are saying about this, what they think, because there is a fair bit of scepticism, isn't there?\n\nDan Mercer: There is, definitely, and a lot of people who watch the industry closely, including people who are, you know, senior participants in the industry, are sceptical. I spoke to Dylan McConnell. He's an energy analyst at the University of New South Wales and I think a fairly well respected one. He was of the view that the Coalition's timeframes are simply not realistic. They're just not plausible. Peter Dutton says the first plant, which will be a so-called small modular reactor, would be built probably in South Australia by 2035, but small modular reactors don't exist in a commercial sense in the developed world. Mr Dutton also says the first large-scale reactor will be up and running by 2037, but we don't have a nuclear energy industry in Australia and we have legislative bans in place on the technology. So we would have to overturn those bans, establish an industry with all of the monumental difficulties and costs that entails. And as Dr McConnell noted, there is nowhere in the developed world that has built a nuclear reactor since the start of the century without incurring significant costs and time blowouts on the construction.\n\nDylan McConnell: 2035 is not credible. We can look at the CSIRO as well that points to 2040, but the idea that we could have something even faster than 2040 I don't think stands up to scrutiny.\n\nSam Hawley: But Dan, Ted O'Brien, he of course is the opposition's energy spokesman, he points actually to a Canadian province to show that it is true that nuclear energy does deliver relatively cheap electricity to households in that province. It really works to bring bills down. It's a case in point for him.\n\nDan Mercer: Indeed, he did make that point, as has Peter Dutton.\n\nTed O'Brien: Now, when you talk to the Canadians, indeed when you sit down with the energy minister from that province, he makes it crystal clear that in fact it's nuclear as part of the mix that drives prices down. There is no reason why as you scan the rest of the world, nuclear drives prices down, that it wouldn't be the same here in Australia.\n\nDan Mercer: I think the point that gets made about this Canadian province of Ontario is that consumers pay about 14 cents a kilowatt hour for their electricity. I don't know if you've looked at your electricity bill closely lately, Sam, but 14 cents a kilowatt hour is certainly a good price. You'd take it. Right. And Ontario has a lot of nuclear power in its energy mix. So the coalition has drawn a link between nuclear power and cheap prices. But what Dr McConnell points out is that the wholesale cost of nuclear in Ontario is not actually that cheap at all. It's about $110 a megawatt hour, and that's more expensive than the wholesale cost of energy across much of Australia right now. So Dr McConnell reckons that if consumers aren't paying much for their power in Ontario, then nuclear doesn't necessarily have much to do with it. There are probably other reasons that better explain it, such as maybe much lower poles and wires costs than we bear in Australia, which are very high. We're a large, dispersed population. We have lots of poles and wires that need to be paid for by consumers. And we need to remember that nuclear power in Ontario has been operating for decades, 50 years in some cases. I think the newest one is almost, if not in fact, 30 years older or more. And that's very important because it means the mountain of debt that those plants racked up when they were first built has been largely, if not totally, paid back by now. And so the cost of those plants is much lower than would be the case for a new plant.\n\nSam Hawley: Yeah, okay. Just on a side, because I just checked. I do pay about 37 cents a kilowatt hour for my electricity. So 14 cents sounds good in Canada, but as you say, they've had this plant up and running for a really, really long time. So Dan, what happens when a plant hasn't actually paid off its costs, it hasn't been there for long, because these cost so much to build, don't they, a nuclear reactor?\n\nDan Mercer: Yeah, they are. They're monumentally expensive, and that's where so much of the risk lies. I mean Hinkley Point C in the UK is almost a poster child for all that can go wrong with these large-scale nuclear power projects. It's now expected to cost almost $100 billion Australian. I think it's about $88 billion Australian, and it was a fraction of that when it was first proposed. That'll be a cost borne for consumers for decades. No doubt they'll appreciate the reliability it provides and the amount of power it can generate, but it's not cheap.\n\nSam Hawley: All right, so Dan, there is another argument though from the Coalition that nuclear will be cheaper to get up and running than this transition to renewables, the transition to wind and solar. What about that?\n\nDan Mercer: Yeah, I think this really cuts to the heart of what the Coalition is arguing, Sam, that their plan, well, we'll release the details later, but look at Labor's plan, it's costing a bomb anyway, and would cost more. The thing about what we're moving to compared with what we've come from is there is so much more electricity generation in different assets, and they are everywhere, and they do need a lot of backup, they do need a lot of kit that has to sit in behind it to step in when the wind isn't blowing or the sun isn't shining. Look, it gets a bit messy because obviously, even if we were to power our economy with nuclear energy, if we electrify, those pressures are still going to be there, and they will still need to be paid for. And so this argument between what the Coalition says around nuclear and what Labor says around renewable energy can just become an utter maze. But, you know, the notion that a renewable electricity system will slash our bills is similarly coming under scrutiny and coming under pressure, and it's why Peter Dutton is mounting this attack. He doesn't think that it's either going to happen, or he thinks that there's ground for prosecuting against it because people are sceptical. Right now, consumers aren't really seeing the benefits in lower bills, unless you're lucky enough to have your own solar or your own batteries, and you're really smart and you can deal with a lot of these pressures in your own ways.\n\nSam Hawley: It's so complicated for voters to get across this, isn't it? It's really, really complex.\n\nDan Mercer: Horribly so. I think it's why it's been such a battleground, Sam, because it's so easy to, you know, confuse people and to muddy the waters.\n\nSam Hawley: Yeah, absolutely. All right, well, from what you've been saying, though, it's clear at this point, without more detail from the opposition, that there really is no evidence that nuclear will be cheaper and then that will mean the consumer pays less, that we all pay less in our power bills. Is that fair to say?\n\nDan Mercer: I think - I mean, I'm going to defer to Dylan McConnell from the University of New South Wales here. He is of the view that on the timescales that matter, nuclear power will not and cannot reduce our electricity bills. On a best-case, most generous assumption scenario, the coalition would have nuclear in some form up and running in Australia by 2035, large-scale by 2037, but that's a pretty heroic assumption. And so nothing is necessarily going to happen in the meantime to bring those bills down. And in the meantime, we face this pressing need to replace our ageing fleet of coal-fired power stations. Arguably, the government is really struggling to do that as it is. We are not building enough capacity, arguably, to replace those coal plants that we've relied on for so long. And so the coalition's plan wouldn't even really kick in for another 15 years at best. For the average punter sitting at home looking for the benefit of cheaper electricity, I mean, it's all kind of a moot point, really. Whether it could reduce prices, I mean, for the reasons that we've discussed, it's questionable. It's highly questionable. So it's Herculean in its assumptions and it's just not something that the average person could probably see any tangible benefits or otherwise from for a very long time.\n\nSam Hawley: All right, and we still don't have the finer details, but, you know, this is a huge big policy, so, Dan, I'm sure we'll be speaking with you rather a lot in the months ahead. Thanks, Dan.\n\nDan Mercer: Does make it interesting. Thanks, Sam.\n\nSam Hawley: Dan Mercer is the ABC's energy reporter.

For the benefit of international readers, this would be huge shift for Australia, which presently has no nuclear energy production.\n\nDutton has framed the policy as a response to climate change, seeking to exploit doubts about the reliability of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar. Dutton's move has been cast in media commentary as restarting the \"climate wars\".\n\nAUKUS was a stepping stone that has led Dutton to this next stage.\n\nThree years ago, Scott Morrison unveiled the nuclear-powered submarine plan. It's easy to forget what a shock this involved. The idea was previously unthinkable. But Morrison dragged the nation across the Rubicon, and Labor, then in opposition, quickly jumped aboard.\n\nMorrison had actually flirted with the dream of a nuclear-power industry at the time of negotiating the submarine deal, according to a recent report in The Australian, which observed that \"the politics of securing AUKUS and a domestic nuclear energy program simultaneously would have been overly ambitious.\"\n\nBut AUKUS was a stepping stone that has led Dutton to this next stage. And he looks to have read the public mood. The Lowy Institute Poll this month found 61% support either strongly (27%) or somewhat (34%) for \"Australia using nuclear power to generate electricity, alongside other sources of energy\". On the acquisition of nuclear-powered submarines, almost two-thirds of Australians remain in favour.\n\nThese are remarkable results compared to where Australia has come from. Only a few decades ago, more than 250,000 Australians protested on the streets over nuclear issues. Opposition to uranium mining was the activist issue of choice. The disarmament movement had enough support to elect senators. France's nuclear testing in the Pacific sparked an outcry that forced to government to recall the Australian ambassador in Paris. Debate over uranium sales to India split the Labor party.\n\nA major deterioration in regional security coupled with nationalist sentiment could become powerful drivers.\n\nSo, with the nation adapting to uncertain times by proposing polices once thought impossible, what about the next step? Should Australia complement its nuclear power industry and nuclear-powered submarines with an arsenal of nuclear weapons? Australia has had atomic ambitions before.\n\nPublic support appears tepid. In 2022, after the AUKUS plans had been unveiled, the Lowy Institute Poll reported 36% of Australians in favour of acquiring nuclear weapons in the future. Still, that was higher than the 16% in favour in 2010, when Australians were asked if they would support developing nuclear weapons should near neighbours do the same. Attitudes can shift. Asked in 2011 whether they favoured Australia building nuclear power plants as part of its plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions, only 35% agreed.\n\nBig international shocks might encourage more Australians to support the development nuclear weapons. Vladimir Putin making good on threats to unleash a nuclear strike over the invasion of Ukraine, for example. Or an act of naked aggression by China.\n\nAustralians might also want to follow should partners take concrete steps. Japan is one country that is already assumed to have a latent nuclear weapons capability, a \"bomb in the basement\", with the technical know-how of a full nuclear fuel cycle. South Korea's President Yoon Suk-yeol warned in January that threats from North Korea might drive him to seek tactical nuclear weapons \"if the problem becomes more serious\".\n\nAnd while a nuclear-armed Australia would complicate relations with neighbours, particularly Indonesia and the Pacific, a major deterioration in regional security coupled with nationalist sentiment could become powerful drivers.\n\nThe question of cost is confronting. Building and maintaining nuclear weapons requires immense expenditure. It would be a massive investment, technically challenging, and run afoul of Australia's international commitments. These are all the same reasons people have for so long dismissed the idea of Australia obtaining nuclear-powered submarines.\n\nYou can start to see the way a political argument in favour of nuclear weapons could be made. Strategic dangers are swirling. China is rapidly expanding its nuclear stockpile. The nuclear non-proliferation treaty signed in the 1960s is outmoded, much as was the argument when effectively exempting India over its nuclear weapons program.\n\nDutton, to be clear, is talking nuclear power, not weapons. But given the upheaval of recent times, who could confidently say never? Australia's nuclear politics have dramatically changed.", "source": {"uri": "lowyinstitute.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lowy Institute for International Policy"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The main reason is to reduce emissions -- both major parties are committed to zero net emissions by 2050, and Labor has legislated a 2030 target consistent with global climate agreements.\n\nBut a secondary reason is that Australia's coal plants are fading fast. Several plants have closed in recent years. Eleven of the 18 coal plants we have left are set to close over the next decade.\n\nAnd those that remain are creaky and increasingly unreliable. Unexpected coal plant closures have been a significant contributor to recent high power prices.\n\nSo far, the main alternatives have been renewable -- solar, wind and hydro power -- and gas, which Labor says will be needed throughout the transition.\n\nBut the pace of the renewable rollout has been slow, something the Labor government has blamed on its predecessor's lack of firm national targets and supporting policies.\n\nThat is something Labor hopes it is changing with its Capacity Investment Scheme, which underwrites renewable projects to improve their commercial viability and provide investors with certainty. Labor points to figures showing that renewables are now rolling out at a record pace.\n\nThe proposal\n\nIt is in that context that the Coalition now proposes nuclear power.\n\nPeter Dutton and Nationals leader David Littleproud say nuclear would be an alternative to renewables, delivering zero-emissions energy on ready-made sites using existing transmission lines, and therefore avoiding the need for the geographical footprint of renewable projects.\n\nThey are undecided between two types of nuclear power: large-scale reactors, like the ones that have long been operational in Europe, or small 'modular' reactors, an emerging but as-yet unproven technology.\n\nThe distinction is an important one. Large-scale plants are a 'base load' power source, hard to turn on and off so best deployed as primary, constant generators.\n\nThe Coalition says five of the sites could host either large or small, but the sites in WA and SA could only host small.\n\nPractical difficulties\n\nThis poses the first challenge: even if it's assumed that five large plants and two small plants are built, that would add up to just over 6 gigawatts (GW) of generation capacity. That's compared to 22 GW of coal used currently, and well over 50 GW of generation capacity currently needed for the National Electricity Market (excluding WA).\n\nThat casts doubt over whether nuclear power would alone be a sufficient replacement for coal. The Coalition has sent mixed signals on that front -- for example, David Littleproud said today he believed renewables had a role to play, but also said nuclear was \"visionary\" because it would mean a country \"not covered in solar panels and wind turbines\".\n\nNext question: Who pays?\n\nCloser examination of the sites would also shed light on another unknown: the cost.\n\nAll available evidence suggests it will be expensive. According to CSIRO and the Australian Energy Market Operator's cost study ('GenCost'), large-scale nuclear is more expensive than renewables and small-scale nuclear is more expensive than anything else.\n\nCoalition politicians have quibbled with the assumptions of that study, but it includes the cost of construction, generation and transmission and is the most detailed study available in the Australian context.\n\nA Coalition business case would need either to come up with a convincing lower number or else argue that the hefty bill is worthwhile. The Coalition has not said who would pay for the construction, but government ownership would generally require partial or full public subsidy -- though the taxpayer could recoup the benefits in future if it retained ownership when the plants turn a profit.\n\nWhen could plants be built?\n\nThe Coalition says it could have the first two plants operational between 2035 and 2037 - the former date if it opts for small reactors and the latter date if it opts for large reactors.", "source": {"uri": "khmertimeskh.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Khmer Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal-fired_power_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coal-fired power station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Dutton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peter Dutton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australian Labor Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_(Australia)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coalition (Australia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegraphy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Telegraphy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_transition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Energy transition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_plant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear power plant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Littleproud", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Littleproud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Party_of_Australia", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Party of Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydropower", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hydropower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_load", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Base load"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric power transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western Australia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Western Australia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CSIRO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Electricity_Market", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Electricity Market"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_panel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Solar panel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_ownership", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State ownership"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_turbine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wind turbine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Subsidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_generator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric generator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Australia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Australia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear Pharmacy", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/photo_2024-06-19_17-22-19.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662030", "eventUri": "eng-9662030", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

over the Coalition's new nuclear power push, with Australians receiving the first taste of an expected scare campaign in opposition to the controversial proposal in the run up to the next election.\n\nWithout revealing the multi-billion dollar price tag of its policy, the Coalition on Wednesday unveiled plans to build seven nuclear power plants by 2050, with the first reactor slated to be operational in just over a decade should the party win power.\n\nIn response, Labor politicians and the union movement launched a wave of attack ads against the Coalition's policy, predominantly highlighting the safety risks posed by nuclear energy.\n\nTheNightlyGet in front of tomorrow's news for FREE\n\nJournalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion.\n\nREAD NOW\n\nChannelling the imagery of the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant from American cartoon sitcom 'The Simpsons', Labor assistant minister Andrew Leigh shared a manipulated depiction of a three-eyed Blinky Bill standing in front of a nuclear reactor.\n\nThe ACTU took a similar line of attack, providing free stickers to members featuring the Simpsons' character of Blinky, the three-eyed fish, and emblazoned with the tag 'Danger Dutton' alongside radioactive symbols.\n\nSo too did Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan, sharing a doctored image of radiation affected animals in the state's Gippsland region, a proposed site for nuclear reactors under the Coalition's proposal.\n\nSpeaking on Thursday morning, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese also rubbished the Coalition's nuclear power plan, describing it as a \"fantasy\".\n\n\"Instead of 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs', this is 'Peter Dutton and the seven nuclear reactors',\" Mr Albanese told ABC Radio.\n\n\"This is just absurd to have a big build-up for an announcement and then say, 'Oh well, we'll give you the details [later]'.\"\n\nMr Albanese's comparison was circulated in picture form online by Labor backbencher Peter Khalil.\n\nIn a darker representation, the Australian Manufacturing Workers' Union shared pictures of individuals clothed in hazmat suits surrounded by nuclear waste.\n\nThe 1986 explosion at a reactor at Chernobyl in Ukraine and the 2011 meltdown of the Fukushima power plant in Japan have heightened community concerns about the safety of nuclear power, even as the track record of such technology shows it poses minimal danger to civilians.\n\nResponding to Labor's attacks, Opposition Leader Peter Dutton called for a more nuanced debate into the merits of his proposed nuclear rollout.\n\n\"From the Labor Party we get them posting cartoon figures and the rest of the nonsense so hopefully we can have an adult conversation because I honestly believe it's in our country's best interest,\" Mr Dutton told Nine Radio.\n\n\"We have the ability to set ourselves up economically for generations to come,\"\n\nA recent report from Australia's peak scientific body CSIRO estimated that building a large-scale nuclear power plant in Australia would cost approximately $8.5bn and take at least 15 years to deliver, longer than the Coalition's 10-year timeline.\n\nAcross advanced economies, the use of nuclear power has begun to fade, with little new investment due to significant costs and lengthy construction times required to build reactors.\n\nOriginally published as

Friends of the Earth's Gippsland organiser and President of the Voices of the Valley Wendy Farmer said:\n\n\"Dutton is dreaming up a nuclear nightmare. The proposal to build a nuclear power plant in the Latrobe Valley on a geological faultline in a community that already suffered the impacts of the Hazelwood coal mine fire is dangerous and insulting\" said Wendy Farmer, FoE's Gippsland organiser and President of Voices of the Valley.\n\nFriends of the Earth is firmly committed to supporting communities that would be impacted by Dutton's nuclear nightmare.\n\n/Public Release.

Peter Dutton is going all in on nuclear energy, announcing seven sites for reactors and setting the stage for an energy referendum at the next election. The choice for voters, do you want a renewable future or a nuclear one? Today, the ABC's national political lead and Insider's host, David Speers, on what will be one of the biggest policy debates of our time. I'm Sam Hawley on Gadigal land in Sydney. This is ABC News Daily.\n\nPeter Dutton: Today we announce seven locations that we have looked at in great detail over a long period of time that can host new nuclear sites. We have a vision for our country to deliver cleaner electricity, cheaper electricity and consistent electricity.\n\nDavid Littleproud: It's about a vision for regional Australia, one that isn't covered in solar panels and wind turbines and transmission lines.\n\nSussan Ley: Our nuclear plan will put our country back on track.\n\nSam Hawley: Speersy, if you thought the Coalition wasn't actually serious about nuclear, you were wrong, right?\n\nDavid Speers: Yeah, look, they are deadly serious about this and they've been talking it up for months and months that the policy announcement would come. Now it's come, at least in part. We don't yet have the cost of all of this. We'll come to that, but we do have the locations. Even just giving these locations and making the commitment they've made is a big political gamble. It's up there, I think, with oppositions trying to do big things like Bill Shorten's tax plans, John Hewson's fightback plan. Now Peter Dutton is saying he'll go to the election with a nuclear policy plan and it's in large part driven by the Nationals, the junior partner in the Coalition, very worried about the rollout of big renewable projects and transmission lines in the regions and they reckon simply replacing retiring coal-fired plants with nuclear means you solve a lot of those problems. You can just plug them into the existing transmission and problem is solved.\n\nSam Hawley: All right, so this is a big announcement from Peter Dutton and it will be a huge part of the battle at the next election, clearly. Just tell me then, what did he say? Where are these seven nuclear reactors going to be if, of course, the Coalition wins the election?\n\nDavid Speers: So they're all on the sites of retiring coal-fired power plants and remember that 90 per cent of our coal fleet is due to go in the next decade. So in New South Wales, the Liddell Power Station, which is already closed, and the Mount Piper Power Station, the Loy Yang Power Stations in Victoria, in Queensland, the Tarong Power Station and the Callide Power Station near Biloela, the Northern Power Station in South Australia and the Muja Power Station in WA. So they're dotted around and the idea, as I say, is to simply use that existing infrastructure to build a nuclear plant so that you can plug it straight into the network.\n\nSam Hawley: Yes, and five of the seven are actually in Coalition seats, that's worth noting. So when are they going to be built, did he say?\n\nDavid Speers: Good question. So the first two, he expects, would come between 2035 and 2037. The rest wouldn't come until the 2040s. The idea here is to have them all up and running so that we can still hit net zero by 2050. But, of course, what it would mean for emissions in the meantime is very unclear. The Coalition is not going to be taking any interim emissions targets to the election, nor is it clear what the cost of all of this would be. But those first two could be either large or small-scale reactors.\n\nSam Hawley: OK, because the Coalition, of course, is dumping the 2030 target under the Paris Agreement.\n\nDavid Speers: That's right. They think it's unachievable, the one the government has set, but they're not even going to take a less ambitious target to the election. Peter Dutton last week made that clear, that he will wait until he's in government to work out what that interim target should be. He says that means he'd still stay in the Paris Agreement and still hit that 2050 emissions target. And really this whole nuclear plan is about having a feasible way of hitting 2050 net zero, but without having to really reduce emissions much at all before then.\n\nSam Hawley: As you mentioned, Speersy, they haven't said how much this is actually going to cost, but we do know it's wildly expensive, right, to build a nuclear reactor. Massively expensive.\n\nDavid Speers: Yeah. Expensive to build and expensive in terms of the power that's generated, according to the CSIRO. Last month the CSIRO and the energy market operator released their GenCost report, most detailed research really into what this would cost, the nuclear option, and it found large-scale, a fair bit cheaper than the small modular reactors, but even the large-scale reactors would cost about $17 billion for the first one and then about $8 billion for each one after that. The power generated would be about double the cost of renewables backed by firming, and that is pumped hydro batteries and so on. So renewables with firming, still half the price of what nuclear power would be. The Coalition took issue with that report. They say a few inputs are wrong and that they don't buy it. They think power would be cheaper under their plan, but they haven't produced any detail to explain how.\n\nSam Hawley: Speersy, there has been really deep concern, I guess, leading up to this announcement about how viable this policy actually is. I mean, there's been a number of analysts and scientists saying that, number one, as we've discussed, it's really, really expensive, but also they argue, I think, that it's come too late, that we've missed the boat, that now is not the time, that it's a risky move, right?\n\nDavid Speers: Yeah, the consensus seems to be the best time for Australia to go nuclear would have been 20 years ago. Yes. And certainly in the nine years they were in office, most recently under the Abbott, Turnbull, Morrison governments, they didn't go down this path at all. The Nats would bowl it up from time to time and it kept getting knocked back. Now we're at a point where a lot of renewables are already being rolled out. And so the problem here is how does nuclear fit in with that and is it too late? Have we missed the boat on nuclear? Yes, plenty of other countries are doing it, and the simple pitch from Peter Dutton is, well, if everyone else can do it, why can't we? They all started a lot earlier and they don't have the renewable resources that we have in Australia with plenty of sunshine and wind in particular. So look, if you start now and you don't get one of these nuclear plants at the earliest for another 10 or 12 years and the full fleet for another 20 or so years, what happens in the meantime? What are we relying on and what does that mean for our power prices? Now, Peter Dutton wants to string out as long as possible the existing coal-fired plants and use a lot more gas. But given the ageing fleet that we're talking about and the price of gas, again, it's unknown whether it would be any cheaper. He says it would, but we just don't have that detail.\n\nSam Hawley: And as you say, we were debating this 20 years ago. The Coalition was debating whether or not it was a good idea. And then, of course, in 1998, John Howard actually banned nuclear power. So it's not even legal here. That would have to change too.\n\nDavid Speers: That's the first big hurdle. It was John Howard who did that deal with the Greens, in fact, to put a ban on nuclear power. It was part of an arrangement that - a compromise that included an expansion of the Lucas Heights Medical Research Reactor. But, yeah, removing that ban would have to be the first thing a Dutton Coalition government would have to do. And while they might win in the House of Representatives, they would still face a crossbench in the Senate that they would have to convince. Then you've got the states who have their own bans in place and the states are all opposed to what he's talking about at the moment as well. He reckons you could win them over with a bucket of money. He referenced Paul Keating's famous quote about never standing in between a Premier and a bucket of money. But, you know, again, how much money are we talking here on top of the price of these nuclear power plants themselves? So a lot of hurdles to overcome.\n\nSam Hawley: Yeah, absolutely. Victoria's Premier, Jacinta Allan, she's been out there saying, no way, it's too toxic and it's risky.\n\nJacinta Allan: This is the Liberal Party's solution to the challenges of transitioning our energy mix in this country. They want to bring more expensive, more risky, more toxic energy solutions to the people of this country and we won't stand for that. We absolutely won't...\n\nSam Hawley: So she's definitely not on board at this point.\n\nDavid Speers: Yeah, and even more politically difficult for Peter Dutton is that his own Queensland LNP colleague, David Crisafulli, who is opposed to this nuclear plan as well, he could well be Premier by the end of the year after the Queensland election.\n\nJournalist: Do you support the Coalition's newly announced nuclear policy?\n\nDavid Crisafulli: We've been very consistent, it's not part of our plan. That's a matter for Canberra.\n\nDavid Speers: So even on his own side of politics, there's resistance at the state level.\n\nSam Hawley: And obviously the government totally rejects this idea.\n\nJim Chalmers: Nuclear takes longer, it costs more, and it will squander Australia's unique combination of advantages. It is the worst combination of economic and ideological stupidity.\n\nSam Hawley: It says, of course, that it threatens our green transition.\n\nDavid Speers: Well, it certainly does threaten the transition to renewables, the path that we're on, because yes, Peter Dutton is saying he'd prefer to keep those coal-fired power plants running much longer, use more gas as well, and clearly there's hostility towards these big renewable projects in the regions from the Nationals and from the Liberals. Look, there are obviously difficulties in this energy transition, no doubt about it, and yes, energy prices have risen and Peter Dutton is really tapping into those concerns about costs, about the impact on the regions of all the transmission lines required for wind and solar projects as well, and that's why he's saying that the much simpler solution is this nuclear idea.\n\nSam Hawley: Alright, well, Speersy, let's have a look then at whether this is really what Australians want, because this is going to be, as we mentioned, a key election issue now, whether you support the government's push to renewables or you want nuclear. This is, isn't it, the climate war's back with a vengeance?\n\nDavid Speers: Yeah, and in fact, Peter Dutton, he said that he's happy to have a referendum at the election on energy and nuclear. Now, it's clear that he really wants to focus and tap into the anger that's there in the regions and elsewhere about power prices and about issues around the renewables rollout, whether it's wind farms, transmission lines, this is where he really wants to focus people's attention. But he also has to defend his alternative and what that would all mean, and it's difficult to defend when we don't have many of the details around the cost, the impact on power prices, but it's a big gamble. Polls have shown growing support for nuclear power. There was a Lowy Institute poll only a couple of weeks ago, which had supported about 61 per cent. So the principal idea of nuclear isn't proving to be a turn-off according to the data we've seen so far. Now that we move into a more informed debate about what the Coalition are planning, perhaps the polling will be more relevant, will tell us a little more about how Australians feel, particularly in some of those local communities as well, where there's so far been a mixed reaction to the idea of having a nuclear plant down the road.\n\nSam Hawley: This is going to be a very different battlefield this time around, right, with two very distinct policies. There's a real choice there when it comes to climate.\n\nDavid Speers: There's a big choice there now, absolutely, two very different visions as to what the Australian energy market and therefore the Australian economy should look like. And yes, there are big risks for Peter Dutton. It's hard to see how this and dropping any notion of a 2030 target going into the election, how that helps the Coalition win back those teal seats. They really do need to win back to have any chance at forming government. Now Peter Dutton will be hoping that this plays more strongly in the suburbs and the regions in particular, and there are a handful of seats where, yes, concerns over cost of living are much higher and this might be appealing to some, but the government's task is to really focus minds on what the cost of this nuclear alternative would be, both in terms of the debt the taxpayers would have to rack up and the power price impact as well. This is where the contest will be fought.\n\nSam Hawley: Yes, and these are two very different paths for Australia, two very different Australias, depending on who wins.\n\nDavid Speers: Yes, a renewable future or a nuclear future.\n\nSam Hawley: David Speers is the ABC's national political lead and the host of Insiders, which goes to air on Sunday mornings on ABC TV.

We factcheck seven key claims", "body": "The Coalition has made a range of claims about what nuclear energy could do for Australia, and why it is better than building solar and wind.\n\nWhat is the reality? We factcheck the key claims.\n\nNo evidence - such as economic modelling - has been produced to back up the opposition leader, Peter Dutton's main argument about nuclear energy: that it would make Australians' electricity bills cheaper than under a renewable-energy run grid and bring down other costs. As things stand, it is a baseless claim.\n\nThe CSIRO and the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) have assessed the cost of different electricity sources and found that solar and wind backed by storage energy, new transmission lines and other \"firming\" - what the country is building now, in other words - were the cheapest option.\n\nThey found nuclear generation would be significantly more expensive - the most expensive technology available - for consumers. They suggested Australia's first large-scale nuclear power plant (1GW capacity) could cost about $17bn, not counting finance costs. If a nuclear industry established that might eventually drop to $8.6bn.\n\nRelated: 'Raises red flags': Coalition nuclear power plan met with widespread scepticism from business groups\n\nSmall modular nuclear reactors (SMRs), a developing technology that the Coalition has suggested could be used in South Australia and Western Australia, are likely to be far more expensive again. They do not exist anywhere on a commercial basis. The leading proposal for an SMR in the US was last year cancelled due to rising cost.\n\nConfronted with this, the Coalition argues the nuclear experience in Ontario, Canada, demonstrates that nuclear energy is cheaper than Australian renewable energy.\n\nThis is not a relevant comparison. Like France, Ontario runs on nuclear plants built decades ago. Construction costs in the 1980s tell us nothing about the costs in the 2030s and 2040s.\n\nEven then, the claim electricity is cheaper in Ontario is misleading. Wholesale electricity prices - the only part of the bill that is affected by the cost of generation - in Ontario are actually higher than the cost of new firmed renewable energy in Victoria and Queensland.\n\nA more relevant comparison may be the ongoing construction of the large Hinkley C generator in the UK. It was initially expected to open in 2017 and cost about A$34bn. That has now been pushed out to 2031, and up to A$89bn.\n\nThere is no evidence it will.\n\nGas is the most expensive form of electricity generation currently used in the National Electricity Market, connecting the five eastern states and the ACT.\n\nThe price of gas is set on the international market - what fossil fuel companies can get by selling the gas in Asia. Nearly all Australian gas is exported. Opening a couple of new gas fields is not likely to materially change this.\n\nCurrently, gas is used in \"peaking\" plants that are turned on only when needed, at times of high demand. This is expected to continue for at least the next couple of decades. Gas-fired power provided less than 5% of total generation last year.\n\nThe Coalition has not explained how it would get more gas into the electricity grid. Would taxpayers pay to build several new gas power plants? It has also not explained how the resulting power could be as cheap as renewable energy.\n\nNo. Using more gas, less renewable energy and extending the life of coal-fired power plants will increase Australia's greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe Coalition admits this. It wants to abandon the country's 2030 emissions target and allow significantly more heat-trapping pollution while arguing it is still committed to net zero by 2050.\n\nAgain, no evidence has been released to explain how this would be possible. The experience in developed democracies internationally is that it would take much longer.\n\nThe Coalition says if it decided to build SMRs there could be \"two establishment projects\" in place by 2035. If it opts for large-scale plants it says first power would be in 2037.\n\nCSIRO found an initial nuclear power plant of any size would not be possible until after 2040. Other analysts, including the pro-nuclear Blueprint Institute, agree.\n\nThat's just the technology challenge. The Coalition would also have to get legislation through both houses of federal parliament to overturn a nuclear energy ban. Labor and most of the cross-bench oppose lifting the ban, and the Coalition is 20 seats short of a majority in the lower house and hasn't had a majority in the Senate since 2007.\n\nIt would also need to persuade three states that ban nuclear energy - and remain strongly committed to their current position - to change their laws.\n\nNo. It has a much smaller effect than factors related to fossil fuels.\n\nTony Wood, the energy and climate change program director for the Grattan Institute, says there was a 20% jump in wholesale electricity costs last year for four reasons: the war in Ukraine pushing up the price of gas; gas shortages; outages at ageing coal power plants reducing competition; and extreme weather causing flooding at coalmines. Prices have since started to come back down.\n\nThe renewable energy in the system has a smaller effect on price as the cost of incentive schemes is passed on, but it also helps reduce costs by increasing capacity and competition in the power grid.\n\nRelated: Peter Dutton names seven potential nuclear power station sites but avoids questions on cost\n\nThe coal-fired power plants in the grid are ageing, increasingly have units offline and need to be replaced. Evidence from government agencies and most independent experts is that renewable energy plus firming is the best path to an affordable, reliable, clean grid.\n\nNo. The lights are still on.\n\nCoalition MPs making this claim were referring to the findings of Aemo's \"electricity statement of opportunities\" report, which was portrayed as warning blackouts were imminent.\n\nThis misrepresents what the statement does. It is a message to the industry about how much more generation will be needed over time. This year's statement found there could be reliability gaps in NSW, Queensland, South Australia and Victoria unless there was faster deployment of renewable energy and batteries.\n\nThis is consistent with other warnings that investment has slowed and needs to accelerate. But Aemo did not say blackouts were inevitable, or that renewable energy would cause them.\n\nNo - again, based on evidence from experts and industry.\n\nThe energy and economic transformation is challenging whatever technology is used. But the electrons are the same, regardless of the source.\n\nIndustry leaders have repeatedly welcomed renewable energy investment. Rio Tinto this year signed what it called Australia's largest renewable energy power purchase agreement to run its operations in Gladstone.\n\nBlueScope Steel applauded the creation of an offshore windfarm zone in the Illawarra, saying it had the \"potential to supply significant quantities of renewable energy to help underpin BlueScope's decarbonisation of iron and steelmaking in Australia\".\n\nAemo has repeatedly found an optimal future power grid, including one that would power new green industries, would run on more than 90% renewable energy.\n\nOther countries, including those with some nuclear power, have similar goals. Both the US and Germany are targeting 80% renewable energy by 2030.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

As nuclear reactors need to be operational 24/7 and can't be switched on and off at short notice to cover peak demand times, where does Dutton suggest this water will come from for his chosen sites? Dam and river supplies will not suffice in times of drought, and the tritium and other radioactive substances released from nuclear plants are not suitable to be released into rivers that supply downstream towns and agricultural areas. Does his timeframe also include the decommissioning and deconstruction of the current coal-fired power plants, or does he propose to plonk them on top or next to the current power plants? And any plan for dealing with the radioactive nuclear waste produced that will remain radioactive for tens of thousands of years? Alan Marel, North Curl Curl\n\nCountries around the world have indicated they will impose trade barriers on other countries that are not pulling their weight in reducing their carbon emissions. It seems like the warning of Lee Kuan Yew in 1980, of Australia becoming the poor white trash of Asia, is part of Dutton's election policy. Bob Dillon, Bathurst\n\nThe Coalition intends to build up to seven nuclear power plants. I can't imagine there would be a skilled workforce large enough to build all of these simultaneously. If using an optimistic 15-year time span to build one reactor, we could anticipate the last one being completed in 2129. I assume the Coalition would be burning coal up to that point. Hopefully, the rest of the world doesn't have a Coalition timeline for addressing climate change. Unless we take strong climate action and burn a lot less fossil fuels, people in the future may be wearing gum boots while they sip coffee at Circular Quay cafes. Dennis O'Hara, Wanniassa (ACT)\n\nNuclear energy is disregarded by voters who are thoughtful, rational, logical, contemplative, reflective, intelligent. They believe the scientists from the CSIRO, who state that nuclear is more expensive than renewable energy and would take many years to build for the climate change that is happening now. I suggest that his plan for nuclear energy includes all nuclear waste to be dumped outside his home. Bea Hodgson, Gerringong\n\nIf Labor offers to subsidise batteries for homes and businesses for half the amount seven nuclear plants will cost, then Dutton will be done like slow-cooked mutton at the next election. Miles Lane, Manilla\n\nThe opposition's nuclear power fixation on top of the government's nuclear submarine plan reminds me of the old East German joke about the fellow ordering a new car. When told it will be delivered on 1 January 2040, he replies: Can you make it the afternoon, as I am having the power connected in the morning?

A theoretical 1,000MW nuclear plant built today would cost at least $8.6bn.\n\nBut Dutton claimed nuclear would be cheaper because \"a wind turbine project probably has an amortisation period, or a lifespan, of about two decades\" whereas nuclear has \"an 80-to-100 year amortisation period ... so the capital cost is spread over a longer period of time\".\n\n\"So, in terms of the current debate in the Illawarra, it's about $10bn over 20-to-30 years, the proponents say.\"\n\nAlbanese said the Coalition had made \"an announcement without any substance: no costings, no real timelines, [and] no idea of what form the reactors will be\".\n\n\"This is economic catastrophe,\" he told Sky News. \"When we look at the costs of nuclear, what we know is that it's the most expensive form of new energy.\"\n\n\"The Dutton opposition are saying in two decades we'll give you the most expensive form of energy there is.\"\n\nAlbanese pointed to state Coalition governments' record of selling government-owned power assets, and said the Coalition would \"struggle to assemble an Ikea flat pack\" let alone develop an industry the federal government had no record experience in.\n\nAlbanese noted the International Energy Agency, which is pro-nuclear, has nevertheless said it is not appropriate for Australia given its \"comparative advantages\" with wind and solar resources.\n\n\"Not only will this [nuclear] cost more, it will make energy supply insecure because there's no answer, either, of what happens between now and two decades' time for how energy supply is secured.\"\n\nAlbanese noted in its nine years in office to 2022, the Coalition had wanted to build new coal power plants \"and it ended up in zero\". He said the Coalition had also wanted to extend the life of existing coal plants but instead 14 announced closure \"on their watch\".\n\nAlbanese said it was \"tacky\" that the Coalition had invoked the late Labor prime minister, Bob Hawke, in their advocacy for nuclear because he \"can't speak for himself\" and had quoted him \"out of context\".\n\nEarlier, Taylor told Radio National there is an \"appropriate time and place\" for government ownership, citing the precedent of Robert Menzies in the 1950s.\n\nTaylor accused Labor of confusing government ownership with subsidies, revealing the Coalition expects nuclear \"to deliver a return on investment so it can be off-budget\" like the national broadband network and Australia Post.\n\nTaylor argued power prices could be reduced sooner than 2035-37 - the timescale the Coalition has put on the first two nuclear plants - because of \"shorter term strategies\" to use more gas in the meantime. Guardian Australia has previously reported that there is no evidence to suggest using gas would cut costs.\n\nThe Coalition has promised to abandon Labor's 2030 emissions reduction target of 43% on 2005 levels and proposed limiting or capping the amount of investment in large-scale renewables.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [],

The Albanese Labor government has refused to put nuclear on the table for debate, despite growing evidence the country is falling increasingly behind its 2030 emissions reduction and renewables targets.\n\nAi Group chief executive Innes Willox called for the Coalition vision to be fleshed out with more detail around cost, viability and timelines, pointing to the long delays and cost blowouts in installing reactors in other Western economies.\n\nHe also said the proposal does nothing to help with short-term emissions reductions, energy costs and reliability, and suggested it could kill off private investment in the sector if it effectively renationalises electricity in Australia.\n\nOthers pointed to numerous hurdles in the way of the development of a domestic nuclear power industry, including unanimous opposition from state premiers, the lack of a skilled workforce, as well as high costs, long lead times and the need to store highly toxic waste.\n\nAGL Energy, which owns one of the sites that would host a nuclear reactor, described the cost of the technology as \"prohibitive\", while Origin Energy chief executive Frank Calabria pointed to several challenges, including when it could be deployed, the cost and its compatibility with the existing market.\n\n\"They are all considerations because I don't think we can see it being scalable for many years, probably well into the next decade ... and the cost is uncertain at that scalable level right now,\" Mr Calabria told a business conference in Sydney.\n\n\"So it's not a decision that I think we can make immediately in order to achieve our goals today.\"\n\nOpposition Leader Peter Dutton did not give an estimate of the costs involved in building the seven nuclear reactors, two of which, in Western Australia and South Australia, would be small modular reactors.\n\nEnergyAustralia, which owns the Mount Piper site in Lithgow that would host a reactor, said it was focusing on rolling out existing, readily available technologies, including batteries, gas power and pumped hydro, as well as underpinning more renewables.\n\nAn EnergyAustralia spokeswoman said the company was \"technology neutral\" when it came to what would be required for the transition in the 2030s and beyond, while noting that nuclear technology \"needs a good regulatory framework and a well-developed industry to deliver support it\".\n\nShe said Energy Australia had not discussed the use of any of its sites in the context of nuclear.", "source": {"uri": "afr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian Financial Review"},

Nuclear power has been with us for many decades, supplying large amounts of emission-free power across a wide number of democratic, developed countries in Europe and North America. Why wouldn't we make use of a power source that can be turned up and down independent of the weather and which other developed nations have used for decades?\n\nWhat many Australians probably don't realise is that almost all of these nuclear power plants were constructed in the 1970s and 1980s. The technology was then largely abandoned as an option for new power supply. Over the 2000s there was talk of a renaissance of the technology as concerns around global warming grew, and the industry unveiled new \"generation 3\" designs to address nuclear meltdown risks. Yet this expected renaissance never eventuated, with just five generation 3 nuclear power plants under construction over the past decade across Europe and North America.\n\nThere is a very good reason for why the appetite to build new nuclear power stations in western nations that already have nuclear power is minimal. Fans of nuclear like to think this is just because of irrational fears of reactor meltdowns and radiation. But in reality it's got more to do with the fact that nuclear power plants cost too much to build.\n\nWhat several countries, particularly France and the United States, encountered during their nuclear build programs over the 1970s and 1980s was that the promised costs for nuclear reactors turned out to be badly underestimated. They also found that things didn't improve as they built more of these reactors - instead they got worse.\n\nOxford University professor Bent Flyvbjerg, an expert in construction management, has built up a large database of the time and budget records for 16,000 major construction projects across the globe covering a wide array of fields. He finds that nuclear reactors encounter the greatest budget and time blowouts in his database of construction projects, with the exception of just two other project types. One, worryingly, is nuclear waste repositories, which Australia would also need to build. The other is host city Olympic Games infrastructure. Interestingly, Flyvbjerg's database also reveals the projects which are most likely to achieve construction timeframes and budgets are wind and solar power.\n\nThe poor experience over the 1970s and 80s meant there was almost no new nuclear plant construction commitments in Europe and North America until the second half of the 2000s. The table below summarises the horrific budget blowouts with the five generation 3 reactors committed to construction since then. Of note is that the two projects in the US used the same reactor model Dutton has indicated he'd like to use - Westinghouse's AP1000. Also worth noting is actual real world experience indicates costs for nuclear per megawatt of capacity, which are significantly higher than the $8.6m estimated recently by the CSIRO.\n\nWhat we can see is that, contrary to the promises of nuclear technology companies, generation 3 designs did not improve on past experience of budget blow-outs. It should also be noted that one of these projects - Virgil C Summer - was abandoned prior to completion, as the cost blowouts became too great to bear. Unfortunately for South Carolina energy consumers, this was only after the expenditure of $13.5bn on the failed project.\n\nSo what does this all mean for you personally?\n\nContrary to Dutton's claims, it means you'll be paying more on your electricity bill. As the table above shows, exactly how much more will be subject to wide variation depending on how badly the construction process unfolds, as well as a range of other assumptions.\n\nIf we use Vogtle as an example, which is the one completed project that employed Dutton's favoured Westinghouse AP1000 technology, the extra cost to consumers would be very high. Power retailers would need to pay prices for wholesale energy at least three times higher than what they currently pay to recover the cost of this plant. For the average household that would result in an increase in their power bill in the realm of $1,000 per year from Dutton's plan to go nuclear.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType":

Michelle Pini reports.\n\nAPART from frequently changing leaders, nothing has changed about the Liberal-National Party Opposition for a very long time, certainly not since the Abbott/Turnbull/Morrison retrograde regime.\n\nPut simply, since the whole point of an opposition party in a two-party system is to provide credible alternative policies - not to recycle the ideas and innovations of a bygone era - today's Coalition is simply no longer fit for purpose.\n\nThis is perhaps best illustrated by Dutton's most recent set of alternative facts masquerading as policies, the recycled 1950s nuclear power plan.\n\nPeter Dutton's recycled nuclear contamination\n\nNuclear power is one hell of a way to boil water. ~ Albert Einstein\n\nSure, the Liberals/Nationals are the parties of the status quo but the fact is, they have taken this concept well past its natural use-by date. Basically, if this was the age of the telephone invention, Opposition Leader Peter Dutton and his band of unmerry naysayers would be advocating to keep tin cans and string because phones would put can and string manufacturers out of business -- not to mention the plight of carrier pigeon trainers.\n\nWait, that is actually the same reasoning that led to over a decade of third-world-standard NBN, but we digress.\n\nCarrier pigeons and tin cans notwithstanding, today, the Coalition want us to get behind a leader who, if elected, would catapult us back to an age before science, before technology and before we worked out the Earth wasn't flat -- in every facet of our lives.\n\nA word is needed about the role of the entire mainstream media, here, including the national broadcaster - yet again - in providing a framework where Dutton's idiotic ramblings are given prominence -- nay, are exalted as if they came from the Heavens.\n\nThere are so many subtle ways in which his party's every brain fart is reported in the media as a credible idea and Alan Austin's latest analysis provides a more detailed explanation of how the ABC's news coverage, in particular, subtly facilitates this Liberal Party agenda. (You can read more here.)\n\nSo, to summarise the Dutton Coalition \"policy platform\", it goes something like this:\n\nFinding it hard to keep up with the changing world? Need a scapegoat for your woes?\n\nThen, has Dutton got an idiotic plan, a minority group and a few gaslights, courtesy of the establishment media, for you?!\n\nIt is the exploitation of these core fears - the primal fears of change and of \"others\" - that form the basis of Dutton's Coalition \"policy structure\". It is the reason he does not provide any substantial \"detail\" in support of his claims. And it provides ongoing ammunition for the climate and culture wars he favours. It's really no more complicated than that.\n\nLet's take a close look at Dutton's banal nuclear \"power plan\", which has been presented as a legitimate argument in the legacy media.\n\nWhy nuclear power won't work in Australia -- yet another explainer\n\nWhile the Liberal Party continues its push for nuclear power in Australia, there are many reasons why renewables are a far better option.\n\nA NUCLEAR NIGHTMARE\n\nDutton - or at least the Coalition's expert advisers, assuming they still have any - is abundantly aware of the following:\n\nnuclear energy is not safe by any stretch of the imagination; it is not clean; it is prohibitively expensive; and a nuclear energy industry is unachievable, certainly in the foreseeable future.\n\nBut none of this matters to Dutton. The reason he is pushing for nuclear is plain: since any nuclear energy plan is unattainable for at least 20 years, it ensures his coal and gas mining mates can continue destroying our natural environment for a long, long time to come.\n\nWith the main game already established, it is only necessary to deflect and obfuscate, providing no \"details\", such as properly calculated costs or a realistic timeline. Even his claim that the first seven reactors would be built in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland was debunked by the state premiers, who have unanimously rejected the idea. According to one ABC report, even some state Liberal and National MPs have 'distanced themselves from nuclear'.\n\nIt's fine, though, according to Dutton, who may eventually give us the details after his party is elected.\n\nDutton's devoid-of-details nuclear plan an atomic failure\n\nGiven the absence of substance in Peter Dutton's nuclear policy so far, his 'lack-of-details' cry over The Voice must surely come back to haunt him.\n\nNO RENEWABLES FOR US!\n\nBecause the efficiency of renewable energies poses a real and imminent threat to fossil fuels, Dutton also plans to ensure any further great strides in this sector will die a quick and unceremonious death by imposing a cap on renewable energy investment.\n\nAnd because Dutton's plan is only about fear, he harnesses the fear of running out of power, or of exorbitant energy prices with idiotic statements like, \"We can't allow the lights to go out.\"\n\nThere is no informed debate. No detail (of which he was once so fond). Not even an attempt to appear informed.\n\nA point proved, yet again, by one of Dutton's unmerry naysayers, Keith Pitt, who told RN Breakfast yesterday (19 June) that nuclear is needed because:\n\n\"[Electricity] grids can't handle more than ten per cent wind and solar.\"\n\nUm... Keith, as the latest report from the Clean Energy Council points out, wind and solar already constitute almost 40 per cent of the national electricity market in Australia.\n\nOh, those pesky details!\n\nThen there are all the Indigenous and other community groups, environmental groups and scientific experts - occasionally consulted in the mainstream media and then summarily ignored - who have voiced their opposition to nuclear en masse.\n\nSuch as Climate Council CEO Amanda McKenzie who described Dutton's plan as:\n\n'A sickening smokescreen for its commitment to coal and gas...\n\nDutton's scheme is: let the climate burn, let the mega fires burn, let the sea levels rise, let the heat become unbearable. Let's send our children towards climate disaster.'\n\nBut not to worry, said Nationals Leader and would-be deputy prime minister, David Littleproud, confirming on Afternoon Briefing that the Coalition's nuclear plans would go ahead anyway:\n\n\"As part of a Coalition government [we] are prepared to make the tough decisions in the national interest.\"\n\nThat's right, bothersome particulars like scientific advice, environmental consequences, community consultation and possible atomic annihilation be damned! Oh, and we'll give you the details after we're elected.\n\nToday's Coalition is aptly headed by Peter Dutton, a climate-denying fossil, who would take us back to tin cans and string if this would appease his coal and gas mining mates.\n\nAs long as the Coalition remains mired in backward thinking such as this latest nuclear \"policy plan\", we will continue to put all its \"policies\" in inverted commas to indicate the absence of any credibility.\n\nToday's Liberal-National Party Coalition under Peter Dutton is simply not fit for purpose as a credible opposition party, let alone a serious government contender.\n\nFollow managing editor Michelle Pini on Twitter @vmp9.

That pursuit of quick riches has since been abandoned, but scientists are now using a similar idea to level up one of the world's most promising energy sources.\n\nTransmutex, a Swiss startup, is pioneering a new method for \"nuclear transmutation\" that not only destroys nuclear waste but can also turn it back into energy -- solving a key problem in nuclear energy production.\n\nScientists have long considered nuclear energy one of the cleanest and most reliable forms of energy production. However, the waste it creates must be stored in deep geological repositories for thousands of years to prevent the environment from being exposed to harmful radiation. Transmutex says its technology can \"transmute\" 99% of the world's high-level radioactive waste into new fuel.\n\nNagra, the Swiss agency that manages nuclear waste, validated the claim as a \"theoretical possibility\" in a letter to the company last month.\n\nSwitzerland, however, has pivoted away from nuclear energy, in part because of the safety concerns made apparent by Japan's Fukushima disaster in 2011. But such disasters are rare and many other countries -- like the United States and Saudi Arabia, for example -- are betting on nuclear energy as the most efficient and sustainable option.\n\n\"To reach our goal of net zero by 2050, we have to at least triple our current nuclear capacity,\" US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said in May.\n\nTech companies at the forefront of the AI revolution are also turning to nuclear energy to power their vast AI data centers.\n\nTransmutex CEO Franklin Servan-Schreiber believes the company can help these businesses go nuclear by destroying that long-term waste.\n\n\"If we know how to deal with the waste, even if it takes a long time, we still know that in the future there is a limit to that waste, which is not gonna be a million years. That's the key,\" he told Business Insider in an interview.\n\nA new fuel cycle for nuclear power\n\nTransmutex's technology uses high-energy subatomic particles known as neutrons to destroy highly radioactive nuclear waste. While it can take hundreds of thousands of years for nuclear waste to decay to safe radiation levels, Transmutex says its technology can shorten that timeframe to just decades.\n\nServan-Schreiber says that over time, this system can also turn that waste into fuel that can be used again in nuclear power plants -- a sort of nuclear recycling program.\n\n\"Because you're able to burn waste and release energy, overall the process is very profitable,\" Cameron Porter, a venture capitalist who manages Steel Atlas and is an investor in Transmutex, told Business Insider.\n\nNuclear physicists say the company's technology avoids one of the biggest concerns with nuclear energy: that the same fuel used to power nuclear plants can also be used to manufacture atomic weapons.\n\n\"We don't want that to happen,\" Andrei Afanasev, a professor of physics at George Washington University's Institute for Nuclear Studies, told Business Insider.\n\nTransmutex avoids this risk because it doesn't produce plutonium, a key element for making nuclear bombs.\n\nThe technology is also more efficient, Afanasev said. According to the Department of Energy, spent nuclear fuel can still have about 90% of its potential energy even after five\u202fyears of operation in a reactor.\n\nWith nuclear reactors, \"you just throw away a big chunk of energy that you could use for everybody,\" he said. \"So this technology addresses this issue. They can extract more energy from the existing fuel.\"\n\nAI firms on the lookout for energy solutions\n\nThe AI industry is looking for new, more reliable power sources as the race to develop artificial intelligence ramps up.\n\n\"Energy, not compute, will be the No. 1 bottleneck to AI progress,\" Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on the Dwarkesh Podcast in April, referring to the computational resources needed for training and running AI models.\n\nOklo, a startup backed by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, is betting on generating nuclear power through small nuclear reactors. Its Aurora reactor can run on spent nuclear waste.\n\nServan-Schreiber said nuclear power might be the only way to support the industry's massive energy demands.\n\n\"AI requires massive, industrial-scale amounts of energy,\" Servan-Schreiber said. \"Only nuclear power will be able to supply this massive energy demand in a reliable manner. With a technology like Transmutex (only one currently being proposed), the US can build classic uranium-based nuclear plants, such as the Vogtle plant in Georgia, without being burdened with high-level nuclear waste for hundreds of thousands of years.\"", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider India"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Michelle Pini reports.\n\nAPART from frequently changing leaders, nothing has changed about the Liberal-National Party Opposition for a very long time, certainly not since the Abbott/Turnbull/Morrison retrograde regime.\n\nPut simply, since the whole point of an opposition party in a two-party system is to provide credible alternative policies - not to recycle the ideas and innovations of a bygone era - today's Coalition is simply no longer fit for purpose.\n\nThis is perhaps best illustrated by Dutton's most recent set of alternative facts masquerading as policies, the recycled 1950s nuclear power plan.\n\nPeter Dutton's recycled nuclear contamination\n\nNuclear power is one hell of a way to boil water. ~ Albert Einstein\n\nSure, the Liberals/Nationals are the parties of the status quo but the fact is, they have taken this concept well past its natural use-by date. Basically, if this was the age of the telephone invention, Opposition Leader Peter Dutton and his band of unmerry naysayers would be advocating to keep tin cans and string because phones would put can and string manufacturers out of business - not to mention the plight of carrier pigeon trainers.\n\nWait, that is actually the same reasoning that led to over a decade of third-world-standard NBN, but we digress.\n\nCarrier pigeons and tin cans notwithstanding, today, the Coalition want us to get behind a leader who, if elected, would catapult us back to an age before science, before technology and before we worked out the Earth wasn't flat - in every facet of our lives.\n\nA word is needed about the role of the entire mainstream media, here, including the national broadcaster - yet again - in providing a framework where Dutton's idiotic ramblings are given prominence - nay, are exalted as if they came from the Heavens.\n\nThere are so many subtle ways in which his party's every brain fart is reported in the media as a credible idea and Alan Austin's latest analysis provides a more detailed explanation of how the ABC's news coverage, in particular, subtly facilitates this Liberal Party agenda. (You can read more here.)\n\nSo, to summarise the Dutton Coalition \"policy platform\", it goes something like this:\n\nIt is the exploitation of these core fears - the primal fears of change and of \"others\" - that form the basis of Dutton's Coalition \"policy structure\". It is the reason he does not provide any substantial \"detail\" in support of his claims. And it provides ongoing ammunition for the climate and culture wars he favours. It's really no more complicated than that.\n\nLet's take a close look at Dutton's banal nuclear \"power plan\", which has been presented as a legitimate argument in the legacy media.\n\nWhy nuclear power won't work in Australia - yet another explainer\n\nWhile the Liberal Party continues its push for nuclear power in Australia, there are many reasons why renewables are a far better option.\n\nA NUCLEAR NIGHTMARE\n\nDutton - or at least the Coalition's expert advisers, assuming they still have any - is abundantly aware of the following:\n\nBut none of this matters to Dutton. The reason he is pushing for nuclear is plain: since any nuclear energy plan is unattainable for at least 20 years, it ensures his coal and gas mining mates can continue destroying our natural environment for a long, long time to come.\n\nWith the main game already established, it is only necessary to deflect and obfuscate, providing no \"details\", such as properly calculated costs or a realistic timeline. Even his claim that the first seven reactors would be built in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland was debunked by the state premiers, who have unanimously rejected the idea. According to one ABC report, even some state Liberal and National MPs have 'distanced themselves from nuclear'.\n\nIt's fine, though, according to Dutton, who may eventually give us the details after his party is elected.\n\nDutton's devoid-of-details nuclear plan an atomic failure\n\nGiven the absence of substance in Peter Dutton's nuclear policy so far, his 'lack-of-details' cry over The Voice must surely come back to haunt him.\n\nNO RENEWABLES FOR US!\n\nBecause the efficiency of renewable energies poses a real and imminent threat to fossil fuels, Dutton also plans to ensure any further great strides in this sector will die a quick and unceremonious death by imposing a cap on renewable energy investment.\n\nAnd because Dutton's plan is only about fear, he harnesses the fear of running out of power, or of exorbitant energy prices with idiotic statements like, \"We can't allow the lights to go out.\"\n\nThere is no informed debate. No detail (of which he was once so fond). Not even an attempt to appear informed.\n\nA point proved, yet again, by one of Dutton's unmerry naysayers, Keith Pitt, who told RN Breakfast yesterday (19 June) that nuclear is needed because:\n\nUm... Keith, as the latest report from the Clean Energy Council points out, wind and solar already constitute almost 40 per cent of the national electricity market in Australia.\n\nOh, those pesky details!\n\nThen there are all the Indigenous and other community groups, environmental groups and scientific experts - occasionally consulted in the mainstream media and then summarily ignored - who have voiced their opposition to nuclear en masse.\n\nSuch as Climate Council CEO Amanda McKenzie who described Dutton's plan as:\n\nBut not to worry, said Nationals Leader and would-be deputy prime minister, David Littleproud, confirming on Afternoon Briefing that the Coalition's nuclear plans would go ahead anyway:\n\nThat's right, bothersome particulars like scientific advice, environmental consequences, community consultation and possible atomic annihilation be damned! Oh, and we'll give you the details after we're elected.\n\nToday's Coalition is aptly headed by Peter Dutton, a climate-denying fossil, who would take us back to tin cans and string if this would appease his coal and gas mining mates.\n\nAs long as the Coalition remains mired in backward thinking such as this latest nuclear \"policy plan\", we will continue to put all its \"policies\" in inverted commas to indicate the absence of any credibility.\n\nToday's Liberal-National Party Coalition under Peter Dutton is simply not fit for purpose as a credible opposition party, let alone a serious government contender.\n\nSubscribe NOW to receive editorials like this one (usually only available to subscribers) directly to your inbox and access all our work.", "source": {"uri": "unitedkingdomnews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "United Kingdom News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._P._Dutton", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "E.

From Western Australia to the east coast, front pages are dominated by takes on the Coalition's announcement it will seek, if elected at the next election, to build seven nuclear reactors in five states. It's hard to find a positive angle among the barrage of articles: the most encouraging spin comes from News Corp papers, which have highlighted the fact voters will be asked to decide their own energy future at the ballot box.\n\n\"Energy referendum gamble: Dutton's historic power play\" reads the top line of The Australian, above an all-caps headline saying \"Voters' nuclear option\". The Daily Telegraph called it Dutton's \"Nuclear strike\", arguing it would set up an \"energy election\". The Australian Financial Review's Phillip Coorey also focused on the fact voters will get a say in the matter, writing that Coalition electorates earmarked for possible reactors are feeling positive about the prospect, but pointing out it's \"one of the riskiest plays by an opposition since John Hewson released Fightback more than a year before the 1993 election\".\n\nGuardian Australia leads with a story saying: \"'No credible reason' to expect cheaper power bills under Peter Dutton's plan, experts say\". The ABC reports: \"Nuclear proposal rejected by premiers, who say Dutton has no power to lift state nuclear bans\" (more on that below).\n\nThe West Australian has a splash on its website saying: \"Dutton's nuclear energy plan bedevilled by unknowns\". And so on and so on. At least no one can claim Dutton doesn't know how to set a news agenda.\n\nNUCLEAR REACTIONS\n\nHow are the local politicians in the areas where Dutton wants to build nuclear reactors feeling about the idea? In Queensland, where the federal Coalition would like to build two reactors, Liberal-National Party state leader David Crisafulli said on Tuesday he would not repeal the state's nuclear ban and added nuclear was \"not on our plan, not on our agenda\", per Guardian Australia. Crisafulli is campaigning for an election that will be held in October. Labor Premier Steven Miles wasn't impressed either: \"We've been very clear about the fact that we don't believe in that model,\" he said, according to The Courier-Mail.\n\nNSW would also get two reactors under the proposal, but some state Coalition MPs feel negative about the idea there, too. Nationals MP Paul Toole, whose electorate would be a proposed reactor site, said \"the announcement lacks detail and raises more questions than answers. I'll be backing the views of my community 100%,\" according to The Daily Telegraph. Dave Layzell, another Nationals MP whose electorate would be impacted, said: \"I do not accept a federal government decision to lob a facility onto the community of the Upper Hunter.\"\n\nLabor Premier Chris Minns said he had no plans to repeal the state's nuclear ban: \"Our ban stays in place, we're not repealing it. I'd be surprised if the NSW Liberal and National party want to repeal it as well.\"\n\nIn Victoria, where Dutton wants to build one reactor, Premier Jacinta Allan said, according to the Herald Sun: \"We won't stand for that. We absolutely will not stand for that ... it is unfathomable\".\n\nIn Western Australia, a Labor stronghold where another reactor was proposed, state Energy Minister Reece Whitby said the plan was \"a recipe for disaster\", according to the ABC.\n\nThat leaves South Australia, where Dutton wants two reactors. Labor Premier Peter Malinauskas might be the Labor leader most warm to the idea of nuclear power, but even he wasn't down with the Coalition plan. \"I would support nuclear power unless it makes electricity more expensive, and all the evidence says that it will make electricity a lot more expensive,\" he said, according to news.com.au.\n\nON A LIGHTER NOTE...\n\nTalk about a vintage: archeologists have found an urn in Spain containing wine that's more than 2,000 years old. The newspaper El Pais reports: \"The finding supersedes the Speyer wine bottle, discovered in 1867 and dated between 325 and 350 AD, which is preserved in the Historical Museum of Pfalz (Germany) and considered the world's oldest known bottle of wine.\"\n\nThe new discovery was made at a Roman necropolis in the city of Carmona in Spani's southern Andalusia region. While the urn was actually filled with white wine, the liquid had turned red with age. Before you entertain any notions of having a sip, however, consider the fact there was a skeleton submerged in the booze.\n\nSay What?\n\nWe will do everything to prevent the secession of the rich.\n\nIn Italy, a proposal to reward authorities in areas of the country that run their affairs efficiently with more power has exposed a \"deep wound in Italy's national psyche\", Politico reports. The proposed law has exposed a geographic divide, amid accusations the Giorgia Meloni government is \"abandoning\" the poorer south in favour of the wealthy, industrialised north. Tensions came to a boil last week when a fistfight erupted in Parliament. Ruotolo, a centre-left MP from Naples, was one of the critics who used their words to oppose the proposal.\n\nPutin says Russia and North Korea will help each other if attacked, taking ties to a 'new level' (CNN)\n\nDutch leader Mark Rutte clears a big hurdle to becoming NATO chief after Hungary lifts objections (Associated Press)\n\nIn South China Sea dispute, Philippines' bolder hand tests Beijing (Reuters)\n\nTHE COMMENTARIAT\n\nCivil war, what civil war? The so-called Tory moderates never even put up a fight -- Rafael Behr (The Guardian): \"[Conservative] ministers have resorted to pleading with voters not to give Keir Starmer too big a majority. There is a deficit of drama in the contest to be prime minister. The gap is filled with speculation over the size and character of Britain's next opposition.\n\nConvention dictates that this be construed as a civil war. On one side is the remnant of the traditional Tory party that David Cameron led until 2016. These are MPs who mostly voted remain and endorsed Theresa May's Brexit deal. They venerate fiscal discipline and managerial sobriety. They are moderate, at least by demeanour and in comparison with the other side -- a messy coalition of nationalist demagogues, social reactionaries, libertarian ultras and Brexit puritans who hanker for congress with Nigel Farage's Reform party. In reality, the lines are blurred. Vibes count for more than policy.\"\n\nPeter Dutton's expensive nuclear folly another deplorable outcome after ditching carbon pricing scheme -- Tom Dusevic (The Australian) ($): \"If voters decide they want to have nuclear power to achieve net zero by 2050, it won't come cheap: higher debt and taxes and the heavy hand of government ownership that has bequeathed money pits like the NBN and Snowy 2.0.\n\nThere is no other way because private capital won't go anywhere near this risky energy play, with huge upfront costs, very long lead times and the madness that has pervaded our energy transition to meet international obligations. Peter Dutton is all the way with enriched uranium, with details to follow, presumably on costs, benefits and how we'll cover the period before the first power plants are online in 2035 and 2037.\n\nA new government business enterprise may be \"off-budget\", as many of today's green industry and decarbonisation measures are, but their funding and finan\u00adcing won't be a free lunch. This is pure folly with taxpayers' money at this time, in this way.\"", "source": {"uri": "crikey.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Crikey"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anton_nilsson@crikey.com.au",

A journo came panting back in from a job and gabbled out his story to McKenzie, concluding with the words \"and the most amazing thing is, it's actually true!\"\n\nMcKenzie is said to have bellowed across the newsroom: \"True story alert, folks! Repeat: We have a TRUE STORY!\"\n\nPolitical leaders make policy decisions based on all kinds of factors -- too often, the driving force is a sickly alloy of cowardice and polling.\n\nThe one that Peter Dutton rolled out today, however, is different. And certainly the riskiest gambit from opposition in many moons. He genuinely believes nuclear is the answer to Australia's energy problems and is confident that the details (yet to be established) will vindicate him.\n\nIn other words: \"Genuine conviction alert, folks! We have a GENUINELY HELD BELIEF here!\"\n\nThere is no chance Dutton and his climate and energy spokesman Ted O'Brien, another nuclear true believer, are basing this decision on polling, unless they're reading it upside down.\n\nA national energy survey conducted last month by the research company RedBridge, which asked 2,000 respondents how they felt about various energy sources, put public support for nuclear at 35 per cent. Coal was the only less popular option, at 28 per cent. Solar was at 80 per cent.\n\nDutton has been a highly effective opposition leader for two years now. Just surviving as Liberal leader for two years after a sickening election loss is a triumph, historically speaking. But Dutton has built support, and has a united party room. Or has had, until now.\n\nThis success has been built on caution. He keeps a fairly low profile, and has built political capital among his colleagues by being consultative and concentrating his efforts on criticising the government's errors rather than making his own.\n\nToday, Peter Dutton has taken every single chip he's amassed, and he's put the whole lot on yellowcake.\n\nHe's announced a full-strength tilt at nuclear power for Australia, said the first plant will be up and running within 13 years, doesn't know how much it will cost, but does hold out the promise that it will bring rivers of cheap energy to Australia just like it has in France (which started building nuclear power stations in the 1970s).\n\nWhere will the plants go? Mostly in National Party seats, and they're all on board, says Nats leader David Littleproud. Easy.\n\nWhere will the nuclear waste go? Probably on the sites of the reactors, came the opposition leader's response when questioned at his press conference today. The \"no big deal\" tone to his reply was sharpened by his observation that the average volume of radioactive waste emitted by the proposed reactors would fit into \"a can of Coke\". (One assumes that this is not actually the formal storage plan proposed, but in the absence of another model it's all we have at this stage.)\n\nNuclear has full-throated support from certain parts of the Coalition's party room, and among the high-volume, low-viewership opinion vendors who ply their trade on Sky as the evening shadows lengthen.\n\nBut among the broader population, there is a perceptible and fascinating pattern. Men don't mind nuclear - 51 per cent expressed approval in the RedBridge survey - but women really, really don't; only 19 per cent approved, and 40 per cent expressly disapproved.\n\nThe strongest support for nuclear is found among Coalition voters (52 per cent), the over-65s (47 per cent), people who own their houses outright (42 per cent) and people who describe themselves as under \"no housing stress at all\" (52 per cent).\n\nPeter Dutton has spent two years declaring that the cost of living is the biggest issue Australians face. But the solution he's proposing also happens to be the least attractive to the people with whom he's trying hardest to emote.\n\nHis job now is to convince them that an Australian government led by him can -- in just 15 years and at as-yet undisclosed national expense -- generate cheap power.\n\nIf elected, he would also need to convince state governments to cooperate in NSW, Victoria, SA and his home state of Queensland, where even the state LNP leader David Crisafulli, who quite possibly will be premier within months, today issued a polite \"no, thank you\" to Dutton's plan.\n\nThe whole thing certainly relieves John Hewson -- author of the GST-toting Fightback package that the Coalition took to the 1993 election to a large and sustained round of voter indifference -- of his mantle as the most courageous Liberal opposition leader in modern history.\n\nContacted today, Hewson did not appear to entertain any camaraderie with Dutton's policy boldness.\n\n\"The comparison is most insulting, given the detailed policy work -- including costings -- in Fightback,\" he said.\n\n\"This is the scam of the year. No detail, no costings.\"\n\nThe opposition leader is correct that high power prices -- and the exposure of Australian households to power shortages, and the concern over sacrifice of farming land to wind farms and transmission lines -- are genuine issues of concern to Australians.\n\nBut committing untold volumes of public money to speed-build reactors about which voters are already nervous ... well. Only a true believer would attempt such a thing. Which is what Dutton is, when it comes to nuclear.\n\nHe's not the first leader to feel this way: John Howard floated nuclear after a long consultation process in 2007, and was promptly flattened by Kevin Rudd and Wayne Swan who toured Australia sweetly asking voters how they'd feel about a reactor in their backyard. Bob Hawke was a fan, but didn't have a crack at it while in an actual position to do so.\n\nIn whipping this decision through the shadow cabinet and then an online meeting of the party room, Dutton has also put his greatest political asset -- party stability -- on the table. Every marginal seat MP or candidate attempting to win back metropolitan seats for the Liberal Party will now be obliged to talk about nuclear power stations, when they'd prefer to be talking about the cost of living under Labor.\n\nUp until now, the opposition leader has enjoyed -- among his own colleagues -- a reputation for caution, for keeping the party a small target, and for capitalising on the government's mistakes rather than bolting out and making his own.\n\nNot any more, folks. Peter Dutton has today placed a staggering bet on his own ability to sell Australians something they presently don't want, at a price yet to be determined. They don't make targets bigger than this.", "source": {"uri": "abc.net.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

I sincerely doubt that the opposition has sought an opinion on that.\"\n\nOn the coalition's pledge that the first two nuclear power plants would be built between 2035 and 2037, Associate Professor Wagner said it was \"extremely unlikely\".\n\n\"It is undoubtedly extremely difficult to build them and highly technical,\" he said.\n\n\"We don't have the human capital here in Australia to be able to do that on our own.\n\n\"Even if we were able to procure the right people to build it, I sincerely doubt that it would be built by 2035 ... it's just not feasible.\"\n\nMr Dutton said the planned rollout is sensible and achievable.\n\nThe CSIRO last month reported the first nuclear plants would not be achieved until 2040 at the earliest.\n\nEnergy Minister Chris Bowen said the announcement produced many more questions than answers.\n\n\"The Liberals and Nationals promised you a sensible energy plan. Instead, they're giving you a risky nuclear scam,\" he said.\n\n\"We know that nuclear is too expensive, too slow to build, and too risky for energy reliability.\"\n\nGet the latest news from

Where will they go? That's the big question, where will they go?\" Stefanovic pressed.\n\nHis line of questioning prompted a swift response from Ms Ley who remained tight-lipped on the finer details of the Coalition's nuclear plan.\n\n\"You wouldn't expect me to have a scoop at 7am on your program,\" Ms Ley hit back.\n\n\"But what I will say... we will consult with communities unlike this government that is forcing renewable energy solutions on communities like the Hunter, like the south-west of WA with offshore wind, communities not been consulted on.\n\n\"So consultation is critical to this and we've always said that and it will remain at the core of the policies that we bring forward. Communities matter.\"\n\nAsked how the Coalition would maneuver around state bans on building nuclear power facilities, Ms Ley said the Coalition would \"work through\" that detail and had a \"sensible proposition to put to the Australian people\".", "source": {"uri": "skynews.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sky News Australia"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adriana_mageros@skynews.com.au", "name": "Adriana Mageros", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition_(Western_Australia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Opposition (Western Australia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sussan_Ley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sussan Ley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Dutton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peter Dutton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_(Australia)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coalition (Australia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_reactor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear reactor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_cabinet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shadow cabinet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian Government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_United_Kingdom_general_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2010 United Kingdom general election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_News_Australia", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sky News Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Energy policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Australia", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liberal Party of Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Telegraph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian Labor Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Australian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Australian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliamentary group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latrobe_Valley", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Latrobe Valley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_neutrality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carbon neutrality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Region", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Region"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New South Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New South Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Queensland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Queensland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western Australia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Western Australia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Management", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Consulting", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear Pharmacy", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/dceb6bb036b8cf30aed03eda002a28e8", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662030", "eventUri": "eng-9662030", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

I sincerely doubt that the opposition has sought an opinion on that.\"\n\nOn the coalition's pledge that the first two nuclear power plants would be built between 2035 and 2037, Prof Wagner said it was \"extremely unlikely\", citing a lack of human capital.\n\n\"It is undoubtedly extremely difficult to build them and highly technical,\" he said.\n\n\"Even if we were able to procure the right people to build it, I sincerely doubt that it would be built by 2035 ... it's just not feasible.\"\n\nMr Dutton said the planned rollout is sensible and achievable.\n\nThe CSIRO in May reported the

Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in.\n\nScientists have long considered nuclear energy one of the cleanest and most reliable forms of energy production. However, the waste it creates must be stored in deep geological repositories for thousands of years to prevent the environment from being exposed to harmful radiation. Transmutex says its technology can \"transmute\" 99% of the world's high-level radioactive waste into new fuel.\n\nNagra, the Swiss agency that manages nuclear waste, validated the claim as a \"theoretical possibility\" in a letter to the company last month.\n\nSwitzerland, however, has pivoted away from nuclear energy, in part because of the safety concerns made apparent by Japan's Fukushima disaster in 2011. But such disasters are rare and many other countries -- like the United States and Saudi Arabia, for example -- are betting on nuclear energy as the most efficient and sustainable option.\n\n\"To reach our goal of net zero by 2050, we have to at least triple our current nuclear capacity,\" US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said in May.\n\nTech companies at the forefront of the AI revolution are also turning to nuclear energy to power their vast AI data centers.\n\nTransmutex CEO Franklin Servan-Schreiber believes the company can help these businesses go nuclear by destroying that long-term waste.\n\n\"If we know how to deal with the waste, even if it takes a long time, we still know that in the future there is a limit to that waste, which is not gonna be a million years. That's the key,\" he told Business Insider in an interview.\n\nTransmutex's technology uses high-energy subatomic particles known as neutrons to destroy highly radioactive nuclear waste. While it can take hundreds of thousands of years for nuclear waste to decay to safe radiation levels, Transmutex says its technology can shorten that timeframe to just decades.\n\nServan-Schreiber says that over time, this system can also turn that waste into fuel that can be used again in nuclear power plants -- a sort of nuclear recycling program.\n\n\"Because you're able to burn waste and release energy, overall the process is very profitable,\" Cameron Porter, a venture capitalist who manages Steel Atlas and is an investor in Transmutex, told Business Insider.\n\nNuclear physicists say the company's technology avoids one of the biggest concerns with nuclear energy: that the same fuel used to power nuclear plants can also be used to manufacture atomic weapons.\n\n\"We don't want that to happen,\" Andrei Afanasev, a professor of physics at George Washington University's Institute for Nuclear Studies, told Business Insider.\n\nTransmutex avoids this risk because it doesn't produce plutonium, a key element for making nuclear bombs.\n\nThe technology is also more efficient, Afanasev said. According to the Department of Energy, spent nuclear fuel can still have about 90% of its potential energy even after five\u202fyears of operation in a reactor.\n\nWith nuclear reactors, \"you just throw away a big chunk of energy that you could use for everybody,\" he said. \"So this technology addresses this issue. They can extract more energy from the existing fuel.\"\n\nThe AI industry is looking for new, more reliable power sources as the race to develop artificial intelligence ramps up.\n\n\"Energy, not compute, will be the No. 1 bottleneck to AI progress,\" Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on the Dwarkesh Podcast in April, referring to the computational resources needed for training and running AI models.\n\nOklo, a startup backed by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, is betting on generating nuclear power through small nuclear reactors. Its Aurora reactor can run on spent nuclear waste.\n\nServan-Schreiber said nuclear power might be the only way to support the industry's massive energy demands.\n\n\"AI requires massive, industrial-scale amounts of energy,\" Servan-Schreiber said. \"Only nuclear power will be able to supply this massive energy demand in a reliable manner. With a technology like Transmutex (only one currently being proposed), the US can build classic uranium-based nuclear plants, such as the Vogtle plant in Georgia, without being burdened with high-level nuclear waste for hundreds of thousands of years.\"", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri":

But given the Coalition had been setting the agenda since the May budget, which the opinion polls show is paying dividends, why stop now?\n\nParliament resumes on Monday for another fortnight and Dutton is not perturbed at what he knows will be coming from the government.\n\n\"He wants the fight,\" said a colleague.\n\nMoreover, once upon a time, advocating nuclear power was political suicide. Now Dutton is proposing seven nuclear plants in Coalition electorates, but not before polling them to gauge sentiment.\n\nClearly that sentiment was deemed favourable enough, especially when accompanied by the offer of cut-price power for locals, to enable the policy announcement to proceed.\n\nIt is understood there was 55 per cent support in the seat of Gippsland for a power plant on the site of the Loy Yang coal station. Support was 60 per cent in another of the seats.\n\nThe Coalition is not ruling out releasing more detail, such as cost, but wanted to get the sites on the record to kneecap a growing government campaign which featured beautiful coastal landscapes blighted by nuclear power plants.\n\nThe Albanese government began carpet-bombing Dutton's nuclear plans about a month ago, suggesting it, too, was picking up positive vibes towards the concept of nuclear power.\n\nThat campaign will intensify over coming months given this issue, which Dutton is conflating with the cost of living, will be front and centre come election time.\n\nLabor would be well advised to mount its attack on fact - cost, achievability, believability and plausibility - and not demonise a power source that is more popular than coal, but still lags solar, gas, wind and hydrogen, as the most recent The Australian Financial Review/Freshwater Strategy poll reaffirmed.\n\nThe same poll showed Dutton's stature had grown while Labor was being marked down on its handling of climate change and the cost of living.\n\nThe question now is whether Dutton has pushed it too far with an uncosted announcement and will be deemed by voters to have over-egged the pudding?", "source": {"uri": "afr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian Financial Review"}, "authors": [{"uri": "phillip_coorey@afr.com", "name": "Phillip Coorey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_(Australia)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coalition (Australia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_plant", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear power plant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uninterruptible_power_supply", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uninterruptible power supply"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indigenous Australians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photovoltaic_power_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photovoltaic power station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-emissions_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zero-emissions vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric power transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_generator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric generator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dividend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanese_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Albanese government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Financial_Review", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Financial Review"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gippsland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gippsland"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landscape", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Landscape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_living", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cost of living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Labor Party"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear Pharmacy", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2856%2C$multiply_3%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/c_scale%2Cw_800%2Cq_88%2Cf_jpg/t_afr_opinion_no_age_social_wm/2673badb06c714e3ab22e880d6fe57660fdeb16d", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662030", "eventUri": "eng-9662030", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

They said adding more gas power could also increase greenhouse gas emissions, accelerating the climate crisis.\n\nTristan Edis, a director with the firm Green Energy Markets, said the wholesale electricity price was set by the most expensive fuel being used at any given time. Those prices were \"very high\" - between $250 and $300 per megawatt hour of electricity, about three times the average price - whenever fast-start gas plants were used to complement cheaper coal, solar, wind and hydro energy.\n\nGas currently provides less than 5% of electricity in the national electricity market, and is only called on when needed to meet demand.\n\nEdis said if a Coalition government put a hold on investment in solar and windfarms and boosted gas power so that it was replacing coal and always setting the price, \"you're talking about an increase of $500 to potentially even $1,000 per annum for a household power bill\".\n\nDr Roger Dargaville, an associate professor and the interim director of the Monash Energy Institute, said it was difficult to predict what the Coalition's announcement would mean for bills due to a lack of detail, but agreed the increase in an annual bill could be $1,000.\n\n\"It seems the options being presented will either lead to extraordinary maintenance bills to keep old coal plants going or using a lot more gas,\" he said. \"Coal is a very cheap fuel, so if you're going from a coal-dominated system to a gas-dominated system, you are going to see very steep energy prices.\"\n\nDargaville said more renewable energy backed by \"firming\" support - including energy storage, new transmission lines and gas power only when required - was \"the only sensible option and almost certainly the least cost option\".\n\nDr Dylan McConnell, an energy systems researcher at the University of New South Wales, agreed that using more gas-fired power would push up prices for consumers.\n\nHe estimated the increase in annual bills, if gas replaced renewable energy as the main new energy source over the next decade, could be $400 or $500.\n\n\"If you slow the rollout of renewable energy and backfill with gas we're talking about quite a large cost,\" McConnell said.\n\nThe analysts' estimates are at odds with the Coalition's claim that its approach would lead to \"cheaper, cleaner and consistent electricity\" compared with the Albanese government's goal of 82% of generation coming from renewable sources by 2030.\n\nThe shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, told the ABC's Radio National on Thursday that power prices could be reduced under the Coalition before nuclear came online because of \"shorter-term strategies\" including using more gas.\n\nThe opposition has said it would make announcements on gas and renewable energy before the election. Coalition MPs have signalled they may offer more support for household solar systems, but stall investment in the large-scale renewable developments. The Nationals leader, David Littleproud, has argued \"we won't need them\".\n\nDutton said he wanted the commonwealth to build nuclear plants on the site of existing or past coal-fired plants in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia and South Australia.\n\nBut he has not released the cost of the plants, explained how the Coalition would lift legislated federal and state bans on nuclear power, or said why he believed the first two plants could be operating by 2035 or 2037 - a much faster timeframe than experts say would be possible.\n\nOn Friday, progressive thinktank the Australia Institute released the results of a survey of 1,005 Australians that it commissioned from the firm Dynata in May.\n\nIt found nearly two-thirds (65%) said they were not prepared to pay extra to have nuclear power in the mix.\n\nHowever, nearly one-quarter of respondents said they would be prepared to pay more to introduce nuclear. About 4% said they were prepared to pay more than $500 extra a year.\n\nThe executive director of the Australia Institute, Richard Denniss, said it showed that \"residents across the country, regardless of who they vote for, don't support a nuclear future that requires them pay more for electricity than they already do\".", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Federal and state Labor leaders and the union movement quickly began posting improbable and downright ridiculous ways to try and undermine nuclear power.\n\nDeformed pets, references to The Simpsons, toxic spills causing three-eyed fish and images suggesting the sites might be located near iconic natural wonders such as Victoria's Twelve Apostles were just some of the immature games being played by parliamentarians.\n\nI did say yesterday that the mother of all scare campaigns would soon start but I didn't think it would be quite this pathetic.\n\nThe Australian Union movement suggested the family dog would become deformed as a result of Peter Dutton's nuclear power proposal\n\nVictorian Premier Jacinta Allan's team produced this Simpsons-inspired meme - with Ms Allan slamming nuclear power as 'toxic'\n\nAssistant Minister for Competition, Charities and Treasury Dr Andrew Leigh shared a photoshopped image of Blinky Bill with three eyes\n\nIt isn't as though there aren't serious problems with Dutton's announcement - I'll come to those shortly.\n\nVictoria's new premier Jacinta Allan, no less, posted mocked up images of three-eyed cartoon fish leaping out of the water in Gippsland, writing: 'The Liberal Party want a toxic and expensive nuclear reactor in Gippsland.'\n\nAnthony Albanese's contribution wasn't much better: 'Instead of Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, this is Peter Dutton and the seven nuclear reactors'.\n\nI wonder how long it took the PM's taxpayer funded team of 11 media advisers to come up with that one. Or did Albo proudly think it up all on his own?\n\nPoll\n\nDo you think Australia should embrace a nuclear power future?\n\nYes, nuclear energy is the way forward 121 votes No, I prefer renewables 10 votes We need a mix of both nuclear and renewables 25 votes\n\nSeizing upon The Simpsons theme, Victorian federal MP Josh Burns tweeted images of nuclear reactors with the Liberal Party logo on them, writing 'under Peter Dutton Australians will glow green'.\n\nClever stuff.\n\nDr Andrew Leigh - one of Labor's brainiacs, having completed his PhD at Harvard - shared a Photoshopped image of Blinky Bill with three eyes.\n\nThe guy used to be a professor. Does serving in parliament lower one's IQ?\n\nAt 62 years of age Labor MP for the Victorian seat of Corangamite, Libby Cocker, wasn't too mature to take a similar dig, days before Dutton's announcement.\n\nThe federal Victorian MP riffed off the 'where the bloody hell are you' tourism campaign of yesteryear spearheaded by Lara Bingle.\n\nCocker, who was a school teacher before entering politics, tweeted a mock up of a bikini-clad Bingle standing in front of the 12 Apostles on the Victorian coastline with three nuclear reactors billowing smoke behind her.\n\nThere really must be something in the water in Victoria - before the nuclear waste arrives as is being alleged.\n\nThe Simpsons references were running thick and fast\n\nThe Australian Manufacturing Workers Union shared an image of a Chernobyl-style dystopia\n\nThe Australian union movement's official X page posted an image of a deformed something or another, it was hard to tell, above the headline 'this will be your family dog'.\n\nScare campaigns are rarely rooted in accuracy, and that is a bipartisan problem. But they are rarely this childish in nature.\n\nIt will be interesting to see if these callow MPs and vested interests continue to act this way, or sharpen up their attacks in the weeks and months ahead.\n\nHistory tells us that scare campaigns work, especially against big bold policy ideas raised by Oppositions. But do they work when they are this low brow?\n\nAs mentioned earlier on, if anyone wants to seriously critique Dutton's policy there is plenty to dig into without having to resort to juvenile antics.\n\nFor example, Dutton says he plans to use existing coal fired power sites and the government will pay for and own the operations.\n\nBut most of the private owners of these sites have already ruled out relinquishing them to a Coalition government, and they weren't consulted before the policy was announced.\n\nBefore Dutton revealed where the reactors would be placed, Labor MP Libby Coker shared this meme, inspired by Lara Bingle's famous Tourism Australia ad\n\nMost of the sites Dutton has announced are in states that have legislatively banned nuclear power, and a number of these Premiers have already ruled out changing that.\n\nThe policy hasn't been costed, much less modelled to ascertain what taxpayers might be up for if or when construction was to begin.\n\nWe don't even know who the Coalition engaged to produce this policy. Is it rooted in any scholarly research beyond a superficial thought bubble announcement?\n\nWe're also still in the dark about which types of nuclear reactors the Opposition is proposing to build: the new smaller modules or the more established larger varieties used in other parts of the world?\n\nIt is a pretty basic choice - and it was not included in a major policy announcement.\n\nSo yes, there are serious questions for serious people to raise requiring serious answers before Team Dutton can expect Australians to get behind his proposal.\n\nUnfortunately the Labor government and its union mates seem largely incapable of reaching high and properly challenging the policy announcement.\n\nInstead they choose to play in the sandpit on social media.\n\nNo wonder the public has such a dim view of the political class.", "source": {"uri": "expressdigest.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "expressdigest.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

[Opposition Leader] Peter Dutton and David Littleproud as part of a Coalition government are prepared to make the tough decisions in the national interest,\" Mr Littleproud told ABC's Afternoon Briefing.\n\n\"Ultimately, we need strong leadership in this country to have the courage of its convictions to follow through and to make the tough calls in the nation's interest.\"\n\nMr Littleproud said the Coalition would undertake a lengthy two-and-a-half-year consultation, and would seek a national mandate through the federal election.\n\nMr Dutton said yesterday he was confident earmarked communities would back the Coalition's nuclear proposal.\n\nRetiring Liberal MP Rowan Ramsey, whose seat of Grey in South Australia contains one of the seven proposed nuclear sites, said he would have to reconsider his support of a nuclear reactor if his community did not back it.\n\n\"I think we're a fair way away from that position, [but] if at the end of the day the community clearly expressed its view it didn't want it, I would probably reconsider my position as well,\" Mr Ramsey told the ABC.\n\nLiberal MP Rick Wilson, whose electorate of O'Connor has also been flagged for a nuclear site, told the ABC in March \"a social licence is a pre-requisite for any major energy infrastructure project\".\n\nFaults near earmarked nuclear sites would need further study\n\nAs well as finding the numbers in the Senate to lift a federal nuclear ban and convincing several states to lift state-level nuclear bans, a future Coalition government would also need to find out whether the seven sites it proposes for nuclear are actually geologically suitable.\n\nMr Littleproud said preliminary assessments had been made and there would be further assessments made.\n\nNuclear regulator ARPANSA has a long list of conditions that should be met for a controlled-nuclear facility to be established, including landslide and erosion considerations, soil and rock types, stability, groundwater levels and surface faulting.\n\nThe National Seismic Hazard Assessment by Geoscience Australia says \"damaging earthquakes in Australia are considered [a] low probability but high consequence event\".\n\nGeoscience Australia's earthquake hazard scientist Tamarah King told the ABC while some of the proposed nuclear sites are near faults, \"globally there are plenty of nuclear sites in high hazard regions that are engineered to withstand potential geological hazards\".\n\n\"There are only some geological characteristics that would pose an un-engineerable hazard which would mean the site could not be safely considered for a nuclear power point,\" Dr King said.\n\n\"In the Australian context, this includes the identification of a fault capable of producing large earthquakes and surface offsets within the immediate vicinity, the liquefaction potential of a site, the likelihood of underground cave collapse, and landslide potential.\"\n\nThe agency said it had identified faults across Australia with \"demonstrated or suspected history\" of generating large earthquakes, but they would require detailed study to understand whether they pose a hazard to infrastructure near-term or into the future.\n\nSeismology Research Centre chief scientist Adam Pascale said site-specific seismic hazard assessments would be necessary.\n\n\"For the Victorian site at Loy Yang ... there is a lot of earthquake activity in Gippsland and that region. We've seen even in recent years large earthquakes in the region, so that would be something certainly to look at,\" Mr Pascale said.\n\n\"Some of the other areas where there's proposed sites I know there have been studies, but again, everything would need a site-specific study.\n\n\"Within Australia, we can have a magnitude-7.5 earthquake, that's our maximum credible earthquake for within our plate, and that could happen anywhere at some point in the future, so you can't really rule out anywhere as immune from earthquakes.\"\n\nMr Pascale said earthquake risk did not necessarily invalidate a site, but rather would require more investment to make a facility earthquake-resistant.", "source": {"uri": "abc.net.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation"},

But I still think nuclear is worth considering,\" Mr Ceeney told The Australian Financial Review.\n\n\"Peter Dutton is pretty brave to open up the discussion in today's political climate before an election. I don't know if I support it, but I applaud it.\"\n\nUnder Mr Dutton's plan, which was supported without dissent by the Coalition party room on Wednesday, there would be five large-scale power plants and two small modular reactors, or SMRs, all in operation by 2050.\n\nThe large-scale plants, which would have a capacity of between 1 gigawatt and 1.4 gigawatts, would be built on the site of old coal-fired power stations including Loy Yang in Traralgon.\n\nThis comes despite the CSIRO last month warning the first large-scale nuclear power plant could cost as much as $17 billion in today's dollars, and would not be operational until at least 2040.\n\nMr Ceeney, who lives in the town of Churchill, about 15 minutes away from Loy Yang, said he would be open to nuclear in the region. But he's also open to renewables manufacturing. His main concerns are jobs and power prices.\n\n\"We used to have the cheapest electricity going and granted it's dirty and nasty, but now we've gone the other end of the spectrum where we're losing jobs in manufacturing because of it,\" the 56-year-old said.\n\n\"The buzzword around here is new energy. It's nice, exciting and attractive, but it doesn't appear to have any substance that would bring real jobs.\n\n\"Any power plant would have construction jobs and ongoing jobs. The power industry created so many skills and opportunities. And so I think nuclear could maybe do the same, but right now I just want to learn more.\"\n\nMorwell newsagent Ray Burgess is far more bullish about the prospect of nuclear in the Latrobe Valley, handing over a copy of a booklet produced by the University of Queensland called What would be required for nuclear energy plants to be operating in Australia from the 2030s.\n\nThe 69-year-old, who worked as a supervisor for the old State Electricity Commission in the early 1990s before taking over the newsagency, reckons nuclear is an opportunity for the Latrobe Valley.\n\n\"Ultimately, what I'm for is prosperity in the region,\" he said.\n\n\"The power stations had jobs for nearly everyone. You had people sweeping the turbine room floor, as well as fitters and joiners. That's all disappearing.\"\n\nLatrobe City Council mayor Darren Howe said if the Coalition was prepared to the run the next election on nuclear energy then it was a \"serious option\" that needed to be fully considered by the community. But the mayor said he was energy-agnostic and would be just as happy if Morwell and Traralgon became a manufacturing hub for wind turbines or solar panels.\n\n\"We've been the powerhouse of Victoria for 100 years, that's what we're known for and what our community hangs it hat on, so why can't we do that for the next 100 years? Whatever the energy mix ends up looking like, we need to leverage it as much as possible,\" he said.\n\nTraralgon clothing retailer Jill Magnuson, on the other hand, said that while she feared businesses like hers would suffer after Yallourn and Loy Yang power stations closed down, she didn't want nuclear anywhere near her.\n\n\"Nobody really wants a nuclear plant in their backyard,\" she said.\n\n\"But I'm also pretty sceptical about the cost and time it would take to set up. We can't seem to build enough houses for everyone right now, so how would we go building nuclear?\"\n\nThis outright rejection of nuclear in Traralgon was shared by a small group of protesters outside Gippsland MP Darren Chester's office on Wednesday.\n\nVoices of the Valley spokeswoman Wendy Farmer, who helped organise the protest, said the Latrobe Valley was not a \"dumping ground\".\n\n\"Peter Dutton is dreaming up a nuclear nightmare,\" she said.\n\n\"The proposal to build a nuclear power plant in the Latrobe Valley, on a geological fault line, in a community that already suffered the impacts of the Hazelwood coal mine fire, is dangerous and insulting\".", "source": {"uri": "afr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian Financial Review"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Prime Minister, thanks for your time, as always. One of your predecessors, a much loved figure in your Party and beyond that, the late, great Bob Hawke. He said in 2016, nuclear power would be a win for the environment and an essential part of attacking dangerous global warming. Why not at least consider it?\n\nANTHONY ALBANESE, PRIME MINISTER: Let's be clear here, Bob Hawke can't speak for himself, so I think it's pretty tacky that the Coalition attempting to use a quote out of context as well, of my dear late friend Bob Hawke. What we're dealing with here in 2024 is a Coalition so-called plan that hasn't lasted a day. They've said there are seven sites, but they haven't said whether they're going to be compulsorily required. They say there'll be a community consultation process. One of the Shadow Ministers has said that that'll have the right of veto. So, will they go and look for other spots? Others have said there'll be compulsory acquisition. Peter Dutton is now saying, after saying just that yesterday, now saying, 'Oh, well, we'll convince them that they're on board', even though six of the seven owners of those sites have rejected this proposal. Every state and territory where it's proposed has rejected the proposals. Even the Queensland LNP are saying they don't want a bar of this. They've made an announcement without any substance, no costings, no real timelines, no idea of what form the reactors will take, how big they will be, what the engagement with the community is. This is farcical, frankly, Kieran. This is economic catastrophe. When we look at the costs of nuclear, what we know is that it's the most expensive form of new energy. So, my Government is providing $300 off energy bills in two weeks. The Dutton Opposition are saying, 'In two decades, we'll give you the most expensive form of energy that there is, new energy. And what's more, we'll have government ownership and send all the bills to the taxpayers because there is no way that not a single private bank or financier in this country would go anywhere near this because it's such a risky economic proposition'.\n\nGILBERT: You say that it's economic catastrophe, but let's look at Europe. There are more than 100 nuclear plants. France has dozens. It provides a clear majority of that country's power supply. Why are you so adamant it can't be part of our mix?\n\nPRIME MINISTER: Listen to the experts, Kieran. The International Energy Agency that is very much pro-nuclear energy says that Australia is not an appropriate venue because of the comparative advantages that we have. Kieran, if you go outside in Australia, you can fry an egg on a footpath during the summer. We have the best solar resources in the world. We have such a comparative advantage if we seize the opportunities which are there. The CSIRO say that compared with renewable energy with firming, it's up to eight times more expensive. It is decades away. Not only will this cost more, it will make energy supply more insecure, because there's no answer either of what happens between now and two decades' time for how energy supply is secured. They spent almost a decade in office saying that we needed to extend the life of coal fired power. They had proponents like in Collinsville, where they paid the people who wanted to build a coal fired power plant money to do the study and to do the preparatory work, and it ended up in zero, just as they said that Liddell should stay open. Indeed, no new coal fired power plants were built on their watch. And 14 of them announced their closure. Now, they've moved away from coal, but they've found another destination of denial. And that destination of denial is nuclear. In the meantime, what will happen is that there'll be issues of more energy insecurity because we know that it is disrupting the certainty that the business community have been crying out for. That's how you reduce prices, by increasing supply, offering the business community the certainty that they've been asking for. And that is what we have done.\n\nGILBERT: But when you look at the cost question, I want to put this to you because this is one of the fundamental arguments Peter Dutton is making is that, say, if you look at something like the Illawarra wind farm, that in itself is going to cost billions. I think the figure out there is about $10 billion, but its lifespan is up to 30 years for wind turbines, a nuclear power facility is up to 100 years. So, the cost comparison needs to factor in the lifespan of the assets as well. What do you say to that?\n\nPRIME MINISTER: Kieran, this is a mob that when they were in government, couldn't build a commuter car park, but say that government, the Federal Government, that has no experience whatsoever in building government-owned energy assets, energy assets historically were owned by state governments, and Coalition governments were quite happy to flog them off when they found it convenient. Now, you would have us believe that a mob who'd struggle to assemble an Ikea flat-pack are going to start from scratch and be able to develop a nuclear energy industry in Australia, even though they can't say what form the nuclear reactors will take. Last night, I saw their Energy Shadow Minister struggling to concede the fact that these small modular reactors they speak about don't exist anywhere in the world right now. Don't exist. But they're going to be from scratch, ahead of the entire curve. That's why the International Energy Agency have said it's not appropriate for Australia. What we know is that the cheapest form of new energy is renewables. And what we know as well is that the business community have said we want certainty. That's what we've done. A 43 per cent legislated target, a net zero by 2050 legislated target in place. The capacity investment scheme, encouraging investment. The safeguard mechanism to drive that business certainty with the trajectory so that we reach net zero. That's why there's no business leaders coming out and saying they support this. In terms of the energy sector, where are they saying, 'We want to pitch in and build these nuclear reactors'? And that's why Peter Dutton has had to take the remarkable step for a Coalition government of having a command-style economy approach and building these nuclear reactors from scratch decades into the future, the most costly form of energy. And guess what? Guess what? Taxpayers will foot the bill for Peter Dutton's nuclear fantasy.\n\nGILBERT: Well, given those numbers and the facts as you see it, would you urge your colleagues, and I point to one of your frontbenchers who tweeted an image of Blinky Bill with three eyes, and Jacinta Allan tweeted a three-eyed fish today, you know, would you tell them to steer clear of some of that stuff and focus on the facts? I ask you that in the context of if that's the sort of scare campaign they're going to run, what about the submariners on the AUKUS submarines? And what would you say to our AUKUS allies about our ability to manage nuclear waste? It's a serious issue, isn't it? Would you urge your colleagues to steer clear of some of that stuff?\n\nPRIME MINISTER: We're not going to take lectures, Kieran, we're not going to take lectures from the Coalition that are out there running scare campaigns about everything. Every issue is an opportunity for them to steer away from the facts. Look, this is an announcement without any detail. I cannot recall a serious government or alternative government coming out with a policy such as this, with not a single costing, with just a media release, which is more than Peter Dutton's Budget Reply had, which had no media releases, no costings. This is a mob that have not produced a costing for policies in the more than two years now with three budget replies from Peter Dutton. When I was the Leader of the Labor Party and Leader of the Opposition, I produced fully costed policies in areas like child care, in rewiring the nation, in the National Reconstruction Fund, in a whole range of areas. I put them forward with substance. This mob think they can just get through by running. Remember where this has been driven by as well. This is a scare campaign. Worried about a solar panel scaring people is what they have tried. And six of the seven sites have said they don't want a bar of this. In Port Augusta, the site that they have so-called identified, this is how hopeless they've been, has already been taken up with other activity that is creating jobs. And I saw the local Member there saying, 'Oh, well, we'll put it somewhere near there and somehow connect it up with the grid'. Liddell is, I've been up at Liddell, what Liddell have done is sign deals with Sundrive. They're going to be doing a range of activities there, including manufacturing the world's most efficient solar panels there on the Liddell site, employing more people than were employed under the former when the coal fired station, power station that they said they would keep open into the never-never that shut years ago on their watch.\n\nGILBERT: Their polling of those communities suggests that it's upwards.\n\nPRIME MINISTER: Have you seen it, Kieran? Have you seen it?\n\nGILBERT: We haven't seen it yet. I've been advised of it.\n\nPRIME MINISTER: Exactly. Exactly. Oh, you've been advised. You've been advised. Seriously? Seriously. What a joke. They're out there, you know, talking about a half-baked plan. There are no costs. The reason why there are no costings out there is because it is so expensive, because it doesn't add up. That's why they're trying to hide it. Just as Peter Dutton has said, 'We'll tell you what we're going to do on 2030 after the election'. And I'll make this tip, Kieran. There's a reason why people hide costings, and that's because those costings would completely rule out any rational person going down this nuclear road. What we have here is a bloke who's incapable of leading his party in any serious ways, who just agrees to whatever some of the extreme people in his show who want to, as David Littleproud has said really explicitly, they want to wind back renewables. It's not clear what they're saying. I noticed in the person you were speaking to beforehand saying, 'Oh, they've announced this policy and they'll announce their gas policy and their renewables policy down the road'. Well, we have all of our policy out there. It's one energy policy. It's coherent. It has the support of the business community and it's driving investment. There are more than 50 renewable energy projects underway that have been approved. We've seen a 25 per cent increase already in heading towards our target, which is there. We've seen more than 300,000 Australians in the last couple of years put solar panels on their roofs. The reason why they've done that is because it makes economic sense to drive down costs. And just as it makes sense for households, it makes sense for our entire economy as well.\n\nGILBERT: I know you've got to go and get a plane. But I do want to ask you a few other issues. A big week of news and commitments for you. One of them, of course, the Premier of China, the visit. Now, Peter Dutton said you lacked the backbone to strongly criticise the behaviour of those officials when Cheng Lei was blocked at that media event. In hindsight, could you have been more immediate in your criticism?\n\nPRIME MINISTER: Kieran, you were there at that event, I would assume. Peter Dutton was there. He stood up at the lunch afterwards with Premier Li and said absolutely nothing. He was a lion outside and a pussycat when in front of Premier Li and other Chinese officials, said nothing. The truth is that we responded very clearly. It was inappropriate activity. We made that clear. And I made it clear directly to Premier Li, which is more than Peter Dutton did. He left it up to Simon Birmingham to speak up and didn't raise it himself. The truth is as well, just to put some perspective here, the reason why Cheng Lei was at that press conference is because of the work that we did to ensure that she was brought home. Strongly advocating, as we do, always in Australia's national interest. We've managed to stabilise the relationship without compromising any of our values. And Peter Dutton, for all of his macho nonsense he goes on with, he's incapable of standing up to his own party. He's got people in his Caucus room who've been out there praising Vladimir Putin. He's got people out there putting all sorts of extreme positions opposing any action on COVID. He's got anti-vaxxers sitting there giving speeches in the Parliament that he's refused to say anything against. He can't even stand up to people in his own Party, let alone stand up for Australia's national interests globally. That's something that I've done and that's why Cheng Lei brought home, Sean Turnell brought home from Myanmar. People in Vietnam taken off death row. The actions that we've continued to put. And we always defend Australia's national interests.\n\nGILBERT: The Putin and Kim Jong Un summit in Pyongyang, that's quite the spectacle. The two despots having their diplomatic dance. But I ask you a serious question. Should China be doing more to rein those despots in and to ensure world peace like in Ukraine? They've got the influence there, why not use it?\n\nPRIME MINISTER: It's one of the issues that we put forward very strongly when I met with Premier Li. We think that China should use its influence with Russia. Vladimir Putin's illegal and immoral invasion of Ukraine has had a devastating impact on the people of Ukraine who are standing up for their sovereignty. But it's also had a devastating impact on the global economy. It is one of the major sources of global inflation that saw inflation hit double digits in places like the UK and have a real impact. So, we want all countries to put pressure on Russia. And we do directly, as well, by standing up with our allies, by providing support, now has been over a billion dollars that we've supported for Ukraine, that's so important. It's a struggle for the rule of international law and for national sovereignty to be respected. And the people of Ukraine, and I had another discussion with President Zelenskyy just a couple of weeks ago and praised the courage of him and his people, as did Bill Shorten when he represented Australia at the important summit that was held in Europe just last week.\n\nGILBERT: And finally, one out of left field. It hasn't been a major commitment of yours this week or priority, but one of my colleagues reporting on this, the Australian company DefendTex, it's seeking to purchase a Brazilian weapons manufacturer, Avibras. They want $70 million. It would give us a sovereign capacity. Our own Aussie-owned missile maker. Is the Government considering offering that support as a line?\n\nPRIME MINISTER: Well, Export Finance Australia are looking at that proposal. We're big supporters of our defence industry. Part of our agenda for a Future Made in Australia is about renewables, it's about manufacturing, it's about our defence industry, our pharmaceutical industry. It's about new high tech as well, and making sure that we're not only dealing with the immediate issues. So, in less than two weeks now, Kieran, on July 1, Monday week, what we'll have is not just a tax cut for every taxpayer, we'll have $300 energy bill relief for every household. We'll have a wage increase for everyone on the minimum wage and award wages. We'll also have further cheaper medicines come into play. And in addition to that, we've managed to achieve all of that while putting that downward pressure on inflation, which is half of what we inherited. And one of the ways we've done that is producing two budget surpluses in a row. So, we've done all that in the immediate sense. But we're also looking for what are the opportunities for new industries into the future. And what we are doing with our Future Made in Australia is in part about defence industry and about us being able to be more resilient as a national economy. And part of that is the examination of proposals such as the one that you've raised today.\n\nGILBERT: Prime Minister, thanks for your time. Apologies to your officials. I've gone way over the time they allocated. But thank you for being generous with your time. And on a big day in Australian politics. It's been a big week. I thank you for that.\n\nPRIME MINISTER: Always great to chat with you, Kieran.\n\n/Public Release.

internal rift is emerging in the coalition over nuclear power as the major parties prepare for battle over Australia's energy future.\n\nThe opposition has vowed to build seven nuclear plants at the sites of coal-fired power stations if it wins the next election but has been criticised for not revealing costs.\n\nSome Liberals have suggested there will be a big contribution from renewable energy at the same time leading Nationals want to restrict wind and sun-generated power.\n\nLiberal senator James Paterson said his party supported renewable energy.\n\n\"Renewables will be an important part of the mix as it is internationally,\" he said on Thursday.\n\nEarlier this week, Nationals leader David Littleproud said the coalition should send a clear policy that large-scale renewable projects would be restricted.\n\n\"We want to send the investment signals that there is a cap on where we will go with renewables and where we will put them,\" he said.\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese said the cheapest form of new energy was renewable.\n\n\"That's why there is no one in the business community who's putting their hand up, not a single bank, not a single financier, not a single equity firm, saying 'yeah, we want to be involved in this',\" he said.\n\nLabor has committed $22.7 billion over the next decade for its Future Made in Australia plan, which aims to increase investment from the private sector for the energy transition.\n\nVoters would have a clear choice at the election, Energy Minister Chris Bowen said.\n\n\"Our energy policy, which we've been very clear about and implementing, and their fantasy which they can't answer key questions on,\" he said.\n\nMore details of the coalition's nuclear plan would be revealed \"in bite-sized bits\", Opposition Leader Peter Dutton said.\n\n\"We want the information out there in bite-sized bits so that people can consume exactly what it is that we're proposing and understand what it's not proposing,\" he said.\n\nThe coalition has promised to detail the cost of nuclear reactors before the election expected early next year.\n\nLiam Wagner, an associate professor in sustainable energy systems at Curtin University, poked holes in the nuclear proposal.\n\nHe rubbished a potential reliance on Westinghouse-manufactured reactors, which had experienced delays and budget blowouts abroad.\n\n\"It would be irresponsible to seek that as the preferred option, given the significant delays that it's faced in installation in the US,\" Dr Wagner told AAP.\n\n\"It's essentially like ripping up $100 bills.\"\n\nSites nominated for nuclear plants include Loy Yang Power Station in Victoria, Callide and Tarong in Queensland, Mount Piper at Lithgow in central west NSW and Liddell in NSW's Hunter region.\n\nSmall, modular reactors would be built at Northern Power Station in Port Augusta and at Muja Power Station, southeast of Perth.\n\nDr Wagner questioned whether the coalition checked the locations were

Federal and state Labor leaders and the union movement quickly began posting improbable and downright ridiculous ways to try and undermine nuclear power.\n\nDeformed pets, references to The Simpsons, toxic spills causing three-eyed fish and images suggesting the sites might be located near iconic natural wonders such as Victoria's Twelve Apostles were just some of the immature games being played by parliamentarians.\n\nI did say yesterday that the mother of all scare campaigns would soon start but I didn't think it would be quite this pathetic.\n\nThe Australian Union movement suggested the family dog would become deformed as a result of Peter Dutton's nuclear power proposal\n\nVictorian Premier Jacinta Allan's team produced this Simpsons-inspired meme - with Ms Allan slamming nuclear power as 'toxic'\n\nIt isn't as though there aren't serious problems with Dutton's announcement - I'll come to those shortly.\n\nVictoria's new premier Jacinta Allan, no less, posted mocked up images of three-eyed cartoon fish leaping out of the water in Gippsland, writing: 'The Liberal Party want a toxic and expensive nuclear reactor in Gippsland.'\n\nAnthony Albanese's contribution wasn't much better: 'Instead of Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, this is Peter Dutton and the seven nuclear reactors'.\n\nI wonder how long it took the PM's taxpayer funded team of 11 media advisers to come up with that one. Or did Albo proudly think it up all on his own?\n\nSeizing upon The Simpsons theme, Victorian federal MP Josh Burns tweeted images of nuclear reactors with the Liberal Party logo on them, writing 'under Peter Dutton Australians will glow green'.\n\nClever stuff.\n\nAt 62 years of age Labor MP for the Victorian seat of Corangamite, Libby Cocker, wasn't too mature to take a similar dig, days before Dutton's announcement.\n\nThe federal Victorian MP riffed off the 'where the bloody hell are you' tourism campaign of yesteryear spearheaded by Lara Bingle.\n\nCocker, who was a school teacher before entering politics, tweeted a mock up of a bikini-clad Bingle standing in front of the 12 Apostles on the Victorian coastline with three nuclear reactors billowing smoke behind her.\n\nThere really must be something in the water in Victoria - before the nuclear waste arrives as is being alleged.\n\nThe Simpsons references were running thick and fast\n\nThe Australian Manufacturing Workers Union shared an image of a Chernobyl-style dystopia\n\nThe Australian Union movements official X page posted an image of a deformed something or another, it was hard to tell, above the headline 'this will be your family dog'.\n\nScare campaigns are rarely rooted in accuracy, and that is a bipartisan problem. But they are rarely this childish in nature.\n\nIt will be interesting to see if these callow MPs and vested interests continue to act this way, or sharpen up their attacks in the weeks and months ahead.\n\nHistory tells us that scare campaigns work, especially against big bold policy ideas raised by Oppositions. But do they work when they are this low brow?\n\nBefore Dutton revealed where the reactors would be placed, Labor MP Libby Coker shared this meme, inspired by Lara Bingle's famous Tourism Australia ad\n\nAs mentioned earlier on, if anyone wants to seriously critique Dutton's policy there is plenty to dig into without having to resort to juvenile antics.\n\nFor example, Dutton says he plans to use existing coal fired power sites and the government will pay for and own the operations. But most of the private owners of these sites have already ruled out relinquishing them to a Coalition government, and they weren't consulted before the policy was announced.\n\nMost of the sites Dutton has announced are in states that have legislatively banned nuclear power, and a number of these Premiers have already ruled out changing that.\n\nRead MoreLIVE How nuclear power plant neighbours could be in for a cash windfall under Dutton's new energy plan\n\nThe policy hasn't been costed, much less modelled to ascertain what taxpayers might be up for if or when construction was to begin.\n\nWe don't even know who the Coalition engaged to produce this policy. Is it rooted in any scholarly research beyond a superficial thought bubble announcement?\n\nWe're also still in the dark about which types of nuclear reactors the Opposition is proposing to build: the new smaller modules or the more established larger varieties used in other parts of the world? It is a pretty basic choice not to be included in a major policy announcement.\n\nSo yes, there are serious questions for serious people to raise requiring serious answers before Team Dutton can expect Australians to get behind his proposal.\n\nUnfortunately the Labor government and its union mates seem largely incapable of reaching high and properly challenging the policy announcement.\n\nInstead they choose to play in the sandpit on social media.\n\nNo wonder the public has such a dim view of the political class.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType":

But under Labor, this isn't happening.\n\nRight now, in households and businesses around the country, Labor's expensive renewables-only approach is failing.\n\nThe Government is now talking about a 65 to 75 per cent emissions reduction target by 2035, but won't release modelling and won't tell us how much higher power prices will go up.\n\nPower bills have already increased by up to $1,000 for many Australians, when they were promised a $275 cut. And Labor's climate target of 43% emissions reduction by 2030 has become unachievable.\n\nThe Coalition believes Australia must have a balanced energy mix to deliver cheaper, cleaner and consistent 24/7 electricity. 90 per cent of baseload electricity, predominantly coal fired power stations, is coming to the end of life over the next decade.\n\nNuclear energy for Australia is an idea whose time has come.\n\nToday, we are announcing that a future Federal Coalition Government will introduce zero-emissions nuclear energy in Australia, which has proven to get electricity prices and emissions down all over the world, to work in partnership with renewable energy and gas as part of a balanced energy mix.\n\nAnd today, we announce seven locations, located at a power station that has closed or is scheduled to close, where we propose to build zero-emissions nuclear power plants:\n\nLiddell Power Station, New South WalesMount Piper Power Station, New South WalesLoy Yang Power Stations, VictoriaTarong Power Station, QueenslandCallide Power Station, QueenslandNorthern Power Station, South Australia (SMR only)Muja Power Station, Western Australia (SMR only)\n\nEach of these locations offer important technical attributes needed for a zero-emissions nuclear plant, including cooling water capacity and transmission infrastructure, that is, we can use the existing poles and wires, along with a local community which has a skilled workforce.\n\nA key advantage of modern zero-emissions nuclear plants is they can be plugged into existing grids. This means they can effectively replace retired or retiring coal plants and avoid much of the new spending needed for Labor's 'renewables-only' system, including new transmission poles and wires. All of which will be passed on in the form of higher bills.\n\nLabor's approach requires imposing 58 million solar panels, 3,500 new industrial wind turbines, and up to 28,000 kilometres of new transmission lines across the country. Energy experts have warned the cost of Labor's rollout will be between $1.2 trillion and $1.5 trillion.\n\nNo country in the world relies solely on solar and wind as Labor is proposing. By contrast, there are 32 countries operating zero-emissions nuclear plants. Another 50 countries are looking to do so.\n\nOf the world's 20 largest economies, Australia is the only one not using nuclear energy, or moving towards using it.\n\nOur plan will deliver a net-zero electricity grid by 2050 and a strong and resilient economy. It will set our country up for decades to come.\n\nAt the front of this next wave of growth will be those communities which host zero-emissions nuclear plants. Not only will local communities benefit from high paying, multi-generational jobs but communities will be empowered to maximise the benefits from hosting an asset of national importance by way of:\n\nA multi-billion dollar facility guaranteeing high-paying jobs for generations to come;An integrated economic development zone to attract manufacturing, value-add and high-tech industry; andA regional deal unlocking investment in modern infrastructure, services and community priorities.\n\nA Community Partnership will be formed in each host community, consisting of experienced local representatives, as the focal point for community engagement and to play an important role in planning the future of the region.\n\nThis community engagement process will occur alongside a comprehensive site study including detailed technical and economic assessments.\n\nA Federal Coalition Government will initially develop two establishment projects using either small modular reactors or modern larger plants such as the AP1000 or APR1400. They will start producing electricity by 2035 (with small modular reactors) or 2037 (if modern larger plants are found to be the best option).\n\nThe Australian Government will own these assets, but form partnerships with experienced nuclear companies to build and operate them.\n\nAustralia is fast running out of energy. The way of life for everyday Australians and the cost of doing business in Australia is already in jeopardy and it is only going to get worse under Labor's expensive all-eggs-in-one-basket 'renewables-only' policy.\n\nWe know the Prime Minister and his Government will mount the mother-of-all scare campaigns on zero-emissions nuclear energy.\n\nBut we believe Australians are up for this discussion and are open-minded about including zero-emissions nuclear technology as part of a balanced energy mix.\n\nIf you are serious about meeting our net zero by 2050 emissions commitments, then you must include zero-emission nuclear as part of your energy mix. Zero-emission nuclear power plants produce no air pollution or carbon emissions. For example, a 1.1 GW AP-1000 reactor cuts approximately seven million metric tonnes of CO2 emissions, equivalent to removing 1.5 million cars from the road.\n\nA zero-emissions nuclear power plant will be a national asset delivering cheaper, cleaner and consistent energy for 80 years. Getting started now on establishing a civil nuclear programme is the right decision for you, your children and your grandchildren.\n\nFrom today, we will be speaking right across the country on the merits of our plan.\n\nOur plan is bold, visionary and what Australians need to secure our energy and economic future.\n\nFor more information visit australianeedsnuclear.org.au\n\n/Public Release.

He also offered the example of Lucas Heights, located in Sydney's south, where a small reactor has been used for medical research for decades.\n\nDurrant-Whyte said Canada's nuclear industry employed about 30,000 people while France's employed 125,000 - \"not a trivial number of people\".\n\nThe United Kingdom, which operated nuclear plants for many years, has just one nuclear engineering program at an undergraduate level, limiting the supply of talent that could be imported from there.\n\nHe was also dismissive of the prospect that small modular reactors (SMRs) - which the opposition proposes to start its nuclear program with - were likely to be commercially viable soon.\n\n\"When I was [at Rolls-Royce] in 1979 my colleagues in the couple of desks next to me were designing SMRs,\" he said. \"It's always the issue with anything big and complex. Whether it's an aeroplane or a nuclear reactor, the first one is always the hardest.\"\n\nThe capabilities learned at the Lucas Heights Ansto (Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation) facility would make \"little contribution\" to supporting a nuclear power industry in the country, he wrote in his 2019 report.\n\n\"[I]t must be recognised that this is a 'zero-power' pool reactor where the complexities of high pressure, high power, high radiation environments do not exist.\"\n\nSimilarly, the capabilities needed to manage nuclear-powered submarines as part of the Aukus program also offered few transferrable skills. The pressurised water reactors on the submarines would be, in effect, SMRs of a 100-200 megawatt capacity size.\n\n\"My suspicion is we will buy the reactors in a piece of submarine and assemble that piece into submarines here,\" Durrant-Whyte said. \"But even then, let's be clear, we're not going to be doing that until the mid-2040s.\"\n\nAs for safety, he said nuclear reactors were designed to be \"very, very safe\". However, there \"have been a lot of accidents because of fuel handling and things like that\" as a result of human error.\n\n\"It's not like we haven't had this [nuclear] conversation many times over the last 20 years in Australia,\" Durrant-Whyte said. \"[I]t would be expensive, and likely more expensive than anything else you could possibly think of.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com",

Now, what does it mean for families who are struggling at the moment?\" he asked.\n\nDutton's claims are as unambiguous as they are bereft of evidence but that will matter little if the leader of the Coalition is not challenged to back up the statements with some facts.\n\nAll of this comes as Dutton revealed a government he leads would build seven taxpayer-funded nuclear reactors around the country - a technology that experts say is more expensive than solar and wind and probably won't produce electricity until the 2040s.\n\nSo what is going on with Australians' power bills and is there any evidence that climate targets are hitting Australians' wallets more than, say, rising petrol prices, sky-rocketing rents or jumps in insurance premiums?\n\nDr Dylan McConnell, an energy systems analyst at the University of New South Wales, says only about $100 of a household's annual electricity bill is made up of charges related to environmental programs, such as feed-in-tariffs for rooftop solar or financial incentives for large-scale renewables projects.\n\nBut McConnell says electricity price rises in more recent years have been underpinned by the rising international costs of gas that was \"supercharged\" by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBuilding more renewables would require investments in new transmission infrastructure that would put upward pressure on prices but he says the alternative would be to \"build a lot more gas and coal [generation] and that is undeniably more expensive [than renewables] now.\"\n\nGiven the Coalition wants to link the rising cost of living to power prices (even where there is little evidence that climate targets or renewables are having a strong effect on those prices) just how significant are electricity costs to rising overall costs?\n\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics publishes its consumer price index (CPI), which pulls in how much Australian households are paying for a large basket of goods and services.\n\nAccording to the ABS, electricity prices rose 6.9% over the last calendar year, which is above inflation. But data shows those price rises are slowing and are now at 2% annually.\n\nIn the last quarter, the biggest price rises were in rents, secondary education, tertiary education and medical and hospital services.\n\nComparatively, insurance premiums have gone up 16.4% in the last year, the ABS says, driven by \"higher reinsurance, natural disaster and claims costs\".\n\nBut the ABS data also shows electricity prices are a small part of Australian household expenditure, at just 2.36% of overall costs.\n\nCompare this with 3.35% for takeaway and fast food, 3.85% for wine and beer, 4.71% for hospital and medical bills, and 6% for rents.\n\nThe cost of renting is now rising by 7.8% annually, according to the most recent ABS quarterly update, \"the strongest rise since the March 2009 quarter\".\n\nProf John Quiggin, an economist at the University of Queensland, says when it comes to electricity prices compared with the CPI as a whole, \"it's evident that rising electricity prices haven't been a problem for some time\" although they do disproportionately affect lower-income households.\n\nQuiggin says the public and politicians are fired up by their power bills \"because they come in a big chunk every three months and so it's noticeable and they're politically sensitive for that reason\".\n\nHe says relative to the CPI, electricity prices have fallen since around 2013 when, for the 10 years leading up to that point, electricity prices had been climbing largely because distributors were recouping their costs for building out the network.\n\nA word (OK, more than just a word) about Peter Dutton's nuclear announcement on Wednesday, which will have been hard to miss. For many months, the Coalition promised more details but has so far offered very little.\n\nDutton suggested that the first nuclear plants could be up and running by 2035 if small modular reactors (SMR) were chosen, or 2037 for the 1,000MW or 1,400MW reactors designed by the white goods company Westinghouse.\n\nTrying to assert that plants could be producing power by 2035 without actually saying what kind of plants they would be, or who would build them, or how large they might be (there's a big difference between a 300MW SMR that has never been built and a 1,400MW plant) leaves an enormous credibility gap.\n\nThe Coalition again insisted nuclear power in Australia would be \"cheap\" but did not articulate how plants that won't deliver electricity, in their minds, for another decade (or 15 years if you accept estimates from CSIRO and others) will help cut costs in the next few years.\n\nUsing the CSIRO's estimates of nuclear costs, a 1,400MW nuclear plant would cost $12bn to build, but only once a nuclear building program is already up and running. Early plants could cost double that, the CSIRO said.\n\nThe CSIRO also said electricity from nuclear would cost at least 50% more than from solar and wind, but again that estimate was based on the assumption that Australia already has a nuclear program ... which it doesn't, despite the Coalition continually pointing to a 20MW research reactor at Lucas Heights in Sydney as evidence that we do.\n\nAnd while you're here, consider this. The Coalition said this week that one of the six nuclear reactors it would build in the east coast market would be a small modular reactor ... which are not currently commercially available.\n\nSo if we generously assume the other five reactors are all 1,400MW units and the SMR is a 300MW unit, that means the Coalition's nuclear plan amounts to 7,200MW of new generation capacity once they're all built some time in the 2040s.\n\nIs that a lot? Right now, there is 21,200MW of baseload coal-fired power capacity along the east coast, expected to fall to less than 5,000MW of coal left by 2035.\n\nPerhaps another question for the Coalition might be: how do you fill that gap?", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "graham_readfearn@theguardian.com", "name": "Graham Readfearn",

We have abundant natural resources and a highly skilled workforce to take advantage of the many renewable energy opportunities. Evidence shows that new nuclear is more expensive than renewable alternatives.\n\n\"Nuclear energy also creates radioactive waste, which must be safely managed over many decades to protect the environment, requiring complex and expensive handling. The Scottish government is supporting continued growth in renewables, storage, hydrogen and carbon capture technologies to drive economic growth, support green jobs and provide secure, affordable and clean energy for Scotland.\"\n\nBut in response, Scottish Conservative Central Scotland MSP Graham Simpson said: \"So it is hopelessly ideological and anti science.\n\n\"Now wind is only available 45% of the time. It requires backup from gas, compared to nuclear, which is available 90% of the time, and is therefore far more reliable.\n\n\"The First Minister's anti-nuclear energy stance has seen gas consumption double since 2015 so I think we have to assume that he wants to follow the example of Germany, Austria and Belgium, who have seen carbon emissions rise after decommissioning nuclear plants. Now we know the GMB Congress last week called for the Scottish Government to lift the ban. They've now invited Kate Forbes to meet nuclear workers at Hunterston. Will she go?\"\n\nThe First Minister responded: \"I gave a considered answer to Graham Simpson. I don't think it could in any way be described as ideological, because I made the point that evidence shows that new nuclear is more expensive than renewable alternatives.\n\n\"We are facing a cost of living and public finance crisis, so any responsible First Minister will look to make sure that we make the most fiscally efficient approach to energy generation.\n\n\"This government, as a result of its clear policy leadership, has successfully decarbonised electricity generation within Scotland. We have developed renewable energy with policy certainty, and I want to give the same policy certainty to storage, to hydrogen to carbon capture technologies to drive economic growth and support green jobs.\n\n\"What troubles me is that we've got fabulous projects in Scotland, for example, in carbon capture and technology.\"\n\nAnd he added: \"So I am afraid to say Graham Simpson has not got a leg to stand on this question. We have got a clear strategy on renewables. We will pursue that and will pursue it sustainably to deliver for the people of Scotland.\n\nMr Swinney came under fire after he previously stated: \"I respect the fact that people have a different opinion from me, but I am not a fan of the nuclear industry and I do not support investment in nuclear power plants. I never have and I never will. The country should focus on creating clean, green, renewable energy resources.\n\nThe NIA had said that Scotland's nuclear industry has been \"the most productive green industry in the nation's history\" and a \"critical source of jobs and investment for the communities that need them\".\n\nAccording to the NIA, Scotland's nuclear power stations have generated enough electricity since the first was opened at Chapelcross, Dumfries and Galloway in 1959, \"enough to save 400 million tonnes of carbon emissons and power every home in the country for 70 years\".\n\nThey say Scotland's last remaining nuclear power station, Torness, is the largest, cleanest and most reliable single generator in the nation.\n\nIt estimates the industry sustains 3,700 direct jobs with more than \u00a3400 million total added value to the Scottish economy.\n\nThe NIA says that at more than \u00a3100,000 per worker, they are more than twice as productive as the national average.\n\nAnd they say the jobs are also concentrated in poorer areas, with 48% of direct jobs in the most deprived 25% of local authorities, and 24.5% in the most deprived 10% The Scottish Government, while ruled by an SNP-Green co-operation arrangement, has been steadfast in its opposition to nuclear, believing that it is not environmentally sustainable and \"isn't required\" while a climate target of reaching net zero by 2045 remains.\n\nNet zero described a state where emissions of greenhouse gases due to human activities, and removals of these are in balance over a given period.", "source": {"uri":

Nobody in Collie wants this,\" she told ABC Radio Perth.\n\n\"We've had a lot of contact to my electorate office with people really concerned about having nuclear in Collie -- what that would do to their lifestyle, and to their property prices.\"\n\nMs Hanns said in her view, the community was supportive of the ongoing economic transition plan started by the McGowan government in 2018.\n\nThat plan has seen $662 million pledged to create jobs in the local renewable and tourism sectors as the WA government works towards shutting Collie's publicly-operated coal power stations by the end of the decade.\n\n\"This announcement puts all of that at risk,\" she said.\n\nMining and Energy union secretary Greg Busson was more cautious in his criticism, but said there were too many unanswered questions due to a lack of consultation with locals.\n\n\"There's obviously questions around safety,\" he said.\n\nMr Busson said a new nuclear plant would not be enough to fill the employment gap left by the soon-to-be-decommissioned coal mine.\n\n\"Roughly there's between 1,500 and 2,000 jobs directly related to the power and coal generation in Collie,\" he said.\n\n\"So what's their plan ... to make sure these communities continue to thrive and have jobs going on into the future?\n\n\"It just seems to be a cheap stunt to try and win votes.\"\n\nWA energy minister Reece Whitby said the plan made no economic or practical sense for Collie.\n\n\"This is a recipe for disaster. It's a recipe for massive increases in power bills. On any measure it simply does not make sense,\" he told ABC Radio Perth.\n\n\"The massive, massive cost of nuclear, it's off the scale.\n\n\"In Western Australia and Australia, more than anywhere else on the planet, renewables are the option that are most affordable and make sense. It's getting cheaper all the time.\n\n\"In Australia we have no legislative or regulatory framework. We have no workforce. We have no experience. It's going to take years and years and years, and billions of dollars of taxpayer subsidies to support this.\n\nWA Liberal senator Michaelia Cash said Collie's nuclear plant would likely not come to fruition until 2050.\n\n\"The situation in Western Australia is different ... because of our access to gas. So we are likely to be part of the second tranche, which is in the lead up to 2050,\" she told ABC Radio Perth.\n\nAsked about the cost of the project, Ms Cash said that would be unveiled in the \"near future\".\n\n\"I would ask [people] to keep an open mind in relation to the benefits of retiring coal out of the grid and bringing nuclear on because ultimately, under Labor's plan, the bad news is ... it is going to cost you and the lights will potentially go out.\n\nWA's electricity network is not connected to the national grid and currently relies mostly on gas and coal.\n\nThe head of Synergy, which operates the grid, said nuclear power was not right for WA.\n\nSpeaking on Monday at a business event in Perth, David Fyfe said \"it's just not worth it\" in WA.\n\n\"It's too big, you can't turn it off.\"\n\nWA's opposition said it's willing to support debate on the role of nuclear, but stopped short of wholeheartedly backing in the technology.\n\nThe WA Liberals energy spokesman Steve Thomas said the economic case was critical.\n\n\"I've always said I'm not afraid of nuclear energy,\" Dr Thomas said.\n\n\"But the business case has to stack up and the community support has to be there to go ahead.\"\n\nWith the Federal Coalition proposing a small modular reactor for the Collie site, he said any development would likely be well down the track.\n\n\"Right now WA could only absorb a small modular reactor, and the technology is much more up in the air on those,\" Dr Thomas said.\n\nCollie is represented by Federal Liberal MP Rick Wilson who said he was travelling to town today to speak with the local shire.\n\nHe had previously pledged support for building a nuclear power plant in his electorate.\n\nUnveiling the policy in Sydney on Wednesday, Mr Dutton said his team had done an \"enormous\" amount of work on the nuclear policy.\n\n\"We know the government has a renewables-only policy which is not fit for purpose. No other country in the world can keep the lights on 24/7 with the renewables-only policy.\"\n\nHe said utilising existing power assets, such as in Collie, made economic sense.", "source": {"uri":

Just the same as Peter Dutton has said that the 2030 target when it comes to emissions reduction, 'Oh well, we'll let you know all of that after the election',\" Mr Albanese told ABC's RN Breakfast.\n\nFive of the seven sites have been earmarked for large-scale nuclear reactors while the other two, Collie and Northern Power Station in SA, have been picked to host small modular reactors.\n\nMr Dutton on Wednesday accepted his plan would be expensive but claimed it would be a \"fraction\" of the cost of Labor's renewables-focused path to net zero by 2050.\n\nUnder the Opposition's proposal, the first two reactors would be built between 2035 and 2037 with all seven up and running before 2050.\n\nEven if Mr Dutton triumphs at the the next election, he would need to overturn a federal ban on nuclear power and convince hostile Premiers to lift their own State-based moratoriums in order to realise his nuclear ambition.\n\nGet the latest news from thewest.com.au in

It launched a public procurement order titled 'The production of a preliminary technical study for considering the peaceful use of nuclear energy in the Republic of Serbia'.\n\nConsultants can apply by July 16 to conduct \"a thorough comparative and credible analysis of options for the technologies available in the market including small modular reactors (SMRs)\" and recommend the solutions. Since 1989 a moratorium has been in force in Serbia. In particular, there is a ban on the construction of nuclear power plants and facilities for producing nuclear fuel and processing used nuclear fuel for nuclear power plants.\n\nTop state officials led by President Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107 intend to abolish the law and consider the possibility of installing one or more reactors.\n\nEligible are consultancies with a total annual income of at least EUR 205,000. The ministry estimated that the task can be delivered within 12 weeks.\n\nSerbia can benefit from the international nuclear energy community's expertise and experience\n\nThe Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan (INECP or NECP), currently in preparation, includes a scenario where nuclear energy is introduced into the national mix. The relevant ministries and members of the scientific and academic communities will sign a memorandum of understanding setting the framework for cross-institutional cooperation, knowledge exchange and human resources development, the document reads.\n\nIn the evaluation, Serbia is leaning on the approach of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the public call adds. The country can also benefit from the international nuclear energy community's expertise and experience, the ministry underscored.\n\nThe study needs to cover conventional, generation 3+ nuclear power plants as well as more advanced technologies like SMRs. Generation 4 reactors won't be included, though, \"considering time-to-market criteria, technological and supply chain maturity and operation and maintenance challenges that a newcomer country like Serbia would encounter in handling this technology,\" the project assignment shows.\n\nThe selected contractor would be responsible for a comprehensive assessment of the potential benefits and challenges of building nuclear power plants, from the electricity grid perspective, having in mind that in 2026 the domestic electricity market could be coupled with the single European market, the ministry said.\n\nThe consultant would be tasked with calculating the historical and targeted costs per unit, presenting in detail the supply chain and producing a high-level assessment of potential project partners.", "source": {"uri": "balkangreenenergynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Balkan Green Energy News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "igor_todorovic@balkangreenenergynews.com", "name": "Igor Todorovi\u0107", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_plant", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear power plant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal-fired_power_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coal-fired power station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrification", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electrification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-carbon_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Low-carbon economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procurement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Procurement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroelectricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hydroelectricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandar_Vu\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spent_nuclear_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spent nuclear fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_modular_reactor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Small modular reactor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moratorium_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moratorium (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electricity market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Atomic Energy Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_grid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electrical grid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorandum_of_understanding", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Memorandum of understanding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 49}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Management", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Consulting", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://balkangreenenergynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Serbia-commission-first-study-possibility-building-nuclear-power-plants.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662030", "eventUri": "eng-9662030", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-16", "textStart": 694, "textEnd": 701}], "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

In addition, the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Act prohibits the nuclear regulator from authorising the same activities.\n\nBoth laws would have to be repealed, and when was the last time the Coalition had the numbers in the Senate? That'd be back in the days of the John Howard government, the one that -- in a neat piece of irony -- legislated the federal ban.\n\nSuppose Dutton wins the election in such a landslide that he controls both houses and gets carte blanche to make all the federal laws he needs. He then must turn to the states and their pesky laws, while at the same time confronting a separate problem: most of the designated sites are privately owned. What if the companies that own them don't want to sell? Can he, as he has claimed, simply compulsorily acquire the land?\n\nThis brings us to the most immovable obstacle: the Australian constitution. Our federal scheme gives the Commonwealth Parliament only those powers it dictates, with everything else vested in the states by default.\n\nThe Commonwealth is strictly limited in its fields of operation, principally by the shopping list of \"heads of power\" set out in section 51. If a subject matter for lawmaking is not on the list, and can't be fit within the more nebulous implied powers the High Court has allowed over the years (mainly the so-called \"nationhood power\" and a narrow field of \"incidental\" power, both created for practical necessity), then it's a no-go zone.\n\nThe constitution also says a couple of other relevant things. One is that if the Commonwealth and a state have conflicting laws on the same subject, Commonwealth law prevails. However, that is only relevant if the latter is a valid law, which depends on existing legislative power.\n\nThe other is that the Commonwealth can acquire property from anyone for just compensation compulsorily. Again, though, only in pursuit of a valid head of lawmaking power.\n\nThe fact is that there is nothing on the list that comes anywhere close to the power to make laws about energy, nuclear or otherwise. That is why electricity generation has always been an exclusively state government affair. The only exception is the Snowy Hydro scheme, which was created as a cooperative joint venture between the Commonwealth and the New South Wales and Victorian state governments.\n\nIt's been suggested that Dutton could use the \"foreign affairs\" power to make the necessary laws, based on the climate change treaties to which Australia is a party. But none of them stipulates nuclear power and it'd be a massive stretch to claim these projects as necessary for fulfilling our treaty obligations. It's not going to fly.\n\nAlternatively, Dutton says he has \"advice\" that he can cut through the legal weeds on the basis of \"national interest\". I'd love to see that advice.\n\nI'm guessing he means the nationhood power, described by one judge as \"a capacity to engage in enterprises and activities peculiarly adapted to the government of a nation\". It's controversial and the High Court has never agreed exactly what it means or how far it stretches, but basically there are some things only a national government can do, even if the constitution doesn't mention them, therefore the Commonwealth has the implied power to do them.\n\nThe argument would be that responding to the climate/energy crisis is sufficiently existential to have become a matter of national interest transcending state differences, giving the feds power to come riding in and fix the problem by building a fleet of nuclear reactors.\n\nThere are two surpassing ironies here. First, to get his case across the legal line, Dutton would be forced to argue that climate change is not only real, but desperately real.\n\nSecond, if that fails, he'd have to advocate with the Australian public at a referendum to change the constitution. To which the answer is obvious: if you don't know, vote no.", "source": {"uri": "crikey.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Crikey"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_bradley@crikey.com.au", "name":

Not that Hewson was keen on the comparison when presented with that notion by Annabel Crabb on Wednesday.\n\n\"The comparison is most insulting, given the detailed policy work -- including costings -- in Fightback,\" the former Liberal leader-turned-renewables advocate said.\n\nYou get the sense he's not a fan.\n\nMore broadly, the nuclear rollout, complete with snap party room meeting, proved bumpy, with Nationals deputy leader Perin Davey promptly being rebuffed by her leader for suggesting communities would have the ability to refuse a nuclear plant (as had previously been the party's policy).\n\n\"No, she's not correct,\" Nationals Leader David Littleproud said on Wednesday afternoon. By Thursday morning, Dutton was all but saying the Coalition would be telling those communities and site owners what was good for them (and anyone who has seen The Castle will know all too well the power of the federal government to forcibly acquire whatever land it wants).\n\nDavey wasn't alone in getting some of the details wrong -- and you can hardly blame them.\n\nHaving long been told the opposition was carrying out \"comprehensive\" and \"bulletproof\" work mapping out a radical overhaul of Australia's energy mix, all the party received when it was asked to sign off on the proposal was an oral briefing, according to ABC journalist Jane Norman's reporting.\n\nThe party room was promised detailed notes, but all they got was a copy of a press release the Coalition distributed 15 minutes later.\n\nBy Thursday, Dutton was insisting the pesky details Hewson was seeking -- like, you know, the costs -- would be unveiled before the next election. That promise should come with a serving of salt: just a week ago, Dutton was shredding his earlier commitment to release a 2030 emissions target before the next federal election.\n\nThe opposition leader's pitch for nuclear is being levelled squarely at the households shivering through the winter and terrified at the prospect of a huge energy bill.\n\nBut it's not just voters Dutton will need to win over. There's the small matter of the states, all of whom seemingly don't want nuclear power plants. Even the Queensland LNP leader, who within months looks set to be the state's next premier, is refusing to get on board.\n\nThat's not to worry, a zealous federal Liberal told the ABC, insisting David Crisafulli could be convinced to \"roll over\" on nuclear, \"as he did with the Voice and [state] budget\". You get the sense the same politician won't publicly be calling him a lapdog during the state election campaign, but it would make for quite the sign.\n\nDutton, channelling Paul Keating, joked that you wouldn't get between a premier and a pot of money, suggesting the states could be convinced to go nuclear for wads of cash.\n\nIt might not be the last time he borrows from Keating. To get nuclear power, Dutton will need the Senate -- infamously described by the former Labor prime minister as \"unrepresentative swill\" -- to overturn a national ban. It's been almost two decades since the Coalition had full control of the Senate, which means Dutton will need crossbench support to get the votes through a chamber where the Greens hold the balance of power.\n\nGetting a majority will be no small task if recent polls are to be believed, with roughly a third of the country continually vowing to vote for anyone but the two major parties.\n\nThe visit of a world leader always brings with it planning to the nth degree.\n\nA ring of steel was constructed, protesters were restricted, and flags were flown outside Parliament House to greet Chinese Premier Li Qiang when he came to town this week.\n\nThe aim was to show relations were back on a level footing after years in the diplomatic freezer.\n\nAnthony Albanese and his deputy-in-all-but-title Penny Wong have spent the last two years maintaining the line left behind by the Coalition while also seeking to repair a shattered relationship between Australia and its largest trading partner.\n\nIf you had drunk every time one of them mentioned the word \"stabilise\" in the last two years, you'd have been out cold on the floor for quite some time. But stabilise they have, with China removing all trade sanctions besides those on rock lobsters (which was not-so-subtly highlighted when lobster was served at an official function for Li in WA on Tuesday).\n\nBy and large, the trip went as planned. Both countries expressed a desire to work closer together and Albanese, behind closed doors, again raised the plight of Australians on death row, like academic Yang Hengjun.\n\nLikely unplanned was Albanese accidentally misnaming the Chinese premier during a lunch in parliament's Great Hall. (It's of course awkward when you call a bloke the name of his now-deceased predecessor, but maybe it goes some way to counter the Coalition's suggestions that Labor was a pack of Manchurian candidates for the Chinese Communist Party. But we digress.)\n\nAlso unplanned, at least from the Australian side, were the efforts to prevent journalist Cheng Lei from doing her job.\n\nChinese officials sparked days of furore after they were seen seemingly trying to block Cheng -- an Australian-Chinese journalist who was held in a Chinese jail for more than three years -- from the cameras set up to capture Albanese and Li signing documents.\n\nCheng proved something of a rarity in the media in that when presented with the chance to make a story about herself, she largely left it for others to prosecute.\n\nIt took Albanese a couple of goes to land his response. After initially insisting he hadn't seen the incident, on Tuesday he dubbed it clumsy. Wong later confirmed that the PM had raised it with Li.\n\nThe Coalition was quick out of the gates to label Albanese's response \"pathetic\" and make it known that Dutton had raised it with Li when the two held talks on Monday afternoon.\n\nFormer Home Affairs boss Mike \"Pez\" Puzzullo -- who the government sacked last year after he breached the public service code of conduct -- is no stranger to high-profile events inside Parliament House, having been a senior public servant for decades.\n\nAfter months on the sidelines, he made an appearance to classify the Chinese officials' actions in the \"heart of our democracy\" as a \"disgrace\".\n\n\"To have that democratic space desecrated in the way that it was by those Chinese officials, who, no doubt, were acting under instructions, ... was frankly disgraceful,\" he told the ABC's Afternoon Briefing.\n\nLooking at the list of previous recipients of public service medals, others have received them for far less.\n\nLooming large over the Chinese premier's visit was a state of panda-monium (I'll see myself out) over the fate of South Australia's much loved $1-million-a-year rented pandas, Wang Wang and Fu Ni.\n\nCuddly and tourist-attracting they might be, procreating pandas they are not.\n\nOne of the premier's first tasks was to announce Wang Wang and Fu Ni would be heading home after 15 long years in Australia.\n\nA relieved Zoos SA seemed rather chuffed that they'll be replaced with a male and female panda, almost at breeding age.\n\nAs they await their arrival, the zoo's task will be to curate the requisite mood music and keep everything crossed that the pitter-patter of panda paws could one day feature in its future.\n\nAs for who pays? Well, that remains unclear.\n\nThe Commonwealth picked up the rental charges for Wang Wang and Fu Ni during their first decade, while South Australia covered the lease extension for the last five years.\n\nThe Chinese premier appeared less concerned about costs than he was excited about the prospect of the pair going home.\n\n\"Wang Wang and Fu Ni have been away from home for 15 years. I guess they must have missed their home a lot,\" he said through a translator.\n\nJailed academic Dr Yang is too missing home and in much poorer health than the pandas. Yet the Chinese government has offered few signs that he'll be repatriated any time soon.", "source": {"uri": "abc.net.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation"},

The renewed climate wars are a sad reflection of the selfish, win-at-all costs conservative side of politics. Its aim seems not to have a plan, just scaremongering to win votes. It would much appear to prefer to kick any problems down the road rather than deal with them now for the future of our children. Its decision to abandon climate targets is pathetic. After all, these mostly old white men won't be around to suffer the consequences of a warming climate that our qualified scientists tell us is an inevitable consequence of our mistreatment of the environment. Not our problem they might say.\n\nRoss Hudson, Mount Martha\n\nUnknown unknowns make a no\n\nPeter Dutton doesn't know what his emission targets will be. He doesn't know how much building nuclear power stations will cost or who will build them. He also doesn't know where any nuclear waste will be stored. Taking a leaf out of his playbook, I guess if we don't know, we should vote No!\n\nGraeme Gardner, Reservoir\n\nFearmongering leads to perilous path\n\nRe ''\u2063One giant leap towards the unknown''\u2063 (19/6). Shane Wright is to be congratulated for his article, which illustrates the death wish we would have embraced if the LNP were to win the next election. He does well to remind us of the unforgivable inaction and political opportunism of the years that the LNP were in power.\n\nMr Dutton's fearmongering and disregard of what the majority of the world's scientists are telling us regarding the changing climate is beyond belief. Our planet is already experiencing rapid ecological change. Is it going to take some catastrophe here to understand what a perilous path it would be to wait for nuclear power to be the answer, in attempting to work towards a sustainable future?\n\nJudith Morrison, Nunawading\n\nWe need a secure energy network\n\nI am not in favour of nuclear. It has at least a 15-year (and probably more like a 20-year) lead time. It will take until at least 2050 for any plant to be carbon-neutral. According to the latest reports, nuclear is much more expensive in LCOE (Lifetime Cost of Energy) than renewables. We need to consider storage (for hundreds of thousands of years) of waste.\n\nEven so, Mr Dutton's strident calls for nuclear (which ignore or try to hide my points above) have some merit. We do need reasoned and considered debate about our energy future. Our energy needs are only going to increase in the future and a secure energy system is imperative.\n\nEarle Orenstein, Caulfield South\n\nDutton's plan and the election cycle\n\nPeter Dutton's nuclear-powered electricity plants program maybe short-lived. If he fails to win the 2025 election then his plans fall behind another three years. By then we will be so much more advanced in our transformation to renewables that the nuclear option is even more obsolete and ridiculous than it is now.\n\nJohn Rome, Mt Lawley, WA\n\nKicking an old can\n\nThe Coalition would have us believe their nuclear policy is forward thinking. The reality is, Dutton is trying to sell us a decades old policy that other countries are now moving away from. Dutton's plan is just kicking the proverbial can so far down the road it will result in another 15 years of climate inaction.\n\nJulie Perry, Highton", "source": {"uri": "theage.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Age"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fearmongering", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fearmongering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Wright_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shane Wright (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Dutton", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Peter Dutton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_National_Party_of_Queensland", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liberal National Party of Queensland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hudson, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hudson, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Martha,_Victoria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mount Martha, Victoria"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mount Martha, Victoria"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_United_Kingdom_general_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2010 United Kingdom general election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._P._Dutton", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "E.

It aims to bring the first government-owned reactors on line as early as 2035-37 if it is elected next year.\n\nThe Liberal-National coalition announced seven locations where small modular reactors (SMRs) or large-scale units could be installed, all in sites hosting coal-fired power facilities that have either closed or are scheduled to close, and each of them would have cooling water capacity and transmission infrastructure. A SMR could start generating electricity by 2035, while a larger plant could come on line by 2037, according to the coalition.\n\n\"The Australian government will own these assets, but form partnerships with experienced nuclear companies to build and operate them,\" the opposition's leader Peter Dutton, spokesman for climate change and energy Ted O'Brien and National party leader David Littleproud said in a joint statement on 19 June.\n\nThe opposition claims the federal Labor government's \"renewables-only approach\" is expensive and is \"failing\", while its target of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 43pc by 2030 has become \"unachievable\". The coalition earlier this month said it would not pursue the target, although it declined to set its own 2030 goal for GHG emissions cuts.\n\nFederal energy minister Chris Bowen said the coalition's plan lacked detail, costs or modelling, although the opposition has vowed to engage with local communities while site studies, including detailed technical and economic assessments, take place. The proposed sites are the Liddell and Mount Piper plants in New South Wales; the Tarong and Callide stations in Queensland; the Loy Yang facility in Victoria; the Northern Power station in South Australia; and the Muja plant in Western Australia.\n\nNuclear power generation is prohibited in Australia under federal and state laws, and the Labor government last year ruled out legalising it because of its high costs. The Australian federal government estimates that replacing Australia's coal-fired plants with nuclear would cost A$387bn ($257bn).\n\nThe Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) late last year said SMRs would not have \"any major role\" in emission cuts needed in the electricity sector for the country to reach its net zero GHG emissions target by 2050, as costs would be well above those for onshore wind and solar photovoltaic (PV). Nuclear plants would also take 15 years or more to be deployed because of lengthy periods for certification, planning and construction, CSIRO noted.\n\nCSIRO last month included large-scale nuclear costs for the first time in its annual GenCost report, saying costs would be lower than those for SMRs but still way above renewables. Estimated costs between A$136-226/MWh could be reached by 2040, compared with A$171-366/MWh for SMRs and A$144-239/MWh for coal-fired power with carbon capture and storage (CCS), but only if Australia committed to a \"continuous nuclear building programme\", requiring an initial investment in a higher cost unit.\n\n\"If a decision to pursue nuclear in Australia were made in 2025, with political support for the required legislative changes, then the first full operation would be no sooner than 2040,\" CSIRO noted.", "source": {"uri": "argusmedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Argus

Seven standard nuclear reactors would deliver approximately nine gigawatts of energy capacity. With AEMO's latest plan indicating Australia will need at least 300 gigawatts by 2050, Peter Dutton must reveal where the rest of the power is coming from in his energy scheme: how much more coal and gas will get burned to support this nuclear fantasy?\n\nClimate Council CEO Amanda McKenzie said: \"The Coalition's nuclear proposal is a smokescreen for its commitment to climate pollution, a clear case of radioactive greenwashing and a scheme for more climate pollution, it's that simple.\n\n\"The winners from this scheme are the multinational coal and gas corporations who will keep polluting until well past mid-century. On the other hand, as a result of this scheme, Australians will suffer from worsening unnatural disasters due to climate pollution.\n\n\"Communities are being pummelled by heatwaves and dangerous bushfires one week, and extreme rainfall and flooding the next. Dutton's scheme is: let the climate burn, let the mega fires burn, let the sea levels rise, let the heat become unbearable.\n\n\"Later is too late - we need clean energy now to slash climate pollution and keep our kids safe. With no workforce, no industry and no waste facilities, nuclear is a generation away in Australia. Nuclear reactors are a dangerous delay tactic that would mean climate pollution explodes in the next two decades.\n\nDr Jennifer Rayner, Climate Council Head of Policy and Advocacy said: \"Under Dutton's scheme Australians will pay twice: untold billions in direct public funding for nuclear reactors, and even more in lives and livelihoods lost because of worsening climate pollution.\n\n\"Our clean energy resources are the envy of the world and we're well on the path to a clean, reliable energy system with 40 percent of the power in our main national grid already coming from clean wind and solar today.\n\n\"Dutton's scheme does nothing to fix the climate and energy challenges we face now.\n\n\"A political party without a real plan for cutting climate pollution can't be taken seriously in 2024. Australians expect and deserve better, and the bad news for Peter Dutton is: Australians know when they're being sold a lemon.\"\n\nFACT BOX: Separating nuclear fact from fantasy\n\nCSIRO found nuclear power is up to eight times more expensive than large-scale wind or solar power. They also estimated a development timeline of at least 15 years for nuclear power.\n\nAEMO's 2024 Integrated System Plan indicates 300 GW of installed capacity will be needed in the National Electricity Market alone by 2050, under the conservative Step Change scenario.\n\nAEMO has also projected that all of Australia's coal-fired generators will close by 2038 under current market conditions. The LNP's scheme is unlikely to have even the first of any new planned nuclear reactors online by then.\n\nAbout us:\n\nThe Climate Council is Australia's leading community-funded climate change communications organisation.

It means less groceries are sold at the store. It means less rate base for the local government authority.\n\nThe Callide Power Station site offers important technical attributes needed for a zero-emissions nuclear plant, including cooling water capacity and transmission infrastructure, that is, we can use the existing poles and wires, along with a local community which has a skilled and experienced workforce.\n\nA key advantage of modern zero-emissions nuclear plants is that they can be plugged into existing grids. This means they can effectively replace retired or retiring coal plants and avoid much of the new spending needed for Labor's 'renewables-only' system, including new transmission poles and wires. All of which will be passed on in the form of higher bills.\n\nI have welcomed the Coalition's announcement and what it will mean for the greater Biloela community. The Coalition supports nuclear as part of the energy mix as we move toward delivering cheaper energy that does not compromise agricultural land, and the environment.\n\nThis will provide jobs and opportunities to the Biloela community while also providing 24/7 reliable baseload power for Central Queensland.\n\nCentral Queensland has a proud heritage as an energy-producing region and there is a high level of 'energy literacy' in the community. I am proud of the local workers who have kept the lights on for many years. Cheap energy has been a competitive advantage for our nation. It has meant we have had a thriving manufacturing sector like the alumina industry in Gladstone.\n\nLabor's approach requires imposing 58 million solar panels, 3,500 new industrial wind turbines, and up to 28,000 kilometres of new transmission lines across the country. Energy experts have warned the cost of Labor's rollout will be between $1.2 trillion and $1.5 trillion. Labor will also require 34 times the current amount of utility-scale variable renewable energy in the national electricity market to meet its hydrogen export ambitions.\n\nThis reckless rollout of renewables is having an enormous effect on the livelihood of local communities and the environment especially in the Biloela region.\n\nNo country in the world relies solely on solar and wind as Labor is proposing. By contrast, there are 32 countries operating zero-emissions nuclear plants. Another 50 countries are looking to do so.\n\nOf the world's 20 largest economies, Australia is the only one not using nuclear energy, or moving towards using it.\n\nToday's announcement by the Coalition is a crucial step in getting Australia back on track.\n\n/Public Release.

Much Coalition concern on Thursday focused on a barrage of memes, with Dutton even calling on the ABC to \"condemn\" one that referenced cartoon koala Blinky Bill.\n\nMichaelia Cash, the shadow attorney general, complained that Anthony Albanese \"should pull his frontbench and all Labor MPs into line and tell them not to make such attacks\".\n\nCash was particularly troubled by what she called a \"disgraceful\" Instagram post from Andrew Leigh, the assistant minister for treasury: a cartoon image of Blinky Bill, with three eyes edited on to his head, standing in front of the nuclear plant from The Simpsons.\n\n\"Is this what Peter Dutton wants Blinky to look like in 50 years?\" Leigh wrote.\n\nIt's the latest iteration of a Simpsons theme from Labor and other nuclear critics referencing the long-running cartoon's nuclear power plant and its depictions of atomic energy - including its famous three-eyed fish, also named Blinky.\n\nLabor MP Dan Repacholi recently posted an AI-generated image of a fisher pulling up a three-eyed fish, critical of the plant the Coalition wants in his Hunter electorate; another backbencher, Julian Hill, on Thursday posted an image of a two-headed cow.\n\n\"Don't know? Vote no,\" Hill wrote, referencing the slogan the Coalition employed during the Indigenous voice referendum.\n\nThe Coalition has been alive to the risk of such attitudes taking hold as it battles to explain its nuclear policy to voters. Albanese recently posted photos of 10 beautiful beach locations online, writing \"they're at risk of a nuclear reactor in their backyard\", to which Dutton quickly posted a rebuttal of his own online.\n\nSeveral Coalition figures hit out at Leigh's Blinky Bill meme. Cash put out an entire press release on Leigh's post, calling it a \"disgraceful example of misinformation\" and a \"juvenile undergraduate attempt at humour\".\n\nDutton raised it on the ABC, blasting it as \"juvenile conduct, which, frankly, should be condemned, including by the ABC\".\n\nPhil Thompson, a Queensland MP and the shadow assistant defence minister, tweeted: \"do you think our submariners will develop three eyes by being on a nuclear powered submarines? Didn't you vote in favour of AUKUS?\"\n\nThe opposition has been linking the Aukus nuclear submarine pact to the energy plan - despite the two initiatives using different technology. On numerous occasions Dutton and other senior Coalition members have invoked Aukus while making its case for nuclear energy.\n\nResponding to criticisms of his post on ABC radio, Leigh claimed Dutton was \"trying to distract from his refusal to release any costings(and) his refusal to provide answers on when nuclear power would come on stream\".\n\nAsked about Leigh's three-eyed Blinky post on Sky News, Albanese said: \"We're not going to take lectures from the Coalition that are out there running scare campaigns about everything.\"\n\nLabor has been making Simpsons jokes about the nuclear policy for some months. With many Australians not overly familiar with nuclear energy, the thinking goes that the Simpsons is potentially a rare point of reference. Labor sources have spoken of highlighting the \"three-eyed fish\" trope from The Simpsons.\n\nDutton, in a speech to a NSW Liberal conference last November, conceded party research found some Australians \"were influenced by The Simpsons ... People didn't want a Springfield going up in their back yard\".\n\nThe Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, tweeted an image of three-eyed fish and nuclear fuel rods on Wednesday night.\n\nDutton has been trying to head off that conversation, saying earlier this week: \"I know the Labor party's putting out all sorts of cartoons, and 'the Simpsons this' and nonsense. This is about keeping the lights on in hospitals.\"\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, Nationals MP Darren Chester - who would have a nuclear plant built in his Gippsland electorate - also criticised the Simpsons jokes.\n\n\"Frankly, it is juvenile and demeaning to listen to some federal Labor MPs continually joking about the 'The Simpsons' cartoon in parliamentary debates, as if it's an intelligent reference point for a mature conversation on an issue of intergenerational significance,\" he said.\n\nLabor MP Brian Mitchell's Victorian seat of McEwen was flagged as a Coalition target in the last election, and it will again be targeted in the next.\n\nOn Thursday morning he tweeted images of Dutton and the Nationals leader, David Littleproud, comparing them to Mr Burns, the billionaire character from The Simpsons, and his employee Smithers.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "josh_butler@theguardian.com", "name":

It'll all happen before Dutton's first nuclear plant is even opened.\n\nSetting aside the numerous other criticisms of Peter Dutton's one-page, uncosted nuclear plan, it's worth pointing out that it completely relies on a crucial, non-renewable resource: time.\n\nThe Coalition's plan is to get one nuclear power plant up and running by 2035, with more to come soon after. Experts say this timeline is implausible. But even if we take the word of a politician promising to deliver an enormous and technically challenging project far in the future over the expertise of subject matter authorities, 2035 is still more than a decade away.\n\nFunnily enough, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says that same decade is also crucial when it comes to mitigating climate catastrophe.\n\nIn a political sense, nuclear's long runway is a strength. If returned to power, the Coalition will have several future election campaigns in which it can point towards nuclear as the solution to Australia's energy problem before its homework is due. Any debate about emissions can be waved away by vaguely pointing at a date in the future (?) when nuclear comes online to provide cheap energy (??) that can be immediately dispatched (???) whenever Australia suffers a days, weeks or months-long sun and wind drought that renders our existing renewables network useless (????).\n\nThe year 2035 will be here before you know it, so sit back and let the boffins at Australia's Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation figure it out!\n\nBut what happens to the climate over the intervening 10 years, even presuming this project is delivered on time?\n\nThe fact that we need to do something to get our carbon emissions down pronto is not controversial. Remember there had been bipartisan support for climate action since 2015... until earlier this month, when Peter Dutton signalled his plans to breach the Paris Agreement. Nine years is forever in politics -- unless you're building a nuclear reactor, in which case it's really no time at all.\n\nAt the current rate, global temperatures are expected to hit 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels by 2035. (We actually hit this mark over the past year, but this measure is supposed to be a multi-year average so we'll just have to wait and see if this trend continues).\n\nHere are some of the things that will happen when -- not if -- we hit 1.5 degrees according to the IPCC and other sources.\n\nKeep in mind, this is the best case scenario. This grim future is what happens if we limit emissions in line with our Paris targets to keep us to 1.5 degrees, not accounting for countries like Australia deciding, well, they just don't want to anymore. It's assuming we don't do things like cap renewable investment to actively kneecap the transition that's already happening.\n\nTiming, as they say, is everything. And maybe nuclear can be part of an energy transition -- after all, other countries around the world are using it right now or already have projects underway. But given how late Dutton's new \"energy debate\" has been launched, is it really meant to provoke a discussion about how to avert an imminent climate crisis? Or is it about kicking the can down the road, again?\n\nAre you buying the politics of Dutton's nuclear plan? Let us know your thoughts by writing to letters@crikey.com.au.

I know technology has improved over the years, but so has car technology and they go wrong in a big way too.\"\n\nFellow Port Augusta local Kareema Elma was pleased about the announcement and said she felt closing the old coal station had been a wasted opportunity.\n\n\"It's definitely hindered opportunities within the region,\" she said.\n\n\"It's [the nuclear proposal] a really great initiative, it's going to bring a lot of economic resources to Port Augusta, it's going to open up a lot of job opportunities.\"\n\nHowever, Mrs Elma said there needed to be more education around what this project could mean for the region.\n\nIndependent Member for Stuart Geoff Brock said he had not been briefed about the proposal and had already received a lot of phone calls from concerned community members in Port Augusta and Port Pirie.\n\n\"The fear is the unknown -- nobody knows what they intend to do, there's no plans for it, there's no costings for it,\" he said.\n\n\"They're indicating that it's going to go onto the old power station site at Port Augusta, that is in private hands.\n\n\"My philosophy is communicating to people, talk to people.\n\n\"We've got nothing whatsoever and it's frustrating, I think it's unprofessional.\"\n\nA state government spokesperson said the government was not opposed to nuclear \"in principle\".\n\n\"But the economies have to stack up and all advice for Australia is that they don't,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\"The reality is this site is not available, and the opposition has not done the proper groundwork before making yesterday's announcement.\n\n\"Peter Dutton's nuclear thought bubble has no costs attached to it and assumes SMR [small modular reactor] technology that has never been built in any advanced democratic

Seven standard nuclear reactors would deliver approximately nine gigawatts of energy capacity. With AEMO's latest plan indicating Australia will need at least 300 gigawatts by 2050, Peter Dutton must reveal where the rest of the power is coming from in his energy scheme: how much more coal and gas will get burned to support this nuclear fantasy?\n\nClimate Council CEO Amanda McKenzie said: \"The Coalition's nuclear proposal is a smokescreen for its commitment to climate pollution, a clear case of radioactive greenwashing and a scheme for more climate pollution, it's that simple.\n\n\"The winners from this scheme are the multinational coal and gas corporations who will keep polluting until well past mid-century. On the other hand, as a result of this scheme, Australians will suffer from worsening unnatural disasters due to climate pollution.\n\n\"Communities are being pummelled by heatwaves and dangerous bushfires one week, and extreme rainfall and flooding the next.

Currently, there are no long duration storage facilities for nuclear waste anywhere in the world, and most nuclear waste is kept in temporary storage near to the nuclear power stations that generate it. This waste will be stored in a temporary and unsafe manner, in storage devices that themselves will become radioactive.\n\nPaul Spearim, Protect Country Strategist, Queensland Conservation Council said:\n\n\"White Australia has a short-sighted approach to country. You are still trying to clean up the mess of Maralinga, Emu Field, Ranger Uranium Mine, and the many closed mines that still scar the landscape across Australia, and leak radioactive tailings.\n\n\"You have forced poison onto the lands of traditional owners, and now Peter Dutton is proposing to create poisons that would last 100,000s of years.\n\n\"We have learnt that white Australia cannot be trusted with nuclear power, and you continue to act without care for our sacred country. We will fight these poisons, they are not welcome, and we will fight against proposals to force them upon us.\"\n\nAunty Jannine Smith, Boujiebara/Dungibara Elder said:\n\n\"I live on Country in Kumbia (20 minutes from Tarong) which has no potable water supply.

Those of us who took global warming seriously would argue that the additional cost of renewable energy was worth paying to save the planet.\n\nFast forward to today and we know that the cheapest form of new generation is wind and, above all, solar PV. The energy sector knows that and has zero interest in building new coal-fired power stations. And Australian families know that too, which is why we have the highest rate of rooftop solar PV in the world.\n\nNuclear generation, on the other hand, is the single most expensive form of new generation.\n\nToday's nuclear power announcement by Peter Dutton offers Australians the worst of all energy worlds. It is designed to delay and obstruct the rollout of renewables, it will increase, massively, the cost of electricity, and it will extend our reliance on burning coal.\n\nSo higher emissions and higher electricity costs!\n\nWe are blessed in Australia with ideal resources of sunshine, wind and land for renewable generation. That is our big comparative advantage. But what do we do when the sun doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow?\n\nThe answer is simple: we produce more electricity than we need when the sun is shining and the wind is blowing and store the excess to use when they are not. We have the technologies to do that: batteries for short-term storage of a few hours and pumped hydro for long-term storage. Both types of storage are being developed and built now.\n\nFor example, our own company, Upper Hunter Hydro, is developing two pumped hydro projects which will store enough electricity to generate 1,400MW for 10 hours - that's a fraction of the storage in Snowy 2.0 but about the same generation capacity as a large coal-fired plant.\n\nThere are many other pumped hydro projects under development in Australia including two huge Queensland government projects, comparable to Snowy 2.0 in their scale.\n\nDutton has said that nuclear power is needed to support renewables. That is nonsense. A nuclear power plant runs at a consistent level throughout the day, it cannot be turned off when there is a glut of solar or wind power like a battery, hydro or even gas plant can.\n\nIf you want to support renewables, you need a flexible, despatchable, source of power that, ideally, absorbs surplus electricity during the day, and discharges it during the night. Thousands of Australians are already doing this right now with rooftop solar and home batteries.\n\nA nuclear power plant would face the same economic challenges that coal-fired generators do now - for much of the day it would be unable to compete with solar and wind. During those times of excess supply the nuclear plant would add to the excess. That surplus electricity would be taken up by batteries and pumped hydro which would then compete with the nuclear plant during the night.\n\nSo the only way the economics of a nuclear plant could be assured in our market would be for the rollout of solar and wind to be constrained. That seems to be Dutton's intention. In other words, the Coalition is planning to intervene in the market to constrain the cheapest form of new generation and use taxpayers' money to build the most expensive form.\n\nSo the Coalition's response to a cost-of-living crisis is to make itself the issue with the promise of higher electricity prices. It's response to the loss of nine of its safest seats to independents committed to climate action is to delay the rollout of renewables and prolong the burning of coal - while we wait for a nuclear nirvana.\n\nIf the first episode of Australian climate wars was a tragedy, the second is an expensive and dangerous farce.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "malcolm_turnbull@theguardian.com", "name": "Malcolm Turnbull", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumped-storage_hydroelectricity", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pumped-storage hydroelectricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooftop_solar_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rooftop solar power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal-fired_power_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coal-fired power station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowy_Mountains_Scheme", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Snowy Mountains Scheme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Dutton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peter Dutton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photovoltaic_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photovoltaic system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Energy industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_plant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear power plant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Queensland Government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel_power_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel power station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Region", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Region"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate change mitigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_(Australia)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coalition (Australia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroelectricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hydroelectricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_generator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric generator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wind power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Associations", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f29b485c356ce30bc55886e1da1c7c958253c4a4/0_612_6335_3801/master/6335.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&s=f45149a312d7384bc7eed8cbd6e6d8fc", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662030", "eventUri": "eng-9662030", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 116, "relevance": 1}

proposal.\n\nGladstone, the closest major centre to Callide, is already transforming into a renewable energy hub, with several large-scale wind, solar and green hydrogen projects across the region.\n\n\"Our community is the industrial powerhouse of the nation, we're getting on with the job of transitioning our economy from fossil fuels to renewable energy,\" Gladstone Region councillor

Farmer, president of Voices of the Valley community group, said there were already several renewable projects on the cards and locals would not accept the risk of a nuclear reactor.\n\n\"The coalition

Truly shocking.\n\nThe response to Peter Dutton's back-of-the-envelope announcement yesterday on seven proposed nuclear power sites -- they hadn't even googled to find out that the owner of the Port Augusta site has other plans for it -- is occurring in a weird haze of amnesia about what's going on with major infrastructure projects in Australia.\n\nOn the one hand, the corporate media gleefully reports news of major cost blowouts for big projects. On the other hand, being taken for granted is the Coalition's ability to achieve an unprecedented project of a fleet of nuclear power stations, including two by 2035-37, without a truly shocking cost.\n\nWhat's the federal Coalition's form on building major projects? Let's take three from its last period in government. The inland rail project was originally costed at $4.7 billion. That doubled to around $10 billion when the Coalition finally committed to it. That then went to more than $14 billion before the Coalition was turfed out. When Labor examined it properly, it discovered the final cost would be more than $31 billion. It's also currently years behind schedule. How's that for a blowout -- a six-fold increase.\n\nThen there's \"Snowy Hydro 2\". That's a lot more complicated than laying a rail track across flat landscape, true. Set in motion by the Coalition in 2017 with an estimated cost of $2 billion, the project rose to $4.5 billion, then more than $5 billion. Currently the expected cost is $12 billion. Even ignoring the initial cost, that's still an increase of two and a half times the initial estimate.\n\nOr there's the NBN. We all know about that. After the Abbott government elected to change the NBN to a multi-technology mix, the initial cost was $15 billion (up from Labor's highly optimistic $5 billion). Later that became $29 billion, then $41 billion, then $56 billion. The final cost was $51 billion, or more than three times the initial estimate.\n\nSo, what kind of blowout would we get with Dutton's nuclear power stations? Just a Snowy Hydro blowout, in which case double the cost, or an inland rail blowout, in which case multiply by five or six?\n\nThat's not to say Labor is much better: the Victorian government's infrastructure program is a litany of huge blowouts and projects that should have been binned, not built. Indeed, Victorian Labor seemingly can't be trusted at all when it comes to infrastructure.\n\nThe inability of governments of any persuasion to prevent megaprojects from blowing out their costs by substantial factors -- on average 28-30% -- has been the subject of more than one analysis by the Grattan Institute. Since the last Grattan report in 2020, there has been a massive burst of construction industry inflation that has substantially pushed up the cost of everything from the smallest renovations to the biggest civil engineering projects.\n\nAnd that's separate from the ongoing and worsening problem of labour shortages for major infrastructure projects. Even as governments race to build more than 1 million new homes in the next five years, there's a shortage of nearly 230,000 workers for construction, according to Infrastructure Australia. Nuclear power plants aren't magically free from these problems -- if anything, they are more prone to them because Australia has zero experience building commercial nuclear power plants.\n\nNor would they be free from many of the more mundane problems that plague big infrastructure projects. The CSIRO's GenCost report uses the cheapest example of ongoing nuclear power plant building, from South Korea, as the basis for its costing of both first-of-a-kind and subsequent (\"Nth of a kind\") nuclear plants.\n\nSouth Korea's nuclear power industry -- KEPCO, which built a delayed, US$24 billion 5.6Gw nuclear plant in Abu Dhabi, could be a major contender to build Australia's plants -- is now being progressively closed down, after repeated discoveries of corruption, graft and dangerous short cuts. These involved the industry as well as the South Korean government's nuclear regulator, which \"has been accused of revolving door appointments, back-scratching, and a disregard for the safety regulations it is meant to enforce\".\n\nGiven the sad history of Commonwealth regulators like ASIC or APRA, or the record of our gambling regulators at the state level, is there any confidence a Commonwealth nuclear regulator wouldn't end up with the same problems as South Korea's Nuclear Safety and Security Commission?\n\nAll of this is on the public record and well known to journalists who cover transport or infrastructure. Political journalists, however, seem to blithely accept that the Coalition can be taken seriously when it proposes a vast new infrastructure project in a decade.\n\nWhat's your confidence in the Dutton's nuclear proposal?

Fear and emotion over safety concerns conspired to paint the technology in a bad light, but it was a mistake to allow it to atrophy.\n\nThe nuclear industry is fond of stating that more people die from solar than nuclear. It sounds like propaganda, but it appears to be true.\n\nIn the last data I could locate, the 2020 U.S. Bureau of Labor Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries report showed that roofers accounted for 111 of the 5,333 fatal injuries that occurred in 2019. Some percentage of those are related to solar installations. Was the response: stop installing solar? No, it was how can we make installing solar safer?\n\nThe argument against nuclear now is focused on cost and time. Both are valid. Nuclear power does cost too much and take too long to build. It would be easy - but in error - to conclude that it's not a technology worth pursuing. Except that both problems are self-inflicted and fixable.\n\nThe nuclear industry has been over-regulated. That has extended development times. And when you turn your back on technology, it stops advancing, and you lose economies of scale.\n\nIf we once again consider nuclear a key component of our clean energy strategy, costs will decline as they have with every other clean technology - including solar and wind.\n\nThe good news is that governments around the world have recognized the importance of nuclear energy and are attempting to breathe new life into the industry. This is long overdue. So, to those who have told me that nuclear was a lost cause: you may want to pay attention to recent events along with the missed clean energy goals that have occurred despite installing record levels of solar.", "source": {"uri": "energycentral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Energy Central"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian Labor Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economies of scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clean technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable energy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear Pharmacy", "wgt": 27}], "image": "https://energycentral.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_meta/public/ece/node_main/2024/6/nuclear20silo20with20flowers20resized.jpg?itok=gdya3w3_", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662030", "eventUri": "eng-9662030", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 108, "relevance": 1}

They've told us that,\" he said.\n\n\"But they haven't started an industry that's going to take these people on.

For example, he's announced the seven sites where the reactors will go and he's explained the reason that they'll go there is because there's already poles and wires and they'll be able to shut down the coal-fired power station that's already there and just plug in the nuclear reactor. Not straight away, of course. First they'll have to acquire the site from the owners who shouldn't ask too much given that they're no longer needing it. I'm sure that they won't hold out when they know that - as they've already announced that it's going there - the Coalition will have no alternative but to pay what ever the asking price is or else end up looking silly. Then they'll have to build the nuclear plant, but how long can that take? That's right, not as long as you think. Not even as long as other countries around the world because we're in a hurry to get it up and running to save all those pensioners who have to choose between heating and eating.\n\nAs for the other considerations such as cost, well, that's going to released before the next election. This is not because they don't know what the cost will be. Apparently they know but they don't want to overwhelm us with too much information. So the cost is one of those things that would be too hard for us to contemplate.\n\nThen we have the question of who will build it. This is not something that we need to worry about until after the election for the simple reason that until we know the cost, we can't know who'll build it. It's like any building project: First you work out how much the house will cost, then you engage a builder and tell him the price... Oh wait, that's not how that works, is it? Anyway, it's how this works, so move on.\n\nA few people were asking where we'll get the processed uranium to put into the reactors. While we have uranium in Australia, we just export it to other countries and they do the refining. Will we do what Rex Connor wanted to do all those years ago and build our own plants or will we just say if we sell it to you, can we buy some back at mates rates?\n\nWhile some people are suggesting that there could be delays because of state government bans and objections from the local communities, David Littleproud made it perfectly clear that this is something that will be worked out during the consultation process. The Coalition will consult with the local communities and tell them that it really doesn't matter what they think because their legal advice is that they can ignore the state governments so why would they listen to a few disgruntled people who seem to think that they have a right to object to a democratically elected government...\n\nThe question of waste was answered by Ted O'Brien when he told us that it would be held onsite until they find out where the waste from those AUKUS subs is going and all the waste can be united into one safe spot. The suggestion that the prayer room at Parliament House might be a good choice was not taken seriously for some reason.\n\nNow I know what some of you are thinking. How can they just decide that old power stations are the appropriate place without a lot of expert analysis into their suitability? Well, the answer to that is simple: It doesn't really matter because they'll never got the ban overturned unless there's a really massive change in the Senate and so paying the owners of coal fired power stations for their land is something that keeps everyone happy because the owners can use the money and the subsidies to keep the coal burning and we won't have to worry about little things like uranium processing or finding some company with a shack on Kangaroo Island to be the ones to organise the build or waste or being blamed when the whole thing runs into more delays than Snowy 2.0?", "source": {"uri": "theaimn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The AIM Network"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rossleigh_brisbane@theaimn.com", "name": "Rossleigh Brisbane", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Dutton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peter Dutton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal-fired_power_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coal-fired power station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_(Australia)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coalition (Australia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_reactor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear reactor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uranium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AUKUS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AUKUS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_O'Brien_(Australian_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ted O'Brien (Australian politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Littleproud", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Littleproud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Connor", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rex Connor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowy_Mountains_Scheme", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snowy Mountains Scheme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House,_Canberra", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliament House, Canberra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_territories_of_Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "States and territories of Australia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Power station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangaroo_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kangaroo Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kangaroo Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Building_Types", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Building Types", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Do-It-Yourself", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Do-It-Yourself", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Build_Management", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Build Management", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://theaimn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/littleproudduttonthumb-e1663645813152.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662030", "eventUri": "eng-9662030", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 105, "relevance": 1}

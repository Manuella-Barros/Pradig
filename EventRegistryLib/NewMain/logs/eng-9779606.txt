Santiago Fern\u00e1ndez Emilio Mart\u00ednez, Gabriel Varela, and Pablo Mus\u00e9 Federico Larroca, have published a paper describing their discovery on the arXiv preprint server.\n\nBack in the days of CRT-based computer screens, hackers learned early on that it was not difficult to translate the electromagnetic radiation emissions into imagery that revealed the contents of someone else's computer screen. When the industry moved to LED-based screens, which use HDMI cables, hacking became much more difficult due to the vastly more complex signaling. In this new study, the team in Uruguay has found that applying AI to the problem makes it possible.\n\nThe work involved capturing electromagnetic radiation emitted from a computer's HDMI cables. They then trained an AI system by giving it screen samples associated with radiation signals moving through the computer's HDMI cable. Over time, the system gradually grew better at deciphering the text displayed on a given computer screen.\n\nTesting showed the system capable of reconstructing text from a random computer screen with 70% accuracy. Good enough, the research team suggests, for most people to get the gist of text on a given computer screen. They also note it is likely good enough to steal passwords, sensitive data, or in some cases, encrypted communications. The researchers found they could improve their results by using text recognition software on the text after it was deciphered.\n\nThe researchers suggest hackers have likely already conducted similar research, meaning such screen-grabbing is probably already targeting hapless users. All it would take, they note, is hardware capable of capturing the electromagnetic radiation emitted by HDMI cables placed near a building, such as in the back seat of a car.\n\nThe team further suggests that most people are not at risk of such an attack, however, due to the skillset the technique requires.

The bad news is this HDMI cable security threat could potentially impact all devices using HDMI, including Apple gear. The \"good\" news is that it's not easy to do, so individual users aren't likely to be targets. But companies and governments might be.\n\nThe study, conducted by a team at Universidad de la Rep\u00fablica Montevideo, demonstrates that it's possible to eavesdrop on HDMI cables and reproduce text displayed on a computer screen. While this may sound like a plot from a spy thriller, the implications for privacy and data security are very real.\n\nUsing artificial intelligence, the researchers were able to decipher the complex signals transmitted through HDMI cables with up to 70% accuracy. This level of accuracy is sufficient to comprehend most text on a screen, potentially exposing sensitive information like passwords or confidential data.\n\nFor Apple users, who often handle sensitive personal and professional information on their devices, the discovery raises important security questions. Many Apple products, including MacBooks, iMacs, Mac Studio and Mac minis, use HDMI ports for external displays, potentially making them vulnerable to this type of attack.\n\nHowever, the researchers emphasize that executing such an attack requires significant technical expertise and specialized equipment. They suggest average users probably won't be targeted. The greater risk lies with high-profile individuals or organizations, like big companies or governments. They might attract sophisticated attackers.\n\nIn fact, the researchers suggest the technique may already be in use by advanced hackers or state-level actors. They paint a scenario where an attacker could potentially capture HDMI emissions from outside a building, using equipment hidden in a nearby vehicle. So we'll probably see this hacking technique in a spy novel or movie sometime soon. A new James Bond installment is due, after all.\n\nWhile Apple is known for its strong focus on user privacy and security, this research highlights the evolving nature of cybersecurity threats. As of now, Apple has not commented on this specific vulnerability.\n\nAs always, Apple users should stay vigilant and follow best practices for digital security. This may include being aware of your surroundings when working with sensitive information, especially in public spaces or near windows. That's where hackers could more easily intercept HDMI emanations.\n\nCybersecurity experts will no doubt keep tabs on how hardware manufacturers, including Apple, respond to this vulnerability. In the meantime, users may want to consider using encrypted connections like HDCP (although a cybersecurity expert would have to verify its efficacy for this threat). And maybe avoid displaying sensitive information on external displays connected via HDMI.\n\nFor more information on protecting your Apple devices, visit Apple's official platform and personal user security guidelines.", "source": {"uri": "cultofmac.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cult of Mac"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_snow@cultofmac.com", "name": "David Snow", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "HDMI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electromagnetic radiation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eavesdropping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eavesdropping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_monitor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer monitor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Data security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Espionage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montevideo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Montevideo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montevideo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_hacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Security hacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMac", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IMac"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MacBook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Password"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-bandwidth_Digital_Content_Protection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Bond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Encryption"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers", "label": "dmoz/Computers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Honeypots_and_Honeynets", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Honeypots and Honeynets", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.cultofmac.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/HDMI-cable-security-threat.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9779606", "eventUri": "eng-9779606", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

Three scientists from the University of the Republic in Montevideo published their findings on Cornell's ArXiv service, spotted by Techspot.\n\nAccording to the paper, it's possible to train an AI model to interpret the tiny fluctuations in electromagnetic energy from the wired HDMI signal. Even though it's a wired standard and it's usually encrypted digitally, there's enough electromagnetic signal coming off of these cables to detect without direct access.\n\nDetecting and decoding are two different things, of course. But the researchers also found that using an AI model paired to text recognition software, it's possible to \"read\" the wirelessly recorded EM radiation with up to 70 percent accuracy.\n\nThough that's a long way from a conventional recording, it's still a 60 percent improvement over previous methods -- and it's more than enough to steal passwords and other sensitive information.

It's a vulnerability referred to as TEMPEST (Transient ElectroMagnetic Pulse Emanation STandard, a very awkward backronym) with roots in espionage going all the way back to World War II.

The researcher's AI algorithm-assisted method of attack (which they're calling \"Deep-TEMPEST\") opens up some very disturbing possibilities.\n\nThe researchers claim that this system, or functionally identical alternatives, are already being used by state-level spies and industrial espionage agents. The sophisticated nature of the technique and the need to be at least somewhere in the vicinity of the target system means that it's unlikely to affect regular users.

When they intercept the data, hackers can then use additional steps to access users' sensitive data, such as personal banking information or encrypted messages. Federico Larroca and his team at the university have created an AI model that can rebuild signals from the leaked signals even from multiple meters away.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nThe researchers prepared an AI model to identify patterns when comparing the original and intercepted signals. The research teams discovered that only 30% of the characters were misread. The team labeled the error rate low; therefore, hackers could still read most of the text. The research team's method was 70% more accurate than the preceding state-of-the-art attacks.\n\nThe attacks mostly occur in government or industrial settings. Therefore, these types of buildings are already taking the necessary precautions to keep their signals safe.\n\n\"Governments are worried about this, but I wouldn't say that the normal users should be too concerned,\" Larroca said. \"But if you really care about your security, whatever your reasons are, this could be a problem.\"\n\nWhen everything was analog, this would have been even easier for hackers to pull off, rebuilding what was on a user's screen using leakage from video cables. However, HDMI made the transmission of data more complex, but it was not impossible for hackers to gain access to sensitive data using AI. So, there is no need to throw away your HDMI cable just yet.", "source": {"uri": "digitaltrends.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Digital Trends"}, "authors": [{"uri": "judy_sanhz@digitaltrends.com", "name": "Judy Sanhz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_hacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Security hacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "HDMI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Scientist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Scientist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_the_Republic_(Uruguay)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of the Republic (Uruguay)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electromagnetic radiation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antenna_(radio)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antenna (radio)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Encryption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_signal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Analog signal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric power transmission"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Honeypots_and_Honeynets", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Honeypots and Honeynets", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cryptography", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cryptography", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/macbook-pro-2021-06.jpg?resize=800%2C418&p=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9779606", "eventUri": "eng-9779606", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

By harnessing the power of artificial intelligence (AI), they have demonstrated the ability to decode encrypted video data from the electromagnetic radiation emitted by these cables.\n\nTraditionally, intercepting video signals has been associated with outdated espionage techniques. However, this new discovery exposes a vulnerability that was previously overlooked. According to TechSpot, the researchers found that the electromagnetic energy emanating from HDMI cables, even when encrypted, contains enough information for an AI model to interpret. This means that sensitive data, including passwords and confidential information, could potentially be stolen without physical access to the target device.\n\nRelated Article: BEWARE: Facebook Ads Bring Fake Windows Themes Hiding Malware\n\nThe breakthrough lies in the development of an AI model capable of deciphering the complex patterns within electromagnetic radiation. Coupled with text recognition software, the system can \"read\" the intercepted data with an impressive accuracy rate of 70%.\n\nWhile this might not seem perfect, it's somehow a new method that hackers can use to \"electronically\" spy on our screens. It's even better than the previous methods.\n\nThe implications of this discovery are profound. It signals a new era of espionage where adversaries can potentially monitor targets remotely by simply intercepting electromagnetic signals.\n\nGovernment agencies, corporations, and individuals handling sensitive information are now at increased risk. The researchers warn that this technique, or similar variants, could already be exploited by state-sponsored hackers and industrial spies, according to PC World.\n\nWhile the average user is unlikely to be targeted, organizations handling sensitive data must reassess their security measures. Implementing electromagnetic shielding can help mitigate the risk of interception. Additionally, employees who work from home should be made aware of the potential threat and encouraged to adopt security best practices.\n\nThe revelation of this vulnerability highlights the urgent need for ongoing research and development in cybersecurity. As technology continues to advance, so too will the methods employed by malicious actors.\n\nTo view the study, visit Arxiv for more information.\n\nIn another cybersecurity report, Kaspersky is now preparing to leave the US anytime soon. With the government ban order imposed on the Russian cybersecurity firm last month, the antivirus maker is more than ready to exit the US market.\n\nThe US government imposed the ban due to allegations linking Kaspersky to the Russian government. According to the administration, it poses security concerns to the national safety.\n\nIt is expected that more layoffs will happen in Kaspersky. The operations will also be halted as a result.", "source": {"uri": "techtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tech Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joseph_henry@techtimes.com", "name": "Joseph Henry", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electromagnetic radiation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Espionage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "HDMI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Encryption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Optical character recognition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Malware"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidentiality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Confidentiality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Password"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_work", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Remote work"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_shielding", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electromagnetic shielding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_World", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PC World"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaspersky_Lab", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kaspersky Lab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Russia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of Russia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antivirus_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antivirus software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Research and development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Birth_Control", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Birth Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Science_and_Technology", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Science and Technology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Methods_and_Techniques", "label": "dmoz/Science/Methods and Techniques", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Chemistry/Nuclear_Magnetic_Resonance", "label": "dmoz/Science/Chemistry/Nuclear Magnetic Resonance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://1734811051.rsc.cdn77.org/data/thumbs/full/449866/820/0/0/0/hackers-can-watch-your-screen-through-this-new-technique-researchers-warn.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9779606", "eventUri": "eng-9779606", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Kylie Jenner rocked a tiny black bikini during her Italian getaway while relaxing aboard a yacht.\n\nThe cosmetics mogul, 26, shared a photo via her Instagram Stories on Monday, July 29, showing her bending over slightly to run her fingers through her hair while the sapphire-blue sea and a rocky coastline could be seen behind her. While she didn't tag the bikini, it appeared to be from her new Khy by Kylie Jenner vacation collection.\n\nKylie didn't look like she was going for a dip, as she accessorized with a gold bracelet and numerous gold rings.\n\nThe reality star has been vacationing in Italy since July 19. That day, she began sharing photos while in Venice, Italy, including sexy selfies in a plunging black mini dress while cruising the city's grand canal.\n\nIn another post, Kylie showed it was a family affair as she cuddled up to son Aire Webster, whom she shares with ex-boyfriend Travis Scott. She called him \"my forever love\" in the caption while wearing the same outfit as her selfies.\n\nThe California native was joined by her bestie Anastasia \"Stassie\" Karanikolaou on her Italian getaway. While sitting in the back of the boat as it cruised down a canal in a separate video post, the pair sweetly looked at each other before going in for a huge hug.\n\nFans were happy to see the ladies back together on social media, as one commented, \"Missed you two.\" Others thought they were going to have a little more than a hug, as one fan wrote, \"You almost kissed, you got me there,\" and another added, \"I thought you were going to kiss bahahah.\"\n\nKylie also used the trip to show off some of her new items from her clothing line, Khy. She modeled a black backless dress that tied around her neck as she posed in front of a window while soaking in the Italian sunshine in a July 20 series of snapshots. \"When in Italy,\" The Kardashians star quipped in the caption.\n\nThe following day, Kylie shared two sweet photos of daughter Stormi Webster with her arm around Aire, 2, as their boat floated underneath a small bridge while heading down a canal. \"Doesn't really get any better than this,\" the proud mom captioned the pictures.\n\nIt didn't appear that the tycoon's boyfriend, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, joined in on Kylie's trip with those nearest and dearest to her. The pair have yet to go Instagram official during their low-key romance, which began in the spring of 2023. The pair were last photographed together during an outing in Los Angeles on June 28.\n\nKylie and Timoth\u00e9e, 28, confirmed their relationship when they packed on the PDA at a Beyonc\u00e9 concert and a U.S. Open tournament in September 2023. They later attended the Golden Globes together in January 2024, although they did not walk the red carpet together.\n\nA source exclusively told Life & Style on July 16 that the Wonka star's reluctance to get to know her famous siblings has become worrisome.\n\n\"Timoth\u00e9e is obviously enjoying himself with Kylie, but when it comes to getting to know her family, he's put in almost no effort and doesn't seem to want to,\" the insider said.\n\n\"Sure, he's come to the occasional dinner or family gathering, like Easter, but that took a huge amount of effort on Kylie's part,\" the source revealed. \"And the few times he has shown up he's spent the majority of his time talking to her and practically ignored the rest of them.\"\n\nKylie's famous siblings -- including Kourtney, Kim and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian, as well as Kendall Jenner -- think it's a bad sign.\n\n\"Her sisters are telling her it's a huge red flag, that if he was serious about anything long term with her, he'd be making a lot more effort with them,\" said the insider. \"Instead, he's giving the impression that he thinks the Kardashians are beneath him, which they obviously find so insulting, and they're telling her it's clear he's just using her for a good time.\"", "source": {"uri": "lifeandstylemag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Life & Style"}, "authors": [{"uri":

However, she insisted on leaving out the topic of her romantic life and any further developments at the doorstep. The Kylie Cosmetics founder is shown busy planning the dinner for her family as the season comes to an end.\n\nFans of the beauty mogul were disappointed to see no mention of her boyfriend and actor Timothee Chalamet in the reality television show. Kylie is seen directing her daughter to keep quiet for a moment. \"Storm! Be quiet for a second while I film this. We are doing a special family dinner at my house,\" she said. Looking at the camera she continues, \"I feel really lucky to have Nobu here to cook for the family. Yeah, we've been traveling a lot, we've been super busy, so it's just the best when we can all get together,\" as reported by Daily Mail.\n\nSpeaking in a confessional during the show, Kourtney Kardashian expressed, \"We haven't all been together and seen each other like this in a while.\" She continued about the dinner hosted by her half-sister saying, \"Well, we're almost all here. There's always one that can't make it, and tonight that's Kendall.\" Kendall Jenner shared her good thoughts on the dinner party by apologizing for her absence, \"I'm so sorry I'm not at the dinner, but I hope that it's all going perfectly and beautifully.\" The Kardashian-Jenner matriarch Kris Jenner confessed humorously how she would prefer to keep her phone to herself. \"Everyone except me deposit your phone in the basket. Someone's gotta have their phone in case of an emergency,\" she said.\n\nCurrently, the mom of two, Kylie is in Italy vacationing with her friend and kids Stormi and Aire according to Daily Mail. The Call Me By Your Name actor was earlier spotted with his rumored girlfriend during the onset of the show when the Paris Fashion Week started. However, the youngest in the Kardashian-Jenner clan barely mentioned him throughout the season leaving everyone puzzled about the stage of their relationship. The two have been seeing each other since April 2023 according to People. When they first started seeing each other an insider revealed, \"She is getting to know him. Kylie is having fun. After years of back and forth with Travis [Scott], she just wants to date without any pressure.\"\n\nThe model and entrepreneur started seeing the actor after parting ways with Travis Scott. \"Everyone wants Kylie to move on. Everyone in the family is happy and supportive of Kylie dating,\" the source added. Back in September 2023, the two were caught in a PDA moment in Beyonc\u00e9's concert.

The Panthers hold the edge in net with Bobrovsky over Skinner, but the play in front of their netminder needs to be stellar as well. McDavid will create one or two chances for himself, but Florida can't allow him to have six or seven significant scoring opportunities. Florida did a tremendous job of slowing down the New York Rangers' top skaters in the Eastern Conference Final. If that defense translates to Game 1, the Panthers should take the advantage in the series and make the Oilers adjust to their style of play. Edmonton wins if its top unit overwhelms Florida and the home side can't control McDavid and Zach Hyman. Prediction: Florida 3, Edmonton 2 Gambling problem?

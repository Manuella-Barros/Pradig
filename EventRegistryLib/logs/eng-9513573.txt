Littler couldn't help but aim a dig at Reds fans after Amad's late extra-time winner last month.\n\nAnd in his Premier League debut in Liverpool, he was jeered by the crowd. Although, Littler had the perfect response to the critics as he signalled '2-0' with his hands after Everton's Merseyside derby win on Wednesday, thanks to goals from Jarrad Branthwaite and Dominic Calvert-Lewin.\n\nSpeaking to Sky Sports, when asked about whether he might get 'stick' from the Liverpool crowd, he replied: \"Like my manager said, expect the worst and if it's not that bad, I'll take it as a positive. Fans can't really take the banter but that's all I do have banter but no, I'll be looking to get a few more points on the board and hopefully guarantee myself at the O2.\"\n\n\"It was a good result for Everton,\" he replied to the result at Goodison Park.", "source": {"uri": "liverpoolecho.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liverpool Echo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stephen_killen@liverpoolecho.co.uk", "name": "Stephen Killen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League_Darts", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League Darts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_O2_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The O2 Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Darts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Aspinall", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nathan Aspinall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belgium national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Merseyside"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrad_Branthwaite", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jarrad Branthwaite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Calvert-Lewin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dominic Calvert-Lewin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_O2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The O2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodison_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goodison Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Darts/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Darts/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/English_Billiards", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/English Billiards", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article29062588.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GMB7vIWXIAE5w2M.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9513573", "eventUri": "eng-9513573", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-23", "textStart": 665, "textEnd": 671}], "sentiment": 0.4901960784313726, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

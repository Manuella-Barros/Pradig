{"id": 243240784, "title": "Kate Middleton Might Still Attend Wimbledon 2024 Amid Cancer Treatment", "text": "Kate Middleton, 42, regularly attends Wimbledon and is known for awarding trophies to the singles champions at the tennis tournament as the patron of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club. Although she has kept out of the public eye amid her cancer treatment, Wimbledon organizers are reportedly \u2018hopeful\u2019 that she will be able to continue the tradition at the event this year. On March 22, Kate announced that she had been diagnosed with an unspecified type of cancer and was undergoing preventative chemotherapy treatment. Following the news, she\u2019s stayed largely out of the public eye, only returning for Trooping the Colour earlier this month. \u201cI am learning how to be patient, especially with uncertainty,\u201d Kate\u2019s statement on June 14 continued. \u201cTaking each day as it comes, listening to my body, and allowing myself to take this much needed time to heal\u2026\u201d Reports indicate that the Princess of Wales, who is \u201cnot out of the woods yet\u201d requires time to recuperate quietly before resuming her royal duties, is planning to attend next month\u2019s Wimbledon tennis championships. \u201cWe\u2019re hopeful that the Princess of Wales will be able to present the trophies as the Club\u2019s patron, but her health and recovery is the priority,\u201d the England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club chair Debbie Jeans told Telegraph Sport on Thursday, adding: \u201cWe don\u2019t know what we don\u2019t know. All we\u2019ve said is that we\u2019ll work with her and give her as much flexibility as possible.\u201d Aside from Kate\u2019s official statement earlier this month, Kensington Palace said late last month the princess \u201cneeds the space and the privacy to recover right now,\u201d offering no timeline for her return. \u201cShe will return to work when she has had the green light from doctors,\u201d the palace added. However, a source exclusively told Us Weekly in early June that Kate \u201cmay never come back in the role that people saw her in before\u201d as her health is still of concern. Her team is \u201creevaluating what she\u2019s going to be able to take on when she comes back.\u201d", "summary": "The Chairman of the All England Club is \u2018hopeful\u2019 that the Princess of Wales will be back to present trophies.", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2024/06/28/kate-middleton-might-still-attend-wimbledon-amid-treatment/", "image": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1550995392.jpg?quality=100", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 01:00:23", "author": "Vivian", "authors": ["Vivian"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.009}

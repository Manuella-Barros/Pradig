{"id": 231971944, "title": "Relieved Barr lifts it again to get job done in Rome, Tuthill through in hammer", "text": "\u201cI left myself a little bit of work to do in the home straight but I knew I\u2019d be strong, I went out relatively conservative,\u201d said Barr. \u201cI\u2019m happy to have got the job done. It\u2019s always a huge relief after the first round as you never know what way it\u2019s going to go.\u201d Barr admitted it was hard to come down from the high of Friday night\u2019s mixed relay gold medal, but he was pleased with the run. \u201cWe\u2019re going in the right direction,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was a really nice confidence boost.\u201d Nicola Tuthill threw 69.85m in qualification to advance to the final of the women\u2019s hammer. The 20-year-old was making her debut on this stage and looked right at home, producing a superb effort to finish second in her group and seventh overall. \u201cIt\u2019s my second farthest throw so to get close to my PB is nice, it\u2019ll be amazing to make the final,\u201d said the Bandon athlete. \u201cI was definitely nervous, but nerves are good too.\u201d Mark Smyth clocked a season\u2019s best of 20.93 to advance to this evening\u2019s semi-finals of the men\u2019s 200m, coming home fourth in his heat. \u201cI\u2019m delighted, happy to get through by the skin of my teeth,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s good to be running sub-21 again, it was tough in lane three with no one in the lane outside me so it was a bit of a blind race.\u201d Kelly McGrory broke new ground in the heats of the women\u2019s 400m hurdles, clocking a lifetime best of 57.10 to finish seventh, which was not enough to advance. \u201cWhen you run a PB you can\u2019t really complain but I\u2019m a little disappointed,\u201d she said. \u201cI messed up my stride pattern between hurdles six and seven and hit a hurdle with my trail leg. If I didn\u2019t do that, I probably would have run under 57 which I\u2019d have loved. I don\u2019t know did I lose concentration a bit.\u201d In the men\u2019s half marathon, Hiko Tonosa came home 43rd in 1:05:42, a race won by Italy\u2019s Yemaneberhan Crippa in 1:01:03. \u201cAt halfway I wanted to push but I couldn\u2019t and I don\u2019t know why,\u201d said Tonosa, who dropped out late in the race at the London Marathon in April. \u201cMy calf was a bit sore and I think I didn\u2019t do enough training for this, I was 50-50 on going, but it\u2019s not too bad. I\u2019m happy to be in green again, representing Ireland.\u201d Shona Heaslip was 34th in the women\u2019s half marathon, clocking 1:12:19, while Emily Haggard-Kearney came home 64th in 1:17:04. Norway\u2019s Karoline Bjerkeli Grovdal, who won silver in the 5000m on Friday night, took gold with 1:08:09. \u201cIt was a tough race and we knew it\u2019d be tough, but I\u2019m happy with my run,\u201d said Heaslip. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could have given it anymore. I was pretty wiped when I crossed the line and that\u2019s always a good sign. It gives me confidence going forward as I look to move up the marathon.\u201d Haggard-Kearney said it was a \u201cbig step up in terms of quality\u201d but said the experience of earning her first senior cap for Ireland was \u201camazing\u201d. The big focus at the Stadio Olimpico tonight will be the women\u2019s 1500m final at 9.40pm Irish time, where Ciara Mageean and Sarah Healy will both have medal aspirations.

The new duo are the San Diego Zoo's first pandas since 2019.\n\nSince arriving in late June, the pandas have been adjusting to their new home in a private habitat at the San Diego Zoo under the careful eye of wildlife health and care teams.\n\nThe zoo's newly renovated enclosure, Panda Ridge, is four times the size of the previous habitat and was inspired by famous geological formations in China including mountains, canyons and cliffs.\n\nYun Chuan, pronounced \"Yoon Chu-ahn,\" is the nearly 5-year-old son of Zhen Zhen, a panda born at the San Diego Zoo in 2007. Xin Bao, pronounced \"Sin Bao,\" is a nearly 4-year-old female.\n\nZoo officials hope the panda pair will eventually produce a cub or two.\n\nA conservation agreement was signed in February. The zoo agreed to pay $1 million a year in exchange for the pair, money earmarked to support Chinese conservation efforts.\n\nThe zoo has a long history of working with Chinese partners on conservation. Pandas first came to the San Diego Zoo in 1987 under an exhibition loan. Over the years, the zoo's program has resulted in six cubs and helped zoo scientists develop techniques to keep young pandas alive, such as panda milk formula.\n\nAlthough pandas were long considered endangered in the wild, they were upgraded to vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature in 2016 thanks to ongoing efforts to protect their health and habitat.", "source": {"uri": "sandiegouniontribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San Diego Union-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emily_alvarenga@sandiegouniontribune.com", "name": "Emily Alvarenga", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Zoo", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Zoo"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_panda", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Giant panda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_biology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conservation biology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Zoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_San_Diego_Union-Tribune", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The San Diego Union-Tribune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_reservation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian reservation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Zoo_Wildlife_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoo_Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zoo Atlanta"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panda_diplomacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Panda diplomacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Habitat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canyon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canyon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Union for Conservation of Nature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Endangered species"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerable_species", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vulnerable species"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wildlife"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Zoology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Zoology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal Welfare", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Wildlife", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Wildlife", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Reptiles_and_Amphibians", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Reptiles and Amphibians", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SUT-L-panda-debut-04.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747559", "eventUri": "eng-9747559", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 245, "textEnd": 251}], "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 223, "relevance": 1}

Additionally, advanced reservations are available for an exclusive 60-minute Early Morning with Pandas Walking Tour before the zoo opens to guests for the day.\n\nYun Chuan and Xin Bao arrived in San Diego in late June and have spent the last several weeks acclimating to the zoo and their new habitat.\n\nAccording to a San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance statement, Yun Chuan is nearly 5 years old and is described as mild-mannered, gentle and lovable. He is the son of Zhen Zhen (pronounced jen jen), who was born at the San Diego Zoo in 2007 to parents Bai Yun (pronounced bye yoon) and Gao Gao (pronounced gow gow). The first character of his name, \"Yun,\" is a nod to his grandmother Bai Yun, who lived at the San Diego Zoo for 23 years.\n\nXin Bao is a nearly 4-year-old female and is described as a \"gentle and witty introvert with a sweet round face and big ears,\" a zoo statement reads. Her name means a \"new treasure of prosperity and abundance.\"\n\n\"For 30 years, we've worked alongside our Chinese conservation partners to save, protect and care for giant pandas and their ecosystems,\" Kohler said. \"And now we have the opportunity to continue caring for and conserving these incredible bears as we expand on our transformative work to secure a future for their species.\"\n\nSan Diego Zoo was the first zoo in the United States to have a cooperative panda conservation program.\n\nChina recalled almost all of its pandas who were on loan to zoos in the U.S. around five years ago after relations between the two countries soured. Cooperation between China and the U.S. has led to the possibility of pandas returning to zoos, including the San Diego Zoo.\n\nThere is typically a $1 million per year fee paid by the zoos for two pandas, and the money is used for China's conservation efforts, according to a 2022 report by America's Congressional Research Service.\n\nChina first gifted the U.S. with pandas in 1972, when two were sent to the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. Part of the goal in loaning pandas to zoos in the United States was to help breed cubs and boost the population.\n\nConservation efforts have saved the giant pandas from extinction by increasing the population from fewer than 1,000 to more than 1,800 in the wild and captivity, causing the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List to downgrade the giant panda from Endangered to Vulnerable in 2021.", "source": {"uri": "cbs8.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "cbs8.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Zoo", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Zoo"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_panda", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Giant panda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bai_Yun", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bai Yun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southern California"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Zoo_Wildlife_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gao_Gao", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gao Gao"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_biology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservation biology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_reservation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian reservation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Habitat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Zoological_Park_(United_States)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Zoological Park (United States)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Research_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Congressional Research Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Union for Conservation of Nature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Endangered species"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extinction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerable_species", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vulnerable species"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cooperative"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Zoology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Zoology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal Welfare", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Wildlife", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Wildlife", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Reptiles_and_Amphibians", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Reptiles and Amphibians", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://media.cbs8.com/assets/KFMB/images/155af6be-d68a-4a4c-b161-b8b82f6a4bf7/20240710T013130/155af6be-d68a-4a4c-b161-b8b82f6a4bf7_1140x641.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747559", "eventUri": "eng-9747559", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 164, "textEnd": 170}], "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 222, "relevance": 1}

Currently, there are six types of bamboo that our giant pandas really like, so both pandas are now very well adapted,\" Huang told China Daily.\n\nExperts from China and the San Diego Zoo have collaborated on feeding exchanges, promptly documenting their opinions in writing and forming necessary procedures, including feeding protocols and training guidelines. Many of these guidelines are formulated into written rules for implementation, according to Huang.\n\nSince their arrival in late June, the panda pair has been acclimating to their new home in the reimagined Panda Ridge space, which is four times larger than the zoo's previous panda habitat. It was inspired by famous geological formations in China and emulates mountains, canyons and cliffs and features new shade trees for climbing, a diverse array of plants, and rolling hillsides, allowing Yun Chuan and Xin Bao to navigate and explore vertically.\n\nLing Shanshan, veterinary expert, director of the Disease Prevention and Control Department at the China Giant Panda Conservation and Research Center, said she appreciates the \"lush and full of vitality\" new panda enclosure provided by the San Diego Zoo.\n\n\"The enclosure features wide slopes, climbing frames, and thriving vegetation, creating a natural and comfortable new home for the pandas. Additionally, the bamboo landscaping not only provides food for the giant pandas but also offers an ideal space for them to play,\" said Ling.\n\nYun Chuan, a male nearly five years old, is identifiable by his long, pointy nose. His mother, Zhen Zhen, was the fourth cub born at the San Diego Zoo in 2007. Xin Bao, a nearly four-year-old female, is best recognized by her large, round face and big, fluffy ears.\n\nThe Zoo offers three ways for guests to experience the giant pandas.

At the time of their arrival, the zoo had said that a wildlife care team will determine when the two would be able to come in front of the public.\n\nSince their arrival, the pair has been acclimating to their home in the newly reimagined Panda Ridge, an \"innovative space is four times larger than the San Diego Zoo's previous panda habitat.\" The new enclosure is \"inspired by famous geological formations in China, emulating mountains, canyons, and cliffs,\" San Diego Zoo said, adding that it features \"new shade trees for climbing, a diverse array of plants, and rolling hillsides that allow Yun Chuan and Xin Bao to navigate and explore vertically.\"\n\nPresident and CEO of San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance Paul Baribault, in a statement Friday, said the zoo is \"delighted to introduce Yun Chuan and Xin Bao to our San Diego Zoo community\" and that he hopes the new residents \"will bring joy to our visitors and symbolize the enduring spirit of international conservation efforts.\"\n\nGet to know Xin Bao and Yun Chuan\n\nXin Bao (pronounced sin bao) is a 4-year-old female and the zoo describes her as active, alert and witty, adding that she is superb climber. Xin Bao's name means \"new treasure of prosperity and abundance,\" according to the San Diego Zoo.\n\nThe zoo said guests may be able to spot Xin Bao pretty easily due to her large, round face and big ears that give her a unique look.\n\nYun Chuan (pronounced yoon chu-ahn), who is almost five years old, has familial ties to the San Diego Zoo. His maternal grandmother, Bai Yun, as well as his grandfather, Gao Gao, both stayed at the San Diego Zoo in the early 2000s. His mother, Zhen Zhen, was born at the zoo in 2007.\n\nYun Chuan name means \"cloud\" and \"big river,\" alluding to the place in China he's from - Sichuan, according to the San Diego Zoo. Altogether, his name means \"big river of cloud,\" a reminder of the \"flowing clouds that often shroud the forests where giant pandas live in the mountains of southwestern China,\" the zoo said.\n\nHe can be easily identified by his long, pointy nose, the zoo said.\n\nHow many pandas are coming to US zoos?\n\nYun Chuan and Xin Bao are not the only giant pandas who will be coming to the U.S.\n\nIn May, the Smithsonian National Zoo said it will get one male and one female panda from China sometime before the end of 2024. The 2-year-old male, Bao Li, is the grandson of Tian Tian and Mei Xiang, the two pandas who left the National Zoo to return to China in November. The female, Qing Bao, is also 2-years-old.\n\nSan Francisco zoogoers also celebrated in April, when the city's zoo said it will get two more pandas from China sometime in 2025.\n\nContributing: Claire Thornton, Saleen Martin, USA TODAY", "source": {"uri": "coloradoan.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Coloradoan"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fort_collins_coloradoan@coloradoan.com", "name": "Fort Collins Coloradoan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Zoo", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Zoo"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_panda", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Giant panda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wildlife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Zoo_Wildlife_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canyon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canyon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_biology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservation biology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cliff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tian_Tian_(male_giant_panda)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tian Tian (male giant panda)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_dynasty", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Qing dynasty"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gao_Gao", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gao Gao"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bai_Yun", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bai Yun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mei_Xiang", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mei Xiang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Zoological_Park_(United_States)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Zoological Park (United States)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sichuan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sichuan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Zoology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Zoology", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Biochemical", "label": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Biochemical", "wgt": 4}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Fine-Chemical_Intermediates", "label": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Fine-Chemical Intermediates", "wgt": 4}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Millennialism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Millennialism", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Puzzles/Jigsaw", "label": "dmoz/Games/Puzzles/Jigsaw", "wgt": 5}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/07/19/USAT/74471577007-yun-chuan-1.jpg?auto=webp&crop=2249,1265,x0,y117&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747559", "eventUri": "eng-9747559", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 434, "textEnd": 442}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 217, "relevance": 1}

(San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance/Handout via Xinhua)\n\nLOS ANGELES, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The panda pair that arrived at the San Diego Zoo from China earlier this summer will make their eagerly-awaited public debut on August 8, San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance announced on Friday.\n\nYun Chuan and Xin Bao landed in California from China on June 27 for a 10-year international giant panda protection cooperation with San Diego Zoo, marking a new round of such collaboration between the two nations. The two are the first pandas to enter the United States in 21 years.\n\n\"We are delighted to introduce Yun Chuan and Xin Bao to our San Diego Zoo community,\" said Paul Baribault, President and CEO of San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance in a press release, adding that \"our newest residents will bring joy to our visitors and symbolize the enduring spirit of international conservation efforts.\"\n\n\"Together with our partners, we continue to make significant strides in ensuring a hopeful future for this iconic species,\" he added.\n\nYun Chuan is an almost five-year-old male identifiable by his long, pointy nose. In 2007, his mother, Zhen Zhen, was the fourth cub born at the San Diego Zoo. Xin Bao is a nearly four-year-old female best recognized by her large, round face and big, fluffy ears.\n\nSince their arrival in late June, the pair has been acclimating to their home in the newly re-imagined Panda Ridge, said the zoo.\n\nThe innovative space is four times larger than the San Diego Zoo's previous panda habitat and inspired by famous geological formations in China, emulating mountains, canyons and cliffs. It features new shade trees for climbing, a diverse array of plants, and rolling hillsides that allow Yun Chuan and Xin Bao to navigate and explore vertically, according to the zoo.\n\nOn Friday, the zoo also released the first video of the two pandas as they continue settling into their new home.\n\n\"Not only is the space of the new panda habitat much larger, but also the comfort of panda habitat and the experience of tourists are considered,\" said Ling Shanshan, a Chinese expert from China, who is helping a local team keeping a close eye on the pandas' health, tracking their weight, appetite and other health indicators on daily basis to ensure they thrive in their new environment.\n\n\"The new home helps visitors gain a deeper understanding of panda life,\" she noted.\n\nSan Diego Zoo, one of the most visited zoo in the country, is the first U.S. zoo to have a cooperative conservation program with Chinese partners. Located north of downtown San Diego in Balboa Park, it is home to more than 12,000 rare and endangered animals representing over 680 species and subspecies.\n\nThe panda pair were selected from the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda (CCRCGP), which has conducted scientific research cooperation with San Diego Zoo for over 25 years, with fruitful results in the protection, breeding and disease control of giant pandas, and related public education.\n\nGiant pandas are one of the world's most endangered species. Nearly 1,900 pandas live in the wild, mostly in the provinces of Sichuan and Shaanxi in China, rising from 1,100 in the 1980s.\n\nA photo released by San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance on July 19, 2024 shows Xin Bao, a nearly four-year-old female panda, at her new home at the San Diego Zoo in San Diego, California, the United States.

They are more advanced in aspects such as veterinary medicine, genetics and vaccination and we learn from them,\" said Zhang Hemin, chief expert at the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda in the southwestern Chinese city of Ya'an.\n\nZhang spoke to journalists during a recent government-organized media tour at the Ya'an Bifengxia Panda Base, home to 66 pandas that lolled about and chomped on stalks of bamboo in a tranquil setting rich with vegetation.\n\nChina's giant panda loan program has long been known as a tool of Beijing's soft-power diplomacy, but its conservation significance could have been an important reason Beijing is renewing its cooperation with U.S. zoos and sending new pairs of pandas at a time of otherwise sour relations.\n\nA pair of pandas that arrived at the San Diego Zoo in June will debut to the public after several weeks of acclimation. Another pair will come to the Smithsonian's National Zoo later this year and a third pair will settle in the San Francisco Zoo in the near future.\n\nTheir arrivals herald a new round of giant panda conservation cooperation, after the agreements from the first round - which began around 1998 - ended in recent years. The ongoing difficulties in the U.S.-China relationship fueled worries Beijing was retreating from sending pandas abroad, but President Xi Jinping in November dispelled the worries with an announcement during a U.S. visit last year.\n\nIt is a brilliant move to soften China's image among Americans but is unlikely to change U.S. policy, said Barbara K. Bodine, a former ambassador who is now a professor in the practice of diplomacy at Georgetown University.\n\n\"If they are to project China not as a big, threatening country, they send several pairs of overstuffed plush toys,\" she said. \"Pandas are cute, fat and fluffy. They sit all day and eat bamboos, then China is kind of this cuddly and fluffy country. It's the best signaling.\"\n\nBut \"it doesn't change the political discussion one whit,\" Bodine said. \"Public diplomacy can do only so much. It does not change the geopolitical, economic calculations. People don't go home after the zoo to be OK for the U.S. to be flooded with cheap EVs (electric vehicles) from the panda land.\"\n\nConservation, however, is keeping the two sides working together.\n\nZhang said there are benefits from sending pandas overseas.\n\n\"Pandas temporarily living abroad raises humans' awareness of preservation and promotes attention to our planet and the protection of biodiversity,\" Zhang said. \"Why isn't it good?\"\n\nZhang said pandas sent overseas have been selected for their good genes. \"They have very high hereditary values. If they bear offspring, the cubs also will have very high hereditary values,\" he said.\n\nWhile Western research leads in genetic studies, China excels at feeding and behavioral training, he said. \"It's mutually complementary,\" Zhang said. The ultimate goal, researchers say, is to help the bears return to the wild and survive and a larger captive-bred panda population is the foundation for that effort.\n\nThe first giant pandas sent abroad were more gestures of goodwill than conservation pioneers from a Chinese communist government seeking to normalize its relations with the West. Beijing gave a pair of pandas - Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing - to the U.S. following President Richard Nixon's historic visit to China in 1972 and then other pandas to other countries, including Japan, France, Britain and Germany, over the next decade.\n\nWhen the panda population dwindled in the 1980s, Beijing stopped gifting pandas but turned to more lucrative short-term leasing then longer-term collaboration with foreign zoos on research and breeding.\n\nUnder this kind of new arrangement, Mei Xiang and Tian Tian arrived at the National Zoo in 2000, with the ultimate goal of saving giant pandas in the wild. Over the 23 years Mei Xiang lived in the U.S. capital, she gave birth to four living cubs: Tai Shan in 2005, Bao Bao in 2013, Bei Bei in 2015 and Xiao Qi Ji in 2020. All have been returned to China.\n\nBei Bei, sent to China in 2019, walked over to a row of lined-up bamboo shoots last month, picked one up with his teeth and sat down to eat it as a cluster of visitors looked on at the Ya'an Bifengxia Panda Base. Staff described the nearly 9-year-old male as sociable.\n\nSmithsonian scientists have been working to \"unravel the mysteries of panda biology and behavior, gaining crucial insights into their nutritional needs, reproductive habits and genetic diversity,\" the National Zoo says in its literature on the panda program.\n\nIts ecologists have been working with Chinese partners to restore natural habitats for the giant panda, the zoo said.\n\nOver the years, it has raised tens of millions of dollars to run the zoo's panda conservation program, including an annual fee of $1 million to the China Wildlife Conservation Association.\n\n\"The purpose of the fund is stated very clearly - it's scientific and research funds for the preservation of wild giant pandas and their habitats,\" Zhang said. \"They are very clear about this. It's not an income of the Chinese government.\"\n\nPandas born overseas can face a language barrier when they are sent to China, said Li Xiaoyan, the keeper of Bei Bei and two other bears from abroad.\n\n\"Some pandas may adapt very quickly and easily upon return, while others need a long time to adjust to a new environment, especially human factors such as language,\" Li said. \"Overseas, foreign languages are spoken. In China it's Chinese that's used, and even Sichuanese and the Ya'an dialect.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailysabah.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Sabah"}, "authors": [{"uri":

At the time of their arrival, the zoo had said that a wildlife care team will determine when the two would be able to come in front of the public.\n\nSince their arrival, the pair has been acclimating to their home in the newly reimagined Panda Ridge, an \"innovative space is four times larger than the San Diego Zoo's previous panda habitat.\" The new enclosure is \"inspired by famous geological formations in China, emulating mountains, canyons, and cliffs,\" San Diego Zoo said, adding that it features \"new shade trees for climbing, a diverse array of plants, and rolling hillsides that allow Yun Chuan and Xin Bao to navigate and explore vertically.\"\n\nPresident and CEO of San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance Paul Baribault, in a statement Friday, said the zoo is \"delighted to introduce Yun Chuan and Xin Bao to our San Diego Zoo community\" and that he hopes the new residents \"will bring joy to our visitors and symbolize the enduring spirit of international conservation efforts.\"\n\nSan Diego is offering three ways for guests to experience giant pandas:\n\nXin Bao (pronounced sin bao) is a 4-year-old female and the zoo describes her as active, alert and witty, adding that she is superb climber. Xin Bao's name means \"new treasure of prosperity and abundance,\" according to the San Diego Zoo.\n\nThe zoo said guests may be able to spot Xin Bao pretty easily due to her large, round face and big ears that give her a unique look.\n\nYun Chuan (pronounced yoon chu-ahn), who is almost five years old, has familial ties to the San Diego Zoo. His maternal grandmother, Bai Yun, as well as his grandfather, Gao Gao, both stayed at the San Diego Zoo in the early 2000s. His mother, Zhen Zhen, was born at the zoo in 2007.\n\nYun Chuan name means \"cloud\" and \"big river,\" alluding to the place in China he's from - Sichuan, according to the San Diego Zoo. Altogether, his name means \"big river of cloud,\" a reminder of the \"flowing clouds that often shroud the forests where giant pandas live in the mountains of southwestern China,\" the zoo said.\n\nHe can be easily identified by his long, pointy nose, the zoo said.\n\nYun Chuan and Xin Bao are not the only giant pandas who will be coming to the U.S.\n\nIn May, the Smithsonian National Zoo said it will get one male and one female panda from China sometime before the end of 2024.

The two are the first pandas to enter the United States in 21 years.\n\n\"We are delighted to introduce Yun Chuan and Xin Bao to our San Diego Zoo community,\" said Paul Baribault, President and CEO of San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance. \"Our newest residents will bring joy to our visitors and symbolize the enduring spirit of international conservation efforts. Together with our partners, we continue to make significant strides in ensuring a hopeful future for this iconic species.\"\n\nSince arriving in late June, the pair has been acclimating to their home in the newly reimagined Panda Ridge. This innovative space is four times larger than the San Diego Zoo's previous panda habitat and is inspired by famous geological formations in China, emulating mountains, canyons, and cliffs. It features new shade trees for climbing, a diverse array of plants, and rolling hillsides that allow Yun Chuan and Xin Bao to navigate and explore vertically.\n\nYun Chuan is an almost five-year-old male identifiable by his long, pointy nose. In 2007, his mother, Zhen Zhen, was the fourth cub born at the San Diego Zoo. Xin Bao is a nearly four-year-old female best recognized by her large, round face and big, fluffy ears.\n\nThe Zoo is offering three ways for guests to experience giant pandas. On the day of their visit, visitors can either obtain a complimentary Giant Panda Timed Ticket or join the standby line. Additionally, guests can make reservations for an exclusive 60-minute Early Morning with Pandas Walking Tour.

The number of giant pandas in the wild has risen to 1,900, and the animal is no longer considered at risk of extinction but is given the safer status of vulnerable.

Zoo officials said its newest resident is part of their mission to invest in Asian conservation and support endangered species like red pandas.\n\n\"The newest red panda was placed here as part of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums' Species Survival for Red Pandas,\" said SF Zoo CEO Tanya Peterson. \"SSPs are comprised of zoological experts who study various factors before moving an animal to ensure the genetic diversity of a species. SF Zoo has provided a safe haven for the endangered red panda for several years, and we are honored to provide a home for Little Mebo.\"\n\nMebo traveled from Tennessee to San Francisco inside the cabin of a Southwest Airlines jet, and enjoyed bamboo mid-flight snacks. Dominick Dorsa, the zoo's vice president of animal care, said \"Southwest Airlines granted a special exception by allowing our red panda to travel in the aircraft's cabin.\"\n\nMany curious travelers were able to view the red panda as Little Mebo was wheeled through an airport.\n\n\"It was hard to keep a low profile with Little Mebo peeking over the mesh door covering of the crate every 30 seconds. Everyone was beyond excited to see her,\" said SF Zoo assistant curator Andrew Poole. Seasoned TSA staff were delighted when the animal went through security.\n\nThe zoo shared photographs and videos of the red panda exploring her new home in San Francisco. Little Mebo joined the zoo's male red panda, \"Tenzing,\" and an older female, \"Hunter,\" at the Red Panda Treehouse located at the Zoo's Youth Exploration Zone.\n\nAlmost 50 percent of the red panda's wild habitat is located in high-altitude forests of the Himalayas.\n\nRed pandas have a bear-like shape, thick fur, small body size, and bushy tails.\n\n\"Red pandas are very skillful and acrobatic animals that predominantly stay in trees. They use their long, bushy tails for balance and to cover themselves in winter, presumably for warmth,\" the World Wildlife Fund wrote.\n\nTwo giant pandas from China will arrive at the San Francisco Zoo by 2025, according to a letter of intent signed by the city's mayor and the China Wildlife Conservation Association.", "source": {"uri": "kron4.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KRON4"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amy_larson@kron4.com", "name": "Amy Larson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mebo_Telecommunications", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mebo Telecommunications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_panda", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red panda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Zoo", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Zoo"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Endangered species"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_panda", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Giant panda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Zoos_and_Aquariums", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association of Zoos and Aquariums"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservation movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zoology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southwest Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_diversity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genetic diversity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamboo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bamboo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jet aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Species"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Fund_for_Nature", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Wide Fund for Nature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fur", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalayas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Himalayas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Curator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Habitat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Zoology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Zoology", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal Welfare", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Alcoholic_Beverages", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Alcoholic Beverages", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://www.kron4.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2024/07/mebo1.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747559", "eventUri": "eng-9747559", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

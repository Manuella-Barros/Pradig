MILF: Motherhood, Identity, Love and F*ckery, published earlier this week, sees the Brit award-winning music artist, and mother-of-two, pose the question \u2013 can women have it all? Described as \u2018passionate, funny and fierce\u2019, the biography does a deep-dive into \u2018the issues that face women today, from puberty and sexual awakenings, to battling through the expectations of patriarchy and the Supermum myth.\u2019 The 42-year-old singer peppers funny and raw anecdotes throughout, including her \u2018challenges of IVF\u2019, \u2018the early years of motherhood\u2019 and how to juggle a romantic life with raising children. Since its release on June 6, the biography has slowly climbed the bestselling rankings and is currently sat at the top of the Women\u2019s biographies and Parenting lists on Amazon UK. The Stone Cold Sober singer married French artist Leyman Lahcine in 2017 and they share two daughters, aged eight and three. But in 2022, the couple split after nine years together. It\u2019s topping two lists on Amazon (Picture: Ebury Publishing) The singer recently released a new album as well (Picture: Ken McKay/ITV/Shutterstock) \u2018Our relationship ended because we have those children,\u2019 the Bake Off star admitted in an interview earlier this year. \u2018And I think that was worth it.\u2019 \u2018You either grow together, adapting to one another like expandable foam and filling the gaps where it\u2019s empty \u2013 or one person grows and the other stays the same.\u2019 She added: \u2018For the first time in my life, I needed more than nothing \u2013 and the expandable foam just wasn\u2019t there.\u2019 Paloma and Leyman parted ways in 2018 (Picture: Richard Young/Shutterstock) The end of her relationship seems to be a key element of the new book which explores the emotional labour women undergo in motherhood and unequal division in parental responsibility. On book launch day Paloma took to social media to share photos of her pumping breast milk at work alongside a fridge full of breast milk. She continued: \u2018At times the motherhood journey can feel isolating and lonely and you can feel unable to see wood for trees. \u2018Especially when our culture puts so much pressure on us to do everything alone or feel guilty if we need / ask for / pay for help.\u2019 Milf is out now. Here are some pics of me pumping breast milk at work and a fridge full of my milk that I stored and eventually donated to a mother who was struggling to produce milk for her newborn. https://t.co/VBBrN9D0Fx pic.twitter.com/a8AeO2a36V\u2014 Paloma Faith (@Palomafaith) June 6, 2024 She described the book as a \u2018hug for women\u2019 and an \u2018eye-opener\u2019 for men. The book has also come alongside the release of her new album, The Glorification of Sadness, which came out in February and explored similar themes. MILF has already received glowing praise from fellow celebrities. \u2018Paloma is a storyteller like no other. Empowering and healing \u2013 a whole generation of women are about to feel SEEN!\u2019 Giovanna Fletcher wrote. Fearne Cotton added the book was \u2018the most raw, funny and liberating look at what it is to be a woman.\u2019 And after discussing the new release on Saturday Kitchen Live, fans are even more excited to get their hands on it. \u2018I don\u2019t usually enjoy watching celebs flogging their books on TV. But if Faith\u2019s book, MILF, is anywhere near as good as her turn this morning, it will be a hilarious, provocative, insightful masterpiece,\u2019 @robinalexbaker wrote. \u2018Quirky, mad and engaging and standing up for women all in five minutes! Go girl!\u2019 @kathiemcgregor4 added. MILF: Motherhood, Identity, Love and F*ckery is available to buy now. Got a story?

Sure, he isn't Charlie Condon, but he may be exactly what the Reds need for the future. Keith Law believes he will be a fast mover (in fact most people who analyze the draft say this), multiple analysts think Paul Skenes when they think of Burns (though they believe he's not as far along in his development as Skenes was when he was drafted), and it flows with the organizational plan.\n\nGetting a top flight pitcher to come to Great American Ballpark is hard. Even guys who the Reds have previous ties with (Sonny Gray) aren't rushing back to pitch in the bandbox. So you must draft and develop good pitching.\n\nThe Reds have gone to the Wake Forest well for pitching the past two years. Much has been reported on the Wake Forest pitching factory that they have and even Burns acknowledges it.\n\n\"Yeah that pitching lab they have there is no joke,\" Burns said. \"(I was) able to get in there and work with all the new technology that baseball is moving to. It helped me move better and work on the mental game and elevate my game.\"\n\nThe Reds are getting a guy who already has a high floor.\n\nThen, in the ensuing rounds, the Reds grabbed pitcher Luke Holman and outfielder Mike Sirota. Both had first round grades attached to them before this most recent college baseball season. Both players experienced some struggles in that season that knocked them down a peg, but clearly something is there for them to have earned a high grade in the past.\n\nThe Reds have spent time and money rebuilding their development system over the last four years.

One Stat Points to Resurgence for Reds Outfielder", "body": "There is one stat that could be a ray of hope for struggling Cincinnati Reds outfielder Will Benson.\n\nIt's not a deep cut to say Benson has had a bad season. You don't have to go far into his stats to see numbers that scare you. His batting average (.190) is horrible, his strikeout rate (40.3%) is atrocious, and there aren't a ton of metrics that point to him bouncing back. There is one that could give some hope, though.\n\nMajor League hitters vary when it comes to statistics they shoot for. There is one statistic that former Reds legend Joey Votto always coveted: barrels. This is something that Benson has excelled at this season.\n\nBenson has a barrel rate of 11.9%. That is good enough to put him in the top-45 hitters in all of MLB in that category. It's also a marked increase from last season and it is a mark that Votto was right around for his final two years in Cincy.\n\nIf Benson can improve his strikeout rate (he has nowhere to go but up from here), while maintaining his ability to get barrels, we could see everything else increase with it.\n\nA Benson bounce back in the final 66 games of the season would make the recent revival of the Reds' lineup enjoyed more sustainable.\n\nMake sure you bookmark Cincinnati Reds Talk for the latest news, exclusive interviews, and daily coverage of the Cincinnati Reds!\n\nYou May Also

Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports / Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe second half of the season kicks off on Friday night in both Major League Baseball and Minor League Baseball.\n\nThe Cincinnati Reds selected Rhett Lowder with the seventh overall pick in the 2023 MLB Draft.\n\nLet's take a look at how he has done so far this season.\n\nLowder, the Reds' highly touted pitching prospect, has had an eventful and promising start to his 2024 season. Beginning the year with the Dayton Dragons in High-A, Lowder quickly showcased his exceptional talent and earned a promotion to Double-A with the Chattanooga Lookouts.\n\nHigh-A Performance with the Dayton Dragons\n\nIn his five starts for the Dayton Dragons, Lowder was nothing short of spectacular. Over 25 1/3 innings, he posted impressive numbers that underscored his potential as a future major league starter:\n\nLowder's ability to miss bats and limit walks was evident, and his 2.49 ERA demonstrated his effectiveness at keeping runs off the board. His .191 BAA indicated that opposing hitters struggled to make solid contact, further highlighted by his WHIP of just 0.95. These dominant numbers earned him a quick promotion up to Double-A Chattanooga.\n\nDouble-A Challenges with the Chattanooga Lookouts\n\nUpon his promotion to the Chattanooga Lookouts, Lowder faced tougher competition and experienced some growing pains. In 11 games his statistics reflected the adjustment period common for many young pitchers moving up the ranks:\n\nWhile Lowder's strikeout and walk rates remained strong, his ERA ballooned to 6.52, and opposing hitters had a much easier time reaching base, as evidenced by his .316 BAA and 1.57 WHIP. These numbers suggest that while Lowder continued to exhibit his strikeout potential and control, he faced challenges with consistency and limiting hits.\n\nOutlook for the Rest of the Season\n\nLowder's first half of the season has been a tale of two levels. His dominance in High-A showed why he is considered one of the Reds' top prospects, and his struggles in Double-A are a natural part of his development as he adjusts to more advanced hitters. With his solid strikeout and walk rates, there is reason to believe that Lowder will make the necessary adjustments and find greater success as he gains more experience at the Double-A level.\n\nAs the season progresses, keeping an eye on Lowder's ability to refine his approach and improve his consistency will be key indicators of his readiness for future promotions and his potential impact on the Cincinnati Reds' major league roster.\n\nMake sure you bookmark Cincinnati Reds Talk for the latest news, exclusive interviews, and daily coverage of the Cincinnati Reds!\n\nYou May Also

In the wild card era, the Reds have never had a losing record at the All-Star break and earned a postseason bid.\n\nHowever, here are three reasons the Reds could emerge from a crowded group to claim a playoff berth:\n\nThe Reds get plenty of chances to gain ground in the second half.

They are 8-5 in July after finishing 14-13 in June. Since a 9-18 May, the Reds have been fighting to get back to .500.\n\n3. Run differential: The Reds have outscored their opponents 432-394.

It has buoyed a disappointing start to the year after a promising year in 2023. The National League Wild Card standings continue to be very deep, the Reds lost a game in the standings to Pittsburgh during that stretch, so they will need reinforcements at the trade deadline to get back to the playoffs. Looking at the injury-plagued roster, the outfield is a point of interest to improve the roster in the interim. Could Luis Robert Jr be the key to getting the Reds back in the playoffs for the first time since 2020? Or will a pitcher be on their way to the Queen City?\n\nA big splash for the Reds\n\nCincinnati has struggled to keep star players around after their rookie contracts, specifically Luis Castillo, Eugenio Suarez, and more. Elly De La Cruz has five years of team control after this season, giving the Reds a pretty clear window of contention. They can prop that window open by trading for Luis Robert Jr.\n\nThe White Sox centerfielder has three years of control after this season, locking down a premier position and adding an above-average right-handed bat to the middle of their lineup. Robert has been connected to the big market teams across the majors in the run-up to the trade deadline, specifically the Philadelphia Phillies.\n\nThe Reds would have to give up a few blue-chip prospects to make this deal with Chicago considering they will likely get many offers for their centerfielder. When you add that to their recent selection of RHP Chase Burns at second overall, they are in a position to move their top prospect.\n\nReds receive: OF Luis Robert Jr.\n\nWhite Sox receive: RHP Rhett Lowder (CIN #1, OVR #20), 3b Cam Collier (CIN #3, MLB #84), RHP Connor Phillips (CIN #5)\n\nA package deal with Oakland\n\nThe Athletics' are a team of interest at this deadline because of their flame-throwing reliever Mason Miller. The Reds will likely not be in the running for him due to their dynamic duo of Fernando Cruz and Alexis Diaz in the bullpen. Instead, they'll look to the starting rotation for a pitcher.\n\nBaseball Reference has Brent Rooker as the most valuable player on the Athletics this season with a 3.1 WAR. No Reds outfielder has posted a WAR that high this season. Rooker would be a valuable addition both in the field and as a designated hitter. He has three years of team control and would be a great addition to the Reds long term. With the recent rise of Rece Hinds at the plate, Rooker would be able to give him designated hitter days down the stretch toward a Wild Card spot.\n\nOn the mound, the Reds would be wise to add Ross Stripling. He is currently on the injured list with an elbow strain but is expected to return after the All-Star Break. He is a low-risk, high-reward add for Cincinnati at the trade deadline as he will be an unrestricted free agent after the season.\n\nFor the Athletics, they will look to have players who they can develop in the minor leagues while the team awaits their new home in Las Vegas.\n\nReds receive: OF/DH Brent Rooker, RHP Ross Stripling\n\nAthletics receive: 3b Cam Collier (CIN #3, MLB #84), RHP Chase Petty (CIN #6), RHP Ty Floyd (CIN #11).\n\nBeefing up the starting rotation\n\nWhen you think of the Reds and their current core, it is almost all offensive players. The pitching could use another big arm to help bring along young up-and-comers, specifically Hunter Greene. Frankie Montas has been a solid starter but won't scare any teams come playoff time. The Reds can continue to look west and add Tyler Anderson from the Los Angeles Angels.\n\nAnderson will be a free agent after the 2025 season which gives him a great opportunity to spend over one year as a top-2 starter on a playoff team. This will also help the Reds this offseason as Montas has an opt-out after the season. If they decided to move on from Montas, they would have his replacement waiting in Anderson. The left-handed pitcher is a great candidate to start playoff games or even come out of the bullpen in a long relief setting in October.\n\nThe Reds looked like a team with no chance at the playoffs in the early stages of this season, but a recent hot streak has them just 3 games back of the final National League Wild Card spot. The additions would have to be significant for the Reds to make the playoffs this season.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri":

As we get deeper into the draft, leaning on the work that we do with our (analytical) model. Identifying players analytically that might have slipped through the cracks. And the makeup work our guys do, finding guys that really fit into our system.\"\n\nThe Reds rounded out their draft with Rounds 11-to-20 on Tuesday. High school pitcher Edgar Colon (Round 11) and Puerto Rican shortstop Adrian Areizaga (Round 14) headlined their acquisitions on Tuesday.\n\nReds All-Star Game Elly De La Cruz 'Amazing': Cincinnati Reds' Elly De La Cruz checked every All-Star box but the obvious one\n\nReds MLB Draft Breaking down the Cincinnati Reds' picks in Rounds 3-10 of 2024 MLB draft\n\n\"We're always messaging to our (scouts) that there are big leaguers after Day 2,\" Katuska said. \"It's our job to find out which ones they are.\"\n\nHere are three takeaways from the final day of the MLB Draft:\n\nThey see upside in Colon and Areizag\n\nColon, a right-hander from Florida, has hit 96 mph, has three pitches and the delivery that translates well to being a starting pitcher.\"He's a projectable kid that has a lot to work with there,\" Katuska said. \"He's the type of guy we really like to get.\"\n\nAreizaga, originally from Puerto Rico, has power and a plus arm. He's a smooth defender and impressed the Reds' organization during a pre-draft workout with the Reds.\n\n\"Really good power for a high school kid,\" Katuska said. \"He was rattling (home runs) off the top of the building back behind left field there. It's hard to do that.\"\n\nColon and Areizaga had both committed to play college baseball at the University of Miami.\n\n\"I think we'll be able to get to the finish line with both of those guys and get them signed,\" Katuska said. \"We're very optimistic that we can come to an agreement on both players.\"\n\nIn addition to Areizaga, the Reds added two more position players on Tuesday.\n\nIn the 13th round, the Reds drafted Virginia outfielder Anthony Stephan.\n\n\"We really think he can hit,\" Katuska said. \"When we saw him, we really liked the bat profile.\"\n\nState College of Florida Manatee third baseman Jalen Hairston (Round 18) is a 20-year-old known for his ability to hit. \"There's a lot of projection to him going forward,\" Katuska said.\n\nThe Reds add four relief pitchers\n\nThe Reds typically prioritize adding pitchers who have the profile to be starters, but Katuska said that it was difficult to find many standout available starting pitchers on the third day. As a result, the Reds drafted four true relief pitchers.\n\n\"A bunch of interesting guys there,\" Katuska said. \"We'll see what can happen. We've had success with those guys who have been primarily college relievers that we can develop.\"\n\nLSU right-hander Will Cannon (Round 12) is up to 98 mph with his fastball. Virginia Tech right-hander Jordan Little (Round 15) has good fastball characteristics. Duke right-hander Jimmy Romano (Round 16) is a converted shortstop who hasn't pitched much yet. \"We see some upside there,\" Katuska said. University of South Carolina Upstate right-hander Trent Hodgdon is another power arm.\n\n\"We prioritized guys with stuff who throw strikes,\" Katuska said. \"I think we got a decent number of them there.\"\n\nThey might not sign all of their draft picks\n\nKatuska said that he's optimistic that the Reds will sign \"a bunch\" of their draft picks, but he doesn't think the Reds will be able to sign all 21.\n\nNineteenth-round pick Owen Pate is an interesting case.\n\n\"He's probably going to be a draft and follow type of player,\" Katuska said.\n\nThe Reds took this approach with 2023 draft picks JP Ortiz and Drew Pestka. The Reds picked them in 2023 and the players went on to play a year of junior college. This summer, they both went on to sign with the Reds.\n\n\"If we don't sign him right now, we have the opportunity to watch him all next year and see what his path looks like,\" Katuska said.\n\nRound

Later in the night, Cincinnati rounded out its first day of picks with Nebraska high school shortstop Tyson Lewis and LSU right-hander Luke Holman.Then, on Monday, eight more players were picked by Cincinnati, including three catchers and several accomplished college hitters.Below is a breakdown of each pick the Reds made on the third and final day of the 2024 MLB Draft.Round 11, No. 329 overall: RHP Edgar Colon, Felix Varela Senior HS (FL)An 18-year-old right-hander out of a Florida high school, Colon would forego a commitment to the Miami Hurricanes if he signs with the Reds and begins his professional career.Originally from Puerto Rico, the baseball scouting website Perfect Game ranks Colon as the top right-handed pitching prospect from the area, in part due to his fastball which is among the best in his class.Colon is the first prep pitcher taken by the Reds in the draft after they previously selected four collegiate pitchers on Sunday and Monday.Round 12, No. 359 overall: RHP Will Cannon, AuburnWhile his collegiate numbers may not stack up well against some of the SEC's elite pitchers, Cannon's pure stuff and strikeout ability clearly intrigued the Reds.In two seasons at Auburn, Cannon pitched to a 5.57 ERA, including an ERA of nearly 8.00 in mostly relief appearances. The right-hander was able to rack up strikeouts, however, punching out 70 hitters since 2023.If Cannon is able to maintain better control of his fastball while continuing to harness his strikeout ability, he could become a useful depth piece for the Reds organization.Round 13, No. 389 overall: OF Anthony Stephan, VirginiaThe Reds' first position player of the draft's third day, Stephan is a contact-oriented hitter whose style is unique in a modern game driven by power and extra-base hits.In three seasons at Virginia, the 5-foot-11 Stephan hit .309 with 98 hits. The outfielder also displayed a penchant for getting on base consistently, recording an astounding .455 on-base percentage during his final season with the Cavaliers.Round 14, No. 419 overall: SS Adrian Areizaga, Leadership Christian Academy (PR)The Reds went with another young player out of Puerto Rico with their 14th-round pick on Tuesday, taking the talented Areizaga with the hope of swaying him from his commitment to Miami next season.The 18-year-old Areizaga is ranked by Perfect Game as the No. 51 shortstop in the draft cycle, with the scouting website describing him as an athletic player whose movement and agility should allow him to play multiple positions up the middle as he continues to develop.Perfect Game also cited the need for Areizaga to continue getting stronger as he enters professional baseball, which could aid in the power and hitting departments against advanced competition.Round 15, No. 449 overall: RHP Jordan Little, Virginia TechThe 6-foot-4 Little pitched exclusively out of the bullpen during his time at East Carolina and Virginia Tech.Injuries limited Little to only five games for East Carolina, during which he struggled, but the North Carolina native showed flashes of dominance during his one season with the Hokies, striking out 34 hitters in just over 25 innings last season.Round 16, No. 479 overall: RHP Jimmy Romano, DukeAnother relief pitcher with previous success in college, Romano is set to join the Reds after pitching two seasons out of the bullpen for Duke.The New Jersey native put together a strong campaign in relief last season for the Blue Devils, logging a 3.91 ERA with 34 strikeouts as Duke won 40 games and reached the NCAA Tournament before bowing out in the Norman Regional.Round 17, No. 509 overall: RHP Trent Hodgdon, South Carolina Upstate (SC)An Oklahoma native who attended high school in Alabama, Hodgdon's baseball journey has taken him around the country before the Reds snatched him up in the 17th round.His college career began at West Virginia, where he pitched only eight innings out of the bullpen before transferring to USC Upstate. At his second stop, the right-hander found much more success in the strikeout department, punching out 51 hitters as a weapon out of the Spartans' bullpen. Round 18, No. 539 overall: 3B Jalen Hairston, State College of Florida Manatee (FL)A Florida native who was ranked as one of the best junior college prospects in the draft this year, Hairston attended the State College of Florida in Sarasota.Having spent time in summer league action as both an infielder and a relief pitcher, Hairston is listed by MLB.com as a third baseman, possibly indicating that the Reds see his long-term future on the dirt, rather than on the mound.Hairston hit .262 with eight runs scored and two stolen bases in limited action last season at State College of Florida.Round 19, No. 569 overall: RHP Owen Pote, Sherwood Park, ABA lanky right-handed pitcher who is originally from Canada, Pote is listed as 6-foot-6 according to the baseball scouting website Prep Baseball Report.Pote recently participated in the Toronto Blue Jays' Canadian Futures Showcase, one of the largest amateur baseball tournaments in Canada that focuses on professional development and is held at the home of the Blue Jays, the Rogers Centre.Round 20, No. 599 overall: LHP Mason Russell, Casteel HS (AZ)The Reds rounded out their 2024 draft group with the selection of Russell, an 18-year-0ld who MLB Pipeline ranked as its 97th-best player in the class.Committed to pitch at Arizona next season, evaluators said Russell can run his fastball up to 95 miles per hour, while also mixing in a curveball and a changeup.MLB Pipeline also lauded Russell's ability to deliver in high-pressure environments, tossing a no-hitter in the high school state semifinals and another no-hitter in USA Baseball's National High School Invitational.\n\nThe top decision makers in the Cincinnati Reds organization are setting their sights on the future this week with the MLB Draft in Arlington, Texas.\n\nSunday night, the Reds got their draft started with former Wake Forest starting pitcher Chase Burns at No. 2 overall.

But that record also puts them just three games back from the third wild-card spot.\n\nRegardless of their present place in the NL, it's indisputable that the team has underperformed as we creep up to this month's trade deadline.\n\nOne of the game's more popular sleeper picks before the season, the Reds haven't seen infielder Matt McLain, perhaps their best player in 2023, take a single at-bat. Their leading Rookie of the Year candidate, Noelvi Marte, not only missed the first 80 games of the season after testing positive for a banned substance ahead of the season but has struggled in his first 17 games back, striking out 22 times in 67 plate appearances after striking out just 25 times over 123 plate appearances in 2023. Last year's All-Star closer, Alexis D\u00edaz, has mirrored the team's inconsistency, allowing more hits and more walks this year while striking out fewer batters.\n\nThe talent and potential are still there for the Reds, but they've been maddeningly inconsistent.\n\nThat, coupled with shocking mediocrity across the National League, leaves a jumbled mess where any direction the front office decides to take could be justified.\n\nHere are three storylines to watch for the second half of the 2024 season.\n\nThe trade deadline is coming up later this month, so where do the Reds feel they are?\n\n\"I feel that we have everything in place, we're intact, we're a true team and we're positioning to continue to find ways to get better,\" Bell said.\n\nThat can start with hitting the baseball. The Reds' offense is below average in most important offensive categories.\n\nStill, the Reds have, on aggregate, scored enough. They are just one of two teams in the NL Central, along with the Brewers (plus-65), to have a positive run differential (plus-38). And the team is just one of five teams (Atlanta Braves, New York Mets, Arizona Diamondbacks and San Diego Padres) in contention for the three NL wild-card spots with a positive run differential, which has shown to be a good indication of a team's success over a full season. The Reds' run differential is better than all but Atlanta among those wild-card contenders.\n\nThe Reds used 14 starters (not including three openers) in 2023. Through 97 games, the Reds have used just seven, not including Brent Suter, who served as an opener for three games.\n\nTwo of those seven, though, are starting the second half on the injured list, right-handers Carson Spiers and Graham Ashcraft. Spiers is expected to return after missing one start after the break, while Ashcraft's timetable to return is less clear and not expected to be anytime soon. Nick Martinez, who started the season in the rotation, is not currently stretched out to throw more than three innings. To add to that uncertainty, lefty Nick Lodolo has made two starts since coming off the IL with a blister on his pitching hand and both times had success early before running into trouble and failing to get beyond the fifth inning.\n\nWhile Frankie Montas is a free agent at the end of the season and could be a valuable trade piece, moving him would signal to the team that they are indeed conceding the ability to contend for a playoff spot after a trade. None of the team's top starting prospects -- Rhett Lowder, Connor Phillips or Chase Petty -- have had the type of success in the minors this year that makes them immediate candidates to replace anyone in the rotation. If the Reds needed a starter, the first call would likely be right-hander Julian Aguiar, the team's pitcher of the year in the minors last year, who is 2-0 with a 2.25 ERA in four starts at Triple A after getting promoted from Double A, where he was 2-3 with a 3.38 ERA in 13 starts.\n\nTrading from its depth of relievers could be a more middle-of-the-road approach that allows the team to both buy and sell. The Reds also have depth in their farm system that could help bring back offensive players to reinforce a run at the playoffs.\n\nWhen Hinds was called up last week, there was a possibility that he'd be sent back down the next day. Instead, Hinds took full advantage of his promotion and hit a double and a home run in his first big-league game. The next day, the Reds optioned infielder Livan Soto to Triple A to make room for the newly acquired Austin Slater.\n\nHinds bettered his debut the next day, finishing with a double, triple and a home run. The Reds then optioned outfielder Blake Dunn to make room for the returning Jake Fraley.\n\nBy the end of his first week in the big leagues, Hinds had five homers and was hitting .423. That said, it's unlikely Hinds will continue to stay on his current pace, which has him putting up a 341 OPS+ over a full season. The question then becomes, just who is Hinds as a player at the big-league level?\n\nHe certainly looks the part, at 6-foot-4, 215 pounds. He's athletic and his sprint speed is in the 91st percentile, according to Baseball Savant. His arm is good enough to stay in right field and there is, as we've seen, thunder in his bat. Those are all good things.\n\nIn his first week in the big leagues, he has a 25 percent strikeout rate, which isn't that bad but it's also much lower than what he was doing in Triple A, where he struck out 38.4 percent of his plate appearances.\n\nThe Reds need offense, and if they buy, outfield is the natural spot. The team's organizational depth is in the infield, although it's easier to move infielders to the outfield than vice versa. But of the team's top 30 prospects according to Baseball America, the only outfielders on the list who are playing at a level beyond High A are Hinds, Dunn and Jacob Hurtubise, all of whom have played in the big leagues this year. Only Hinds has made a splash.\n\nCould the Reds look to the trade market for an impact bat? Or do they believe Hinds can be more than a player who went on a heater?", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "c_trent_rosecrans@nytimes.com", "name": "C.

But, the past two days have been off days for all teams, and now they come back for the remaining 60-ish games for the season. This season seems a bit more well-scheduled than I remember past seasons being. The end should be a really fun stretch. We have the trade deadline coming up shortly, then another couple of months of a playoff race and changes from the deadline. I'm excited and I'm going to get started on a big second-half run as the Reds take on the Nationals.\n\nThe Reds have to make some good progress here as we begin this period of baseball. They currently are under .500 at 47-50, but that's not all that far back in the division (eight games, not insurmountable, but probably unrealistic) and very close in the division at three games behind the last Wild Card spot. If the Reds fall further back in the race within the first week, expect them to start flipping players for prospects and building upon the future. The team should spark interest as they have a .231 batting average and a team that has hit 108 homers. Their pitching staff has done a good job with a 3.82 ERA and a 1.25 WHIP, and that will also draw attention from opposing teams. The Reds have played good baseball outside of a stretch from April 30th to May 23rd. They were 4-17 in that stretch. Take away that brutal stretch, the team is 43-33. The GM will have to make some tough calls, but a hot start could force them to buy instead of sell. Tonight they put Opening Day starter, Frankie Montas, on the hill for them. Montas is 4-7 with a 4.38 ERA and a 1.33 WHIP. He had a solid enough June going 25.1 innings and allowing 10 earned runs, but he struggled in his most recent start against the Rockies as he allowed five earned runs over seven innings. He's only made two starts in July, but he has allowed two home runs in both games. He does have a tendency to have some control issues, but if he avoids those he typically has a strong outing. He opened the season against the Nationals and three six scoreless innings where he allowed just four hits and struck out four hitters.\n\nThe Nationals are surprisingly good this season. They are 44-53 and I have to imagine they are already on the side of selling for their team. Still, they held strong for longer than I thought they were going to. Coming into the year, I was expecting them to finish in last place within the division. If it wasn't for the Marlins, that probably would come true. However, there are some other positives to take away from this club. They are hitting .239 collectively, but have only scored 402 runs. The Reds have a lower batting average but have scored 30 more runs and hit 28 more home runs. Their pitching staff has been better than I expected, and they are getting young guys a ton of experience. While they will probably want to keep the majority, I am sure there are some guys that will find their way into a new uniform soon. Tonight they put their contractual albatross on the mound as Patrick Corbin takes center stage. Corbin has been brutal for years and has the worst contract in baseball. His ERA hasn't been below five in years. He is 1-9 with a 5.57 ERA and a 1.54 WHIP. For the season, he has made five quality starts. He has allowed four or more earned runs in nine of his 19 starts. He faced the Reds in his first start of the year and allowed four earned runs over 4.1 innings. Overall, Reds hitters are hitting .446 against him.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if this game hits the over, but I am shocked at how low the line is for the Reds. Corbin is a bad pitcher, and Montas may not be great, but he is good enough to grab this one. The Reds are at -118 to win the game. I'm taking that and running with it as I fully expect the Reds to be the better team here and motivated to get off to a good start.\n\nFor more sports betting information and plays, follow David on X/Twitter: @futureprez2024", "source": {"uri": "outkick.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OutKick"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_troy@outkick.com", "name": "David Troy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Reds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Nationals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington Nationals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankie_Montas", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frankie Montas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Run_Derby_(Major_League_Baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home Run Derby (Major League Baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Games_behind", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Games behind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Opening Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Corbin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Corbin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2024/07/Frankie-Montas-Cincinnati-Reds-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9743173", "eventUri": "eng-9743173", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "-04-30", "dateEnd": "2024-05-23", "textStart": 1351, "textEnd": 1373}], "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

We're here to share our MLB odds series, make a Reds-Nationals prediction, and pick while showing you how to watch.\n\nLast Start: Montas struggled before the All-Star Break, going seven innings, allowing five earned runs on eight hits, striking out seven, and walking two in a loss to the Colorado Rockies.\n\n2024 Road Splits: Montas has done slightly better on the road, going 3-2 with a 4.24 ERA over eight starts away from the Great American Ballpark.\n\nPatrick Corbin (1-9) with a 5.57 ERA\n\nLast Start: Corbin went five innings in his last outing, allowing four earned runs on eight hits, striking out five, and walking one in a loss to the New York Mets.\n\n2024 Home Splits: Corbin has not won a game at home yet and is 0-3 with a 5.64 ERA over eight starts at Nationals Park.\n\nHitting has been rough this season for the Reds, as they have dealt with numerous injuries, including a season-ending injury to Christian Encarnacion-Strand and a demoralizing injury to Matt McLain. Yet, they continue to persevere and find ways to score. It also helps that they have one of the most dynamic players in baseball.\n\nElly De La Cruz is a superstar who continues shattering records for the Reds. He is batting .256 with 17 home runs, 43 RBIs, and 64 runs. However, he does almost all of his damage on the basepaths, as he has swiped 46 bags. Jonathan India has been solid this season. So far, he is hitting .275 with eight home runs, 38 RBIs, and 48 runs. Spencer Steer is battering the baseball but is also hitting inconsistently. He is batting .242 with 15 home runs, 60 RBIs, and 50 runs.\n\nStarting pitching has been inconsistent for the Reds. Currently, they rank 13th in baseball in team ERA. Montas will attempt to give them a quality start before turning it over to the fifth-best bullpen in baseball. Then, they hope to hand it over to Alexis Diaz, who is 1-3 with a 4.33 ERA and 19 saves in 21 chances.\n\nThe Reds will cover the spread if De La Cruz can get on base and his teammates can drive him across. Next, they need a good outing from their starter before turning it over to the bullpen.\n\nWhy The Nationals Will Cover The Spread/Win\n\nHitting has been below par for the Nats this season. Currently, they rank 19th in hitting. The Nats need some of their best players to produce at the plate to have a chance.\n\nCJ Abrams has been solid. So far, he is batting .268 with 15 home runs, 48 RBIs, and 59 runs. Luis Garcia Jr. has also been quietly productive. Significantly, he is hitting .281 with 11 home runs, 45 RBIs, and 34 runs. Harold Ramirez has been quiet this season. He hopes to put it all together but is batting just .235 with seven RBIs and two runs over 12 games.\n\nThe Nationals have also had issues starting games on the mound. Substantially, they rank just 19th in team ERA on the mound. Corbin needs a good start in this one before turning it over to a bullpen that ranks just 17th in baseball in team ERA. If they can garner a lead in the ninth inning, it will allow Kyle Finnegan to come in. Finnegan is 2-4 with a 2.45 ERA and 25 saves in 29 chances. Therefore, he has been very productive this season.\n\nThe Nationals will cover the spread if the bats can wake up and they can drive in some runs. Then, they need to prevent De La Cruz from getting on base and wreaking havoc.\n\nFinal Reds-Nationals Prediction & Pick\n\nDespite both of these teams struggling to stay alive in the playoff race, the Reds and Nationals are both among the best in baseball at covering the spread. The Reds and Nats are both 54-43 against the spread. Meanwhile, the Reds are 30-14 against the spread on the road, while the Nats are 24-20 against the spread.\n\nThe Reds took two of three earlier this season at the Great American Ballpark. Additionally, the Nats are just 2-8 over the past 10 games at home against the Reds. Cincinnati has not lost a series in this park since 2019. Consequently, they will again be difficult for the Nationals to solve. The Reds will cover the spread on the road to start the second half of the season, with both teams looking to make a run at a wildcard spot.\n\nClick here for more betting news and predictions", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rb_hayek@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Rb Hayek", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankie_Montas", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Frankie Montas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Corbin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Corbin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Reds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Nationals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington Nationals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationals_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nationals Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_India", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_start", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quality start"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_American_Ball_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Great American Ball Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Save_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Save (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Garc\u00eda_(pitcher,_born_1996)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luis Garc\u00eda (pitcher, born 1996)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Finnegan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Finnegan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Reds-vs-Nationals-prediction-odds-pick.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9743173", "eventUri": "eng-9743173", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

They also are just three games out of the third and final NL wild-card spot held by the New York Mets, though they would need to leapfrog three other teams to get there.\n\nCincinnati is also eight games back of the division-leading Milwaukee Brewers.\n\n\"I think there is room for us to play better, for sure,\" Reds manager David Bell said. \"I've liked that we've stayed true to who we are as a team and we're in position to do everything that we set out to do. We're not there now.\"\n\nOne area they'll be aiming to improve on is their record in one-run games. The Reds are 8-18 in such contests, the second-fewest wins in that category, ahead of only the Houston Astros (seven). And though they've only headed to extra innings four times this season, only once have they come away with the win in those games.\n\nFresh off his All-Star Game debut, Cincinnati shortstop Elly De La Cruz heads into the second half on a six-game hitting streak, connecting at a .375 clip (9-for-24) in that stretch.\n\nFrankie Montas (4-7, 4.38 ERA) will be on the mound for Cincinnati on Friday. The right-hander is 1-0 with a 6.14 in three career appearances (one start) against Washington, allowing five runs on 10 hits across 7 1/3 innings.\n\nIt's been a rough few weeks for the Nationals, who have fallen six games behind the last wild-card berth after being half a game out on June 23 following a win against the Colorado Rockies. At the time, strong efforts from the rotation -- 13th-best ERA in the majors -- helped counter struggles at the plate and kept Washington in the mix.\n\nIt's a different story as the second half begins. Since beating Colorado, the Nationals' rotation had a 5.80 ERA, third-worst in the majors. They're 6-14 in that stretch and now own the third-worst record in the National League.\n\n\"This is part of the learning process,\" Nationals manager Dave Martinez said. \"We're going to push (the pitchers) a little bit, (but) we'll keep an eye on it. Later on, we might go to a six-man rotation and see where we're at.\"\n\nNationals left-hander Patrick Corbin (1-9, 5.57 ERA) is scheduled to start Friday. The veteran is 5-5 with a 4.50 ERA in 16 career outings (15 starts) against the Reds.\n\nNationals first baseman Juan Yepez has been a bright spot since being called up from Triple-A Rochester and making his season debut on July 5. The 26-year-old has hit in each of his 10 games his season, going 14-for-37 (.378 average) with a .541 slugging percentage.

That said, this page is updated frequently so make sure that you click on the link provided so that you're getting the most updated information.\n\nThe Reds will start Frankie Montas, Nick Lodolo, and Andrew Abbott in this weekend's series against the Nationals. Hunter Greene had been on track to start on Friday based on his turn in the rotation prior to the All-Star break, but he will now be bumped back to next week's series against the Braves. Obviously, Greene losing a start against the Nationals and gaining one against the Braves is not ideal for his fantasy managers.\n\nPatrick Corbin will start for the Nationals on Friday against the Reds instead of MacKenzie Gore. Gore will now have his start pushed back to Saturday with Jake Irvin going on Sunday, which means Mitchell Parker will be bumped into next week's series against the Padres\n\nNationals are 2-6 SU in their last 8 games against an opponent in the National League\n\nTake the over. The over is 5-1 in the Reds' last six games overall, is 5-1 in their last six league meetings and is 13-5 in their last 18 road games played on a Friday.

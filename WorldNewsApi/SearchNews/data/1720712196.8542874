{"id": 232194426, "title": "Talk is cheap, reform is only way to end child poverty, insists leading children's charity", "text": "Manifesto promises to end child poverty will mean nothing unless they lead to life-changing reforms, according to a leading children\u2019s charity. The warning comes as all the main parties pledge to tackle the poverty blighting the lives and sabotaging the futures of one in four children in Scotland. Party leaders have now been invited to special hustings to be quizzed by children and teenagers asking how they will ease the poverty endured by 240,000 young Scots. Aberlour, the leading charity working across Scotland to improve the lives and life chances of disadvantaged children, is staging the election summit backed by other influential Third Sector organisations and anti-poverty campaigners. The charity, which is campaigning for a raft of policies including the scrapping of debt owed by children for school meals, believes the talks will be the only event raising the voice of young Scots on one of the campaign\u2019s critical issues. \u2018Only effective action can change lives\u2019 SallyAnn Kelly, chief executive of Aberlour, said: \u201cIt is difficult to think of a more important issue facing our country or one that demands more urgent action. \u201cEvery party has promised to address this national emergency but it would be more remarkable if any party did not. Their promises are welcome but do not feed a baby, or keep a child warm at night, or keep their feet dry on the way to school when their shoes are leaking. \u201cOnly effective action not promises can change lives and that requires commitment and resource. \u201cThe Scottish leaders of all the main parties say ending child poverty is a priority so we have invited them to detail their plans to an audience with a particular interest. \u201cThese children and young people may not be voting in this election but their voices must be raised and their questions should be answered.\u201d Aberlour has invited all the Scottish party leaders to attend the hustings at the Glasgow Science Centre next week \u2013 on June 17 \u2013 to face questions from the young audience. First Minister John Swinney last month promised eradicating child poverty warning is the absolute priority for his government. He warned that it \u201cstands in the way of both social justice and economic growth\u201d.", "summary": "Manifesto promises to end child poverty will mean nothing unless they lead to life-changing reforms, according to a leading children\u2019s charity.", "url": "https://www.sundaypost.com/fp/talk-is-cheap-reform-is-only-way-to-end-child-poverty-insists-charity/", "image": "https://www.sundaypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2024/06/Sally-Ann-Kelly.jpg_47348279-2ka7e54c8.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 12:56:25", "author": "Derek Healey", "authors": ["Derek Healey"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.402}

Gov. Maura Healey (D-MA) broke the news on Friday, saying that effective July 9, migrants will be banned from sheltering in the state\u2019s largest airport. Instead, the sanctuary state will transfer migrants to a taxpayer-funded facility in Norfolk. Massachusetts is opening up an emergency shelter in a former minimum-security prison facility that will accommodate approximately 450 people. The state\u2019s emergency assistance director, Scott Rice, said in a statement that \u201cthe airport is not an appropriate place for people to seek shelter.\u201d Instead, Rice touted the development of the Norfolk sheltering facility as \u201cprogress,\u201d saying it makes it possible to \u201cend the practice of families staying overnight in the airport.\u201d It is unclear how much the facility will cost. Healey\u2019s press release announcing the decision reiterated a message to migrants at the southern border, telling them not to come to Massachusetts without a plan for housing, as the state has been drained \u201cout of shelter space.\u201d \u201cWe are going to continue to spread the word,\u201d the release read, \u201cthat if families are traveling to Massachusetts, they need to be prepared with a plan for housing that does not include Logan Airport or our Emergency Assistance shelters.\u201d The announcement comes after Healey sent a state delegation to Texas, warning migrants at the southern border not to come to Massachusetts. Rice called the trip \u201can important opportunity to meet with families arriving in the U.S. and the organizations that work with them at the border to make sure they have accurate information about the lack of shelter space in Massachusetts.\u201d The state plans to spend $915 million on emergency migrant housing in the next fiscal year. In February, a poll commissioned by the Fiscal Alliance Foundation found that a majority of Massachusetts voters were opposed to providing taxpayer-funded housing to migrants. It is unclear how many illegal immigrants are in Massachusetts. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, there is no \u201ccomprehensive count\u201d of migrants in the state. Between 2010 and 2021, Massachusetts\u2019s illegal immigrant population grew by approximately 120,000. That figure excludes data from 2020. In 2022, the state saw close to 18,000 asylum filings. Between October 2022 and September 2023, the Healey administration tracked an additional 11,000 migrants, marking a 152% increase over the previous fiscal year.

Now, she has switched tactics for the upcoming 2024 presidential election, hilariously intimating that the entire nation lives in fear of the former president.\n\nClinton joined Brzezinski and actress/composer Shaina Taub, who has created a Broadway musical called Suffs, of which Clinton is the producer. The conversation, of course, turned to something more interesting... Trump.\n\n\"I'd like to call this part of this segment 'Therapy with Hillary,' if I may, because she needs another role, therapist. I know a lot of people ask you this question so I want to ask you for our viewers about not just abortion, which I'll get to in a moment, and women's rights, but about former President Donald Trump who is in criminal court in New York City for this hush money thing,\" Brzezinski said kicking off the hate-fest.\n\n(Video Credit: MSNBC)\n\n\"Meanwhile the documents case is delayed, meanwhile Georgia, what's going on here -- everything seems to be delayed and moving down the road and there are even those who argue this Manhattan case is not as big, it's not serious, and he might get off anyway or not,\" she continued.\n\n\"How do people manage, especially people who really love this democracy, who take it seriously, who take the words you just said on our show very seriously, that you can't just sit back and let democracy come to you, that this is every day something we all must work on together -- what do you say to people when they ask you about the former president, these trials, and these delays, and the fear that they feel about the upcoming election?\" the co-host asked Clinton teeing up yet another attack on Trump.\n\nThe lengthy, scripted opening paved the way for Clinton to rail against the former president with expert and frankly stunning deflection.\n\n\"Mika, I'm happy to go to therapy with you anytime because clearly the pressure and the stress on our system, our country, our Constitution, our future is so intense for those of us who understand what's at stake and I don't mean that in a derogatory way to others,\" Clinton stated.\n\nClinton alluded to Trump being an existential threat to democracy, then accused the Supreme Court of doing a \"grave disservice\" to the country by not stripping Trump of his presidential immunity.\n\n\"The Supreme Court is doing our country a grave disservice in not deciding the case about immunity,\" she contended.\n\nShe's also incensed over the indefinite delay of Trump's classified documents case in Florida. The former secretary of state's frustration with Trump not being persecuted was quite apparent.\n\nWhen co-host Joe Scarborough got tired of not being the center of attention and jumped into the conversation, he proclaimed that the \"therapy session\" was officially \"over.\"\n\n\"No, I need more,\" Brzezinski laughed.\n\nClinton went on to push President Biden for re-election even if voters were \"not ecstatic\" about him while painting Trump as \"dangerous.\"\n\n\"When people ask me about the Biden-Trump race, my answer is very clear: we have two old candidates. One is, yes, old and effective, has passed legislation that I think is going to put America on such a strong footing for the future, is compassionate, cares about people, tries hard to make the right decisions, and they are complicated,\" she said. \"The other is old and dangerous. I mean, why is that a hard choice for people?\"\n\nUsers on X were not in the least surprised by Clinton's Trump Derangement Syndrome:\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

One is, yes, old and effective, has passed legislation, that I think is going to put America on such a strong footing for the future, is compassionate, cares about people, tries hard to make the right decision, and they are complicated,\" she told MSNBC. \"The other is old and dangerous. I mean, why is that a hard choice for people?\"\n\nClinton, who memorably wondered why she wasn't \"50 points ahead\" of Trump at one point during their 2016 campaign, was responding to host Willie Geist's question about voters feeling disillusioned and considering third-party options like Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nThe race remains close, according to recent polling, which showed Trump leading Biden by just 2% in a general election match-up. With third-party candidates thrown in the mix in an ABC News-Ipsos poll, Trump garners 42% of support, and Biden gets 40%. Twelve percent of registered voters said they would go for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in according to an ABC News/Ipsos poll.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE\n\nClinton suggested during the interview that voters thinking about sitting out the 2024 presidential election, or voting for a third-party candidate would be throwing their votes away.\n\n\"Every one of us has an obligation as a citizen to try to figure out, waking up the morning after the election. Do I want to throw my vote away? Do I want to not vote and let somebody who doesn't agree with me or care about me essentially fill that vacuum that I left?\" she said.\n\nThe 2016 Democratic presidential nominee continued, \"Or do I want to feel like, OK, maybe I'm not ecstatic about the outcome, but I'm safe. I'm not going to have to worry about what might happen to the economy because we have somebody who took us out of COVID, has tackled inflation, the best economy in the world right now.\"\n\nClinton warned the future of the country was at stake and suggested Trump would get rid of Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.\n\nHILLARY CLINTON SAYS TO MOVE ON FROM BIDEN'S AGE: 'LET'S GO AHEAD AND ACCEPT THE REALITY' THAT HE'S OLD\n\nShe said later in the interview that there was only one choice for women in the U.S. who value freedom in the aftermath of Dobbs decision, which overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\n\"Any woman who has any sense of self-respect, autonomy, agency, independence and values freedom, needs to understand there's only one choice in this election, and that's Joe Biden,\" she said.\n\nClinton has acknowledged age is a legitimate issue in the upcoming election, but has also argued the president should \"lean into\" his years of experience.\n\nClinton was asked by \"Late Show\" host Jimmy Fallon in April about what she'd say to voters \"upset\" by the choice between Trump and Biden.\n\n\"One is old, and effective, and compassionate, has a heart and really cares about people.

The justices were split by both ideology and gender.\n\n\"To hear male Justices of the Supreme Court parsing how many organs you have to lose in order to be eligible for emergency treatment, honestly it was 'The Handmaid's Tale' come alive,\" Clinton said. \"And it was so distressing to me that you would have that kind of conversation going on in the Supreme Court by a radical group of justices who literally want to turn the clock back. They want to turn it back on all kinds of advances we've made.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court case is looking at an Idaho law that prohibits abortion care under all circumstances except if a woman's life is in danger.\n\nThe Biden administration filed a suit against the state over the law, arguing it goes against the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA), which mandates federally funded hospitals provide stabilizing care to emergency room patients regardless of their ability to pay.\n\nClinton reiterated her support for President Biden's reelection, arguing it is crucial to ensuring abortion rights in the U.S.\n\n\"Therefore, any woman who has any sense of self-respect, autonomy, agency, independence and values freedom, needs to understand there's only one choice in this election and that's Joe Biden,\" she said.\n\n\"And it is something that I feel so strongly about because if you are someone who has a religious belief about abortion, then pursue your own religious beliefs. That is exactly what this country allows you, in fact, wants you to do, but that doesn't mean that you or any of your male allies, get to impose your views on everyone else, every other woman in this country,\" Clinton added.\n\nShe urged women voters to make a choice that will \"preserve\" their freedom, noting \"progress is possible, not guaranteed.\"\n\nClinton has been a vocal supporter of access to abortion care and last month warned the oral arguments suggested such access could be limited.\n\n\"The MAGA Supreme Court majority appears ready to rule that the right to 'life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness' doesn't extend to women with pregnancy complications or who otherwise need abortions,\" Clinton wrote on the social platform X. \"This is horrifying, and it is because of Donald Trump.\"", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "miranda_nazzaro@thehill.com", "name": "Miranda Nazzaro", "type": "author", "isAgency":

Clinton rips Supreme Court over Trump immunity case: 'Justice delayed is justice denied'", "body": "Former first lady Hillary Clinton attacked the Supreme Court on Thursday for preventing the Donald Trump criminal trials from being decided before the election.\n\nIn an interview on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" the two-time unsuccessful presidential candidate said the justices are doing \"a grave disservice\" and should have let stand a court of appeals decision denying Mr. Trump's claims of immunity from prosecution.\n\n\"I read the excellent decision by the court of appeals, and the judges there, I think, covered every possible argument,\" Mrs. Clinton said, \"and what we heard when this case was tried before the Supreme Court -- to my ear at least -- were efforts to try to find loopholes, to try to create an opportunity for Trump.\"\n\nMany court observers agreed that the Supreme Court's line of questioning implied that former presidents enjoy at least some immunity, which will require further litigation on the details and how they apply to the four principal criminal cases against him.\n\nAs a result, Mrs. Clinton warned, the cases may very well not be decided before the November election.\n\n\"Justice delayed is justice denied,\" she said. \"The people in our country, it looks as though will most likely go to vote without knowing the outcome of these other very serious trials.\"\n\nMr. Trump faces 91 charges in four cases -- a Florida case about the handling of presidential records, a federal case in Washington about his efforts to overturn the 2020 election result, a Georgia case about his efforts in that state, and a New York case currently ongoing accusing him of business fraud over the Stormy Daniels hush-money payments.\n\n\"These are very serious charges against any American, but someone who's both been a president and wants to be a president again -- that should cause any voter to think not twice, but many, many times over, about whether we should entrust our country to him,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "victor_morton@washingtontimes.com",

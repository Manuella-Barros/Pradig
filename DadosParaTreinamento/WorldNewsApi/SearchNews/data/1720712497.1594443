{"id": 232028072, "title": "NDA govt would fall mid-term: TMC; BJP hits back", "text": "West Bengal minister and senior TMC leader Firhad Hakim on Sunday claimed that the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) won't last long and would fall mid-term. Talking to reporters in Kolkata, Hakim said, \"There is no need to celebrate too much. The NDA government would be short-lived. It won't last long. This swearing-in ceremony of (Narendra Modi) is temporary. The government would fall mid-term.\" His remarks evoked a sharp reaction from BJP leader and former Jadavpur MP Arjun Singh who suggested that the former should be more concerned about his political future. \"He (Hakim) needs to focus on his political career. Instead of talking about the swearing-in ceremony, he should think about his own party and its future,\" said the BJP leader. Singh, who was defeated by the TMC in Barrackpore constituency, confirmed that he had received an invitation to attend Prime Minister-designate Narendra Modi's swearing-in ceremony. The TMC had earlier stated that it had received an invite to Modi's swearing-in ceremony but its leaders would not attend the event. Speaking to reporters outside the Kolkata airport, TMC MP Sudip Bandyopadhyay said, \"We are not going to attend the swearing-in ceremony. We are going to Delhi for the registration of newly-elected MPs. Sunday is the last date, therefore we are going to Delhi. On Saturday, Prahlad Joshi had called and invited us to attend the swearing-in ceremony, but our party has decided not to participate. Therefore, there is no question of attending the event.\" His statement comes a day after West Bengal Chief Minister and TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee had announced that her party would not attend the swearing-in ceremony of the new government at the Centre. \"Neither have we received an invitation nor are we attending it,\" Banerjee had said. In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the ruling TMC increased its seat tally to 29, while the BJP's number reduced to 12.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/kolkata/nda-mid-term-tmc-bjp-back-9381828/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/Firhad-Hakim.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 15:08:35", "author": null, "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.403}

Mina, who is in her 20s, married a Chinese man five years ago and settled in Beijing. She often posts YouTube videos documenting the cultural differences in their relationship. On May 30, she posted a video saying that she had recently become obsessed with watching Chinese durian live-streaming. On Douyin, sellers can be seen surrounded by dozens of durians, enthusiastically introducing their taste, origin and the latest promotional deals to audiences. One such live-stream can attract up to 10,000 viewers. \u201cI find the Chinese sellers are very friendly. They call me sister or baby, creating a great atmosphere, which makes me very happy to watch,\u201d Mina said. What impresses her most are the sellers\u2019 unique techniques. Some can determine a durian\u2019s exact weight by feel, identify the number of flesh segments by looking at the outside, and even split open the spiky fruit barehanded without gloves or tools. Mina likes to refer to this skill set as \u201cthe new kung fu\u201d. One online observer wrote on Weibo: \u201cThese skills are what we call \u2018practice makes perfect\u2019.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t like eating durians, but I love watching people peel them in live-streams. It\u2019s very stress-relieving,\u201d said another. China is the world\u2019s largest importer and consumer of durians, accounting for 82 per cent of global consumption, according to the World Trade Organization. \u201cIn Thailand, durians are a very expensive fruit, but in Chinese live-streams, people can sell 300 durians in a minute,\u201d Mina said. Last year, China imported 1.4 million tonnes of fresh durians, mainly from Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines, according to China customs. Many Southeast Asian countries have joined the durian live-stream craze to grab a share of the market. In May, the Thai government invited two Chinese influencers to live-stream durian sales in Chanthaburi province in the east of the country, achieving sales of up to 100 million baht (US$3 million) in three days, according to Thai PBS. Often considered to be the king of fruits, durians attract enthusiasts with their rich taste and high nutritional value, despite their pungent smell. Originally from Malaysia and Indonesia, Thailand has the largest cultivation among Southeast Asian countries, while China also grows durians in its southern provinces of Guangdong and Hainan. In Malaysia, the main varieties of the fruit are Musang King, which is known for its creamy texture and balanced sweet-bitter flavour, and Sultan King, noted for its robust flavour and slightly dry texture. Thailand\u2019s Mon Thong is recognised for its firm texture and high sweetness, China\u2019s durians have a sweet and full flavour, but are scarce due to limited suitable growing areas. The mainland\u2019s only durian export trade route is through its northernmost province, Heilongjiang, with trans-shipping to Russia, according to the 2024 China Durian Import and Export Data Analysis Report.", "summary": "Known for her videos that document the cultural differences with her Chinese husband, a Thai influencer delights in discovering new and unusual things about her adopted country, especially about the pungent durian fruit.", "url": "https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3265425/thai-kol-hails-bare-hand-opening-spiky-durians-china-live-streamers-new-kung-fu", "image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/06/05/ccb4e09e-2a09-43fe-a0ea-eca438e3dd2f_8aaf7c17.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 06:00:11", "author": "Zoey Zhang", "authors": ["Zoey Zhang"], "language": "en", "source_country": "cn", "sentiment": 0.667}

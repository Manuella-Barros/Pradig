During his Sunday noon blessing, Francis also thanked Jordan, which this week will host an international humanitarian aid conference for Palestinians. \u201cI encourage the international community to act urgently, with all means, to come to the aid of the people of Gaza, worn out by the war,\u201d he said. \u201cHumanitarian aid must be allowed to reach those in need, and no one can impede it.\u201d He recalled that Saturday marked the 10-year anniversary of a peace prayer he hosted in the Vatican gardens, attended by then-Israeli President Shimon Peres and Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas. \u201cThis meeting showed that shaking hands is possible, and that to make peace, you need courage - much more courage than to make war,\u201d he said. Francis threw his support behind cease-fire proposals and said he hoped the terms would be quickly accepted by both sides, even though he acknowledged negotiations \u201care not easy.\u201d PHOTOS: Pope Francis appeals for urgent humanitarian aid for Gaza and backs cease-fire proposals \u201cI hope that the peace proposals on all fronts that have been presented and for the release of hostages will be accepted immediately for the sake of the Palestinians and Israelis,\u201d he said.", "summary": "Pope Francis called Sunday for humanitarian aid to urgently reach Palestinians in Gaza and for Israel and Hamas to immediately accept proposals for a cease-fire and release of hostages.", "url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2024/jun/9/francis-appeals-for-urgent-humanitarian-aid-for-ga/", "image": "https://media.washtimes.com/media/image/2024/06/09/Vatican_Pope_91837.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:54:36", "author": "Associated Press", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.028}

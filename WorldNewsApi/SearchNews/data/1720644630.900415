{"id": 231233380, "title": "Robbie Keane in frame for return to Premier League in coaching role with Tottenham", "text": "The Irish Independent revealed on Thursday that Keane was walking away from his job as the manager of Maccabi Tel Aviv after a solitary season. While Keane\u2019s friend Damien Duff suggested last night that he was sure the Dubliner had something lined up, it\u2019s understood there is no firm plan in place. Maccabi did have the option to trigger an extension factored into Keane\u2019s contract for another year, but they parted ways amicably as the Irishman did not wish to continue working in Israel. He received criticism for working there, and that escalated considerably after the Israeli response to the October 7 attacks with Keane committing to see out a league winning season before moving on. His fresh availability has coincided with Postecoglou\u2019s plans to make changes to his support team, with the departure of assistant head coach Chris Davies for Birmingham leaving a vacancy be to be filled \u2013 although it has been suggested that the Australian was already planning changes. It\u2019s understood that Keane\u2019s name has now entered the frame as an option, as he has retained excellent links with a club where he arguably enjoyed the best days of his playing career although he has no prior relationship with Postecoglou. Keane remains on good terms with chairman Daniel Levy who has given him references in the early stages of his coaching career, and they previously held discussions about the prospect of the Irishman taking an underage role with the Premier League side. The idea of Keane being a part of Jose Mourinho\u2019s backroom was also considered, while he was also a regular visitor to watch training during Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s tenure. They are working together on Soccer Aid this weekend. While the prospect of a Spurs comeback would hold natural appeal for Keane, it\u2019s anticipated that he will have managerial options to consider with club representatives seeking to sound out his intentions since the news broke. Keane\u2019s backroom staff from Maccabi \u2013 including ex-Irish international Rory Delap \u2013 also vacated their roles this week. They would be keen to work together again if the right opportunity arose this summer, so it\u2019s anticipated the 43-year-old will take time to consider options that emerge before making a decision on his future. Naturally enough, Keane has been linked with the Ireland job but that is not expected to be a runner this time around.", "summary": "<p>Robbie Keane could make a return to football as a member of Ange Postecoglou\u2019s coaching staff at Tottenham.</p>", "url": "https://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/premier-league/robbie-keane-in-frame-for-return-to-premier-league-in-coaching-role-with-tottenham/a1393964022.html", "image": "https://focus.independent.ie/thumbor/80R2fnp7cR74adz-fqsw745gjTY=/0x16:3189x2142/550x550/prod-mh-ireland/2925f8ab-34f1-4005-93fe-868de2f0d9c6/bb3e6db5-10ae-4e3a-80cf-ea2211fa273a/tyImages_1134207292.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 13:06:55", "author": "Daniel McDonnell", "authors": ["Daniel McDonnell"], "language": "en", "catgory": "sports", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": 0.037}

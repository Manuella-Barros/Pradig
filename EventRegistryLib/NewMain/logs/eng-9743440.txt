Arsenal signed Pepe for a club record amount of 72 million pound in 2019 from French club Lille. Despite displaying signs of potential in his first two seasons at Arsenal, the winger was unable to leave a lasting impression and, during his third Premier League season, was granted permission to sign a loan with Nice.\n\nPepe said he was subjected to a lot of flak for his performance and was even termed the \"biggest flop in the history of the Premier League\".\n\n\"It was almost harassment.

The intense criticism he received during his time at the Gunners almost led him to retirement, as the negativity took a toll on his mental health. Pepe played over 100 times for Arsenal, recording 48 goal contributions, but failed to meet high expectations.\n\nNicolas Pepe's career has taken a disappointing turn after it has been revealed that the winger is currently without a club, just five years after his mega \u00a372 million move to Arsenal from Lille. At one time, the 29-year-old looked like an extremely promising talent. Through his form for the Ligue 1 club between 2017 and 2019, he shone and caught the attention of big clubs across the world.\n\nPepe scored 37 times in 80 games for Lille, and this convinced the Gunners to splash an eye-watering amount of cash on securing his services during the summer of 2019. Things went south from there, and the Ivory Coast international never came close to replicating the form he'd displayed in Ligue 1 at the Emirates.\n\nRelated Arsenal's Starting Lineup For 2024 Was Predicted in 2019\n\nFrom Rob Holding to Nicolas Pepe, just three of the predicted players are still at Arsenal, while only one is a regular starter.\n\nAside from one promising campaign during the 2020-21 season, where Pepe scored 16 times across all competitions, he struggled at Arsenal. Four years after joining the club, he was allowed to leave the Gunners for absolutely nothing. He moved to Trabzonspor but, less than 12 months later, he's now a free agent.\n\nPepe Revealed He Almost Retired Intense criticism was almost too much for him\n\nWhenever an enormous transfer fee is spent on a player, there's always a level of expectations placed on their shoulders. If they don't quite live up to the hype, they run the risk of being scrutinised as their form is watched under a microscope. This is something that Pepe has struggled with, and it's been revealed that the winger came close to retiring as a result of the criticism that came his way. Speaking to French publication L'Equipe, per journalist Matt Spiro, the 29-year-old said the negativity 'bordered on bullying'.\n\nSpeaking about the situation, Pepe revealed just how big an impact the situation has had on him and his career. The toll all the criticism took on his mentality has had a lasting effect. He said:\n\n\"People don't realise how it can affect you mentally, your family, your performances. I suffered a kind of trauma at Arsenal... like my passion was taken from me. How could (the critics) be so relentless? I was even being called the biggest flop in Premier League history!\"\n\nCalling Pepe the biggest flop in Premier League history is harsh. The winger wasn't completely terrible at the Emirates Stadium; however, considering the astronomical fee that Arsenal paid for him, he certainly didn't live up to expectations.\n\nPepe Played Over 100 Times for Arsenal He spent three years with the club\n\nHaving spent over \u00a370 million on Pepe, Arsenal will have been hoping they'd locked down a star on the wing for the foreseeable future. That's not quite how things played out, though, and after just three years in the first team, he was loaned out to OGC Nice. He was allowed to leave on a free transfer a year later, bringing his time in north London to a premature end.\n\nAcross three seasons in the Arsenal first-team, Pepe played 112 times for the club, and actually recorded 48 goal contributions in that time, so to label him the biggest flop in Premier League history is harsh.

Pepe had just enjoyed a stellar season at Lille, where he was prolific, and had a host of European outfits eyeing him before the north Londoners paid \u00a372million to win the race.\n\nBar the odd moment of brilliance Pepe largely underwhelmed whilst at the Emirates with many feeling as though Arsenal failed to get a return on their investment. The winger only spent three years at the club, scoring 27 times as he continued to be judged harshly.\n\nEventually the Gunners opted to terminate his deal in order to get his hefty wages off their books. Pepe has hit back and claimed he \"didn't ask for the \u00a372m fee to be put on him\" and believes it led to an increase in criticism which saw him consider his future in the sport.\n\nHe told French outlet L'Equipe: \"It was almost harassment. I don't look at social media much, but if my brother told me 'this is what they said about you', it would affect me unconsciously. It also came from the media or from certain members of the club. They don't realise that it can affect the mental state, the family and it affects performance.\n\n\"The only people who have always supported me are the Arsenal fans. At Arsenal, I suffered a kind of trauma, as if my passion had been ripped away from me, I had a disgust for football. I doubted myself to the point that I thought about quitting everything.\n\n\"I wondered how they could have been so relentless in their attacks on me. They even called me the biggest flop in the history of the Premier League. But I refused to mope.\"\n\nPepe had been plying his trade in Turkey with Trabzonspor, where scored six times last term before his one-year deal expired. The Ivorian has previously opened up on his relationship with Mikel Arteta - among those to sanction his departure - and claimed the Spanish coach said he would be part of his plans before leaving him on the bench consistently.\n\n\"How could I be a substitute when he said he counted on me? Everything is spinning in your head,\" said Pepe.\n\nThe winger is now a free agent after opting against renewing his deal with the Turkish outfit and the 29-year-old is reportedly still keen to make an impact in Europe despite interest from Saudi Arabia.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp communityand receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

They don't realise that it can affect the mental state, the family and it affects performance.\n\n'The only people who have always supported me are the Arsenal fans.\n\n'At Arsenal, I suffered a kind of trauma, as if my passion had been ripped away from me, I had a disgust for football. I doubted myself to the point that I thought about quitting everything.'\n\nJust Arsenal Opinion\n\nPepe is one of the worst players that we have signed in recent memory, and the Ivorian will be delighted that he has left the club for good.\n\nYou agree not to give any personal abuse to other Arsenal fans.

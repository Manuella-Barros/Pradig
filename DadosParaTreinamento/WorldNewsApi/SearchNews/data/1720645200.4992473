The three-minute film focuses on weekly classes held at Inverness Leisure. Parkinson\u2019s UK has been working closely with High Life Highland and NHS Highland to train instructors to deliver classes that meet the needs of people with Parkinson\u2019s. There are currently more than 90 people attending sessions in Inverness, Alness, Thurso, Aviemore and Wick. The charity hopes the video, which has just been launched on social media and already racked up more than 5000 views, will encourage more people with Parkinson\u2019s to discover the benefits of regular physical activity. Andrew Grant, who lives in Inverness and features in the video, said the class helps him feel he is doing something positive to manage his Parkinson\u2019s. \u201cIt also provides an opportunity to socialise with people who are going through similar experiences, which is really important,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving an instructor who understands a little more about the condition is brilliant as you know they can provide advice and support on the best types of exercises for you. \u201cI really hope the video shows other people with Parkinson\u2019s the physical and mental benefits that people gain from attending a class like this.\u201d The film also features Carole Jackman, Parkinson\u2019s specialist physiotherapist with NHS Highland, who has been involved in training instructors at High Life Highland. Amanda McKay, physical activity delivery manager for Parkinson\u2019s UK, said: \u201cWe\u2019re passionate about promoting the benefits of physical activity, which can help people live better with some of the symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s. \u201cIf anyone has ever wondered what a class for people with Parkinson\u2019s looks like, this video contains a fantastic example from the Highland region. In addition to demonstrating some of the activities, the video captures the power physical activity has to improve the wellbeing of participants. \u201cWe encourage anyone inspired by this video to find out what is happening in their local area, come along, get active and become part of a real community of support.\u201d Parkinson\u2019s UK also hopes the video will appeal to health professionals and leisure trusts, encouraging them to develop similar offerings in other parts of Scotland. The charity is working with 20 leisure trusts across the country and has trained more than 80 exercise instructors, with training for a further20-30 instructors planned for 2024. Steve Walsh, chief executive at High Life Highland, said: \u201cThere are over 90 people attending our special Parkinson\u2019s classes and more joining online where there are barriers that mean they can\u2019t attend in person. \u201cHaving chatted to many of them, it strikes me how important the social aspect of these classes is, alongside the physical and mental wellbeing benefits, where attendees can share their experiences with each other. \u201cAt High Life Highland we are all about Making Life Better and we are delighted to be able to work with Parkinson\u2019s UK to deliver a service which is making a big difference to people\u2019s lives.\u201d Do you want to respond to this article?

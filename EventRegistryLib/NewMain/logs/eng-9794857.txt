and anyone found liable for supplying the drugs that killed the star will face the full force of the law, an lawyer says.\n\nPerry was found unresponsive in the hot tub of his LA home on October 28, 2023, having suffered acute effects of ketamine and drowning, his autopsy revealed.\n\nThe 54-year-old actor, best known for his portrayal of Chandler Bing in Friends, was found to have similar levels of ketamine in his system as a hospital patient under general anesthetic.\n\nPerry, for years, was frankly honest about his struggles with addiction and had been open about receiving ketamine infusion therapy to treat depression in the months before his death.\n\nHowever, the star's last therapy session was a week and a half before he died, and ketamine metabolises in the human body within hours of consumption - meaning the treatment was not the cause of his sudden passing.\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department launched a criminal investigation in December to determine how Perry obtained the drugs that would ultimately claim his life.\n\nOver the last nine months, the LAPD has been working alongside the Drug Enforcement Administration and the US Postal Inspection Service to re-trace the line of supply.\n\nSome of the detectives working on the case also investigated the overdose death of rapper Mac Miller, who died after consuming a fentanyl-laced opioid in 2018.\n\nTre Lovell, a veteran entertainment lawyer, told The U.S. Sun he believes arrests in the case are imminent and will likely involve multiple people.\n\nLovell further warned that the charges against anyone accused of wrongdoing will be swift and unforgiving, even though Perry's death was ruled accidental.\n\n\"Charges will be coming any day now,\" said Lovell. \"This investigation has been going on for a long time, and the leaks are starting to come out, which are probably intentional.\n\n\"[Anonymous law enforcement sources] are not going to leak stuff unless they intend on indicting, otherwise they'll get egg on their face.\"\n\nIn June, a law enforcement source close to the investigation told PEOPLE the Perry investigation was \"nearing its conclusion\" and \"multiple people\" could be charged.\n\nThe US Attorney's Office has the final say on whether or not charges should be filed, the source said.\n\nLovell says those at risk of being charged could include doctors who may have written Perry an under-the-table prescription, drug dealers who could've sold him the ketamine illegally, and friends or associates who facilitated any illicit transaction.\n\nHe shared, \"There are several ways to impose criminal liability, either through the distribution of a controlled substance, an unlawful act that rose to criminal negligence or recklessness, and even in some cases involuntary manslaughter and mail fraud.\n\n\"There cases are tough [ ...] when somebody overdoses, that's an act of their own volition, so to impose criminal culpability there's a very high standard.\n\n\"They have to get warrants, they have to get subpoenas, they have to get private information from his physician, and this takes a lot of time.\"\n\nDepending on what charges prosecutors pursue - if any - accused parties could face prison sentences of anywhere between four and more than 20 years in prison.\n\nPerry's star power will motivate authorities to prosecute the case to the full extent of the law, Lovell says.\n\n\"The reason for this is because there's a big policy now to attack this kind of drug distribution, with fentanyl at the top of the chain, and these other controlled substances that are floating around, like ketamine.\n\n\"The government - both at federal and state level - has a mandate to go after drug dealing like this where there are overdoses, so they're going after the suppliers - and part of the reason for that strategy is deterrence.\n\n\"They want to deter future acts, and the best way to prevent someone from distributing drugs is deterring them from getting involved in the first place.\n\n\"Where there's a high profile victim, and the press is monitoring it, it's the government's opportunity to show there are severe consequences for supplying people drugs.\n\n\"Not only can you be liable for distributing a drug, you can also be liable for homicide.\n\n\"And they'll want to make that clear in this investigation.\"\n\nThe only person so far publicly linked to the Perry investigation is the late actor's friend, Brooke Mueller, whom he met in rehab.\n\nOver the last few months, Mueller has been the subject of multiple search warrants.\n\nThe actress' LA sober living residence was raided by police in May and her iPhone and a laptop were reportedly seized.\n\nMueller, an ex-wife of Charlie Sheen, is said to be fully co-operating with the investigation.\n\nA source with knowledge of the matter told InTouch, \"She's hired lawyers and has had multiple meetings with law enforcement since they arrived at her sober living house with a search warrant.\n\n\"She's being tight-lipped about the situation. But the investigators must have known something to get a warrant and turn up like that.\n\n\"It's tough to say or know exactly what her role is [in Perry's death], but she's adamant she had nothing to do with that.\"\n\nLovell agreed that for police to have obtained a warrant to search Mueller's home, there must've been strong evidence of a crime potentially having occurred.\n\n\"To seize a phone and search a house, you have to get a warrant, and to get a warrant you have to have probable cause,\" said Lovell.\n\n\"To have probable cause, you have to convince a judge there's likely a crime going on, and if they've been able to get all of that, there's a strong chance that person is a person of interest.\n\n\"We don't know for sure, but if they've gone to those lengths and they have enough evidence to get probable cause for a warrant, then that person is likely suspected of something serious.\"", "source": {"uri": "news.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "News.com.au"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketamine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ketamine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_overdose", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Drug overdose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Postal_Inspection_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Postal Inspection Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mac Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_anaesthetic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General anaesthetic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drowning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intravenous therapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Depression (mood)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metabolism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_Enforcement_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drug Enforcement Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Autopsy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Friends"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_body", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human body"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_drug_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illegal drug trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Opioid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culpability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Culpability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Sheen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Sheen"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs_and_Medications", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs and Medications", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Drugs_and_Alcohol", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Drugs and Alcohol", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Pharmacology", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Pharmacology", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/25c582b95f70cdf2eeea25003f68381f", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794857", "eventUri": "eng-9794857", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 219, "relevance": 1}

and anyone found liable for supplying the drugs that killed the star will face the full force of the law, an attorney says.\n\nPerry was found unresponsive in the hot tub of his LA home on October 28, 2023, having suffered acute effects of ketamine and drowning, his autopsy revealed.\n\nPerry, for years, was frankly honest about his struggles with addiction and had been open about receiving ketamine infusion therapy to treat depression in the months before his death.\n\nHowever, the star's last therapy session was a week and a half before he died, and ketamine metabolizes in the human body within hours of consumption - meaning the treatment was not the cause of his sudden passing.\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department launched a criminal investigation in December to determine how Perry obtained the drugs that would ultimately claim his life.\n\nOver the last nine months, the LAPD has been working alongside the Drug Enforcement Administration and the US Postal Inspection Service to re-trace the line of supply.\n\nSome of the detectives working on the case also investigated the overdose death of rapper Mac Miller, who died after consuming a fentanyl-laced opioid in 2018.\n\nTre Lovell, a veteran entertainment attorney, told The U.S. Sun he believes arrests in the case are imminent and will likely involve multiple people.\n\nLovell further warned that the charges against anyone accused of wrongdoing will be swift and unforgiving, even though Perry's death was ruled accidental.\n\n\"Charges will be coming any day now,\" said Lovell. \"This investigation has been going on for a long time, and the leaks are starting to come out, which are probably intentional.\n\n\"[Anonymous law enforcement sources] are not going to leak stuff unless they intend on indicting, otherwise they'll get egg on their face.\"\n\nIn June, a law enforcement source close to the investigation told PEOPLE the Perry investigation was \"nearing its conclusion\" and \"multiple people\" could be charged.\n\nThe US Attorney's Office has the final say on whether or not charges should be filed, the source said.\n\nLovell says those at risk of being charged could include doctors who may have written Perry an under-the-table prescription, drug dealers who could've sold him the ketamine illegally, and friends or associates who facilitated any illicit transaction.\n\nHe shared, \"There are several ways to impose criminal liability, either through the distribution of a controlled substance, an unlawful act that rose to criminal negligence or recklessness, and even in some cases involuntary manslaughter and mail fraud.\n\n\"There cases are tough [...] when somebody overdoses, that's an act of their own volition, so to impose criminal culpability there's a very high standard.\n\n\"They have to get warrants, they have to get subpoenas, they have to get private information from his physician, and this takes a lot of time.\"\n\nDepending on what charges prosecutors pursue - if any - accused parties could face a minimum of 20 or more years in prison.\n\nPerry's star power will motivate authorities to prosecute the case to the full extent of the law, Lovell says.\n\n\"The reason for this is because there's a big policy now to attack this kind of drug distribution, with fentanyl at the top of the chain, and these other controlled substances that are floating around, like ketamine.\n\n\"The government - both at federal and state level - has a mandate to go after drug dealing like this where there are overdoses, so they're going after the suppliers - and part of the reason for that strategy is deterrence.\n\n\"They want to deter future acts, and the best way to prevent someone from distributing drugs is deterring them from getting involved in the first place.\n\n\"Where there's a high profile victim, and the press is monitoring it, it's the government's opportunity to show there are severe consequences for supplying people drugs.\n\n\"Not only can you be liable for distributing a drug, you can also be liable for homicide.\n\n\"And they'll want to make that clear in this investigation.\"\n\nThe only person so far publicly linked to the Perry investigation is the late actor's friend, Brooke Mueller, whom he met in rehab.\n\nOver the last few months, Mueller has been the subject of multiple search warrants.\n\nThe actress' LA sober living residence was raided by police in May and her iPhone and a laptop were reportedly seized.\n\nMueller, an ex-wife of Charlie Sheen, is said to be fully cooperating with the investigation.\n\nA source with knowledge of the matter told InTouch, \"She's hired lawyers and has had multiple meetings with law enforcement since they arrived at her sober living house with a search warrant.\n\n\"She's being tight-lipped about the situation. But the investigators must have known something to get a warrant and turn up like that.\n\n\"It's tough to say or know exactly what her role is [in Perry's death], but she's adamant she had nothing to do with that.\"\n\nLovell agreed that for police to have obtained a warrant to search Mueller's home, there must've been strong evidence of a crime potentially having occurred.\n\n\"To seize a phone and search a house, you have to get a warrant, and to get a warrant you have to have probable cause,\" said Lovell.\n\n\"To have probable cause, you have to convince a judge there's likely a crime going on, and if they've been able to get all of that, there's a strong chance that person is a person of interest.\n\n\"We don't know for sure, but if they've gone to those lengths and they have enough evidence to get probable cause for a warrant, then that person is likely suspected of something serious.\"\n\nOne of Perry's ex-girlfriends, Kayti Edwards, told The U.S. Sun in June that Mueller and Perry were at one time romantically involved.\n\nMueller has not publicly been accused of any wrongdoing.\n\nA request for comment has not yet been returned.\n\nIn a July statement, an attorney for Charlie Sheen played down Mueller's connection to the case.\n\n\"I believe Ms. Mueller's past choices may have put her in a position to provide some incidental, anecdotal background to the authorities investigating Mr. Perry's death. Nothing more,\" said Gregory J. Pedrick.\n\nInTouch reported in July that a second celebrity friend of Perry's was being eyed by the LAPD for potential involvement in his death.\n\nThe second celebrity has not been named, but a source said while Perry and the unnamed star claimed to be sober they were in fact \"walking pharmacies\" who indulged in late-night chats about addiction and their battles to stay sober.\n\nThe source claimed there was photo evidence of Perry and the anonymous star pictured together at the office of a doctor who is known to prescribe ketamine.\n\nThe tipster suggested that Perry and the second celebrity may have \"aided\" one another by referring the other to their respective doctors whenever their supplies of drugs ran low.\n\n\"If the feds had either one of their phones -- especially [the second celeb's], because she doesn't erase her text messages -- they would probably find conversations about the drug and 'How can I get extra?' Like, 'Oh, come see my doctor if you need more,'\" said the source.\n\n\"It will not look good for the celebrity,\" they added.\n\nLovell believes law enforcement will plan to charge as many people as possible to begin with, and offer deals to lesser offenders to \"flip\" and testify against the main player or players.\n\nHe shared, \"We seem to be getting to the end of this investigation, and what they're going to do is just try to charge as many people as they can.\n\n\"Then, if there's three or four people involved, you can charge everyone and hand out a couple of deals so they flip for the bigger one.\n\n\"They don't want to charge anyone too prematurely, but they want to get as many people in the net as they can because that's how they build their case.\n\n\"It's going to be very interesting to find out who is involved in all this.\"\n\nPerry was pictured playing pickleball in the hours preceding his death.\n\nAt the time of his passing, Perry's personal wealth was valued at just over $1.5 million, The U.S. Sun exclusively revealed in July.\n\nThat sum was directed to go into a trust already said to be worth more than $120 million, and his will named numerous beneficiaries, court documents show.\n\nPerry established his \"Alvy Singer Living Trust\" in 2009, which is named after Woody Allen's character in the movie Annie Hall.\n\nHe chose his father John Perry, mother Suzanne Morrison, and half-sister Caitlin Morrison as his beneficiaries, along with an old ex-girlfriend, Rachel Dunn.\n\nCourt filings obtained by The U.S. Sun and filed in June show his personal property amounted to more than expected.\n\nLisa Ferguson, the trustee of Perry's estate, filed an inventory and appraisal document showing a balance of $1,596,914.47.\n\nThe Pacific Palisades home where he died is still in Ferguson's name and is not yet on the market.\n\nRenovation work was being carried out at the home around the time of his death, sources told The U.S. Sun.\n\nAnother property Perry purchased before his death under his Alvy Singer, LLC in the Hollywood Hills went on the market for $5,195,000 in May.\n\nPerry had also been renting a three-bed home overlooking Beverly Hills for $49,000 a month while his Pacific Palisades property was being renovated.\n\nPerry has always been open about his struggles with drug and alcohol abuse.\n\nHe wrote candidly of his health problems and struggles to stay sober in his 2022 memoir Friends, Lovers and the Big Terrible Thing.", "source": {"uri": "the-sun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The US

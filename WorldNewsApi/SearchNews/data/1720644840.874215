The 25-year-old, who spent 14 years at Rangers and made two first team appearances, has been in Northern Ireland with Glentoran for the last two seasons but he has sealed a return to Scotland, becoming Rhys McCabe's third summer signing. He joins recent arrivals defender Dylan MacDonald from East Kilbride and striker Aaron Reid from Aberdeen Aidan, who has also had spells with Edinburgh City, Forfar and Crusaders, said: \u201cI\u2019m delighted - it\u2019s good to get things sorted and I\u2019m looking forward to getting in and getting started. I\u2019ve played all over the place, but I see myself as a centre-half. Having a chat with the gaffer, the way he plays should suit me down to a tee. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to create an environment where you\u2019re going to get better and learn, so I\u2019m really looking forward to it and hopefully I can do well.\u201d Manager Rhys McCabe said: \"Aidan\u2019s been a target that we\u2019ve been pursuing for a number of weeks, and again he fits the model here. \u201cHe\u2019s got good experience in two or three positions at the back, having played over 100 games in the last couple of seasons and being a big part of his previous clubs. I think he can add real quality and he\u2019ll prove to be a very good addition to the squad.\" Follow Lanarkshire Live Sport onX via@LanLiveSport, like us onFacebookor find us onInstagramfor the latest sports news, pictures and video.", "summary": "The Diamonds have bolstered their squad further with the arrival of the 25-year-old", "url": "https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/former-rangers-defender-adds-real-32989112", "image": "https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article32989148.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_PHOTO-2024-06-08-15-41-10.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 14:43:45", "author": "Paul Thomson", "authors": ["Paul Thomson"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.247}

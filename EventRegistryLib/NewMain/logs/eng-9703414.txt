day?", "body": "Millions of people across the UK will cast their votes in the General Election on Thursday, choosing MPs in 650 constituencies and contributing to a national result which will decide who is the prime minister.\n\nFrom photo ID to bringing furry friends, here is everything you need to know about what you should, and should not, do on the day itself.\n\n- When do polling stations open and where should I go?\n\nPolling stations will be open from 7am to 10pm on July 4.\n\nThese are often found in schools, churches, community centres and libraries.\n\nIn 2022, voters in Oxford even cast their ballots inside a launderette.\n\nAll registered electors who are eligible to vote in the General Election should have received a polling card which includes the address of the polling station at which they may vote.\n\nYou cannot vote elsewhere.\n\nThe Electoral Commission, which oversees UK elections, also has an online tool which tells you where your polling station is.\n\nYou can also check on your local council's website or contact them for more information.\n\n- What do I do at the polling station?\n\nYou may have to queue outside before you get into the polling station as they can get very busy, especially towards the end of the day.\n\nOnce you are inside the polling station, the staff will check you are on the electoral register, ask for your photo ID and hand you a ballot paper.\n\nYou should take this to a voting booth, read the instructions on it and mark the ballot paper with your vote.\n\nYou can then place it in the ballot box and leave the venue.\n\n- What forms of ID should I bring?\n\nThis election is the first time in the UK that everyone wanting to vote in person will have to show a correct form of photo ID before casting a ballot - this includes a passport, driving licence and blue badge.\n\nIt does not matter if your photo ID is out of date, as long as it still looks like you and has the name under which you registered to vote.\n\nOther forms of permitted ID include an Older Person's or Disabled Person's Bus Pass, and an identity card bearing the Proof of Age Standards Scheme hologram (a Pass card).\n\n- Do I need a polling card?\n\nA polling card, which tells you when you can vote and at which polling station, is not required to cast your vote.\n\nSimply tell the staff there your name and address when you arrive.\n\n- What will my ballot paper look like?\n\nAlthough the election news cycle is often dominated by party leaders, who have appeared in televised debates and regularly make headlines, those probably are not the names you will see in front of you.\n\nYour ballot paper will offer a list of candidates representing political parties, or standing as independents, in your constituency.\n\nThere will usually be about seven options, made up of candidates representing the major parties, smaller parties or running as independents.\n\nIn some seats where there is more public interest, this number may be much higher.\n\nSome 13 candidates are running in Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's constituency of Richmond and Northallerton, while Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is among 12 names voters in Holborn and St Pancras can choose from.\n\n- Can I vote for more than one person?\n\nYou are only allowed to vote for one candidate on the ballot paper, by putting a cross (X) in the box next to their name.\n\nLeaving any other mark on the ballot paper, including voting for more than one candidate or party, or writing anything which could identify you or leads to doubt about who you intended to vote for, will result in the ballot paper not being counted.\n\nDoing this on purpose is known as \"spoiling\" your ballot.\n\n- What happens if I have not been able to vote by 10pm?\n\nYou are entitled to vote as long as you are inside the polling station or in a queue outside at 10pm.\n\n- What do I do if I cannot make it to the polling station on the day or lose my ID?\n\nThere are various reasons a person who intended to vote in-person at a polling station on election day may be unable to at short notice, such as a medical emergency, work requirements or loss of photo ID.\n\nUnder these circumstances, a prospective voter can apply for an emergency proxy vote where another person casts your ballot on your behalf.\n\nThey must take their own ID with them.\n\nApplicants must send the relevant form to their local Electoral Registration Office by 5pm on polling day.\n\n- Can I take my dog with me?\n\nUsually, animals are not allowed inside polling stations, apart from assistance dogs.\n\nThough the station's presiding officer may theoretically give permission for pets to be taken inside, this is unlikely to be the case.\n\nIf you choose to bring a furry friend, they should be safely secured outside the venue - you can always chat politics with them on the way home.\n\n- Can I take a selfie inside the polling station?\n\nPhotographs are not allowed inside polling stations as the Electoral Commission says this risks compromising the secrecy of the ballot.\n\nRevealing how somebody else voted, even by accident, could land you with a \u00a35,000 fine or up to six months in prison.\n\n- What help is there for people with disabilities?\n\nAll polling stations should have accessibility measures in place to ensure disabled people can exercise their right to vote.\n\nThis includes providing tactile voting devices, magnifiers and large-print sample ballot papers for voters who are visually impaired.\n\nThey should also provide seating for people who cannot stand for long periods of time and have measures for wheelchair users - such as ramps and low-level polling booths.\n\n- Can I use my own pen or pencil?\n\nYes, voters are allowed to bring their own pen/pencil to fill in their ballot paper.\n\nThough there is no legal requirement to use them, pencils are provided inside polling stations because they are less likely to leak or run than pens which use ink.\n\n- What else can I not do inside a polling station?\n\nOnce inside a polling station, any form of political discussion, campaigning or canvassing is strictly prohibited.\n\nThis means you cannot debate your vote with friends, families or strangers.\n\nYou must also not be accompanied into the polling booth by another adult unless you have a disability, though your children may join you, provided they do not mark the ballot paper.\n\n- When will I know the outcome of the General Election?\n\nThe first indication of how the election has gone on a national level is likely to be the exit polls, which are published shortly after 10pm.\n\nThese take place at about 144 polling stations across the country, with tens of thousands of people asked to privately fill in a replica ballot as they leave, to get an indication of how they voted.\n\nOfficial constituency outcomes are likely to be announced from 11.30pm as early results trickle in.\n\nThis will speed up as the night progresses, with hundreds of results expected in the early hours of Friday morning, between 3am and 4am.\n\nBy 4am, enough results should be in to know which party is on course to win the election and by what margin.", "source": {"uri": "belfasttelegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Belfast Telegraph"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

on election day?\n\nPiers Mucklejohn, PA\n\n3 July 2024 at 2:04 pm\n\nMillions of people across the UK will cast their votes in the General Election on Thursday, choosing MPs in 650 constituencies and contributing to a national result which will decide who is the prime minister.\n\nFrom photo ID to bringing furry friends, here is everything you need to know about what you should, and should not, do on the day itself.\n\n- When do polling stations open and where should I go?\n\nPolling stations will be open from 7am to 10pm on July 4.\n\nThese are often found in schools, churches, community centres and libraries.\n\nIn 2022, voters in Oxford even cast their ballots inside a launderette.\n\nAll registered electors who are eligible to vote in the General Election should have received a polling card which includes the address of the polling station at which they may vote.\n\nYou cannot vote elsewhere.\n\nThe Electoral Commission, which oversees UK elections, also has an online tool which tells you where your polling station is.\n\nYou can also check on your local council's website or contact them for more information.\n\n- What do I do at the polling station?\n\nYou may have to queue outside before you get into the polling station as they can get very busy, especially towards the end of the day.\n\nOnce you are inside the polling station, the staff will check you are on the electoral register, ask for your photo ID and hand you a ballot paper.\n\nYou should take this to a voting booth, read the instructions on it and mark the ballot paper with your vote.\n\nYou can then place it in the ballot box and leave the venue.\n\n- What forms of ID should I bring?\n\nThis election is the first time in the UK that everyone wanting to vote in person will have to show a correct form of photo ID before casting a ballot - this includes a passport, driving licence and blue badge.\n\nIt does not matter if your photo ID is out of date, as long as it still looks like you and has the name under which you registered to vote.\n\nOther forms of permitted ID include an Older Person's or Disabled Person's Bus Pass, and an identity card bearing the Proof of Age Standards Scheme hologram (a Pass card).\n\n- Do I need a polling card?\n\nA polling card, which tells you when you can vote and at which polling station, is not required to cast your vote.\n\nSimply tell the staff there your name and address when you arrive.\n\n- What will my ballot paper look like?\n\nAlthough the election news cycle is often dominated by party leaders, who have appeared in televised debates and regularly make headlines, those probably are not the names you will see in front of you.\n\nYour ballot paper will offer a list of candidates representing political parties, or standing as independents, in your constituency.\n\nThere will usually be about seven options, made up of candidates representing the major parties, smaller parties or running as independents.\n\nIn some seats where there is more public interest, this number may be much higher.\n\nSome 13 candidates are running in Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's constituency of Richmond and Northallerton, while Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is among 12 names voters in Holborn and St Pancras can choose from.\n\n- Can I vote for more than one person?\n\nYou are only allowed to vote for one candidate on the ballot paper, by putting a cross (X) in the box next to their name.\n\nLeaving any other mark on the ballot paper, including voting for more than one candidate or party, or writing anything which could identify you or leads to doubt about who you intended to vote for, will result in the ballot paper not being counted.\n\nDoing this on purpose is known as \"spoiling\" your ballot.\n\n- What happens if I have not been able to vote by 10pm?\n\nYou are entitled to vote as long as you are inside the polling station or in a queue outside at 10pm.\n\n- What do I do if I cannot make it to the polling station on the day or lose my ID?\n\nThere are various reasons a person who intended to vote in-person at a polling station on election day may be unable to at short notice, such as a medical emergency, work requirements or loss of photo ID.\n\nUnder these circumstances, a prospective voter can apply for an emergency proxy vote where another person casts your ballot on your behalf.\n\nThey must take their own ID with them.\n\nApplicants must send the relevant form to their local Electoral Registration Office by 5pm on polling day.\n\n- Can I take my dog with me?\n\nUsually, animals are not allowed inside polling stations, apart from assistance dogs.\n\nThough the station's presiding officer may theoretically give permission for pets to be taken inside, this is unlikely to be the case.\n\nIf you choose to bring a furry friend, they should be safely secured outside the venue - you can always chat politics with them on the way home.\n\n- Can I take a selfie inside the polling station?\n\nPhotographs are not allowed inside polling stations as the Electoral Commission says this risks compromising the secrecy of the ballot.\n\nRevealing how somebody else voted, even by accident, could land you with a \u00a35,000 fine or up to six months in prison.\n\n- What help is there for people with disabilities?\n\nAll polling stations should have accessibility measures in place to ensure disabled people can exercise their right to vote.\n\nThis includes providing tactile voting devices, magnifiers and large-print sample ballot papers for voters who are visually impaired.\n\nThey should also provide seating for people who cannot stand for long periods of time and have measures for wheelchair users - such as ramps and low-level polling booths.\n\n- Can I use my own pen or pencil?\n\nYes, voters are allowed to bring their own pen/pencil to fill in their ballot paper.\n\nThough there is no legal requirement to use them, pencils are provided inside polling stations because they are less likely to leak or run than pens which use ink.\n\n- What else can I not do inside a polling station?\n\nOnce inside a polling station, any form of political discussion, campaigning or canvassing is strictly prohibited.\n\nThis means you cannot debate your vote with friends, families or strangers.\n\nYou must also not be accompanied into the polling booth by another adult unless you have a disability, though your children may join you, provided they do not mark the ballot paper.\n\n- When will I know the outcome of the General Election?\n\nThe first indication of how the election has gone on a national level is likely to be the exit polls, which are published shortly after 10pm.\n\nThese take place at about 144 polling stations across the country, with tens of thousands of people asked to privately fill in a replica ballot as they leave, to get an indication of how they voted.\n\nOfficial constituency outcomes are likely to be announced from 11.30pm as early results trickle in.\n\nThis will speed up as the night progresses, with hundreds of results expected in the early hours of Friday morning, between 3am and 4am.\n\nBy 4am, enough results should be in to know which party is on course to win the election and by what margin.", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

A simple 'X' in the box will help determine who will be Prime Minister, come July 5, and which party will form the UK's next Government.\n\nWhile many will have voted recently in local elections, others may be first time voters - and even if you have voted before, it's worth noting that new measures were put in place last year to stop electoral fraud.\n\nSome people may be unsure about what ID they can use, whether they can take their dogs, or what to do if they make a mistake on the ballot paper. To make the voting process as smooth as possible, here are the answers to some common questions.\n\nWhen can I go to a polling station?\n\nPolling stations opened at 7am on Thursday, July 4 and will close at 10pm the same day. If you are in the queue outside your polling station at 10pm you will still be allowed to vote, but if you arrive after 10pm you will not be able to cast a ballot.\n\nDo I have to go to a particular polling station?\n\nYes, you will have been sent a polling card which will tell you which polling station to go to. If you have not got that card for whatever reason, you can enter your address into wheredoivote.co.uk to find out\n\nCan I bring my own pen or pencil?\n\nYes. Pencils will be provided for you to fill in your ballot, but if you want to use your own pen or pencil that is totally fine.\n\nCan I take photographs of my ballot or pose for selfies in the polling station?\n\nYou are not allowed to take photographs inside the polling station. This is to ensure that you do not - deliberately or accidentally - reveal who anyone voted for.\n\nCan I take photographs outside the polling station?\n\nYes. The Electoral Commission says you are \"more than welcome\" to take photos outside the polling station, and even says that posting such photos on social media can encourage your friends and family to vote.\n\nShould I report someone who has photographed their postal ballot?\n\nNo, the rules are different for postal ballots. People are allowed to take photos of their postal ballot and share them online if they chose to do so. But it is illegal to persuade or induce someone else to share a photo of their postal ballot.\n\nCan I ask for a new ballot paper if I've made a mistake?\n\nYes as long as you've not put your voting paper in the ballot box you can ask a member of staff for a replacement.\n\nCan I bring my dog inside the polling station?\n\nNot always. Some polling stations might allow this, but they do not have to. Assistance dogs are permitted.\n\nA trip to the polling booth is the perfect excuse for a dog walk - and a social media snap. Posting #dogsatpollingstations photos has become an election day tradition.\n\nWhy are Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer not on my ballot?\n\nAlthough they lead their parties, only people in Sir Keir and Mr Sunak's respective constituencies can vote directly for the two party leaders.\n\nCan I vote for someone who is not on the ballot?\n\nNo. In some other countries - for instance the US - you can write the name of a different candidate on your ballot. If enough people do that they can win the election as what is known as a \"write-in\" candidate, although this is uncommon.\n\nHowever, this is not possible in the UK, the Electoral Commission told the PA news agency. You can only vote for a person printed on your ballot. If you write in the name of someone else your vote risks being counted as a spoilt ballot.\n\nI was not asked for photo ID last time I voted, why now?\n\nThe Government introduced a requirement for photo ID in April 2022.\n\nWhat identification can I use?\n\nThere is a long list of accepted types of ID, with UK and EU passports and driving licences probably the most common. The full list of accepted IDs can be found here.\n\nYou can vote with an out-of-date ID as long as your photo is still obviously you, and the name on your ID matches that on the electoral register.\n\nWhat if my name has changed?\n\nIf you have changed your name - for instance if you have married - you can bring a document which proves this, such as a marriage certificate, to show alongside your photo ID. Find out more here.\n\nI wear a veil or other face covering - how does voter ID work for me?\n\nIf you wear some kind of face covering you will be asked to briefly remove it so that election workers can identify you against your photo ID.\n\nYou can ask to do this in private, and can ask for a female member of staff to undertake the check. This demand will be met \"if possible\", the Electoral Commission says. There will be a mirror available to help you replace your face covering.\n\nSomeone outside the polling station asked me questions - is that OK?\n\nYes. These people are known as tellers, and they work for candidates. They can ask for your name and address, your elector number or your poll card.

But how do you go about it?\n\nYou may never have taken part before, either through choice or because you've only just turned 18. So we've got a handy guide below to help you.\n\nThankfully, voting is easy - and kind of fun. Polling stations are open early and close late so you should be able to fit voting in around work, school runs, chores and clubs.\n\nREAD MORE: All the Birmingham schools being turned into polling stations for general election\n\nThe general election takes place on December July 4. Rishi Sunak is hoping to hold onto the top job as Prime Minister while Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is hoping to take it from him.\n\nBoth are fighting their first General Election as leaders of their respective parties. The polls point to a Labour win, but many seats are still very close so those polls could fall wide of the mark. Your vote could make all the difference.\n\nSo here's our guide about how to make your voice heard.\n\nWhat time are the polling stations open?\n\nPolling stations open from 7am until 10pm. As we're enjoying a summer election, rather than the December poll of 2019, we'll have daylight for most hours polling stations are open.\n\nThey can also stay open longer if the need arises as those who remember the chaos at the 2010 election will tell you. Hundreds of people at various places around the country were left queuing at 10pm as some polling stations were unable to cope with a sudden surge in demand as the polls closed.\n\nThe Electoral Commission has since made a change ensuring if you are in a queue at 10pm you will now be guaranteed the opportunity to vote.\n\nCan I vote online?\n\nNo. We're yet to progress past physical polling stations, pencils and paper. Which begs the question...\n\nWhere do I vote?\n\nYou must vote at the polling station assigned to you. You can find that on a polling card which should have been posted to you. If you have chosen to take part via a postal vote and have left it too late to send on time, you can hand deliver a postal vote to any polling station in the constituency.\n\nAm I registered to vote?\n\nTo check if you are registered can contact the electoral registration office at your local council. If you haven't registered to vote then we're very sorry to say it's too late now.\n\nHowever, if you are registered but can't make it to the polling station for a reason you couldn't have predicted - perhaps because you are ill - you can still make your voice heard. The deadline for applying for an emergency proxy vote is 5pm on polling day.\n\nHow do I cast my vote?\n\nBefore the big day you will receive a card, as mentioned about, letting you know where your local polling station is. Firstly go there. any time after polls open and before they close. If you need help getting to the polling station, contact your electoral registration office as they might be able to help. You can also ask to have a companion accompany you when you vote. Staff in the polling station may also be able to help you.\n\nAlternatively, use the tool below to find your polling station. Just enter your postcode.\n\nWhat do the staff there do?\n\nWhen you arrive, tell them your name and address and they will check that you are on the electoral register. You will be given a ballot paper listing the parties and candidates standing for election. If you have a visual impairment, you can ask for a special voting device that allows you to cast your ballot in secret.\n\nWhat do I do with the ballot paper?\n\nTake it into a polling booth so no one can see how you vote. Read the paper carefully. It will tell you how to cast your vote - usually with an 'X'. If you do not follow this instruction your vote could be deemed spoiled and won't be counted.\n\nWhen you have marked your vote, fold the ballot paper in half and put it in the ballot box. Simple.\n\nDo I need my polling card to vote?\n\nIf you are on the electoral register, you will receive a poll card before the election telling you where and when to vote. The poll card is for your information only - you do not need to take it to the polling station in order to vote. But...\n\nDo I need identification to vote?\n\nYes. Since the last General Election the law has changed meaning you must take a valid photo ID in order to cast your ballot. You will not be allowed to vote without it. While this policy has been in place for the last two rounds of local elections, including those in May, this is the first General Election where voters are required to bring photo ID.\n\nVoters can use passports, driving licences, Proof of Age Standards Scheme (PASS) cards, Blue badges, and some concessionary travel cards. The Government has so far rejected calls for additional types of ID to be added to the list, saying the implementation of voter ID was \"conducted efficiently with very few voters initially turned away\".\n\nWhat if I can't get to a polling station?\n\nYou can apply to vote by emergency proxy up until 5pm on polling day for medical reasons or if your occupation, service or employment means that you cannot go to the polling station in person. This applies if you only became aware of that fact after 5pm, six working days before polling day.", "source": {"uri": "birminghammail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Birmingham Mail"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_lloyd@birminghammail.co.uk", "name": "Matt LLoyd", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polling_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Polling station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postal_voting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Postal voting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_United_Kingdom_general_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2010 United Kingdom general election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_Commission_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_roll", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electoral roll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_voting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electronic voting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ballot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_invitation_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Voter invitation card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_United_Kingdom_local_elections", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2021 United Kingdom local elections"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_Age_Standards_Scheme", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Proof of Age Standards Scheme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_voting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Proxy voting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_identification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Photo identification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot_box", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ballot box"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Passport"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article29453071.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_TRMRMMGLPICT000020441199.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9703414", "eventUri": "eng-9703414", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 646, "textEnd": 652}], "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 219, "relevance": 1}

We've put together a guide on everything you need to know about your trip to the polling station.\n\nPolling stations open at 7am and are open until 10pm today. If you are in the queue outside your polling station at 10pm you will still be allowed to vote, but if you arrive after 10pm you will not be able to cast a ballot.\n\n- Do I have to go to a particular polling station?\n\nYes, you will have been sent a polling card which will tell you which polling station to go to. If you have not got that card for whatever reason, you can enter your address into wheredoivote.co.uk. to find out. You do not need to take your polling card to the polling station.- Can I bring my own pen or pencil?\n\nYes. Pencils will be provided for you to fill in your ballot, but if you want to use your own pen or pencil that is totally fine.\n\n- Can I take photographs of my ballot or pose for selfies in the polling station?\n\nYou are not allowed to take photographs inside the polling station. This is to ensure that you do not - deliberately or accidentally - reveal who anyone voted for.\n\n- Can I take photographs outside the polling station?\n\nYes. The Electoral Commission says you are \"more than welcome\" to take photos outside the polling station, and even says that posting such photos on social media can encourage your friends and family to vote.\n\n- Should I report someone who has photographed their postal ballot?\n\nNo, the rules are different for postal ballots. People are allowed to take photos of their postal ballot and share them online if they chose to do so. But it is illegal to persuade or induce someone else to share a photo of their postal ballot.\n\n- Can I ask for a new ballot paper if I've made a mistake?\n\nYes as long as you've not put your voting paper in the ballot box you can ask a member of staff for a replacement.\n\n- Can I bring my dog inside the polling station?\n\nNot always. Some polling stations might allow this, but they do not have to. Assistance dogs are permitted.\n\n- Why are Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer not on my ballot?\n\nAlthough they lead their parties, only people in Sir Keir and Mr Sunak's respective constituencies can vote directly for the two party leaders.\n\n- Can I vote for someone who is not on the ballot?\n\nNo. In some other countries - for instance the US - you can write the name of a different candidate on your ballot. If enough people do that they can win the election as what is known as a \"write-in\" candidate, although this is uncommon.\n\nHowever, this is not possible in the UK, the Electoral Commission has said. You can only vote for a person printed on your ballot. If you write in the name of someone else your vote risks being counted as a spoilt ballot.\n\n- I was not asked for photo ID last time I voted, why now?\n\nThe Government introduced a requirement for photo ID in April 2022.\n\n- What identification can I use?\n\nThere is a long list of accepted types of ID, with UK and EU passports and driving licences probably the most common.\n\nThe full ist of accepted IDs can be found at this link.\n\nYou can vote with an out-of-date ID as long as your photo is still obviously you, and the name on your ID matches that on the electoral register.\n\n- What if my name has changed?\n\nIf you have changed your name - for instance if you have married - you can bring a document which proves this, such as a marriage certificate, to show alongside your photo ID.\n\n- I wear a veil or other face covering - how does voter ID work for me?\n\nIf you wear some kind of face covering you will be asked to briefly remove it so that election workers can identify you against your photo ID.\n\nYou can ask to do this in private, and can ask for a female member of staff to undertake the check. This demand will be met \"if possible\", the Electoral Commission says. There will be a mirror available to help you replace your face covering.\n\nSomeone outside the polling station asked me questions - is that OK?\n\nYes. These people are known as tellers, and they work for candidates. They can ask for your name and address, your elector number or your poll card. You don't have to tell them anything if you do not want to.\n\nTellers are there to help candidates understand who has turned out to vote. This can help them understand what doors to knock on to encourage potential voters to go to the polling stations.\n\nThe tellers are not allowed to try to convince you who to vote for.", "source": {"uri": "yorkshirepost.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yorkshire Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kit_sandeman@yorkshirepost.co.uk", "name": "Kit Sandeman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polling_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Polling station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absentee_ballot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Absentee ballot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_Commission_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Selfie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_identification", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Photo identification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot_box", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ballot box"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ballot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teller_(elections)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Teller (elections)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_identification_laws", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Voter identification laws"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_masks_during_the_COVID-19_pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Electoral College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write-in_candidate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Write-in candidate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_roll", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electoral roll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hijab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driver's_license", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Driver's license"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Passport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Radio", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Radio", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Tributes", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Tributes", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/webimg/b25lY21zOjBlYjdlMDIwLThiYjItNDgzMi1hY2M5LWI3ZjQ1NWE5YTRmMjpmMDY5N2E1ZS04ZmI4LTQyMDQtYjExMi01MGRkZGRmZWE3ZmU=.jpg?width=640&auto=webp&quality=75&crop=3:2,smart&trim=", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9703414", "eventUri": "eng-9703414", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 219, "relevance": 1}

to vote in person will have to show a correct form of photo ID before casting a ballot - this includes a passport, driving licence and blue badge.\n\nIt does not matter if your photo ID is out of date, as long as it still looks like you and has the name under which you registered to vote.\n\nOther forms of permitted ID include an Older Person's or Disabled Person's Bus Pass, and an identity card bearing the Proof of Age Standards Scheme hologram (a Pass card).\n\nA polling card, which tells you when you can vote and at which polling station, is not required to cast your vote.\n\nSimply tell the staff there your name and address when you arrive.\n\nAlthough the election news cycle is often dominated by party leaders, who have appeared in televised debates and regularly make headlines, those probably are not the names you will see in front of you.\n\nYour ballot paper will offer a list of candidates representing political parties, or standing as independents, in your constituency.\n\nThere will usually be about seven options, made up of candidates representing the major parties, smaller parties or running as independents.\n\nIn some seats where there is more public interest, this number may be much higher.\n\nSome 13 candidates are running in Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's constituency of Richmond and Northallerton, while Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is among 12 names voters in Holborn and St Pancras can choose from.\n\nYou are only allowed to vote for one candidate on the ballot paper, by putting a cross (X) in the box next to their name.\n\nLeaving any other mark on the ballot paper, including voting for more than one candidate or party, or writing anything which could identify you or leads to doubt about who you intended to vote for, will result in the ballot paper not being counted.\n\nDoing this on purpose is known as \"spoiling\" your ballot.\n\nYou are entitled to vote as long as you are inside the polling station or in a queue outside at 10pm.\n\nWhat do I do if I cannot make it to the polling station on the day or lose my ID?\n\nThere are various reasons a person who intended to vote in-person at a polling station on election day may be unable to at short notice, such as a medical emergency, work requirements or loss of photo ID.\n\nUnder these circumstances, a prospective voter can apply for an emergency proxy vote where another person casts your ballot on your behalf.\n\nThey must take their own ID with them.\n\nApplicants must send the relevant form to their local Electoral Registration Office by 5pm on polling day.\n\nUsually, animals are not allowed inside polling stations, apart from assistance dogs.\n\nThough the station's presiding officer may theoretically give permission for pets to be taken inside, this is unlikely to be the case.\n\nIf you choose to bring a furry friend, they should be safely secured outside the venue - you can always chat politics with them on the way home.\n\nPhotographs are not allowed inside polling stations as the Electoral Commission says this risks compromising the secrecy of the ballot.\n\nRevealing how somebody else voted, even by accident, could land you with a \u00a35,000 fine or up to six months in prison.\n\nAll polling stations should have accessibility measures in place to ensure disabled people can exercise their right to vote.\n\nThis includes providing tactile voting devices, magnifiers and large-print sample ballot papers for voters who are visually impaired.\n\nThey should also provide seating for people who cannot stand for long periods of time and have measures for wheelchair users - such as ramps and low-level polling booths.\n\nYes, voters are allowed to bring their own pen/pencil to fill in their ballot paper.\n\nThough there is no legal requirement to use them, pencils are provided inside polling stations because they are less likely to leak or run than pens which use ink.\n\nOnce inside a polling station, any form of political discussion, campaigning or canvassing is strictly prohibited.\n\nThis means you cannot debate your vote with friends, families or strangers.\n\nYou must also not be accompanied into the polling booth by another adult unless you have a disability, though your children may join you, provided they do not mark the ballot paper.\n\nThe first indication of how the election has gone on a national level is likely to be the exit polls, which are published shortly after 10pm.\n\nThese take place at about 144 polling stations across the country, with tens of thousands of people asked to privately fill in a replica ballot as they leave, to get an indication of how they voted.\n\nOfficial constituency outcomes are likely to be announced from 11.30pm as early results trickle in.\n\nThis will speed up as the night progresses, with hundreds of results expected in the early hours of Friday morning, between 3am and 4am.\n\nBy 4am, enough results should be in to know which party is on course to win the election and by what margin.", "source": {"uri": "penarthtimes.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Penarth Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

You can vote as long as you are in the queue by 22:00.\n\nTo cast your vote you will need to visit your local polling station. The vast majority of people have been allocated to the same polling station that they were in for the 2023 Local Elections. Some people will have to change from the 2023 Local Election polling station to accommodate UK Parliament constituency boundaries and some have had to change to accommodate the 2023 Boundary Commission review.\n\nAll registered electors who are eligible to vote in the General Election should have received a polling card which includes the address of the polling station at which they may vote.\n\nYou cannot vote elsewhere.\n\nThe address for your local polling station is on your polling card.\n\nAlternatively the Electoral Commission have a handy tool online which provides you your local polling station, the candidates standing in the constituency and who to contact if you need any help.\n\nAlthough the election news cycle is often dominated by party leaders, who have appeared in televised debates and regularly make headlines, those probably are not the names you will see in front of you.\n\nYour ballot paper will offer a list of candidates representing political parties, or standing as independents, in your constituency.\n\nIf you have previously voted in local Northern Irish elections you may be more used to numbering your preferred candidates. That is not the case in a Westminster election.\n\nPut simply, in this election each person has one vote under a system called \"first past the post\", the candidate with the most votes becomes the MP for that area.\n\nOn the ballot paper, mark a cross (X) against the candidate you wish to vote for. Do not write anything else on the ballot paper or your vote may not be counted.\n\nEveryone voting in person at the general election on 4 July will have to show valid photo ID.\n\nAccording to the Electoral Office in Northern Ireland, the following are acceptable forms of identification:\n\nThe identification document does not need to be current, as long as the photograph is of a good enough likeness to allow polling station staff to confirm the identity of the holder.\n\nA polling card, which tells you when you can vote and at which polling station, is not required to cast your vote.\n\nSimply tell the staff there your name and address when you arrive.\n\nYou may have to queue outside before you get into the polling station as they can get very busy, especially towards the end of the day.\n\nOnce you are inside the polling station, the staff will check you are on the electoral register, ask for your photo ID and hand you a ballot paper.\n\nYou should take this to a voting booth, read the instructions on it and mark the ballot paper with your vote.\n\nYou can then place it in the ballot box and leave the venue.\n\nThere is absolutely nothing stopping you from taking a selfie outside the polling station either before or after you have voted.\n\nHowever, according to the Electoral Office, you must not take pictures inside the polling station. If you inadvertently disclose how someone has voted you would be breaking the law.\n\nRevealing how somebody else voted, even by accident, could land you with a \u00a35,000 fine or up to six months in prison.\n\nUsually, animals are not allowed inside polling stations, apart from assistance dogs.\n\nThough the station's presiding officer may theoretically give permission for pets to be taken inside, this is unlikely to be the case.\n\nIf you choose to bring a furry friend, they should be safely secured outside the venue.\n\nAll polling stations should have accessibility measures in place to ensure disabled people can exercise their right to vote.\n\nThe following facilities are available at polling stations to assist voters with disabilities:\n\nIf you want to use any of these items, please tell the staff at the polling station when they give you your ballot paper.\n\nIf you cannot mark the ballot paper yourself due to a disability, you can have it marked for you by a companion or by the person in charge of the polling station (the Presiding Officer).\n\nYou will need to tell the polling station staff that this is how you want to vote and why. If your companion is voting for you they will be asked to fill in a form. Your ballot paper will be marked and placed in the ballot box on your behalf.\n\nVoters are allowed to bring their own pen/pencil to fill in their ballot paper.\n\nThough there is no legal requirement to use them, pencils are provided inside polling stations because they are less likely to leak or run than pens which use ink.\n\nAs we know too well here, the weather is often notoriously changeable and so your experience when you head to the polls may differ.\n\nThat said at the moment the Met Office is forecasting Thursday across Northern Ireland to be a bright and breezy day with a mix of sunny spells and showers.\n\nAccording to forecasters the showers may be occasionally heavy through the morning but are expected to ease in the afternoon.\n\nif you avoid a shower it should still be pretty pleasant to get out and vote, with a maximum temperature expected of 17 C.\n\nThe first indication of how the election has gone on a national level is likely to be the exit polls, which are published shortly after 10pm.\n\nAfter that, official constituency outcomes across the UK are likely to be announced from 11.30pm as early results trickle in.\n\nAs for your individual constituency, results across Northern Ireland are expected throughout the early hours of Friday morning.\n\nCurrently, the estimated declaration times for Northern Ireland constituencies are as follows:\n\n2am - North Down, Strangford, Tyrone West\n\n3am - Antrim East, Belfast East, Belfast North, Belfast West, Londonderry East, Mid Ulster\n\n3.30am - Antrim South, Belfast South & Mid Down, South Down\n\nThe Belfast Telegraph will have live round-the-clock coverage from each of the count centres throughout Friday morning as the election twists and turns take place.\n\nThe best way to follow along will be with our online digital coverage on our website. We will have plenty of video content as well to keep you up to date with what is happening directly from the count centres.", "source": {"uri": "belfasttelegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

This one bears repeating because it is the first general election where you must bring photo ID to the polling station.\n\nThere are 22 different types of ID you can use - you can find a list in our full guide to the voter ID rules.\n\nThe ID can be out of date, as long as it still looks like you and the name is the same one used to register to vote.\n\nThose who don't have any of the accepted forms of ID are able to register for a Voter Authority Certificate - though the deadline for this has passed.\n\nGiven the popularity of dogs at polling stations, you'd be forgiven for thinking they were honoured guests on election day.\n\nBut actually, assistance dogs are the only pets that are guaranteed entry to polling stations.\n\nThe rest of the time, it's up to polling station staff whether they allow dogs inside - and according to advice from the Electoral Commission they are not normally allowed in as they can disturb voters.\n\nPet charity the Blue Cross has published guidelines on taking your pup to vote, and says you should check with the venue in advance.\n\nChildren are welcome at polling stations, and can go to the polling booth with their parents or carer.\n\nHowever, they must not mark the polling card.\n\nYou should not take any photos - including selfies - inside the polling station.\n\nThat is because it is against the law to share how someone has voted, is about to vote, or the unique ID ballot paper number - all of which could end up in shot with photos taken inside the polling station.\n\nBreaking that law could mean you're landed with a fine of up to \u00a35,000, or six months in prison.\n\nYou and your dogs are welcome to take photos outside the polling station.\n\nYou can use your phone inside the polling station - including in the voting booth, for example, if you need to use the torch or an app to help you read the ballot paper.\n\nIt's up to the returning officer - the person in charge of the polling station - to set that venue's rules around mobile phone use and train staff accordingly.\n\nYou will need to remove headphones when giving your name, address, and ID to staff, and if you're having a loud phone conversation you can expect to be told to be quiet.\n\nVoting while drunk is not against the law.\n\nHowever, if you're suspected of being incapacitated by alcohol or drugs, you may be asked questions by the staff in charge.\n\nIf they are unhappy with your answers, you could be turned away until you've sobered up.\n\nPolitical discussion is not allowed inside and immediately around the polling station in case it influences other voters.\n\nIf you're heard talking about the candidates, parties or who you're voting for by polling station staff, you will be asked to stop.\n\nYes - if you don't want it to be counted.\n\nSpoilt ballot papers are a way for voters to express dissatisfaction with the choice of candidates or political parties.\n\nSpoilt votes are declared invalid, and the number of blank and spoilt votes is announced along with other election results.\n\nSpoiling your vote could mean voting for every candidate or none at all or writing or drawing on the ballot paper.\n\nHowever, be careful about marking anything besides a cross on your ballot paper if you want your vote counted.\n\nYou should not sign your ballot paper. If your name is identifiable, your vote will not count as it needs to be anonymous.\n\nYou do not have to vote by law - it is your choice to do so or not.\n\nThere is nothing to stop you from wearing clothing with a political slogan while voting, but campaigning is not allowed in polling stations, so you must leave immediately after voting.\n\nYou can wear a face covering, including a veil for religious reasons or a face mask, but you may be asked to briefly remove it so staff can check the photo ID you're using is really you.\n\nYou can ask to have your ID checked in private or for it to be done by a female staff member.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe ultimate guide to the general election\n\nHow to vote if you're away on election day\n\nPencils will be provided for people to cast their vote - but if you've got a lucky pen, you're welcome to bring your own.\n\nPencils are used for practical reasons, according to the Electoral Commission - with ink pens, there's the risk they may run out or the ink smudges on the ballot paper, potentially leading to it being rejected if it appears spoilt.\n\nYou can only go inside a polling station if you are registered to vote at that station.\n\nStaff at the door will ask for your name, address, and ID before you are given your ballot papers and proceed to a voting booth.\n\nYou can take another adult into the polling booth if you are disabled and need help voting.\n\nThis is where there is an exception to the rule only allowing voters registered at that polling station to enter.\n\nAnyone over the age of 18 can help you vote. You can also ask polling station staff for help.\n\nMeasures to make voting accessible should also be in place, including providing a tactile voting device for blind or partially sighted voters, having a low-level polling booth, and displaying a large-print version of the ballot paper.", "source": {"uri": "news.sky.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sky News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polling_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Polling station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ballot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_identification_laws", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Voter identification laws"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_identification", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photo identification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweater", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sweater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charitable organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sky News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_registration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Voter registration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoilt_vote", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spoilt vote"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Returning_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Returning officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_Commission_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headphones", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Headphones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Selfie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_masks_during_the_COVID-19_pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slogan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slogan"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/24/05/1600x900/skynews-polling-station-rules_6569662.jpg?20240530150954", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9703414", "eventUri": "eng-9703414", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

Here the PA news agency outlines everything you need to know about your trip to the polling station.\n\n- When can I go to a polling station?\n\nPolling stations will open at 7am on July 4 and close at 10pm the same day. If you are in the queue outside your polling station at 10pm you will still be allowed to vote, but if you arrive after 10pm you will not be able to cast a ballot.\n\n- Do I have to go to a particular polling station?\n\nYes, you will have been sent a polling card which will tell you which polling station to go to. If you have not got that card for whatever reason, you can enter your address into wheredoivote.co.uk. to find out\n\n- Can I bring my own pen or pencil?\n\nYes. Pencils will be provided for you to fill in your ballot, but if you want to use your own pen or pencil that is totally fine.\n\n- Can I take photographs of my ballot or pose for selfies in the polling station?\n\nYou are not allowed to take photographs inside the polling station. This is to ensure that you do not - deliberately or accidentally - reveal who anyone voted for.\n\n- Can I take photographs outside the polling station?\n\nYes. The Electoral Commission says you are \"more than welcome\" to take photos outside the polling station, and even says that posting such photos on social media can encourage your friends and family to vote.\n\n- Should I report someone who has photographed their postal ballot?\n\nNo, the rules are different for postal ballots. People are allowed to take photos of their postal ballot and share them online if they chose to do so. But it is illegal to persuade or induce someone else to share a photo of their postal ballot.\n\n- Can I ask for a new ballot paper if I've made a mistake?\n\nYes as long as you've not put your voting paper in the ballot box you can ask a member of staff for a replacement.\n\n- Can I bring my dog inside the polling station?\n\nNot always. Some polling stations might allow this, but they do not have to. Assistance dogs are permitted.\n\n- Why are Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer not on my ballot?\n\nAlthough they lead their parties, only people in Sir Keir and Mr Sunak's respective constituencies can vote directly for the two party leaders.\n\n- Can I vote for someone who is not on the ballot?\n\nNo. In some other countries - for instance the US - you can write the name of a different candidate on your ballot. If enough people do that they can win the election as what is known as a \"write-in\" candidate, although this is uncommon.\n\nHowever, this is not possible in the UK, the Electoral Commission told the PA news agency. You can only vote for a person printed on your ballot. If you write in the name of someone else your vote risks being counted as a spoilt ballot.\n\n- I was not asked for photo ID last time I voted, why now?\n\nThe Government introduced a requirement for photo ID in April 2022.\n\n- What identification can I use?\n\nThere is a long list of accepted types of ID, with UK and EU passports and driving licences probably the most common.\n\nThe full ist of accepted IDs can be found at this link.\n\nYou can vote with an out-of-date ID as long as your photo is still obviously you, and the name on your ID matches that on the electoral register.\n\n- What if my name has changed?\n\nIf you have changed your name - for instance if you have married - you can bring a document which proves this, such as a marriage certificate, to show alongside your photo ID.\n\n- I wear a veil or other face covering - how does voter ID work for me?\n\nIf you wear some kind of face covering you will be asked to briefly remove it so that election workers can identify you against your photo ID.\n\nYou can ask to do this in private, and can ask for a female member of staff to undertake the check. This demand will be met \"if possible\", the Electoral Commission says. There will be a mirror available to help you replace your face covering.\n\nSomeone outside the polling station asked me questions - is that OK?\n\nYes. These people are known as tellers, and they work for candidates. They can ask for your name and address, your elector number or your poll card. You don't have to tell them anything if you do not want to.\n\nTellers are there to help candidates understand who has turned out to vote. This can help them understand what doors to knock on to encourage potential voters to go to the polling stations.\n\nThe tellers are not allowed to try to convince you who to vote for.\n\nLinks\n\nPolling stations opening times (archived)\n\nElectoral Commission - How to vote (archived)\n\nWhere do I vote?\n\nElectoral Commission - Guidance for Returning Officers administering Local Government Elections in England (archived)\n\nBluecross - Can I take my dog inside a polling station?

Here the PA news agency outlines everything you need to know about your trip to the polling station.\n\n- When can I go to a polling station?\n\nPolling stations will open at 7am on July 4 and close at 10pm the same day. If you are in the queue outside your polling station at 10pm you will still be allowed to vote, but if you arrive after 10pm you will not be able to cast a ballot.\n\n- Do I have to go to a particular polling station?\n\nYes, you will have been sent a polling card which will tell you which polling station to go to. If you have not got that card for whatever reason, you can enter your address into wheredoivote.co.uk. to find out\n\n- Can I bring my own pen or pencil?\n\nYes. Pencils will be provided for you to fill in your ballot, but if you want to use your own pen or pencil that is totally fine.\n\nPeople can take selfies outside polling stations, but not inside (Jane Barlow/PA)\n\n- Can I take photographs of my ballot or pose for selfies in the polling station?\n\nYou are not allowed to take photographs inside the polling station. This is to ensure that you do not - deliberately or accidentally - reveal who anyone voted for.\n\n- Can I take photographs outside the polling station?\n\nYes. The Electoral Commission says you are \"more than welcome\" to take photos outside the polling station, and even says that posting such photos on social media can encourage your friends and family to vote.\n\n- Should I report someone who has photographed their postal ballot?\n\nNo, the rules are different for postal ballots. People are allowed to take photos of their postal ballot and share them online if they chose to do so. But it is illegal to persuade or induce someone else to share a photo of their postal ballot.\n\n- Can I ask for a new ballot paper if I've made a mistake?\n\nYes as long as you've not put your voting paper in the ballot box you can ask a member of staff for a replacement.\n\nIf you have made a mistake you can ask for a new ballot paper as long as you\u00b4ve not put it in the ballot box yet (Andrew Milligan/PA)\n\n- Can I bring my dog inside the polling station?\n\nNot always. Some polling stations might allow this, but they do not have to. Assistance dogs are permitted.\n\n- Why are Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer not on my ballot?\n\nAlthough they lead their parties, only people in Sir Keir and Mr Sunak's respective constituencies can vote directly for the two party leaders.\n\n- Can I vote for someone who is not on the ballot?\n\nNo. In some other countries - for instance the US - you can write the name of a different candidate on your ballot. If enough people do that they can win the election as what is known as a \"write-in\" candidate, although this is uncommon.\n\nHowever, this is not possible in the UK, the Electoral Commission told the PA news agency. You can only vote for a person printed on your ballot. If you write in the name of someone else your vote risks being counted as a spoilt ballot.\n\nDogs might have to be left outside the polling station as you vote (Andrew Matthews/PA)\n\n- I was not asked for photo ID last time I voted, why now?\n\nThe Government introduced a requirement for photo ID in April 2022.\n\n- What identification can I use?\n\nThere is a long list of accepted types of ID, with UK and EU passports and driving licences probably the most common.\n\nThe full ist of accepted IDs can be found at this link.\n\nYou can vote with an out-of-date ID as long as your photo is still obviously you, and the name on your ID matches that on the electoral register.\n\n- What if my name has changed?\n\nIf you have changed your name - for instance if you have married - you can bring a document which proves this, such as a marriage certificate, to show alongside your photo ID.\n\n- I wear a veil or other face covering - how does voter ID work for me?\n\nIf you wear some kind of face covering you will be asked to briefly remove it so that election workers can identify you against your photo ID.\n\nYou can ask to do this in private, and can ask for a female member of staff to undertake the check. This demand will be met \"if possible\", the Electoral Commission says. There will be a mirror available to help you replace your face covering.\n\nSomeone outside the polling station asked me questions - is that OK?\n\nYes. These people are known as tellers, and they work for candidates. They can ask for your name and address, your elector number or your poll card. You don't have to tell them anything if you do not want to.\n\nTellers are there to help candidates understand who has turned out to vote. This can help them understand what doors to knock on to encourage potential voters to go to the polling stations.\n\nThe tellers are not allowed to try to convince you who to vote for.\n\nLinks\n\nPolling stations opening times (archived)\n\nElectoral Commission - How to vote (archived)\n\nWhere do I vote?\n\nElectoral Commission - Guidance for Returning Officers administering Local Government Elections in England (archived)\n\nBluecross - Can I take my dog inside a polling station?

This can help them understand what doors to knock on to encourage potential voters to go to the polling stations.\n\nElectoral Commission - Guidance for Returning Officers administering Local Government Elections in England (archived)", "source": {"uri": "jerseyeveningpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jersey Evening Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polling_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Polling station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absentee_ballot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Absentee ballot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_Commission_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_masks_during_the_COVID-19_pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write-in_candidate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Write-in candidate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot_box", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ballot box"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ballot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_identification_laws", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Voter identification laws"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Electoral College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_identification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Photo identification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_roll", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electoral roll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hijab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driver's_license", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Driver's license"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Passport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://d3gvyx4eg3tne0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Img38497303.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9703414", "eventUri": "eng-9703414", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 44, "textEnd": 50, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

If there is a queue to vote at 10pm, then if you are in the queue by that time, you should be allowed to vote, however long you wait.\n\nShould I take my polling card?\n\nYou don't have to, but it's useful. The polling station staff will ask for your name and number on the poll card so they can hand you your ballot paper. Having the card will make that quicker.\n\nShould I take a proper, approved form of picture ID?\n\nYES. Absolutely.\n\nIf you do not have the appropriate picture ID, such as a driving licence photo card, passport, MOD identity card, senior bus pass, blue badge or official proof of age card, or the government-issued voter authorisation certificate you WILL NOT be allowed to vote.\n\nCan I take my children into the polling station with me?\n\nYes, you can, in fact, it's encouraged to help educate youngsters about participatory democracy. They should be well-behaved, however. And they must not make a mark on your ballot paper.\n\nCan I take my dog, or other pets into the polling station with me?\n\nAssistance dogs such as guide or hearing dogs are definitely allowed inside the polling station.

It is at the discretion of the polling station staff.\n\nIf you travel to the polling station by horse or donkey, it should be tied up outside.\n\nCan I wear a rosette, or clothing with political slogans when I go to vote?\n\nThe Electoral Commission says there is nothing in law to prevent someone wearing a political slogan when going into a polling station to vote.\n\nHowever, if you do, you should leave immediately afterwards, as campaigning inside polling stations is not allowed.\n\nPolitical discussion is banned inside polling stations.\n\nStaff will intervene if they hear any references to candidates or parties.\n\nCan I take pictures inside? Can I take a selfie of me voting?\n\nPictures are not allowed because of the risk of revealing how someone else has voted, however remote.\n\nIt is a criminal offence to do this and you could be fined up to \u00a35,000 or even be sentenced to six months in prison.\n\nKeep your camera or phone in your pocket inside the polling station.

Here the PA news agency outlines everything you need to know about your trip to the polling station.\n\n- When can I go to a polling station?\n\nPolling stations will open at 7am on July 4 and close at 10pm the same day. If you are in the queue outside your polling station at 10pm you will still be allowed to vote, but if you arrive after 10pm you will not be able to cast a ballot.\n\n- Do I have to go to a particular polling station?\n\nYes, you will have been sent a polling card which will tell you which polling station to go to. If you have not got that card for whatever reason, you can enter your address into wheredoivote.co.uk. to find out\n\n- Can I bring my own pen or pencil?\n\nYes. Pencils will be provided for you to fill in your ballot, but if you want to use your own pen or pencil that is totally fine.\n\n- Can I take photographs of my ballot or pose for selfies in the polling station?\n\nYou are not allowed to take photographs inside the polling station. This is to ensure that you do not - deliberately or accidentally - reveal who anyone voted for.\n\n- Can I take photographs outside the polling station?\n\nYes. The Electoral Commission says you are \"more than welcome\" to take photos outside the polling station, and even says that posting such photos on social media can encourage your friends and family to vote.\n\n- Should I report someone who has photographed their postal ballot?\n\nNo, the rules are different for postal ballots. People are allowed to take photos of their postal ballot and share them online if they chose to do so. But it is illegal to persuade or induce someone else to share a photo of their postal ballot.\n\n- Can I ask for a new ballot paper if I've made a mistake?\n\nYes as long as you've not put your voting paper in the ballot box you can ask a member of staff for a replacement.\n\n- Why are Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer not on my ballot?\n\nAlthough they lead their parties, only people in Sir Keir and Mr Sunak's respective constituencies can vote directly for the two party leaders.\n\n- Can I vote for someone who is not on the ballot?\n\nNo. In some other countries - for instance the US - you can write the name of a different candidate on your ballot. If enough people do that they can win the election as what is known as a \"write-in\" candidate, although this is uncommon.\n\nHowever, this is not possible in the UK, the Electoral Commission told the PA news agency. You can only vote for a person printed on your ballot. If you write in the name of someone else your vote risks being counted as a spoilt ballot.\n\n- I was not asked for photo ID last time I voted, why now?\n\nThere is a long list of accepted types of ID, with UK and EU passports and driving licences probably the most common.\n\nThe full ist of accepted IDs can be found at this link.\n\nYou can vote with an out-of-date ID as long as your photo is still obviously you, and the name on your ID matches that on the electoral register.\n\n- What if my name has changed?\n\nIf you have changed your name - for instance if you have married - you can bring a document which proves this, such as a marriage certificate, to show alongside your photo ID.\n\n- I wear a veil or other face covering - how does voter ID work for me?\n\nIf you wear some kind of face covering you will be asked to briefly remove it so that election workers can identify you against your photo ID.\n\nYou can ask to do this in private, and can ask for a female member of staff to undertake the check. This demand will be met \"if possible\", the Electoral Commission says. There will be a mirror available to help you replace your face covering.\n\nSomeone outside the polling station asked me questions - is that OK?\n\nYes. These people are known as tellers, and they work for candidates. They can ask for your name and address, your elector number or your poll card. You don't have to tell them anything if you do not want to.\n\nTellers are there to help candidates understand who has turned out to vote. This can help them understand what doors to knock on to encourage potential voters to go to the polling stations.\n\nElectoral Commission - Guidance for Returning Officers administering Local Government Elections in England (archived)", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polling_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Polling station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absentee_ballot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Absentee ballot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_Commission_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Selfie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write-in_candidate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Write-in candidate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_identification", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Photo identification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot_box", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ballot box"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ballot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_identification_laws", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Voter identification laws"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_masks_during_the_COVID-19_pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Electoral College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_roll", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electoral roll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hijab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driver's_license", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Driver's license"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Passport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/4xzGDhHQ4sxHduwbRBU5Ag--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/pa_viral_news_uk_120/e1ec461df425d4b5fb08622161266c44", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9703414", "eventUri": "eng-9703414", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 44, "textEnd": 50, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

You do not need the poll card to vote but you do need to take an acceptable form of voter ID, examples of which are listed below.\n\nWhen you're at the polling station, you will be asked to give your name and address and provide your photo ID to confirm your identity.\n\nYou'll be given a ballot paper containing a list of the people, parties or options you can vote for and you complete this in private in a polling booth by marking X next to your preferred candidate, before folding over the piece of paper and putting it in the ballot box.\n\nPolling stations are open between 7am and 10pm and you can cast your vote so long as you're in the queue before 10pm.\n\nVoters who opted to vote by post but haven't yet sent it should mark their vote on the ballot paper in secret, fill in the accompanying postal voting statement, put the ballot and the statement in the envelope provide and seal the envelope yourself.\n\nIt's too late to send your ballot by post now but you can take the sealed envelope to your local polling station by 10pm on election day or deliver it to your local Electoral Registration Office by the time it closes.\n\nYou can hand in your own postal vote and postal votes for up to five other voters. If you are a political campaigner, the five other voters must be family members or people you provide regular care for.\n\nIf you're voting as a proxy for someone else, you should make sure you know which candidate they want you to vote for.\n\nYou'll need to vote at the polling station where the person you're a proxy for usually votes, bearing in mind this may be a different one to where you vote. If you do not know which polling station to go to, contact the local Electoral Registration Office of the person you are a proxy for.\n\nYou may need to show photo ID to vote but you do not need to show the ID of the person you are the proxy for.\n\nAm I registered to vote?\n\nMost people registered to vote should have received their poll card in the post, although you do not need to show this to cast your vote on 4 July.\n\nTo check whether you're already on the register, contact your local Electoral Registration Office if you live in England, Scotland or Wales or the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland (EONI) if you live in Northern Ireland. Deadlines have now passed to register.\n\nWhere do I vote?\n\nYou can check where your polling station is or who you need to contact if you need help by entering your postcode on the Electoral Commission website.\n\nWhat is voter ID?\n\nVoter ID is a form of photo ID people must show at their polling station in order to cast a ballot.\n\nThe new rule was brought in under the Elections Act 2022, with the government saying they were necessary to combat the risk of in-person voter fraud. It was first enforced at the 2023 set of local elections in England.\n\nPeople without valid voter ID can apply for one, although the deadline to vote in the 2024 election has now passed.\n\nDriving and parking\n\nLocal travel\n\nProof of age\n\nOther government issued documents\n\nHow to apply for an emergency proxy vote?\n\nUnder certain circumstances, where you have an emergency that means you can't vote in person, you can apply for an emergency proxy vote.\n\nThe situation leading to your application must be something that you weren't aware of before the normal proxy vote deadline, which was six working days before the election. Emergency proxy applications can be made up to 5pm on polling day.\n\nCircumstances that may make you eligible for an emergency proxy vote include a medical emergency, being away for work or your photo ID being lost, stolen or damaged.\n\nTo arrange an emergency proxy, you need to contact the electoral services team at your local council.\n\nVoting if you have a disability\n\nIf you have a disability and need information about physical access, for example wheelchair ramps and disabled parking spaces, low-level polling booths and/or any specific equipment you need, contact your local Electoral Registration Office.\n\nEvery polling station must provide at least one large print display version of the ballot paper.\n\nWhat can I NOT do at a polling station?\n\nYou can only vote once - unless you are voting for both yourself and someone else as a proxy - and its illegal for anyone to influence you to vote against your will. Voting is also not compulsory.\n\nYou are not allowed to take a selfie within the polling station as the Electoral Commission says it risks the ballot's secrecy.

If you have not got that card for whatever reason, you can enter your address into wheredoivote.co.uk to find out.\n\nCan I take photographs of my ballot or pose for selfies in the polling station?\n\nYou are not allowed to take photographs inside the polling station. This is to ensure that you do not - deliberately or accidentally - reveal who anyone voted for.\n\nCan I take photographs outside the polling station?\n\nYes. The Electoral Commission says you are \"more than welcome\" to take photos outside the polling station, and even says that posting such photos on social media can encourage your friends and family to vote.\n\nShould I report someone who has photographed their postal ballot?\n\nNo, the rules are different for postal ballots. People are allowed to take photos of their postal ballot and share them online if they chose to do so. But it is illegal to persuade or induce someone else to share a photo of their postal ballot.\n\nCan I ask for a new ballot paper if I've made a mistake?\n\nYes as long as you've not put your voting paper in the ballot box you can ask a member of staff for a replacement.\n\nAlthough they lead their parties, only people in Sir Keir and Mr Sunak's respective constituencies can vote directly for the two party leaders.\n\nCan I vote for someone who is not on the ballot?\n\nNo. In some other countries - for instance the US - you can write the name of a different candidate on your ballot. If enough people do that they can win the election as what is known as a \"write-in\" candidate, although this is uncommon.\n\nHowever, this is not possible in the UK, according to the Electoral Commission. You can only vote for a person printed on your ballot. If you write in the name of someone else your vote risks being counted as a spoilt ballot.\n\nI was not asked for photo ID last time I voted, why now?\n\nThere is a long list of accepted types of ID, with UK and EU passports and driving licences probably the most common.\n\nThe full ist of accepted IDs can be found at this link.\n\nYou can vote with an out-of-date ID as long as your photo is still obviously you, and the name on your ID matches that on the electoral register.\n\nWhat if my name has changed?\n\nIf you have changed your name - for instance if you have married - you can bring a document which proves this, such as a marriage certificate, to show alongside your photo ID.\n\nI wear a veil or other face covering - how does voter ID work for me?\n\nIf you wear some kind of face covering you will be asked to briefly remove it so that election workers can identify you against your photo ID.\n\nYou can ask to do this in private, and can ask for a female member of staff to undertake the check. This demand will be met \"if possible\", the Electoral Commission says. There will be a mirror available to help you replace your face covering.\n\nSomeone outside the polling station asked me questions - is that OK?\n\nYes. These people are known as tellers, and they work for candidates. They can ask for your name and address, your elector number or your poll card. You don't have to tell them anything if you do not want to.\n\nTellers are there to help candidates understand who has turned out to vote. This can help them understand what doors to knock on to encourage potential voters to go to the polling stations.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polling_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Polling station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absentee_ballot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Absentee ballot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_Commission_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Selfie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_masks_during_the_COVID-19_pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write-in_candidate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Write-in candidate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_identification", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Photo identification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot_box", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ballot box"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ballot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_identification_laws", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Voter identification laws"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_invitation_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Voter invitation card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Electoral College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_roll", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electoral roll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driver's_license", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Driver's license"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Passport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/04/06/01f28cd780241684784aaab3248175e2Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzIwMDg3MjU2-2.76469050.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9703414", "eventUri": "eng-9703414", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

This election is about making a stand against Labour's dominance in this country.\"\n\nLabour candidate for the Vale Kanishka Narayan argues differently saying Labour offers an alternative to what he describes as \"Rishi's Conservative chaos.\"\n\nAnd then there's the man of Barry wanting to fight for Barry in Westminster, Plaid Cymru's candidate Ian Johnson, who told us: \"If Plaid can win the election here, then the people of this county will have someone who instinctively knows the area and that would be a valuable asset in Westminster.\"\n\nLabour's Kanishka Narayan and Conservative Alun Cairns (Image: Newsquest/ Supplied)\n\nmemo Arts Centre; Where the Vale count will be held (Image: Google Maps)\n\nMillions of people across the UK will cast their votes in the General Election on Thursday, choosing MPs in 650 constituencies and contributing to a national result which will decide who is the prime minister.\n\nFrom photo ID to bringing furry friends, here is everything you need to know about what you should, and should not, do on the day itself.\n\nPolling stations will be open from 7am to 10pm on July 4.\n\nThese are often found in schools, churches, community centres and libraries.\n\nIn 2022, voters in Oxford even cast their ballots inside a launderette.\n\nAll registered electors who are eligible to vote in the General Election should have received a polling card which includes the address of the polling station at which they may vote.\n\nYou cannot vote elsewhere.\n\nThe Electoral Commission, which oversees UK elections, also has an online tool which tells you where your polling station is.\n\nYou can also check on your local council's website or contact them for more information.\n\nYou may have to queue outside before you get into the polling station as they can get very busy, especially towards the end of the day.\n\nOnce you are inside the polling station, the staff will check you are on the electoral register, ask for your photo ID and hand you a ballot paper.\n\nYou should take this to a voting booth, read the instructions on it and mark the ballot paper with your vote.\n\nYou can then place it in the ballot box and leave the venue.\n\nThis election is the first time in the UK that everyone wanting to vote in person will have to show a correct form of photo ID before casting a ballot - this includes a passport, driving licence and blue badge.\n\nIt does not matter if your photo ID is out of date, as long as it still looks like you and has the name under which you registered to vote.\n\nOther forms of permitted ID include an Older Person's or Disabled Person's Bus Pass, and an identity card bearing the Proof of Age Standards Scheme hologram (a Pass card).\n\nA polling card, which tells you when you can vote and at which polling station, is not required to cast your vote.\n\nSimply tell the staff there your name and address when you arrive.\n\nAlthough the election news cycle is often dominated by party leaders, who have appeared in televised debates and regularly make headlines, those probably are not the names you will see in front of you.\n\nYour ballot paper will offer a list of candidates representing political parties, or standing as independents, in your constituency.\n\nThere will usually be about seven options, made up of candidates representing the major parties, smaller parties or running as independents.\n\nIn some seats where there is more public interest, this number may be much higher.\n\nSome 13 candidates are running in Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's constituency of Richmond and Northallerton, while Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is among 12 names voters in Holborn and St Pancras can choose from.\n\nYou are only allowed to vote for one candidate on the ballot paper, by putting a cross (X) in the box next to their name.\n\nLeaving any other mark on the ballot paper, including voting for more than one candidate or party, or writing anything which could identify you or leads to doubt about who you intended to vote for, will result in the ballot paper not being counted.\n\nDoing this on purpose is known as \"spoiling\" your ballot.\n\nYou are entitled to vote as long as you are inside the polling station or in a queue outside at 10pm.\n\nThere are various reasons a person who intended to vote in-person at a polling station on election day may be unable to at short notice, such as a medical emergency, work requirements or loss of photo ID.\n\nUnder these circumstances, a prospective voter can apply for an emergency proxy vote where another person casts your ballot on your behalf.\n\nThey must take their own ID with them.\n\nApplicants must send the relevant form to their local Electoral Registration Office by 5pm on polling day.\n\nUsually, animals are not allowed inside polling stations, apart from assistance dogs.\n\nThough the station's presiding officer may theoretically give permission for pets to be taken inside, this is unlikely to be the case.\n\nIf you choose to bring a furry friend, they should be safely secured outside the venue - you can always chat politics with them on the way home.\n\nPhotographs are not allowed inside polling stations as the Electoral Commission says this risks compromising the secrecy of the ballot.\n\nRevealing how somebody else voted, even by accident, could land you with a \u00a35,000 fine or up to six months in prison.\n\nAll polling stations should have accessibility measures in place to ensure disabled people can exercise their right to vote.\n\nThis includes providing tactile voting devices, magnifiers and large-print sample ballot papers for voters who are visually impaired.\n\nThey should also provide seating for people who cannot stand for long periods of time and have measures for wheelchair users - such as ramps and low-level polling booths.\n\nYes, voters are allowed to bring their own pen/pencil to fill in their ballot paper.\n\nThough there is no legal requirement to use them, pencils are provided inside polling stations because they are less likely to leak or run than pens which use ink.\n\nOnce inside a polling station, any form of political discussion, campaigning or canvassing is strictly prohibited.\n\nThis means you cannot debate your vote with friends, families or strangers.\n\nYou must also not be accompanied into the polling booth by another adult unless you have a disability, though your children may join you, provided they do not mark the ballot paper.\n\nThe first indication of how the election has gone on a national level is likely to be the exit polls, which are published shortly after 10pm.\n\nThese take place at about 144 polling stations across the country, with tens of thousands of people asked to privately fill in a replica ballot as they leave, to get an indication of how they voted.\n\nOfficial constituency outcomes are likely to be announced from 11.30pm as early results trickle in.\n\nThis will speed up as the night progresses, with hundreds of results expected in the early hours of Friday morning, between 3am and 4am.\n\nBy 4am, enough results should be in to know which party is on course to win the election and by what margin.", "source": {"uri": "barryanddistrictnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Barry and District News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Will it be incumbent PM Rishi Sunak, leader of the Conservative Party? Or Keir Starmer, leader of the Opposition since early 2020 and current Labour leader?\n\nThe result is still hours away, but for now, millions of people across the country will be gearing up to put their X in the box of their favoured candidate.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the opening hours of your polling station.\n\nWhat time do the polls open?\n\nPolling stations across the UK will open simultaneously at 7am. Your poll card will tell you which polling station to head to, and should give you the address and a map to show you where it's located. If you don't have a poll card, you can enter your postcode online to find out which polling station to go to. You cannot vote at a different polling station than the one you're assigned to.\n\nWhen you get there, you will give your name, address and show your photo ID to the staff inside the polling station, and they will cross-reference your registered details with their records. They will give you a ballot paper to take to the nearby booths, where you'll put a single cross in the empty box next to your chosen candidate using the pencil provided. When you've voted, you will fold your paper over and post it through the sealed ballot box.\n\nWhat time do the polls close?\n\nPolling stations will close at 10pm on the dot - you will not be allowed to vote if you turn up after this time. However, there are some exceptions: if you've been waiting in the queue outside the polling station when the clock strikes 10pm you should still be allowed into the station to vote. And if you're in the polling station - or in the queue outside - for the purposes of returning your postal vote, you may still do so after 10pm.\n\nWhat ID do I need to vote?\n\nUnder new legislation, this will be the first UK general election in which voters will need a form of identification to fill in their ballot. You must bring with you one form of photo ID - not a photocopy or digital version - and show it to the staff at the polling station. This can be a passport, driving licence, a Blue Badge, Freedom pass, bus pass funded by the UK government (or Senior Smart Pass issued in Northern Ireland), an identity card with the Proof of Age Standards Scheme hologram (a PASS card), a biometric residence permit, Ministry of Defence Form 90 (Defence Identity Card), National identity card issued by an EEA state, Electoral Identity Card issued in Northern Ireland, a Voter Authority Certificate, or an Anonymous Elector's Document.\n\nThe ID you bring must have a photo of you that bears a reasonable likeness to you now - even an expired passport or driving licence will do if you still look like the picture on it. Just don't do what Boris Johnson attempted at the local elections in May when he turned up with an envelope bearing his name and address... despite introducing the very same voter ID rule that flummoxed him.\n\nWhat happens if I can't vote today?\n\nIf you have an emergency that prevents you from physically getting to your polling station today, you may be eligible for an emergency proxy vote that allows a trusted person to vote on your behalf. If you have a medical emergency, you are away for work or if your photo ID is lost, stolen, destroyed or damaged after the deadline to apply for a Voter Authority Certificate has passed, you can contact the electoral services team at your local council to arrange an emergency proxy vote.\n\nApplications can be made up to 5pm on polling day.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType":

The deadline passed on June 18 at 11.59pm and anyone who did not register in time will not be able to vote or register for a postal or proxy vote.\n\nFor those who are registered, there are three ways of voting: in person at a polling station, by post or by proxy.\n\nAnyone wishing to vote by post or proxy needs to have completed an additional registration, the deadlines for both of which have now passed, although it may still be possible to apply for an emergency proxy vote in certain circumstances.\n\nRead the latest election polls\n\nAm I registered to vote?\n\nYou can check if you are on the electoral register by contacting your local electoral registration office.\n\nThe name and address of everyone who successfully registered to vote, unless they have done so anonymously, is added to the electoral register. During registration, there is also an option to opt out of the open register, which is a version of the electoral register that is available to anyone who wants to buy a copy.\n\nHow to vote in person\n\nYou can vote in person today at your designated local polling station, providing you bring a valid photo ID.\n\nA poll card is sent out before the election to everyone who has registered to vote with details where your designated polling station is and reminding you when it is open, although this will be from 7am to 10pm at every site today.\n\nOn arrival at the polling station, you will need to confirm your name and address with staff and show your photo ID before they can provide you with the ballot paper you need to cast your vote.\n\nHow to vote by post\n\nYou also have the option to select your candidate by post, which can be done if you will not be able to attend a polling station in person today or if it is more convenient for you.\n\nTo do so, you must have registered to vote and also completed the postal vote application before the deadline, which passed at 5pm on June 19.\n\nThose who have applied for a postal vote will automatically be sent a postal ballot. All the necessary information on how to correctly select a candidate and send in your vote is provided on the form.\n\nIt is advised that postal voters fill out their forms and send them for free via the Post Office or a postbox as soon as they can.\n\nThere is no formal deadline for when the ballot needs to be sent off. But if you did so too close to the deadline, it may not be delivered in time to be counted.\n\nDespite reports of delays, Royal Mail said they \"remain confident\" that postal votes received on time will be delivered before the end of the day. You can read more about what to do if your postal ballot is delayed here.\n\nAlternatively, you can take your completed form to your local polling station and deliver it by hand before the polls close at 10pm today.\n\nHow to vote by proxy\n\nYou can get someone else to vote on your behalf if you cannot attend a polling station in person, are registered as an overseas voter, have a medical issue or disability, or cannot vote in person because of work or military service.\n\nThe deadline for registering to vote by proxy passed at 5pm on June 26. You must also have already registered to vote.\n\nYou will need to tell your chosen proxy who to vote for, so they should be someone you trust to vote on your behalf. They must also be registered to vote and can do so at the polling station specified on your poll card.\n\nHow to apply for an emergency proxy vote\n\nIf you missed the deadline, you may be able to put in an application for an emergency proxy vote up until 5pm today in certain cases, including:\n\nLost photo ID\n\nMedical emergency or disability\n\nDue to your employment\n\nNew or replacement photo ID order not arriving on time\n\nTo apply, you need to fill out one of three forms, depending on your circumstance, and send it to your local Electoral Registration Office. There are separate forms for reasons relating to employment, medical emergency or disability and to photo ID.\n\nIf you are applying for an emergency proxy vote because of a medical emergency, disability or your employment, you will need to get your application form signed by an \"appropriate person\" such as a doctor or employer before submitting it.\n\nWhere do I vote?\n\nYou vote in person at a polling station, which is usually a public building such as a school or local hall.\n\nIt is only possible to vote at your designated polling station. Usually, this is the nearest one to the address you are registered at.\n\nIf you require physical access, a disabled parking space or a large print version of the ballot, your local Electoral Registration Office can tell you about what is provided at your polling station.\n\nWhere is my polling station?\n\nLocal Electoral Registration Offices can provide information about where the nearest polling station is - but voters are also sent a poll card that says when the vote is and which station to attend.\n\nWhat time do polling stations open and close?\n\nPolling stations will be open today from 7am to 10pm.\n\nWhat do I need to bring with me to vote?\n\nA valid photo ID is all you are required to bring with you to the polling station to be able to vote today.\n\nWhat ID can I use to vote?\n\nThe name on the ID must match the name provided on the electoral register, otherwise, a voter can bring a document with them to the polling station that proves they have changed their name.\n\nSince May 2023, voters in England, Wales and Scotland have needed to provide a form of photographic ID at the ballot box. Voters in Northern Ireland also need to do so.\n\nFor the general election, voters will need to show a form of identification such as a driving licence, passport or blue badge to be able to cast their vote.\n\nVoters were also able to apply for a free voter authority certificate (VAC) either online or by post if they did not have an accepted photographic ID available.\n\nThe deadline to apply for a VAC passed on June 26 at 5pm and was done through the Electoral Commission's website.\n\nDo I need my polling card to vote?\n\nNo, you do not need to bring your poll card with you to be able to vote today. Your poll card should have been sent to you just before election day and if you have not received one but think you should have, you can contact your local Electoral Registration Office.\n\nCan I vote online?\n\nNo, it is not possible to vote in the general election online.\n\nExperts say that security and anonymity concerns make it difficult to implement an online voting system.", "source":

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nThe general election is finally upon us, with voters across the UK taking to the polls on Thursday.\n\nAcross the UK, 650 seats are up for grabs in the first nationwide election since 2019, and 27 of those are in Greater Manchester. Rishi Sunak will be hoping to keep his Conservative Party in power, therefore extending their 14 years in Downing Street.\n\nBut Sir Keir Starmer's is aiming to become Labour's first Prime Minister since Gordon Brown in 2010. Voters will be heading to polling stations between 7am and 10pm to cast their votes.\n\nREAD MORE: Netflix series with 'biggest ever plot twist' left fans 'unable to sleep for a week'\n\nIt comes as Mr Sunak confirmed a summer general election outside Downing Street in May. He had previously said it would take place in the second part of the year.\n\nPolling stations will open from 7am and close at 10pm - and you must attend the address on your poll card in order to vote. However, if you are in a queue to vote at 10pm, the Electoral Commission says you are still allowed to vote.\n\nMeanwhile, new rules ushered in last year mean voters will now need to provide a form of photo ID to vote in person, or have a voter authority certificate.\n\nHere is a look at all the things you can't do in a polling station - from taking selfies, to discussing politics.\n\nTake your dog\n\nWe all love a scroll through the adorable #DogsAtPollingStations hashtag every year. However animals aren't usually allowed at polling stations - with the exception of assistance dogs.\n\nIt's down to the discretion of each local authority whether to let dogs in or not. The Blue Cross advised owners either to leave dogs at home, or bring someone along with you who can wait outside with your dog while you vote.\n\nVote without a valid form of ID\n\nVoters now need to show a valid form of photo ID when voting at polling stations in elections. The name on your photo ID should be the same name you used to register to vote. While your photo ID can be out of date, it must clearly look like you.\n\nPassports, driving licences and a Blue badge are among the acceptable forms of photo ID. If you do not have photo ID, you must have applied for a a free 'Voter Authority Certificate' by 5pm on April 25.\n\nWear political slogans\n\nUnder voting rules, you cannot wear political slogans when you are voting. You won't be allowed into the polling station if you do. And you must not seek to influence or intimidate other voters in the polling stations.\n\nVote in same booth as other people\n\nYou can only vote on your own - it is not a time to take friends and family into the polling booth. This is a strict rule to maintain a secret ballot.\n\nWhile you can walk to the polling station with your friends or family members you cannot all go into the voting booth itself. Exceptions are made for people with disabilities, who can be accompanied by the presiding officer, or by a helper.\n\nDoodling or signing ballot paper\n\nDoodling on the ballot paper is not allowed as the vote could be counted as \"spoiled\" and will not count. You must also never sign your name at the bottom as the vote will be invalidated - as the vote is anonymous.\n\nAnd you cannot start a political discussion while in the polling station. It's actually a criminal offence to ask someone how they are going to vote - as it could be seen as trying to influence them.\n\nTake a selfie\n\nWhile it may be tempting to capture the moment you cast your vote with a selfie, you must resist the urge to do this. Photography is not allowed as you may accidentally reveal how you've voted - or how someone standing nearby has voted.\n\nIf a picture that links you to your ballot is discovered, your vote may not count.", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ellie_kemp@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "Ellie Kemp", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polling_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Polling station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_identification", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Photo identification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downing_Street", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Downing Street"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constituencies_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constituencies of the Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gordon Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greater Manchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Greater Manchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elections in the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_Commission_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashtag", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hashtag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Selfie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoilt_vote", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spoilt vote"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_ballot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secret ballot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speaker (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ballot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crime"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article29377288.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Polling-station-Getty-Images.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9703414", "eventUri": "eng-9703414", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-04-25", "textStart": 2353, "textEnd": 2361}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

Am I registered to vote?How to vote in personHow to vote by postHow to vote by proxyHow to apply for an emergency proxy voteWhere do I vote?Where is my polling station? What time do polling stations open and close?What do I need to bring with me to vote?What ID can I use to vote?Do I need my polling card to vote?Can I vote online?How do I vote?\n\nAny British, Irish or qualifying Commonwealth citizen who is resident at a UK address and 18 or older can vote today.\n\nIn any case, to be able to vote you need to be registered to do so already. The deadline passed on June 18 at 11.59pm and anyone who did not register in time will not be able to vote or register for a postal or proxy vote.\n\nFor those who are registered, there are three ways of voting: in person at a polling station, by post or by proxy.\n\nAnyone wishing to vote by post or proxy needs to have completed an additional registration, the deadlines for both of which have now passed, although it may still be possible to apply for an emergency proxy vote in certain circumstances.\n\nRead the latest election pollsFollow The Telegraph's live coverage of today's general electionAm I registered to vote?\n\nYou can check if you are on the electoral register by contacting your local electoral registration office.\n\nThe name and address of everyone who successfully registered to vote, unless they have done so anonymously, is added to the electoral register. During registration, there is also an option to opt out of the open register, which is a version of the electoral register that is available to anyone who wants to buy a copy.\n\nHow to vote in person\n\nYou can vote in person today at your designated local polling station, providing you bring a valid photo ID.\n\nA poll card is sent out before the election to everyone who has registered to vote with details where your designated polling station is and reminding you when it is open, although this will be from 7am to 10pm at every site today.\n\nOn arrival at the polling station, you will need to confirm your name and address with staff and show your photo ID before they can provide you with the ballot paper you need to cast your vote.\n\nStruggling with who to pick?\n\nWho should I vote for? Read more How to vote by post\n\nYou also have the option to select your candidate by post, which can be done if you will not be able to attend a polling station in person today or if it is more convenient for you.\n\nTo do so, you must have registered to vote and also completed the postal vote application before the deadline, which passed at 5pm on June 19.\n\nThose who have applied for a postal vote will automatically be sent a postal ballot. All the necessary information on how to correctly select a candidate and send in your vote is provided on the form.\n\nIt is advised that postal voters fill out their forms and send them for free via the Post Office or a postbox as soon as they can.\n\nThere is no formal deadline for when the ballot needs to be sent off. But if you did so too close to the deadline, it may not be delivered in time to be counted.\n\nDespite reports of delays, Royal Mail said they \"remain confident\" that postal votes received on time will be delivered before the end of the day. You can read more about what to do if your postal ballot is delayed here.\n\nAlternatively, you can take your completed form to your local polling station and deliver it by hand before the polls close at 10pm today.\n\nHow to vote by proxy\n\nYou can get someone else to vote on your behalf if you cannot attend a polling station in person, are registered as an overseas voter, have a medical issue or disability, or cannot vote in person because of work or military service.\n\nThe deadline for registering to vote by proxy passed at 5pm on June 26. You must also have already registered to vote.\n\nYou will need to tell your chosen proxy who to vote for, so they should be someone you trust to vote on your behalf. They must also be registered to vote and can do so at the polling station specified on your poll card.\n\nHow to apply for an emergency proxy vote\n\nIf you missed the deadline, you may be able to put in an application for an emergency proxy vote up until 5pm today in certain cases, including:\n\nLost photo IDMedical emergency or disabilityDue to your employmentNew or replacement photo ID order not arriving on time\n\nTo apply, you need to fill out one of three forms, depending on your circumstance, and send it to your local Electoral Registration Office. There are separate forms for reasons relating to employment, medical emergency or disability and to photo ID.\n\nIf you are applying for an emergency proxy vote because of a medical emergency, disability or your employment, you will need to get your application form signed by an \"appropriate person\" such as a doctor or employer before submitting it.\n\nWhere do I vote?\n\nYou vote in person at a polling station, which is usually a public building such as a school or local hall.\n\nIt is only possible to vote at your designated polling station. Usually, this is the nearest one to the address you are registered at.\n\nIf you require physical access, a disabled parking space or a large print version of the ballot, your local Electoral Registration Office can tell you about what is provided at your polling station.\n\nWhere is my polling station?\n\nLocal Electoral Registration Offices can provide information about where the nearest polling station is - but voters are also sent a poll card that says when the vote is and which station to attend.\n\nWhat time do polling stations open and close?\n\nPolling stations will be open today from 7am to 10pm.\n\nWhat do I need to bring with me to vote?\n\nA valid photo ID is all you are required to bring with you to the polling station to be able to vote today.\n\nWhat ID can I use to vote?\n\nThe name on the ID must match the name provided on the electoral register, otherwise, a voter can bring a document with them to the polling station that proves they have changed their name.\n\nSince May 2023, voters in England, Wales and Scotland have needed to provide a form of photographic ID at the ballot box. Voters in Northern Ireland also need to do so.\n\nFor the general election, voters will need to show a form of identification such as a driving licence, passport or blue badge to be able to cast their vote.\n\nVoters were also able to apply for a free voter authority certificate (VAC) either online or by post if they did not have an accepted photographic ID available.\n\nThe deadline to apply for a VAC passed on June 26 at 5pm and was done through the Electoral Commission's website.\n\nDo I need my polling card to vote?\n\nNo, you do not need to bring your poll card with you to be able to vote today. Your poll card should have been sent to you just before election day and if you have not received one but think you should have, you can contact your local Electoral Registration Office.\n\nCan I vote online?\n\nNo, it is not possible to vote in the general election online.\n\nExperts say that security and anonymity concerns make it difficult to implement an online voting system.", "source":

Here the PA news agency outlines everything you need to know about your trip to the polling station.\n\n- When can I go to a polling station?\n\nPolling stations will open at 7am on July 4 and close at 10pm the same day. If you are in the queue outside your polling station at 10pm you will still be allowed to vote, but if you arrive after 10pm you will not be able to cast a ballot.\n\n- Do I have to go to a particular polling station?\n\nYes, you will have been sent a polling card which will tell you which polling station to go to. If you have not got that card for whatever reason, you can enter your address into wheredoivote.co.uk. to find out\n\n- Can I bring my own pen or pencil?\n\nYes. Pencils will be provided for you to fill in your ballot, but if you want to use your own pen or pencil that is totally fine.\n\n- Can I take photographs of my ballot or pose for selfies in the polling station?\n\nYou are not allowed to take photographs inside the polling station. This is to ensure that you do not - deliberately or accidentally - reveal who anyone voted for.\n\n- Can I take photographs outside the polling station?\n\nYes. The Electoral Commission says you are \"more than welcome\" to take photos outside the polling station, and even says that posting such photos on social media can encourage your friends and family to vote.\n\n- Should I report someone who has photographed their postal ballot?\n\nNo, the rules are different for postal ballots. People are allowed to take photos of their postal ballot and share them online if they chose to do so. But it is illegal to persuade or induce someone else to share a photo of their postal ballot.\n\n- Can I ask for a new ballot paper if I've made a mistake?\n\nYes as long as you've not put your voting paper in the ballot box you can ask a member of staff for a replacement.\n\n- Why are Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer not on my ballot?\n\nAlthough they lead their parties, only people in Sir Keir and Mr Sunak's respective constituencies can vote directly for the two party leaders.\n\n- Can I vote for someone who is not on the ballot?\n\nNo. In some other countries - for instance the US - you can write the name of a different candidate on your ballot. If enough people do that they can win the election as what is known as a \"write-in\" candidate, although this is uncommon.\n\nHowever, this is not possible in the UK, the Electoral Commission told the PA news agency. You can only vote for a person printed on your ballot.

The deadline passed on June 18 at 11.59pm and anyone who did not register in time will not be able to vote or register for a postal or proxy vote.\n\nFor those who are registered, there are three ways of voting: in person at a polling station, by post or by proxy.\n\nAnyone wishing to vote by post or proxy needs to have completed an additional registration, the deadlines for both of which have now passed, although it may still be possible to apply for an emergency proxy vote in certain circumstances.\n\nYou can check if you are on the electoral register by contacting your local electoral registration office.\n\nThe name and address of everyone who successfully registered to vote, unless they have done so anonymously, is added to the electoral register. During registration, there is also an option to opt out of the open register, which is a version of the electoral register that is available to anyone who wants to buy a copy.\n\nYou can vote in person today at your designated local polling station, providing you bring a valid photo ID.\n\nA poll card is sent out before the election to everyone who has registered to vote with details where your designated polling station is and reminding you when it is open, although this will be from 7am to 10pm at every site today.\n\nOn arrival at the polling station, you will need to confirm your name and address with staff and show your photo ID before they can provide you with the ballot paper you need to cast your vote.\n\nYou also have the option to select your candidate by post, which can be done if you will not be able to attend a polling station in person today or if it is more convenient for you.\n\nTo do so, you must have registered to vote and also completed the postal vote application before the deadline, which passed at 5pm on June 19.\n\nThose who have applied for a postal vote will automatically be sent a postal ballot. All the necessary information on how to correctly select a candidate and send in your vote is provided on the form.\n\nIt is advised that postal voters fill out their forms and send them for free via the Post Office or a postbox as soon as they can.\n\nThere is no formal deadline for when the ballot needs to be sent off. But if you did so too close to the deadline, it may not be delivered in time to be counted.\n\nDespite reports of delays, Royal Mail said they \"remain confident\" that postal votes received on time will be delivered before the end of the day. You can read more about what to do if your postal ballot is delayed here.\n\nAlternatively, you can take your completed form to your local polling station and deliver it by hand before the polls close at 10pm today.\n\nYou can get someone else to vote on your behalf if you cannot attend a polling station in person, are registered as an overseas voter, have a medical issue or disability, or cannot vote in person because of work or military service.\n\nThe deadline for registering to vote by proxy passed at 5pm on June 26. You must also have already registered to vote.\n\nYou will need to tell your chosen proxy who to vote for, so they should be someone you trust to vote on your behalf. They must also be registered to vote and can do so at the polling station specified on your poll card.\n\nIf you missed the deadline, you may be able to put in an application for an emergency proxy vote up until 5pm today in certain cases, including:\n\nTo apply, you need to fill out one of three forms, depending on your circumstance, and send it to your local Electoral Registration Office. There are separate forms for reasons relating to employment, medical emergency or disability and to photo ID.\n\nIf you are applying for an emergency proxy vote because of a medical emergency, disability or your employment, you will need to get your application form signed by an \"appropriate person\" such as a doctor or employer before submitting it.\n\nYou vote in person at a polling station, which is usually a public building such as a school or local hall.\n\nIt is only possible to vote at your designated polling station. Usually, this is the nearest one to the address you are registered at.\n\nIf you require physical access, a disabled parking space or a large print version of the ballot, your local Electoral Registration Office can tell you about what is provided at your polling station.\n\nLocal Electoral Registration Offices can provide information about where the nearest polling station is - but voters are also sent a poll card that says when the vote is and which station to attend.\n\nPolling stations will be open today from 7am to 10pm.\n\nA valid photo ID is all you are required to bring with you to the polling station to be able to vote today.\n\nThe name on the ID must match the name provided on the electoral register, otherwise, a voter can bring a document with them to the polling station that proves they have changed their name.\n\nSince May 2023, voters in England, Wales and Scotland have needed to provide a form of photographic ID at the ballot box. Voters in Northern Ireland also need to do so.\n\nFor the general election, voters will need to show a form of identification such as a driving licence, passport or blue badge to be able to cast their vote.\n\nVoters were also able to apply for a free voter authority certificate (VAC) either online or by post if they did not have an accepted photographic ID available.\n\nThe deadline to apply for a VAC passed on June 26 at 5pm and was done through the Electoral Commission's website.\n\nNo, you do not need to bring your poll card with you to be able to vote today. Your poll card should have been sent to you just before election day and if you have not received one but think you should have, you can contact your local Electoral Registration Office.\n\nNo, it is not possible to vote in the general election online.\n\nExperts say that security and anonymity concerns make it difficult to implement an online voting system.", "source": {"uri":

On election day, voters receive a ballot paper with a list of candidates for their constituency. As only one MP will represent the area, each party only has one candidate to choose from.\n\nVoters put a cross next to their favourite candidate and the candidate with the most votes becomes MP.\n\nThere are various reasons a person who intended to vote in-person at a polling station on election day may be unable to at short notice, such as a medical emergency, work requirements or loss of photo ID.\n\nUnder these circumstances, a prospective voter can apply for an emergency proxy vote where another person casts your ballot on your behalf.\n\nThey must take their own ID with them.\n\nApplicants must send the relevant form to their local Electoral Registration Office by 5pm on polling day.\n\nPhotographs are not allowed inside polling stations as the Electoral Commission says this risks compromising the secrecy of the ballot.\n\nRevealing how somebody else voted, even by accident, could land you with a \u00a35000 fine or up to six months in prison.\n\nYes, voters are allowed to bring their own pen/pencil to fill in their ballot paper.\n\nThough there is no legal requirement to use them, pencils are provided inside polling stations because they are less likely to leak or run than pens which use ink.\n\nOnce inside a polling station, any form of political discussion, campaigning or canvassing is strictly prohibited.\n\nThis means you cannot debate your vote with friends, families or strangers.\n\nYou must also not be accompanied into the polling booth by another adult unless you have a disability, though your children may join you, provided they do not mark the ballot paper.\n\nThe counting process can begin when the polls close at 10pm.\n\nCounting may take place overnight after the poll has closed or on the following day.\n\nIf the count is taking place overnight, election staff will take the sealed ballot boxes from the polling station to the count centre along with the completed paperwork which records how many ballot papers have been issued.\n\nIf the count is not taking place overnight then the ballot boxes will be transported to and stored in a secure location until the count begins.\n\nThe first indication of how the election has gone on a national level is likely to be the exit polls, which are published shortly after 10pm.\n\nThese take place at about 144 polling stations across the country, with tens of thousands of people asked to privately fill in a replica ballot as they leave, to get an indication of how they voted.\n\nOfficial constituency outcomes are likely to be announced from 11.30pm as early results trickle in.\n\nThis will speed up as the night progresses, with hundreds of results expected in the early hours of Friday morning, between 3am and 4am.\n\nBy 4am, enough results should be in to know which party is on course to win the election and by what margin.\n\nThe Glasgow Times will be covering the count in Glasgow overnight.", "source": {"uri": "glasgowtimes.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

Of those, about a quarter requested a postal vote.\n\nThis election falls during Scotland's school summer holidays and concerns had been raised about postal ballots being received and returned in time to vote.\n\nFor those still without a voting pack, replacement packs can be obtained from council offices up until 17:00 on polling day.\n\nPostal voters who have forgotten to send their ballot paper back can hand them in at their polling station.\n\nMany councils also accept postal votes at council offices.\n\nThe deadline for proxy votes has passed and emergency proxy votes are only possible in limited circumstances, such as being called away suddenly for work.\n\nIf you are on the electoral register, you should have received a polling card. This contains your polling number and polling place address.\n\nYou must vote at your designated polling place any time between 07:00 and 22:00. You do not need to take your polling card with you to the polling station.\n\nAt the polling station, you will be given a ballot paper listing candidates and parties in your constituency.\n\nTake it to a screened booth, and use the pencil to put an X in the box next to the name of your chosen candidate.\n\nIf you make a mistake you can get another ballot paper, as long as you have not put it in the ballot box.\n\nWhen you are ready, fold the ballot paper - for privacy - and put it in the box where the votes are collected.\n\nPhoto ID was first required in Scotland for the Hamilton and Rutherglen West by-election last year.\n\nBut this is the first time it has been used in a national poll in Scotland.\n\nThe Electoral Commission says 22 different forms of photo ID are acceptable, such as a passport, driving licence, bus pass and Young Scot card.\n\nYou can use out-of-date photo ID as long as you look the same.\n\nIf you wear a face covering, such as a medical mask or a veil worn on religious grounds, you will be asked to remove it briefly, so polling station staff can check that your ID looks like you.\n\nVoters have been warned that photographs and copies of passports or other documents will not be accepted, only original documents.\n\nIf you go to the polling station without the correct ID, you will be asked to come back with valid documentation.\n\nIf you think your ID has been wrongly rejected, the Electoral Commission says you should notify the presiding officer at the polling station.\n\nIf this does not resolve the issue, you can raise your concerns with your council's returning officer.\n\nAnother major difference at this year's election is the number of constituencies in Scotland has been reduced from 59 to 57 due to boundary changes affecting all but 10 seats north of the border.\n\nThe alterations are based on recommendations by an independent commission in each part of the UK and are designed to reflect population shifts.\n\nFollowing the changes some constituency names are different.\n\nYou will be able to keep in touch with the Scotland-wide and UK picture via our live election page which you can also use to watch BBC One Scotland and listen to Radio Scotland.\n\nThere will be video and audio clips, picture galleries, blogs, analysis and news stories - from your area.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

This year's General Election is expected to end with a historic victory for Labour with talk of Sir Keir Starmer leading his party to a super-majority.\n\nHuge losses have also been cited as the likely outcome for the Conservatives. Some polls have predicted Rishi Sunak's party could come away with less than 100 seats.\n\nChanges are also afoot in Leicester and Leicestershire. A number of our 2019 MPs could lose their seats this time around and we also have a brand new constituency in the mix which will get its first MP tomorrow night.\n\nREAD MORE: Leicester and Leicestershire General Election candidates tell you why they believe they deserve your vote\n\nBut before the results can be announced, however, you need to cast your vote. We have pulled together a breakdown of everything you need to know for polling day.\n\nWhen and where do I vote?\n\nPolls open at 7am tomorrow morning, Thursday, July 4, and close at 10pm. If you have opted to vote in person, you should have received a polling card in the post which will include the address of the polling station where you need to cast your vote.\n\nWhat do I need to take?\n\nPhoto ID is now required for you to vote in an election. Accepted forms of ID include passports and drivers licences. You can use:\n\nPassport\n\nDriving or provisional license\n\nBlue badge\n\nSome concessionary travel cards\n\nIdentity card with PASS mark (Proof of Age Standards Scheme)\n\nBiometric immigration document\n\nDefence identity card\n\nSome national identity cards\n\nFree Government Voter Authority Certificate\n\nYou can use your ID even if it is out of date, so long as the picture is recognisably you. The name on your ID should be the same name as you used to register to vote.\n\nYour polling card can speed up the process for you, but taking it is not a requirement when it comes to voting. Polling clerks will have a list of people who can vote and will be able to look up your name.\n\nWhen you're in the polling station, you will be given a ballot paper and you will find a pen or pencil in the voting booth, so you don't need to take those with you.\n\nDo I need to remove face coverings to vote?\n\nIf you wear face coverings for religious, personal or medical reasons, you may be asked to briefly remove it so the polling clerks can check your ID. At last year's local elections, the city council provided privacy screens for this purpose and women wearing veils can ask for a female clerk to assist them.\n\nHow do I vote?\n\nWhen you arrive, the polling clerk will ask for your ID and then will check your name off on the list of people who are able to vote in this election. They will give you your ballot and direct you towards an empty booth.\n\nYour ballot paper will list the names of everyone standing in your constituency and which party they represent. Choose the candidate you wish to support by putting an X in the box by their name.\n\nDon't worry if you make a mistake, you can ask for a fresh ballot sheet. Once you are happy with your choice, fold your slip and pop it in the ballot box provided. And that's you done.\n\nWho can I vote for?\n\nIn UK elections, you vote for one candidate standing in your local area. While many use this as an endorsement of the party they feel most represents their values, you are not voting specifically for the party itself or its leader - so you won't see Rishi or Sir Keir's name on your ballot slip.\n\nYou can find a full list of candidates standing in your constituency here. Over recent weeks, LeicestershireLive has given each of our parliamentary hopefuls the chance to tell you why they believe they deserve your backing. You can find out what they had to say here.\n\nFor voters in Leicester East, don't forget about the LeicestershireLive and Local Democracy Reporting Service Hustings which took place earlier this week. We grilled six of the candidates from the constituency on the NHS, economy, immigration, housing and crime. You can find the hustings here.\n\nHow do I know my constituency?\n\nFor some, boundaries will have changed for this year's election - and Leicestershire has a brand new voting area. You can find your constituency name on your polling card and we have a full breakdown of the changes for you here.\n\nWhat is voter fraud?\n\nIt is illegal for anyone to influence another to vote against their will. This can include pressuring them into voting a certain way, offering them something in exchange for their vote, pretending to be them at a polling station, and filling in a postal vote for them. You can report electoral fraud to Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or at crimestoppers-uk.org\n\nWhen will we find out the results?\n\nPolls close at 10pm and then the counts start. In Leicestershire, we are expecting results to start coming in from around 2am. We will have reporters on the ground at counts in the city and across the county from around 9:30pm. You will be able to follow all the action, breaking news and election night drama on our live blog which will be published on the LeicestershireLive homepage.", "source": {"uri":

You can go home to get your ID and try again - as long as you arrive at the polling station before 10pm.\n\nAll postal votes must also be returned by 10pm - so if you forgot to send yours back in the post, you can turn up to your local polling station and hand it in to the staff there. Make sure you hand it over in person rather than putting it through the letterbox, as it will not be accepted.\n\nWhat happens if I'm still in the queue outside at 10pm?\n\nIf you're still waiting to vote when the clock ticks over to 10pm, you should still be allowed to vote - provided you were in the polling station, or in the queue to get inside, before 10pm.\n\nThe law was changed to allow queuers to vote after the 2010 general election ended in chaos, with scores of people still waiting in line when the polls closed. They were all turned away, sparking outrage from those left without the ability to cast their vote.\n\nThe Electoral Commission held an immediate review of the problems experienced by those turned away, and recommended the law be changed to allow people still queuing at polling stations at 10pm to vote. Legislation was duly brought in to amend the rules around the cut-off time.\n\nWhat time is the exit poll?\n\nThe exit poll comes out at 10pm, with samples taken throughout the day from a select number of polling stations across the country.\n\nThe current model is the brainchild of Professor John Curtice and statisician David Firth, who first introduced it in 2005. It is considered highly accurate because the methodology involves asking voters leaving the polling station to fill out a mock ballot paper based on the real one they just completed.\n\nThe exit poll is also unique in that it does not ask any follow-up questions, simply who the voter cast their ballot for. Teams stationed at scores of polling stations across the country then aim to get a detailed picture about the electorate and how it voted in particular areas.\n\nAnd if you want to know what time your consituency will be declaring its new MP, have a read of our election results timeline in full.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emmeline_saunders@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Emmeline Saunders", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polling_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Polling station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_United_Kingdom_general_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "2010 United Kingdom general election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_United_Kingdom_general_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2017 United Kingdom general election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exit poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postal_voting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Postal voting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Curtice", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Curtice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salad_Fingers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Salad Fingers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_Commission_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ballot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article29672006.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_UK-General-Election-Polling-Day-London.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9703414", "eventUri": "eng-9703414", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 261, "textEnd": 267, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

There's usually one person in charge who is called the Presiding Officer, and a few other people called Poll Clerks.\n\ntell the staff your name and address so they can check that you're on the electoral register. They will ask to see your photo ID. The staff will cross your name off their list so they know who has voted, and hand you your ballot paper. A ballot paper is a list of your voting options on which you mark your decision take your ballot paper into a polling booth. These are private areas designed so that no one else can see who you vote for. Make sure you give people plenty of space, so everyone can cast their vote in secret mark 'X' next who you want to vote for on the ballot paper. You might be asked to vote for more than one person. Take your time to read everything. There will be instructions on the ballot paper and on posters in the polling station fold your ballot paper and put it in the ballot box. This is a large, clearly labelled box in the polling station leave the polling station - that's it, you've cast your vote\n\nAt the end of the day, the ballot box will be taken away for the votes to be counted. Your vote will be kept safe and will always stay secret.\n\nThings to remember you might be voting in different elections on the same day. For example, there might be council elections and a UK Parliament election in your area on the same day. If this is the case, you'll be given more than one ballot paper. Different elections work in different ways so it's important that you understand how to fill in your ballot paper correctly. All ballot papers include clear instructions if you make a mistake and need a new ballot paper, don't worry - just speak to the staff and they can give you a new ballot paper, as long as you haven't already put one in the ballot box don't write anything else on your ballot paper, or your vote may not be counted there will be a pencil in the polling booth, but you can use your own pen or pencil if you prefer taking photos inside a polling station is not allowed as you may accidentally reveal how you or someone else has voted. You can take as many photos and videos as you like outside the polling station and share these on social media.

Owner Mike Birtwistle, 46, took his cavalier King Charles spaniel to the polling station at Alexandra Park Library in north London at around 7.05am.\n\nReggie was \"very excited\" to head to the polling station, according to Birtwistle.\n\nHe said if Reggie could share a message with people to encourage them to vote, he would say: \"As well as being able to exercise your democratic right, there's every chance you might meet a very nice dog at the polling station too, so it's a double win to get yourself down to the polling station to vote.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Helen Montague took her dog Heston, who she said is her \"best friend\", with her to vote at Marden polling station in Kent at 7am on the dot.\n\n\"Heston wanted to be the first dog at the polling station and he was,\" she

required to show photographic ID before receiving their ballot papers, following a law change in 2022.\n\nWhile voters must adhere to this new requirement, their adorable canine companions don't have to worry about bringing their credentials yet as they won't be casting votes.\n\nAn exit poll, published shortly after polls close at 10pm on Thursday, will provide the first indication of how the election has gone on a national level.\n\nThese take place at polling stations across the country, with tens of thousands of people asked to privately fill in a replica ballot as they leave, to get an indication of how they voted.\n\nThe first of the 650 seats are likely to declare their results from 11.30pm.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, prime minister Rishi Sunak, who has insisted the results are not a foregone conclusion despite dire poll ratings for his party, voted in his Richmond constituency.\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer was also joined by his wife, Victoria, as he visited a polling station in his Holborn and St Pancras constituency.\n\nOther party leaders have also cast their votes, with Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey and his wife Emily visiting a polling station in Surbiton.\n\nScotland's first minister John Swinney was joined by his son Matthew as he cast his ballot at Burrelton Village Hall, Perth and Kinross.\n\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar cast his

Councils do their best to keep schools open and look for alternative venues if they can.\n\nAffected schools will have been in touch in advance with parents and carers if they are having to close.\n\nChildren are allowed in the polling booth if you need to look after them that day, just make sure they don't mark the ballot paper.\n\nAll British citizens, qualifying Commonwealth citizens and Republic of Ireland citizens with a UK address can vote as long as they are 18 or above.\n\nSince May last year, voters have to show a valid form of photo ID at polling stations. There are 22 acceptable forms of ID, including passports, driving licences, older or disabled person's bus pass and Oyster 60+ cards.\n\nPeople go into their local polling station, show their ID and give their name and address to officers working inside.

Forty thousands polling stations are open across the UK and over 150,000 staff will work to make sure everything runs smoothly - from checking voters' ID and registration, guiding them on how and where to vote, and of course counting the results.\n\nOne woman named Ellie, who lives in Newcastle, previously counted votes in the general election and has shared what it is really like. The young woman, who has 13,500 TikTok followers and works day-to-day as a hairstylist, says she was able to earn around \u00a3300 from counting votes in Lincolnshire in 2017 - when the election resulted in a hung parliament.\n\nShe explained her experience in a TikTok video via her account @elliemoyses21. and said: \"You start at 10/half 10 and you work through the night and you don't have a time to be finished, but you are on an hourly wage - and it's a really good hourly wage. I remember it being like \u00a315 or \u00a318 an hour in 2017. You get paid like two months later by the council.\n\n\"It was so much fun. I was like 20 years old, at uni, and it's a great way to earn some extra money. I was paid to count the votes. You are sat there and there is somebody watching you and other people count the votes.\"\n\nLaying out how election days run for staff members this , the Electoral Commission says: \"You'll start your day around 6am, making sure the polling station is set up before polls open at 7am. As voters arrive, you'll be issuing ballot papers and marking registers.\n\n\"You'll talk to voters as they arrive and make sure they know what to do. You'll also be the first point of contact for someone who needs help. Most of the time you'll be at a desk helping voters from across your community. The role has a real community feel to it and you'll get to speak to and help lots of people from your local area.\n\n\"Usually, you'll be working until 11pm. raining is provided in the weeks before the election.\"\n\nBut viral polling station worker Ellie said she was surprised by what she found on some of the voting slips - and it results in a huge error. Polling staff instruct people to put a cross with a pencil in one box to mark their voting decision. \"Nothing else, no words, no names, no propaganda, nothing,\" Ellie said.\n\n\"The amount of incompetent people that wrote on their form stuff that they weren't meant to write,\" she confessed. She added that people wrote swear words, referenced the party they were voting for, or wrote a specific message for a candidate.\n\nShe continued: \"My point of the story is that if you think you're funny and clever by writing something like that on the box after you have gone out of your way to go to a polling station to vote, you are so stupid and such an idiot because you've wasted your time because that vote doesn't count.\"\n\nOne individual pointed out that some people choose to do a protest vote on purpose. They said: \"I get your point but it is fully the definition of a protest vote. Ultimately you still get counted in the turnout and also in the number of spoiled ballots.\"\n\nOne other said: \"Some people see it as a vote as it tells the candidates that a large majority chose to spoil due to no confidence in any party.\"\n\nAnyone can apply for a role at a polling station if they are 18 or over. You don't need specific qualifications but you must have the right to work in the UK, have a good standard of English, and not have worked for a candidate standing in the election. Ahead of a general election, opportunities for roles are listed on your local council's website.\n\nHave you ever worked at a polling station?

of surprising places that have been made into makeshift polling stations this week.\n\nHere MailOnline shows you a glimpse of some of the most unusual, and who knows, maybe yours is on the list!\n\nJackie and Alan Ward sit at their polling station caravan, which even features an expandable tent section, in Whitehall Gardens\n\nPeople walk outside a shipping container that has been made

Scottish Green candidate Draeyk van der Horn went round a few polling stations in the Moray West, Nairn and Strathspey constituency this morning and every single one reported having had to turn away someone who did not have ID.\n\nREAD MORE: Lesley Riddoch: The stakes are far too high to vote anything but SNP in this election\n\nGone are the days where you could just rock up, say your name, do your bit for democracy and then get on with your day. You now have to bring a passport, driver's licence or some other form of acceptable ID with you in order to vote and if you don't have it, you'll have to go and get it and come back later.\n\nWe don't yet know how many people have been turned away from polling stations because of not having ID, but this data is collected and will be made public. We'll be sure to share it with you when it is available.\n\nIt's a controversial rule, especially given personation - or stealing someone's vote - is very rare in the UK.\n\nOver the past five years, according to the Electoral Commission, there has been no evidence of large-scale electoral fraud. Of the 1462 cases of alleged fraud reported to police between 2019 and 2023, just 11 led to convictions and the police issued four cautions.\n\nLast year, Jacob Rees-Mogg suggested the Tories introduced the policy to boost their election chances but it came \"back to bite them\" and they had \"upset a system that worked perfectly well\".\n\nREAD MORE: Scottish party leaders make final General Election pitches\n\nBut, however annoying it is, it's a rule we're going to need to live with for now. So if you are going to be voting over the next few hours, please do remember to take ID with you and check what is acceptable here.\n\nThankfully, in Scotland, it's not going to be something we have to deal with at every election, as ID is not required to vote at Holyrood or council elections.\n\nAnd if we become independent one day, we'll get away from these ridiculous Westminster rules that attempt to deny our right to vote.", "source": {"uri": "thenational.scot", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polling_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Polling station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byline_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Byline Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postal_voting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Postal voting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disfranchisement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disfranchisement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesley_Riddoch", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lesley Riddoch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_constituencies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom constituencies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moray", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moray"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moray"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nairn", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nairn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nairn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Rees-Mogg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jacob Rees-Mogg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_Commission_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffrage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suffrage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Westminster"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Westminster"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.thenational.scot/resources/images/18261346/", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9703414", "eventUri": "eng-9703414", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

But while you're doing that, you can't be chatting about who you're going to vote for.\n\nThis isn't allowed inside or in the immediate area around the polling station as it could influence other people's decision.\n\nIf staff hear you having these kinds of conversations, they'll ask you to put a stop to it.\n\nWhile this feels pretty naughty, you are technically allowed to spoil your vote - it's just a bit of a waste.\n\nIf you're annoyed with the choice of candidates and parties, you might choose to express this by 'spoiling' the vote by drawing on the ballot paper or not voting for anyone on it.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nRISHI SUNAK'S AWKWARD LOOK AT BRITAIN'S MOST TATTOOED WOMAN\n\nWHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT VOTING\n\nHowever, you need to be careful of accidentally spoiling it.

You shouldn't be taking any photos while in the polling station as it is against the law to share how someone has voted, is about to vote or the ID number on the ballot paper.\n\nIf you break this law, you could end up with up to \u00a35k in a fine or even six months in prison.\n\nAnd if you're desperate to tell people you've voted with a selfie, do that outside the station, lads.\n\nOK, so it's not illegal to go and vote in the election while you're drunk or tipsy.\n\nBut if staff reckon you've been drinking or taken drugs, they might ask some questions.\n\nAnd if they're unhappy with what you say, they might effectively KB you until you've sobered up.\n\nSave those Genny Lec drinks until after you've crossed the box.

Polling Stations Open as Voters Choose Next MPs", "body": "Votes are now being cast to select the members of the next House of Commons, the British legislating chamber which will determine the next government and next Prime Minister.\n\nPolling stations opened at 0700 (0200 EST) this morning and will close at 2200 (1700 EST) Thursday evening. The election was called by the Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, on May 22nd. The sudden announcement and short campaign confounded expectations, with watchers broadly believing Sunak would push the date back as far as possible, which could have gone as late as January 2025.\n\nPollster Ipsos has interviewers at stations across the country asking members of the public to voluntarily reveal how they voted as they leave. Based on this data, the pollster is able to produce a relatively clear picture of how the country has voted that is published immediately after polls close.\n\nThis has been accurate in the past, and has been produced for every General Election since 1997. But while it gives a picture of the overall national swing, the seat-specific answers and knowing which parties have taken where will only emerge through the early hours of Friday morning as counts are announced.\n\nBritish and Irish citizens resident in the United Kingdom or registered while living abroad who are aged over 18 are eligible to vote, but in many cases immigrants are also to vote even if they don't have citizenship if they originated from the Commonwealth of former British Empire states.\n\nSince last year, it has been the law that voters must show legal identification in order to vote in person. For many, this may be the first election they've voted in where identification to reduce the risk of voter fraud is required. The Electoral Commission, the government body which regulates elections, says there are 22 acceptable forms of identity running the full gamut from a passport, driving licence, retirees' bus pass, and military identity card. For those with none of those things, there is also a free voter ID card, but these would need to have been applied for in advance.\n\nGiven the nature of the secret ballot, it is even possible to vote anonymously under the new voter ID system. Concerned citizens jealous of their privacy have the right to apply for a Anonymous Elector's Document, which features only a photograph of the bearer and an anonymised string of numbers and letters, identifying them as being eligible to receive a ballot paper from the polling station.\n\nUnder United Kingdom law, reporting on the election is severely restricted while the polling places are open. Broadcasters can't discuss the anticipated outcome or publish polling, as the regulator states: \"Discussion and analysis of election and referendum issues must finish when the poll opens... Broadcasters may not publish the results of any opinion poll on polling day itself\". The punishment for breaking these rules can include include imprisonment for news editors.\n\nWhen these rules were last changed, it was considered whether it would be appropriate to ban publishing opinion polling not just on election day itself, but in the days leading up to the vote itself. This, it was said, would give voters more time to make up their own minds, rather than simply being told how other people would vote constantly. This proposal was eventually dropped.\n\nCandidates and party leaders can make speeches to supporters today, and indeed the country will be alive with political activists 'getting out the vote'. But these events cannot be broadcast.\n\nThe candidates are not invisible, however. The party leaders arriving at their local polling places to vote have traditionally done so without wearing a coloured party rosette, and images of this happening are generally widely broadcast.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "oliver_jj_lane@breitbart.com", "name": "Oliver Jj Lane", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polling_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Polling station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipsos", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ipsos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "House of Commons of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "British Empire"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_nationality_law", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Irish nationality law"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_Commission_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_document", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Identity document"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commonwealth of Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driver's_license", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Driver's license"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Passport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Citizenship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_ballot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secret ballot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ballot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/07/GettyImages-2159885122-e1720079470349.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9703414", "eventUri": "eng-9703414", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-22", "textStart": 347, "textEnd": 355}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

stations opened around the country at 7am.\n\nYou should have been sent a poll card if you are registered to vote in person (and not via postal vote) This will tell you where your polling station is to go and vote.\n\nCheck where the station is as it may be in a different location from where you voted last time.\n\nAlso, be sure to bring a valid form of ID -- a new rule for all voting in 2024.\n\nYou do not need to take your poll card but it can help election agents identify you.\n\nThe exact timings of declarations for each of the 75 constituencies across the city are always fluid but will likely be heard from 11.30pm.\n\nIt is possible that by 4am enough seats will have been counted across the country to see clearly if the Conservative Party has hung on. -- or if another party has usurped them from power.\n\nThe final London seats to be declared are set to be at around 6am in Croydon.\n\nThe full results will likely not be known until mid-morning on Friday -- and that's if

A picture or copy of ID will not be accepted.\n\nThe name on the ID must also match your name on the electoral register. If not, you must bring a document with you that proves you have changed your name such as a marriage certificate.\n\nTo vote in the general election, you must be registered to vote, be 18 or over on the day of the election, be a British, Irish or qualifying Commonwealth citizen, be a resident at an address in the UK or living abroad and registered as an overseas voter and not be legally excluded from voting.\n\nHow does my vote decide who becomes my Member of Parliament and Prime Minister?\n\nThe UK General Election uses the 'first past the post' system, meaning you can vote once for a parliamentary candidate in your area.\n\nVotes are then counted and the candidate with the most votes becomes your Member of Parliament and takes a seat in the House of Commons.\n\nThe party with the overall majority of seats, meaning more than 326, will win the election.\n\nThe King will then ask the leader of the majority party to form a government and they will be appointed as Prime Minister.\n\nWhen will I know the results?\n\nBallots will be counted overnight into Friday, July 5.\n\nAll results are expected to be in by 6.30am on Friday, with Brighton Kemptown and Peacehaven expected at 3.45am, Brighton Pavilion at 4.30am and Hove and Portslade at 4.45am.", "source": {"uri": "theargus.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Argus"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

But 2024 will be the first year they are in place for a general election, after Rishi Sunak announced a snap election on July 4 at the end of May.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about voter ID ahead of upcoming general election:\n\nThere are many different forms of ID that will be accepted at the polling station. It must be photographic ID - meaning a bank card is not valid, for instance.\n\nAccepted forms of ID include:\n\nYou can use an out-of-date photo ID provided it still looks like you. A full list of accepted forms of ID can be found on the Electoral Commission website.\n\nIf you do not have any of the accepted forms of photo ID, you are able to apply for a Voter Authority Certificate. It's free to apply for, and will be accepted at the polling station when you want to vote.\n\nYou can apply for a Voter Authority Certificate on the Electoral Commission website. It is free and they do not expire, although it is recommended you reapply every 10 years to ensure your likeness remains similar to the ID.\n\nIf you don't bring an accepted form of photo ID to the polling station, you will be turned away.\n\nThe government sought to pass the new voter ID laws to crack down on election fraud, specifically 'personation'. This is a criminal offence, where a person votes at an election pretending to be someone they're not.\n\nWriting after they were passed, then-levelling up minister Kemi Badenoch said the new law \"means we can eliminate election fraud and make elections more inclusive, ensuring that everyone eligible to vote will continue to have the opportunity to do so.\"\n\nHowever, critics of the voter ID rules have pointed out that cases of electoral fraud are rare in the UK, and personation even more so. Latest data from the Electoral Commission shows that, between 2018 and 2022, only 11 of the 1,386 alleged cases of electoral fraud resulted in convictions.\n\nThere are also concerns that voter ID laws can disproportionately affect marginalised communities' ability to vote.\n\nIn 2021, government-commissioned research found that those with limiting disabilities, the unemployed, people without qualifications, and those who had never voted before were among the least likely to hold a valid form of photo ID.\n\nFurther research presented to the House of Commons found that the changes may result in 1.1 million fewer people voting in the next general election.\n\n\"As there is no justification for this threat to the right to vote, it feels like an opportunistic attack on the rights of some of the most marginalised people in society,\" said a spokesperson for the Liberty human rights advocacy group in 2021.\n\n\"A classic example of ruling through division and distrust.\"\n\nThe government's choice to accept forms of local travel photo ID for older people, but not younger people, has also come under scrutiny. Neither the 16-25 or 26-30 railcard are accepted.\n\nLabour MP Nadia Whittome said: \"The new voter ID requirement will stop many young people from voting - and it seems that is by design, not by accident.\n\n\"The government has given older voters, who are more likely to vote Conservative, a large range of acceptable forms of ID, while providing very few options for young people.\n\nLevelling up minister Dehenna Davison has defended the decision, saying: \"Young person's railcards are generally offered in both digital and hard copy formats.\n\n\"The government did not specifically include digital format documents for the roll-out of the policy, in order to support its effective delivery.\"", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"},

(AP) \u2014 President Joe Biden\u2019s unsteady debate performance reverberated among candidates up and down the November ballot on Friday, but nervous Democratic candidates mostly kept their discomfort to themselves or downplayed it, even as gleeful Republicans looked to seize the opening. Wisconsin\u2019s Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who is facing a tough reelection bid against a Trump-endorsed Republican, distanced herself from Biden and did not answer questions Friday about the debate or calls for him to be replaced at the top of the ticket. \u201cTammy Baldwin is running her own race for the people of Wisconsin,\u201d said her campaign spokesman, Andrew Mamo, who later added: \u201cTammy supports the president.\u201d With control of both chambers of Congress hanging in the balance in November and Democrats defending far more Senate seats than Republicans, both parties understand the stakes. \u201cIt was a bad night for the president. I don\u2019t think he did well in that debate. But I am confident the President and our party can turn it around,\u201d said California Rep. Ro Khanna, a surrogate for the Biden campaign. \u201cAnd the top of the ticket is very important for down-ballot races, especially in swing districts.\u201d The Republican Senate campaign arm, meanwhile, looked to seize the moment, releasing a new ad Friday that linked Democrats to Biden\u2019s debate performance. The video featured battleground Senate candidates like Baldwin, Michigan\u2019s Elissa Slotkin, Ohio\u2019s Sherrod Brown, and Montana\u2019s Jon Tester defending Biden, interspersed with clips from his debate performance. \u201cSenate Democrats have spent years propping up Joe Biden despite his obvious mental deficiencies, now the world can see he isn\u2019t fit for the job. This disaster is on their hands,\u201d said Philip Letsou, spokesperson for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Democrats in Michigan have enjoyed recent success but are defending an open Senate seat and face several tight congressional contests. \u201cThe debate performance matters, just like everything else that happens at the top of the ticket matters to people who are running for down-ballot offices,\u201d said Adrian Hemond, a Democratic strategist in Michigan. In Maryland, where Democrat Angela Alsobrooks faces a tough race against former Republican Gov. Larry Hogan for an open U.S. Senate seat, Gov. Wes Moore remained positive about her candidacy in a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans 2-1. \u201cWhat\u2019s clear to Marylanders is that Angela Alsobrooks has a vision for the future that affirms our freedoms. Abortion rights, economic opportunity, combating gun violence \u2014 those are the issues Angela will champion in the Senate,\u201d Moore said in a statement. \u201cShe will be the 51st vote in the U.S. Senate and protect our Democratic majority.\u201d In Pennsylvania, some top Democrats moved to defend Biden, while Democratic U.S. Sen. Bob Casey, who is defending his seat in November, remained quiet. Gov. Josh Shapiro acknowledged that Biden had a bad debate, but said it doesn\u2019t change the fact that Trump was a bad president. Democrats, including Biden, need to be crisper in delivering that message, Shapiro told CNN. \u201cI would say to all those folks who are out there worrying right now, \u2018start working and stop worrying,\u2019\u201d Shapiro said. Meanwhile, Sen. John Fetterman \u2014 who won his seat after weathering a difficult debate in 2022 while dealing with the effects of a stroke months earlier \u2014 responded on social media, telling Democrats in profane terms to chill out. \u201cI refuse to join the Democratic vultures on Biden\u2019s shoulder after the debate,\u201d Fetterman said. \u201cNo one knows more than me that a rough debate is not the sum total of the person and their record.\u201d The campaign of Casey\u2019s opponent, Republican David McCormick, accused Casey of lying about Biden\u2019s fitness to be president. McCormick suggested that Biden\u2019s Cabinet should consider forcing him out of office, using the 25th Amendment. \u201cIf what we saw last night is reflective of what he is like day to day, when they\u2019re sitting with him talking about how to deal Iran, the possibility of Iran has a nuclear weapon, attacking U.S. troops in Syria \u2026 if you\u2019re the secretary of defense or attorney general or secretary of state, you have a responsibility to say \u2018hey, wait a second, this guy is not up to the job,\u2019\u201d McCormick told KDKA radio in Pittsburgh. Down-ballot Democrats have exceeded expectations in swing states in recent years, especially when running on issues such as abortion. A red wave that was predicted in the 2022 midterms never materialized as Democrats celebrated a voting majority in the Senate, key victories in governors\u2019 races, and a near miss for control of the House. \u201cI believe what\u2019s most important back home is they just want to know that we\u2019re fighting for them,\u201d said Rep. Don Davis, a North Carolina Democrat. Rep. Greg Landsman, a Democrat who is running for reelection after taking his Ohio district from a Republican in 2022, said his takeaway from the debate was, \u201cI better do my job as well as humanly possible.\u201d He said he is still trying to decide how vigorously to support Biden and would take the measure of his constituents. \u201cYou get out, spend the weekend, hear from folks and go from there,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has always been incredibly grounding.\u201d Meanwhile, House Republicans in difficult reelection campaigns were mostly heartened by Trump\u2019s debate demeanor. They said voters\u2019 attention would now be on Biden\u2019s age as well as the policy records of the candidates. \u201cI think the American people saw from President Trump what they know about President Trump. Nothing last night surprised them,\u201d said Rep. Marc Molinaro, who represents a New York district where Biden drew more support in 2020. \u201cI think the American people saw with President Biden\u2019s performance something they didn\u2019t necessarily want to acknowledge.\u201d Molinaro said Trump\u2019s ability to draw voters who may not vote otherwise could help him. Another Republican running for reelection in a district Biden previously carried, Rep. Juan Ciscomani of Arizona, said he was ready to back Trump. \u201cThe president \u2014 the top of the ticket \u2014 sets the tone a lot of ways,\u201d Cisomani said. \u201cThis just shows Trump\u2019s strength in this, his ability to communicate the issues, his record as well.\u201d One candidate on the ballot made no effort to distance himself from Biden. In fact, he appeared with him at his post-debate rally in North Carolina. Democratic gubernatorial candidate Josh Stein was met by roaring applause as he walked onstage at Biden\u2019s rally. Chants of \u201cJosh!\u201d echoed through the crowd as he delivered his speech. At the first mention of his Republican opponent, Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, the audience erupted in boos. Stein said Robinson\u2019s vision for the state is \u201cone of division and hate.\u201d The challenge of the campaign, he said, just means North Carolinians need to show up in November. \u201cWe will keep the White House and we will build a state and country that is safe and prosperous for everyone.\u201d ___ Associated Press writers Scott Bauer in Madison, Wis.; Makiya Seminera in Raleigh, N.C.; Marc Levy in Harrisburg, Pa.; Brian Witte in Annapolis, Md.; Lea Skene in Baltimore; and Stephen Groves in Washington contributed.", "summary": "<a href=\"https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2JpZGVuLWRlbW9jcmF0cy1ob3VzZS1zZW5hdGUtZjI1OTU2NGVmODA0NDEwMTAwYzFhNmIwOTU4N2FlYzPSAQA?oc=5\" target=\"_blank\">Biden's debate performance leaves down-ballot Democrats anxious \u2014 and quiet</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">The Associated Press</font>", "url": "https://apnews.com/article/biden-democrats-house-senate-f259564ef804410100c1a6b09587aec3", "image": "https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/57049c9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5288x2975+0+275/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F5b%2F0c%2Fd147d0440f244cfacda91c9296e7%2F3dd6f447a796473c85fda7c6b56f1834", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 01:14:24", "author": "Joey Cappelletti", "authors": ["Joey Cappelletti"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.099}

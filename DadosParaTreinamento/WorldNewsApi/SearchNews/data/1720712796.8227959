We need family and faith, hope and strength \u2014 that's what these stories are all about.\" Those are the words of SQuire Rushnell and Louise DuArt, co-founders of the Godwinks brands and based in Massachusetts, who shared the following story with Fox News Digital. The couple specialize in what they call \"Godwinks\" stories \u2014 and believe that the Lord works in mysterious ways.

Nurtured by prayer & persistence The Brookwood Community for Adults with Special Needs lies on 485 idyllic acres, a half-hour west of Houston, near the village of Brookshire, Texas. Educators have traveled from all over the globe to learn how Brookwood has become a model of success. From a low-altitude aircraft, one might mistake Brookwood for a small college campus. A chapel steeple rises from a gathering of charming brick buildings, connected by orderly walkways and rolling green lawns, to homes like those in gated residential areas. RHODE ISLAND POLICE OFFICER AND RESCUE PUP PAIR UP FOR RESCUE AND RENEWAL: \u2018CAN ACHIEVE GREAT THINGS\u2019 It may be difficult to imagine that the magnificent property of Brookwood Community grew from the seeds of tragedy \u2014 nurtured by the power of prayer and persistence. The Brookwood story began with its tall and straight-speaking founder, Yvonne Streit, the mother of a severely brain-damaged daughter, Vicki. Conventional wisdom told the mom that she'd better put her child away. As a child, she could neither speak nor move. Conventional wisdom told the mom that she'd better put her child away. But \"oh no, that was not for me,\" said Streit. She found experts who suggested that children with special needs could do many more things than people thought they could. And that, like everyone else, they \"needed to be needed\" and yearned to have a purpose. Subsequently, after months and years of patient training, Streit taught her daughter how to grasp, lift and release an object in order to feed herself. Years later, when Brookwood was started, the girl's simple skill allowed her to grasp a potted seedling plant, lift it into a tray \u2014 and release it. \u2018DOGWINKS\u2019 ARE MAN'S BEST FRIEND BRINGING THE DIVINE INTO OUR LIVES WITH \u2018GODWINKS\u2019 To this day, Vicki Streit reportedly has repeated that process with over 15,000 plants in Brookwood\u2019s horticultural enterprise. So she's significantly contributed to one of the largest annual crops of Christmas poinsettias in the state of Texas. Like so many things in life that people start out to do \u2014 it often takes a good number of Godwinks to get there. Yvonne Streit recalled that when her daughter approached the age of 18, it became clear to her that while many places were teaching special needs children, very few facilities were providing life-skills training for special needs adults. That gave birth to Yvonne Streit\u2019s dream of starting a place called Brookwood. FOR MOTHER'S DAY, A VIRGINA MOM'S STUNNING DISCOVERY REMINDS HER OF GOD'S LOVING PRESENCE Yet, like so many things in life that people start out to do, it often takes a good number of \"Godwinks\" to get there. Carefully articulated plan An undertaking like that needed to begin with a carefully articulated plan. To create the blueprint for Brookwood Community, Yvonne Streit appeared before Rotary clubs, churches, and chambers of commerce \u2014 explaining to anyone standing still that she needed seed money for the necessary travel and study. One night, her husband, Dave Streit, looked at his wife. Seeing the disappointment on her face, he asked how it went at Rotary that day. She shook her head and sighed. \"One more speech with no takers.\" In her bedtime prayers, she choked back tears, she said later. \"God, I know you placed this desire on my heart. And I was sure you had given me the \u2018Go\u2019 sign. But, did I misunderstand you?\" she prayed. \"Because I\u2019m ready to throw in the towel.\" A man was standing there with an envelope. He said, \"Here\u2019s $10,000 for you to study the idea of Brookwood.\" The next morning, she got up and put on the face that many put on sometimes. On the outside, it signals to the world, \"I\u2019m good\" \u2014 but it's really hiding feelings of sadness, worry or fear that exist on the inside.

He said, \"Here\u2019s $10,000 for you to study the idea of Brookwood.\" She was flabbergasted. Then a few minutes later, her assistant said someone had just called and was \"sending over a check for $7,500.\" What? Then, at 10 o\u2019clock, St Luke\u2019s Church phoned. The church was sending a check for $25,000 \"to study Brookwood.\" And at 11 a.m., the Barrow Foundation called: \"We\u2019re sending you $30,000.\" CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER Streit couldn\u2019t believe it. She now felt a string of hope, all stemming from her heartfelt prayers of the night before. It was $72,500 worth of Godwinks \u2014 and definitely giving her the \"Go\" sign.

For the past 17 years, Shudde, with a degree in special education, has overseen an impressive expansion of the Brookwood campus, developed a succession plan and secured the evolution of the Brookwood Community philosophy long into the future. \"Our vision is to change the way the world thinks about adults with disabilities,\" the community's website notes.

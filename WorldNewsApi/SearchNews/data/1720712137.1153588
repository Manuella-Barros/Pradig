Michael, who has died at the age of 67, vanished while holidaying on the idyllic Greek island of Symi with his wife and fellow doctor, Dr Clare Bailey. Friends last saw him alive at Agios Nikolaos beach on Wednesday, June 5, before he headed out on a walk amid extreme weather warnings. Tragically, the presenter's body has now been discovered, reportedly beneath a fence that runs around a bar on Agia Marina beach - an area surrounded by craggy terrain. Those who have followed Michael's career over the years will no doubt feel his loss keenly, having been inspired by his infectious enthusiasm for health science and admirable determination to live the best life possible. What is less known however is Michael's very personal reasons for pursuing his chosen path, with a terrible bereavement of his own changing his perspective forever. During an interview with The Guardian in 2016, Michael opened up candidly about his family's medical history, revealing that none of his male relatives had lived past the age of 72. His own father was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in his fifties and later died of complications relating to the disease, including early-onset dementia and heart failure. It was this bereavement that Michael said 'without a doubt' had inspired him to pursue his healthy way of living, while encouraging countless others to do the same. Michael told the publication: \"I suspect I'm a lot healthier than my dad was. I look a lot like he did when he was younger but because I've done all the self-experiments, I haven't followed the same path he did.\" Recalling his father's funeral, he continued: \"His friends said how much like him I was, so he was kind of a warning from history. I do think, on the whole, that genetics are not destiny and you can do something about it. But at medical school, we really learned nothing about nutrition. And that's quite weird. My son is at medical school now and he is learning effectively nothing about nutrition.\" Michael's dad had tried to do all the 'right' things, as far as he'd been able to, following a low-fat diet and taking medication recommended to him by his GP. Sadly, this wasn't enough to save him. In a heartbreaking admission made during a separate interview with SBS, Michael reflected: \"I do think that if I could go back in time and offer him better advice than he received then, he might still be with us now. \"I would advise him to start on a rapid weight loss diet\u2026 I would show him the research, and also advise that he eat a broadly Mediterranean-style diet, one which is rich in healthy fats, has lots of veg and is quite high in protein. I think he would find that much easier to stick to.\" In a scare that felt as though history was repeating itself, Michael was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in 2012, following a routine blood test. To make matters even more prophetic, he was around the same age his father was at the time of his diagnosis, which was linked to weight gain around his midsection. Michael recalled: \"When I got the diagnosis, it was a major shock \u2013 I had seen what it did to my father and I did not want to go down that road. It led me to make a science doc called Eat, Fast, Live Longer, which triggered my own interest in intermittent fasting and time-restricted eating, both of which are now widely practised worldwide and which are the subject of extensive research.\" Ultimately, Michael was able to reverse his type 2 diabetes through his now extremely popular intermittent fasting diet, which helped keep his weight down and his blood sugar at a normal level.

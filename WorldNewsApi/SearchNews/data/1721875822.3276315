Kritenbrink made the comments during a visit to Hanoi, amid rising tension between China and the Philippines in the South China Sea, where Vietnam is also a claimant.

China's foreign ministry disputed the Philippines' account, with a spokesperson saying on Thursday that the necessary measures taken were lawful, professional and beyond reproach.

China claims almost the entire South China Sea, a conduit for more than $3 trillion of annual shipborne commerce, including parts claimed by the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei. In 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague said China's claims had no legal basis, a decision Beijing has rejected. Kritenbrink arrived in Hanoi on Friday on the heels of a visit to Vietnam by Russian President Vladimir Putin that was sharply criticised by Washington. \"Only Vietnam can decide how best to safeguard its sovereignty and advance its interests,\" Kritenbrink said when asked about his view on Vietnam's foreign policy and its hosting of Putin. Vietnam and the U.S. officially upgraded their relationship to a comprehensive strategic partnership, Vietnam's highest tier of its diplomatic ranking, during a visit to Hanoi by President Joe Biden in September last year. Kritenbrink said upgrade was \"historic and momentous\", and said he wanted to maintain momentum to make sure that all of the agreements reached are implemented. \"We continue to believe that the U.S.-Vietnam partnership has never been stronger,\" he said.

I have been so many times to that place, so many times. It's like a main street with a lot of shops and people,\" Muguruza said.\n\n\"I was very surprised because you always hear what happened in Paris and in London, and you're, like, 'Shit.' But now, I've been so many times to this place, it's like my home. And I feel, like, 'Shit.'\n\n\"I've been there so many times. So it really shocked me. Really shocked me.\n\n\"I'm just sad for the people that were there. I feel like if you're in the wrong place at the wrong time, it can happen anywhere.\"\n\nOnce Muguruza learned of the attack, she called to make certain her family was unharmed.\n\n\"During the rain delay. I'm like OK, I was listening to music, I checked for news and stuff, and I'm like, 'Oh,'\" Muguruza said. \"I checked with my family. Everything is OK, but, you know, it's just incredible.\"\n\nEmotional shock\n\nMuguruza said she was able to set aside the emotional shock and return to finish her match, deadlocked 2-2 in the third set when the storm struck. She saved three match points before breaking in the 12th game, then led all the way in the tie-breaker.\n\n\"I'm used to putting so many things aside to be able to compete. That's my every day, putting things aside and going out there and have two hours of concentration of tennis,\" Muguruza said.\n\n\"I just make sure that people around me are fine. There is not a lot I can do anymore. Just support the people. Be with them. But at the end I've got to go play. And after, we can talk again. But I have to kind of block it for two hours.\"\n\nDavid Ferrer, who also advanced to the quarter-finals, tweeted after his match: \"All my solidarity with the people affected in the attack of Barcelona .. Very sad all that is happening.\"\n\nToda mi solidaridad a las personas afectadas en el atentado de Barcelona.. Muy triste todo lo que esta pasando.\n\n-- David Ferrer (@DavidFerrer87) August 17, 2017\n\nAnd Ramos-Vinolas tweeted ahead of his meeting with Nadal: \"Great pain when seeing what is happening in #Barcelona.

These values are stronger than this odious and cowardly terrorism,\" said Hidalgo.\n\n\"I also extend a message of solidarity to my friend (Barcelona Mayor) Ada Colau and all locals.

My thoughts are with all affected. We need unity now more than ever,\" said Wanngard.\n\nMeanwhile, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said through her spokesman Steffen Seibert that Germany was \"in deep mourning for the victims of the repulsive attack in Barcelona and on the side of Spaniards in solidarity and friendship.\"\n\nThe United Kingdom's prime minister Theresa May, said in a statement: \"My thoughts are with the victims of today's terrible attack in Barcelona and the emergency services responding to this ongoing incident.

A native of Spain, the Barcelona connection normally serves as a sense of pride for Fernandez, but it came with sadness on Thursday following the terrorist attack when a white van slammed into a crowd on Thursday and killed at least 13 people.\n\nThose in North Jersey kept the victims in their thoughts while remaining vigilant.\n\nThe New Jersey Office of Emergency Management posted on Twitter that the department is \"monitoring the events\" while also offering their members' thoughts and prayers for the victims, their families and the first responders. The Bergen County Sheriff's Office also noted that the Department of Homeland Security and police are \"on patrol 24/7\" to protect citizens.\n\nRELATED:Islamic State claims responsibility for Barcelona terror attack\n\nNEW JERSEY:Links to Nazis, the KKK and the Confederacy\n\nThe van injured at least 100 people when it hit the crowd at Las Ramblas tourist district in addition to the 13 people who died in the attack.Police said they were \"treating him as a terrorist.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately it is one of most visited areas in Barcelona,\" Fernandez said, \"so I'm sure you find a lot of tourists, lot of people walking around, sitting around in cafes, sitting and eating.\"\n\nFernandez still has family in Spain and friends in Barcelona but said they were OK following the attack. He grew up in the northwest area of the country but moved to the United States when he was 13.\n\n\"It's a beautiful city,\" he said of Barcelona, a place he visited several times.\n\nPresident Donald Trump posted that the United States condemns the terrorist attack in Barcelona \"and will do whatever is necessary to help.

In late December, a truck plowed into a Christmas market in Berlin, killing 12 people and wounding nearly 50 others.\n\n\"I don't know what to say.

The list by Spain's Civil Protection agency includes France, Germany, Italy, Venezuela, Australia, Ireland, Peru, Algeria, Belgium, Pakistan, Philippines, Hong Kong, Taiwan ...\n\nSpain has decreed three days of national mourning, and this morning, thousands of people gathered in Barcelona in the presence of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and King Philip IV to remember the dead and bear witness to their decision to fight terrorism and defeat fear.\n\nMeanwhile, expressions of condolence and sharing have poured in from around the world. In addition to the messages of Western leaders, and the mayors of London and Paris, cities that have also been affected by terrorism, Russian President Vladimir Putin wrote to the Spanish king calling on the world to unite in an \"uncompromising battle against the forces of terror\". \"We decisively condemn this cruel and cynical crime against civilians\".\n\nIn a message to King Philip IV, Chinese President Xi Jinping said he is shocked to learn of the high number of casualties. On behalf of the people of China and in his own name, Xi said he mourned the dead. \"China,\" he added, \"is firmly opposed to all forms of terrorism and stands ready to work with the international community, including Spain, to strengthen anti-terror cooperation so as to jointly safeguard regional and world peace and stability\".\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said \"Israel firmly condemns the terrorist attack in Barcelona,\" noting that \"This evening we have seen once again that terrorism strikes everywhere.

The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nA series of terrorist attacks in France in 2015 had a chilling effect on tourism in that country, the most-visited nation in the world. Paris and the \u00cele-de-France region that surrounds it received 1.5 million fewer visitors in 2016 compared with the previous year, according to France's Regional Tourism Committee. The drop cost the French economy $1.5 billion (\u20ac1.3 billion). After a truck slammed into crowds in Nice who were celebrating Bastille Day last year, many outdoor events throughout the country were canceled.\n\nTourism accounts account for about 18% of commercial revenue in Barcelona, one of the most visited cities in the world with 30 million visitors, according to the study by the RBD Consulting Group. The tourism industry employs about 26 000 people in Barcelona, according to the study's director, Roger Gaspa.\n\nTourists come to Barcelona to visit the Sagrada Familia, a basilica designed by the master architect Antonio Gaud\u00ed; Las Ramblas, Barcelona's most famous boulevard and site of the terrorist attack; and museums that feature the works of famed Spanish painters Pablo Picasso and Joan Mir\u00f3.\n\nBarcelona, which hosted the 1992 Summer Olympic Games, also is home to Barcelona FC, one of the most successful soccer teams in the sport and one of the most valuable sports clubs in the world.\n\nBarcelona might be a victim of its own success. Many residents view tourism as a threat to their quality of life and have complained of raucous behavior and the fact that the city can't accommodate the tourists who visit Barcelona annually. The city council passed a law banning the opening of hotels in the city center, even if other hotels close. There are 75,000 hotel beds in Barcelona and 50,000 in legal tourist apartments.\n\nFor Spain, which suffered a terrorist attack in Madrid in 2004, a renewed round of terrorist attacks raises the stakes for its thriving tourism industry, a bright spot in an otherwise lackluster economy. Tourism accounts for around 11% of its gross domestic product and employs one in eight people in the workforce, according to analysts Ernst and Young.\n\nThe number of tourists visiting Spain soared 10% in 2016, a fourth straight record year, with 75.3 million visitors. Britons again topped the list with 17 million visitors in 2016.\n\nI'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter\n\nterms and conditions\n\nBy John Harrington", "id": "9895846", "details": {},

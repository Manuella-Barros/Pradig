He insists on calling his ouster a \"firing\" and said he looks forward to facing his former team on Oct. 30 in Kansas City and New Year's Eve in Denver.\n\nWhen he arrived at training camp for his physical last month, Charles was told he had no medical restrictions, but Joseph said he would be cautious nevertheless and ease Charles into action with an eye toward having him fresh and fit come September.\n\n\"He's been injured for a year and a half, and it's our job to get Jamaal as healthy as he can be,\" Joseph said last month, noting, \"If he gets back to being Jamaal, we've got something special there.\"\n\nCharles' route-running and rushing abilities would add a spirited option for new offensive coordinator Mike McCoy no matter which quarterback, Trevor Siemian or Paxton Lynch, wins the starting job -- the only bigger question facing the Broncos this summer than Charles' health.\n\nTossing a wrench into the running back mix, however, is Devontae Booker , who was pushing for the starting job when he showed up at training camp with a sore wrist he'd hurt in OTAs only to learn he needed surgery on a broken bone. He's out until next month.\n\nThe Broncos responded by signing another veteran free agent, Steven Ridley, who has played for five teams in three seasons since leaving New England, where he rushed for 1,263 yards and 12 touchdowns in 2012.\n\nWith fellow veteran free agent Bernard Pierce sidelined by a hamstring injury most of camp, Ridley has carried a heavy workload in his bid to make the roster.\n\nHe's been sharing snaps with starter C.J. Anderson, veteran Juwan Thompson and impressive rookie De'Angelo Henderson, whose 41-yard touchdown run sealed Denver's 24-17 preseason win at Chicago on Thursday night.\n\nCharles said he's comfortable with his new team, confident in his knees and cool with his situation as he watches Anderson bounce back from his knee injury in 2016 and sees Ridley and Henderson impressing the coaching staff.\n\n\"If they go out there and look better than me, oh well, they're better than me,\" Charles said. \"My job every time I touch the field is just to try to outshine them, too.\"\n\nCharles piled up 9,717 yards from scrimmage with 63 touchdowns in nine seasons in Kansas City while amassing a 5.5-yard-per-carry average, best in NFL history.\n\nBut a career that looked as if it would land Charles in the Hall of Fame was derailed the past few years by injuries that cut short several seasons in his prime.\n\nHe played in just eight games over the past two seasons after tearing his right ACL in October 2015, leading the Chiefs to cut him this winter to save $6 million in salary cap space.\n\nCharles quickly signed a one-year deal worth up to $4 million with their AFC West rivals and declaring that he'd long admired John Elway and had always wanted to play for the Broncos.\n\nHe'll soon get that chance.\n\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nFollow Arnie Melendrez Stapleton on Twitter: http://twitter.com/arniestapleton", "timeCrawl": "17:59:00", "sim": 0.8274509906768799, "extractedDates": [{"date": "-10-30", "textStart": 1054, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1061}, {"date": "2015-10-", "textStart": 3492, "amb": false, "textEnd": 3504}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8950077", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "id": 32, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre", "id": 114, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "id": 284, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps", "id": 533, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/North America", "id": 534, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "id": 542, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job_Search", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job Search", "id": 948, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/History", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/History", "id": 1638, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Charles did not take part in team drills as training camp opened but has been worked steadily into practice a little more with each passing week.\n\nThe Broncos see Charles, a four-time Pro Bowl selection in his nine seasons with the Kansas City Chiefs, as a potential situational player who could get 10-12 snaps a game if they determine his knees will hold up to the work. Joseph said Saturday he had not yet decided if Charles would play next Saturday against the San Francisco 49ers, but Joseph did concede the team's decision-makers would likely have to see Charles play in a game before they make their roster decisions.\n\n\"Probably, yes,\" Joseph said. \"We've got San Fran this week, we've got Green Bay, and even Arizona Week 4. He'll eventually play; it depends on the docs and how he's feeling.\"\n\nThe Broncos face the Green Bay Packers Aug. 26 and then close out the preseason Aug. 31 against the Arizona Cardinals. The Broncos have a crowded depth chart at running back, especially with the emergence of rookie De'Angelo Henderson and with what Stevan Ridley has shown in practice; he was signed after Devontae Booker had surgery to repair a fracture in his left wrist as training camp opened.\n\nJoseph has said Henderson's speed and elusiveness makes him \"special\" and Henderson is the fastest back on the roster.

But it's one they soon will have to solve.\n\nWith the selection of sixth-round draft pick De'Angelo Henderson, the signings of veterans Jamaal Charles and Stevan Ridley and the returns of C.J. Anderson, Devontae Booker (when healthy) and Juwan Thompson, the Broncos' once-dormant running game has seemingly been revived with a unique blend of talent.\n\nThe preseason opener at Chicago on Thursday was a test of patience as the Broncos continue to work through the kinks of a new scheme and search for the starter at multiple positions, none more significant than quarterback. But among the more promising aspects was their ground game, which gained 106 yards (4.1 per-carry average) against the Bears and included the winning 41-yard touchdown run by Henderson late in the fourth quarter.\n\n\"What we saw tonight is what he's been since we drafted the guy in the spring,\" first-year Broncos head coach Vance Joseph said of Henderson after the 24-17 victory over the Bears. \"So I'm not surprised to see that tonight.\"\n\nFor the past two years, the Denver running game has failed to launch in the way general manager John Elway envisioned. But this season -- thanks in large part to a remade offensive line whose pride is tied to run blocking -- sure has the potential to be the charm and the key to supporting Denver's quarterbacks and still-developing offense.\n\n\"From what I watched on film to what I see now, it's a different attitude,\" Joseph said. \"In my opinion, it's the offensive line that has made the most improvement. Now, running back-wise, adding Jamaal Charles and adding a guy like Ridley, that obviously makes you better. It makes the competition tough in that room.\"\n\nTraining camp opened with a setback. Booker, Denver's No. 2 running back who had been pushing to be No. 1, suffered a fractured wrist. A pair of screws would fix him, but the Broncos couldn't fill his void on the field for the remainder of camp and the preseason.\n\nEnter Ridley, a free agent who spent four years with the New England Patriots and topped 1,200 yards rushing in 2012 but started only six games over the last three years because of injuries. His shot at a career revival was offered July 27.\n\n\"I told my mom about it at Subway,\" he said with a laugh. \"A small country town in Natchez, Miss., there's not too many options. You've got Wendy's, McDonald's and pretty much Burger King, so Subway takes it.\"\n\nThen he drove three hours to New Orleans, boarded a plane to Denver and worked out for Joseph, offensive coordinator Mike McCoy and running backs coach Eric Studesville inside the Broncos' field house. Then he signed on a dotted line, suited up in a No. 47 practice jersey and took the field for his first walkthrough.\n\nAll in a day's work.\n\nThe next morning, Ridley announced his arrival after throwing on shells and a helmet. He \"flashed\" -- a term Denver coaches have used often to describe their rushers -- showing his ability to find his holes at the line and power through them.\n\nRidley said he wanted to provide \"stability\" to the running backs room, but he has been a welcome disruption -- and a contender for a coveted roster spot.\n\n\"He's a pro,\" Studesville said. \"He approaches this the professional way. And he knows the great opportunity that's sitting here. We're very excited about him.\"\n\nThe Broncos also are excited about Charles, once an AFC West nemesis as a Kansas City Chiefs star who signed a one-year contract in May to fit with Joseph's theme of infusing the offense with speed. Charles didn't play Thursday against the Bears, but he is expected to take the field at some point in preseason as he eases his way back from knee surgeries that hindered his last two years in the league.\n\nHe says his troublesome knees no longer are a concern. The Broncos hope he's right.\n\n\"I don't feel rusty. I feel good,\" Charles said after two days of camp. \"I told the guys in the locker room, when I see one of you kids beat me, it's time for me to give it up.\"\n\nSo far, that kid testing Charles is Henderson, a 5-foot-7 speedster from Coastal Carolina who has given the Broncos a weapon on the ground and in the passing game.\n\n\"Speed kills. That ain't my game,\" Anderson said. \"So, No. 28 (Charles) or No. 33 (Henderson) can go out there and they're fast. If it's time to bulk some muscle and hit somebody in the mouth, call No. 22.\"\n\nIf Joseph had his way, the depth chart that was announced last week wouldn't exist. With multiple position battles underway and many lines blurred because of scheme, the depth chart is misleading and temporary.\n\nIt could change -- as quickly as the Broncos' running backs room changed.\n\nBut for now, Anderson is No. 1. For now, Booker -- despite his wrist injury -- is No. 2. For now, Charles, Ridley, Henderson, Thompson and Bernard Pierce are lumped together in the No. 3 slot.\n\n\"The running back position -- you need two or three guys that can carry the load,\" Joseph said. \"It is no longer a one-guy position.\"\n\nThe competition could prompt the Broncos to take on another tailback and sacrifice depth elsewhere, especially as the backs flaunt a dynamic few other NFL teams can match.\n\n\"I also think the way we're used in the passing game is that other extension of the running game,\" Anderson said. \"So if we're not running the ball well, but catching the ball out of the backfield and keeping the defense honest, we'll still open up some lanes for us to run the ball.\"\n\nIt's a Denver problem that could make for tough decisions Sept. 2, when rosters across the league must be pared to the final 53.\n\n\"Tough? No,\" Studesville said with a smile. \"Tough is when you don't have anybody.\"", "timeCrawl": "01:56:00", "sim": 0.7333333492279053, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 2510, "date": "2017-07-27", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 2517}, {"textStart": 5810, "date": "2017-09-02", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 5817}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8862052", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "id": 49, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "id": 52, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "id": 385, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

He insists on calling his ouster a \"firing\" and said he looks forward to facing his former team on Oct. 30 in Kansas City and New Year's Eve in Denver.\n\nWhen he arrived at training camp for his physical last month, Charles was told he had no medical restrictions, but Joseph said he would be cautious nevertheless and ease Charles into action with an eye toward having him fresh and fit come September.\n\n\"He's been injured for a year and a half, and it's our job to get Jamaal as healthy as he can be,\" Joseph said last month, noting, \"If he gets back to being Jamaal, we've got something special there.\"\n\nCharles' route-running and rushing abilities would add a spirited option for new offensive coordinator Mike McCoy no matter which quarterback, Trevor Siemian or Paxton Lynch, wins the starting job -- the only bigger question facing the Broncos this summer than Charles' health.\n\nTossing a wrench into the running back mix, however, is Devontae Booker , who was pushing for the starting job when he showed up at training camp with a sore wrist he'd hurt in OTAs only to learn he needed surgery on a broken bone. He's out until next month.\n\nThe Broncos responded by signing another veteran free agent, Steven Ridley, who has played for five teams in three seasons since leaving New England, where he rushed for 1,263 yards and 12 touchdowns in 2012.\n\nWith fellow veteran free agent Bernard Pierce sidelined by a hamstring injury most of camp, Ridley has carried a heavy workload in his bid to make the roster.\n\nHe's been sharing snaps with starter C.J. Anderson, veteran Juwan Thompson and impressive rookie De'Angelo Henderson, whose 41-yard touchdown run sealed Denver's 24-17 preseason win at Chicago on Thursday night.\n\nCharles said he's comfortable with his new team, confident in his knees and cool with his situation as he watches Anderson bounce back from his knee injury in 2016 and sees Ridley and Henderson impressing the coaching staff.\n\n\"If they go out there and look better than me, oh well, they're better than me,\" Charles said. \"My job every time I touch the field is just to try to outshine them, too.\"\n\nCharles piled up 9,717 yards from scrimmage with 63 touchdowns in nine seasons in Kansas City while amassing a 5.5-yard-per-carry average, best in NFL history.\n\nBut a career that looked as if it would land Charles in the Hall of Fame was derailed the past few years by injuries that cut short several seasons in his prime.\n\nHe played in just eight games over the past two seasons after tearing his right ACL in October 2015, leading the Chiefs to cut him this winter to save $6 million in salary cap space.\n\nCharles quickly signed a one-year deal worth up to $4 million with their AFC West rivals and declaring that he'd long admired John Elway and had always wanted to play for the Broncos.\n\nHe'll soon get that chance.\n\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nFollow Arnie Melendrez Stapleton on Twitter: http://twitter.com/arniestapleton", "timeCrawl": "17:59:00", "sim": 0.8274509906768799, "extractedDates": [{"date": "-10-30", "textStart": 1054, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1061}, {"date": "2015-10-", "textStart": 3492, "amb": false, "textEnd": 3504}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8950196", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "id": 32, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre", "id": 114, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "id": 284, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps", "id": 533, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/North America", "id": 534, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "id": 542, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job_Search", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job Search", "id": 948, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/History", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/History", "id": 1638, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}], "page": 1, "pages": 5, "totalResults": 5}}}

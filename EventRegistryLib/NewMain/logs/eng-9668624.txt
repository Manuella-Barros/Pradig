(But) it's really important that organizations that put facts out there take every care to be truthful and be grounded in reality.\"\n\nThe passage of the provision is a win for Canadian environmental groups, who have been mounting a full-fledged campaign against \"greenwashing\" -- a term given to the perceived tendency by companies to market their products and practices as more sustainable than they really are.\n\nIn the last year, Canadian green groups have lodged at least four formal complaints with the federal Competition Bureau alleging greenwashing or false environmental claims by fossil fuel companies or banks.\n\nThe Pathways Alliance was the target of one of those complaints. Environmental groups have said the consortium's ads and public claims about net-zero are misleading, as the Pathways Alliance has not yet made a final investment decision on its proposed $16.5-billion carbon capture and storage network.\n\nLeah Temper, program director with the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment, said Thursday she was \"thrilled and surprised\" to see the oilsands industry react so strongly to the passage of C-59.\n\n\"This is basically a very modest provision in the Competition Act. It simply requires companies to tell the truth and to have an evidence base to back up their claims,\" Temper said.\n\n\"So I do think this reaction is very telling.\"\n\nIn a statement, the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers said the anti-greenwashing provision will have the effect of silencing the energy industry and curtailing the ability of Canadians to participate in debates around climate and environmental policy.\n\n\"The burden of proof provision included in the amendments means those making the complaint face no risk or accountability. Rather, the burden falls entirely on companies,\" said CAPP president and CEO Lisa Baiton.\n\n\"Businesses across Canada are being put at significant risk for communicating their efforts to reduce their impact on the environment.\"\n\nBut Temper said that as climate change concerns mount, it has become increasingly common for businesses in all industries to make questionable environmental claims in their advertising.\n\n\"It has been the Wild West. Companies have been able to make almost any claim they want, using terms such as net-carbon neutral, without any reliable evidence base,\" Temper said.\n\n\"Hopefully this (C-59) will represent a sea change.\"\n\nAlberta Environment Minister Rebecca Shulz said while companies in her province are still trying to figure out what the amendments will mean for them, investors and shareholders are likely concerned.\n\n\"This is an attack on freedom of speech. I wholeheartedly believe it's wildly unconstitutional,\" she said in an interview Thursday in Washington, D.C., where she was promoting Alberta's emissions reduction efforts.\n\nOn Thursday, the Calgary Chamber of Commerce said the new rules run at \"cross-purposes\" to the climate ambitions of industries across all sectors.\n\nThe Chamber said the rules will also limit disclosure of climate targets and ambitions to investors and financial markets, putting Canadian companies at a distinct disadvantage relative to companies operating in other jurisdictions.\n\n\"Changes to Canada's Competition Act will be far-reaching and risk the environmental progress industries writ-large have been working toward,\" said Chamber president Deborah Yedlin.\n\nThe debate over environmental claims in advertising has been heating up worldwide. Earlier this month, UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres urged countries to ban advertising by fossil fuel companies in the face of the climate crisis.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published June 20, 2024.\n\n-- With files from Keith Doucette in Westville, N.S. and Kelly Malone in Washington\n\nAmanda Stephenson, The Canadian Press", "source": {"uri": "orilliamatters.com",

The Pathways Alliance is a consortium of Canada's six largest oilsands companies, which together have publicly committed to reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions from oilsands production by 2050. The consortium has previously spent millions of dollars on a countrywide public relations blitz aimed at demonstrating that the oilsands is committed to helping fight climate change. But as of Thursday, all that remains on the group's website is a notice saying Pathways has removed its content due to concerns around an anti-greenwashing provision in federal Bill C-59. \"Imminent amendments to the Competition Act will create significant uncertainty for Canadian companies that want to communicate publicly about the work they are doing to improve their environmental performance,\" the Pathways statement reads. \"With uncertainty on how the new law will be interpreted and applied, any clarity the Competition Bureau can provide through specific guidance may help direct our communications approach in the future.\" The group - which did not provide further comment - added it remains committed to the work it is doing to reduce the environmental impacts of oilsands production. The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers also said Thursday it has \"chosen to reduce the amount of information available on its website and other digital platforms.\" The omnibus Bill C-59, which passed third reading in the Senate Wednesday and will soon become law, contains a truth-in-advertising amendment that would require corporations to provide evidence to support their environmental claims. The bill's wording says businesses must not make claims to the public about what they are doing to protect the environment or mitigate the effects of climate change unless those claims are based on \"adequate and proper substantiation in accordance with internationally recognized methodology.\" The provision is not fossil fuel-specific, but applies to all businesses and economic sectors. \"One of the things that's really important is that in our democracy, people build their positions and their decisions around facts,\" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters in Sackville, N.S. on Thursday, after being asked about Pathways' decision to remove content from its website. \"Freedom of expression, freedom of people to share their points of view, is extraordinarily important ... (But) it's really important that organizations that put facts out there take every care to be truthful and be grounded in reality.\" The passage of the provision is a win for Canadian environmental groups, who have been mounting a full-fledged campaign against \"greenwashing\" - a term given to the perceived tendency by companies to market their products and practices as more sustainable than they really are. In the last year, Canadian green groups have lodged at least four formal complaints with the federal Competition Bureau alleging greenwashing or false environmental claims by fossil fuel companies or banks. The Pathways Alliance was the target of one of those complaints. Environmental groups have said the consortium's ads and public claims about net-zero are misleading, as the Pathways Alliance has not yet made a final investment decision on its proposed $16.5-billion carbon capture and storage network. Leah Temper, program director with the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment, said Thursday she was \"thrilled and surprised\" to see the oilsands industry react so strongly to the passage of C-59. \"This is basically a very modest provision in the Competition Act. It simply requires companies to tell the truth and to have an evidence base to back up their claims,\" Temper said. \"So I do think this reaction is very telling.\" In a statement, the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers said the anti-greenwashing provision will have the effect of silencing the energy industry and curtailing the ability of Canadians to participate in debates around climate and environmental policy. \"The burden of proof provision included in the amendments means those making the complaint face no risk or accountability. Rather, the burden falls entirely on companies,\" said CAPP president and CEO Lisa Baiton. \"Businesses across Canada are being put at significant risk for communicating their efforts to reduce their impact on the environment.\" But Temper said that as climate change concerns mount, it has become increasingly common for businesses in all industries to make questionable environmental claims in their advertising. \"It has been the Wild West. Companies have been able to make almost any claim they want, using terms such as net-carbon neutral, without any reliable evidence base,\" Temper said. \"Hopefully this (C-59) will represent a sea change.\" Alberta Environment Minister Rebecca Shulz said while companies in her province are still trying to figure out what the amendments will mean for them, investors and shareholders are likely concerned. \"This is an attack on freedom of speech. I wholeheartedly believe it's wildly unconstitutional,\" she said in an interview Thursday in Washington, D.C., where she was promoting Alberta's emissions reduction efforts. On Thursday, the Calgary Chamber of Commerce said the new rules run at \"cross-purposes\" to the climate ambitions of industries across all sectors. The Chamber said the rules will also limit disclosure of climate targets and ambitions to investors and financial markets, putting Canadian companies at a distinct disadvantage relative to companies operating in other jurisdictions. \"Changes to Canada's Competition Act will be far-reaching and risk the environmental progress industries writ-large have been working toward,\" said Chamber president Deborah Yedlin.

Earlier this month, UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres urged countries to ban advertising by fossil fuel companies in the face of the climate crisis.", "source": {"uri": "pipestoneflyer.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Pipestone Flyer"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_sands", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oil sands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consortium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Consortium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_neutrality", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carbon neutrality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_issues", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Environmental issues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_Bureau_(Canada)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Competition Bureau (Canada)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Association_of_Petroleum_Producers", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwashing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greenwashing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temper", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Temper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fossil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Climate change mitigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Trudeau", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Trudeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Environmental movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Association_of_Physicians_for_the_Environment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant\u00f3nio_Guterres", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ant\u00f3nio Guterres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calgary", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Calgary"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Calgary"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alberta"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alberta"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate_Change", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Publications", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://www.bpmcdn.com/f/files/shared/feeds/gps/2024/06/web1_20240620100648-e64f8b4f35cf9eda68f0097053cf34bea19609722c9b336c7b5d0eac5b502930.jpg;w=1200;h=800;mode=crop", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668624", "eventUri": "eng-9668624", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

The bill has drawn criticism from environmentalists and concerns about litigation risks. A carbon capture project proposal remains under consideration.\n\nThe Pathways Alliance, a group of Canada's biggest oil sands producers, has removed all content about environmental goals from its website and social media pages, citing \"significant uncertainty\" over the federal government's anti-greenwashing legislation. Bill C-59, which only needs royal assent to become law after Canada's parliament gave approval on Wednesday, would force companies to show proof of their environmental claims.\n\nPathways is proposing a C$16.5 billion ($12.04 billion)carbon capture and storage project to cut carbon emissions from the oil sands, but is yet to make a final investment decision. The group has faced criticism from environmentalists for slow progress and seeking more government financial support. On Thursday, the content on Pathways' website had been replaced with a post about its concerns with omnibus Bill C-59, which will implement the Liberal government's mid-year budget proposals and change Canada's Competition Act. The bill was amended earlier this year to add anti-greenwashing rules.\n\n\"Imminent amendments to the Competition Act will create significant uncertainty for Canadian companies that want to communicate publicly about the work they are doing to improve their environmental performance,\" the website said. On Wednesday, that website had said \"Canada's oil sands are on a path to reach net-zero emissions from operations,\" according to an archived copy.\n\nCanada is the world's fourth-largest oil producer and the oil and gas sector is the country's highest-polluting industry, accounting for more than a quarter of all emissions. Climate advocacy group Environmental Defence said Pathways' decision to take down content shows \"they don't have evidence to support the story they're selling,\" while the Pembina Group think-tank said there were significant gaps between the emissions reduction promises Pathways first made in 2021 and its actions.\n\nThe alliance, which includes oil sands producers Suncor Energy, Imperial Oil, and Cenovus, said in a statement later on Thursday that it removed its online content because the amendments were too vague and opened the door to \"frivolous litigation\" from private entities. \"These actions are a direct consequence of this legislation and are not related to our commitments or belief in the accuracy of our environmental communications,\" Pathways said.\n\nAsked to comment, a Competition Bureau spokesperson referred to a letter it submitted to lawmakers last month, in which it said the amendments would strengthen its ability to police deceptive greenwashing claims. \"While we take the concerns of Pathways Alliance seriously, we are confident that enforcement guidance from the Bureau can help address their concerns and provide assistance to all stakeholders in complying with the law,\" the letter said.

In effect, a company could be taken to a tribunal or court if it makes claims about its environmental performance that can't be backed up by \"internationally recognized methodology,\" a vague phrase that has come under heavy criticism from oil companies and Alberta's government.\n\nKendall Dilling, Pathways' president, said the organization was preparing a statement further explaining its move.\n\nThe group includes Canada's largest oil sands producers including Cenovus Energy Inc., Suncor Energy Inc., Imperial Oil Ltd., MEG Energy Corp. and Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. Pathways was formed as the industry that produces some of the highest carbon-emitting crude oil in the world came under pressure to address its impact on climate change.\n\nPathways plans to invest C$16.3 billion ($12 billion) in a carbon capture and storage system to reduce emissions by 22 million metric tons by 2030 with the goal of becoming a net-zero emitter by 2050.\n\nMost of the reductions initially would come from capturing emissions from their oilsands facilities and transporting them down a pipeline to the Cold Lake region of central Alberta for sequestration underground. But, further into the future, Pathways hasn't fully explained how net zero would be achieved.\n\nThe law came about through an amendment that was inserted into Bill C-59 relatively late in the parliamentary process. It was backed by Trudeau's Liberal Party along with two opposition parties, the New Democrats and Bloc Quebecois.\n\nThe amendment covers claims around a business activity on \"mitigating the environmental and ecological causes or effects of climate change that is not based on adequate and proper substantiation in accordance with internationally recognized methodology.\"\n\nDuring a House of Commons committee meeting, Liberal lawmaker Patrick Weiler explained how the new language might work in practice.\n\n\"To give you an example, a company may say that they are on track to net-zero emissions by a certain year but not have done that, and that can be a form of greenwashing,\" Weiler said.\n\nA few weeks later, at a Senate committee reviewing the bill, a government official said \"a number of industry stakeholders\" had started expressing concerns about the new language and how it would be interpreted.\n\nSamir Chhabra, a policy official with the government's Department of Innovation, Science and Economic Development, told senators there will eventually be guidance coming from the Competition Bureau on how the new clause would be interpreted.\n\n\"I would expect that the bureau would take some time to engage on what they would interpret as an 'internationally recognized methodology,'\" Chhabra said, adding that at this point it is \"an undefined term.\"\n\nThe language remained in the bill, which will imminently be signed into law.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

In effect, a company could be taken to a tribunal or court if it makes claims about its environmental performance that can't be backed up by \"internationally recognized methodology,\" a vague phrase that has come under heavy criticism from oil companies and Alberta's government.\n\nPathways was not alone -- the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, another major industry group, said it had removed some material from its website and other digital platforms pending further guidance from the Competition Bureau.\n\n\"The effect of this legislation is to silence the energy industry and those that support it in an effort to clear the field of debate and to promote the voices of those most opposed to Canada's energy industry,\" Lisa Baiton, president of the association, said in a statement.\n\nClimate advocacy groups including Ecojustice and the Quebec Environmental Law Center released a joint statement welcoming the legislation. The rules will address a \"particularly pervasive form of greenwashing: the lack of proof,\" said Julien Beaulieu, a lawyer and researcher with the Quebec center.\n\n\"From now on, firms willing to advertise their net-zero commitments, their reliance on carbon offsets and their nature conservation pledges will need to back these claims with sufficient evidence,\" Beaulieu said.\n\nKendall Dilling, Pathways' president, said the organization was preparing a statement further explaining its move.\n\nThe group includes Canada's largest oil sands producers including Cenovus Energy Inc., Suncor Energy Inc., Imperial Oil Ltd., MEG Energy Corp. and Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. Pathways was formed as the industry that produces some of the highest carbon-emitting crude oil in the world came under pressure to address its impact on climate change.\n\nPathways plans to invest C$16.3 billion ($12 billion) in a carbon capture and storage system to reduce emissions by 22 million metric tons by 2030 with the goal of becoming a net-zero emitter by 2050.\n\nMost of the reductions initially would come from capturing emissions from their oil sands facilities and transporting them down a pipeline to the Cold Lake region of central Alberta for sequestration underground. But, further into the future, Pathways hasn't fully explained how net zero would be achieved.\n\nThe law came about through an amendment that was inserted into Bill C-59 relatively late in the parliamentary process. It was backed by Trudeau's Liberal Party along with two opposition parties, the New Democrats and Bloc Quebecois.\n\nThe amendment covers claims around a business activity on \"mitigating the environmental and ecological causes or effects of climate change that is not based on adequate and proper substantiation in accordance with internationally recognized methodology.\"\n\nDuring a House of Commons committee meeting, Liberal lawmaker Patrick Weiler explained how the new language might work in practice.\n\n\"To give you an example, a company may say that they are on track to net-zero emissions by a certain year but not have done that, and that can be a form of greenwashing,\" Weiler said.\n\nA few weeks later, at a Senate committee reviewing the bill, a government official said \"a number of industry stakeholders\" had started expressing concerns about the new language and how it would be interpreted.\n\nSamir Chhabra, a policy official with the government's Department of Innovation, Science and Economic Development, told senators there will eventually be guidance coming from the Competition Bureau on how the new clause would be interpreted.\n\n\"I would expect that the bureau would take some time to engage on what they would interpret as an 'internationally recognized methodology,'\" Chhabra said, adding that at this point it is \"an undefined term.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

The consortium of six oil companies -- made up of Canadian Natural Resources Limited, Cenovus Energy, ConocoPhillips Canada, Imperial, MEG Energy and Suncor Energy -- says it came together June 15, 2022, \"to reduce emissions and achieve net-zero operations.\"\n\nA statement on the group's landing page said uncertainty under the bill pushed Pathways Alliance to remove the content.\n\n\"As part of late changes to the omnibus Bill C-59, imminent amendments to the Competition Act will create significant uncertainty for Canadian companies that want to communicate publicly about the work they are doing to improve their environmental performance, including to address climate change,\" reads the statement.\n\n\"For now, we have removed content from our website, social media and other public communications. This is a direct consequence of the new legislation and is not related to our belief in the accuracy of our environmental communications.\"\n\nMC Bouchard, the oil and gas program director at the green think tank Pembina Institute, said the move comes as the Pathways Alliance has failed to make \"any final investment decisions on carbon capture projects, or on other technologies, that would meaningfully reduce their emissions\" in line with federal targets.\n\n\"The oilsands is still Canada's highest emitting industry, and those emissions continue to grow,\" Bouchard said in a statement.\n\n\"The actions Pathways and its member companies have taken today appears to be a withdrawal of their commitments to reduce emissions and reach net-zero by 2050,\" added Bouchard.\n\nCanada's Competition Bureau is currently investigating the Pathways Alliance's national \"Let's clear the air\" campaign under existing laws.\n\nA Greenpeace Canada complaint taken up by the bureau in May 2023 alleges Pathways Alliance made \"misleading\" statements in advertisements touting its plan to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.\n\nThe ads ran across television, major Canadian newspapers, their website, podcasts, social media and at least one billboard outside BC Place stadium in Vancouver. The complaint claims those ads failed to account for more than 80 per cent of the emissions released by the consortium of companies' when their fossil fuels are burned.\n\nAt the time, Pathways Alliance said \"we strongly disagree with the assertions\" in the complaint. The latest statement on its website says the consortium of companies continues to believe the oil industry has \"a key role to play\" in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and environmental impacts of oil sands production.\n\nThe Competition Bureau has taken up a number of complaints alleging deceptive environmental claims in recent years. Bill C-59 represents an attempt by government and the watchdog to strengthen its regulatory hand at a time sustainability claims are becoming more common as companies, charities and non-profit groups look to gain social licence to sell more products and services.\n\nLeah Temper is the health and economic policy program director at the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment (CAPE), a group of health professionals that has been involved in filing several greenwashing claims with the Competition Bureau.\n\nIn addition to Pathways Alliance, Temper said the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers has also removed some of its online content, and reporting from the Calgary Herald earlier this month suggested Bill C-59 -- and the threats of federal fines for misrepresentations that come with it -- was the main reason why the Alberta government's energy \"War Room\" was shut down.\n\n\"The bill has not even passed yet and we're already seeing the wide-ranging impact,\" Temper said.\n\n\"Our hope is that this heralds a new era of corporate accountability for green claims.\"", "source": {"uri": "tricitynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tri-City News"},

(But) it's really important that organizations that put facts out there take every care to be truthful and be grounded in reality.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe passage of the provision is a win for Canadian environmental groups, who have been mounting a full-fledged campaign against \"greenwashing\" -- a term given to the perceived tendency by companies to market their products and practices as more sustainable than they really are.\n\nIn the last year, Canadian green groups have lodged at least four formal complaints with the federal Competition Bureau alleging greenwashing or false environmental claims by fossil fuel companies or banks.\n\nThe Pathways Alliance was the target of one of those complaints. Environmental groups have said the consortium's ads and public claims about net-zero are misleading, as the Pathways Alliance has not yet made a final investment decision on its proposed $16.5-billion carbon capture and storage network.\n\nLeah Temper, program director with the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment, said Thursday she was \"thrilled and surprised\" to see the oilsands industry react so strongly to the passage of C-59.\n\n\"This is basically a very modest provision in the Competition Act. It simply requires companies to tell the truth and to have an evidence base to back up their claims,\" Temper said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"So I do think this reaction is very telling.\"\n\nIn a statement, the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers said the anti-greenwashing provision will have the effect of silencing the energy industry and curtailing the ability of Canadians to participate in debates around climate and environmental policy.\n\n\"The burden of proof provision included in the amendments means those making the complaint face no risk or accountability. Rather, the burden falls entirely on companies,\" said CAPP president and CEO Lisa Baiton.\n\n\"Businesses across Canada are being put at significant risk for communicating their efforts to reduce their impact on the environment.\"\n\nBut Temper said that as climate change concerns mount, it has become increasingly common for businesses in all industries to make questionable environmental claims in their advertising.\n\n\"It has been the Wild West. Companies have been able to make almost any claim they want, using terms such as net-carbon neutral, without any reliable evidence base,\" Temper said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"Hopefully this (C-59) will represent a sea change.\"\n\nAlberta Environment Minister Rebecca Shulz said while companies in her province are still trying to figure out what the amendments will mean for them, investors and shareholders are likely concerned.\n\n\"This is an attack on freedom of speech. I wholeheartedly believe it's wildly unconstitutional,\" she said in an interview Thursday in Washington, D.C., where she was promoting Alberta's emissions reduction efforts.\n\nOn Thursday, the Calgary Chamber of Commerce said the new rules run at \"cross-purposes\" to the climate ambitions of industries across all sectors.\n\nThe Chamber said the rules will also limit disclosure of climate targets and ambitions to investors and financial markets, putting Canadian companies at a distinct disadvantage relative to companies operating in other jurisdictions.\n\n\"Changes to Canada's Competition Act will be far-reaching and risk the environmental progress industries writ-large have been working toward,\" said Chamber president Deborah Yedlin.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe debate over environmental claims in advertising has been heating up worldwide. Earlier this month, UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres urged countries to ban advertising by fossil fuel companies in the face of the climate crisis.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first

In effect, a company could be taken to a tribunal or court if it makes claims about its environmental performance that can't be backed up by \"internationally recognized methodology,\" a vague phrase that has come under heavy criticism from oil companies and Alberta's government.\n\nKendall Dilling, Pathways' president, said the organization was preparing a statement further explaining its move.\n\nThe group includes Canada's largest oil sands producers including Cenovus Energy Inc., Suncor Energy Inc., Imperial Oil Ltd., MEG Energy Corp. and Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. Pathways was formed as the industry that produces some of the highest carbon-emitting crude oil in the world came under pressure to address its impact on climate change.\n\nPathways plans to invest C$16.3 billion ($12 billion) in a carbon capture and storage system to reduce emissions by 22 million metric tons by 2030 with the goal of becoming a net-zero emitter by 2050.\n\nMost of the reductions initially would come from capturing emissions from their oilsands facilities and transporting them down a pipeline to the Cold Lake region of central Alberta for sequestration underground. But, further into the future, Pathways hasn't fully explained how net zero would be achieved.\n\nThe law came about through an amendment that was inserted into Bill C-59 relatively late in the parliamentary process. It was backed by Trudeau's Liberal Party along with two opposition parties, the New Democrats and Bloc Quebecois.\n\nThe amendment covers claims around a business activity on \"mitigating the environmental and ecological causes or effects of climate change that is not based on adequate and proper substantiation in accordance with internationally recognized methodology.\"\n\nDuring a House of Commons committee meeting, Liberal lawmaker Patrick Weiler explained how the new language might work in practice.\n\n\"To give you an example, a company may say that they are on track to net-zero emissions by a certain year but not have done that, and that can be a form of greenwashing,\" Weiler said.\n\nA few weeks later, at a Senate committee reviewing the bill, a government official said \"a number of industry stakeholders\" had started expressing concerns about the new language and how it would be interpreted.\n\nSamir Chhabra, a policy official with the government's Department of Innovation, Science and Economic Development, told senators there will eventually be guidance coming from the Competition Bureau on how the new clause would be interpreted.\n\n\"I would expect that the bureau would take some time to engage on what they would interpret as an 'internationally recognized methodology,'\" Chhabra said, adding that at this point it is \"an undefined term.\"\n\nThe language remained in the bill, which will imminently be signed into law.\n\n3.6 Crore Indians visited in a single day choosing us as India's undisputed platform for General Election Results.

According to Leah Temper of the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment (CAPE), the \"greenwashing\" amendments proposed for the Competition Act came about through a public consultation held in the spring of 2023. CAPE, along with other Canadian environmental groups such Ecojustice, Equiterre and the Quebec Environmental Law Center, worked together on the proposed greenwashing amendments over the last year and a half.\n\nWithin it is a proposed amendment to the Competition Act that would disallow deceptive marketing practices with respect to \"greenwashing\" claims. Specifically, any person or organization that makes a representation to the public in the form of a statement, warranty or guarantee of a product's benefits for protecting the environment or mitigating the environmental and ecological effects of climate change that is not based on an adequate and proper test, could be considered misleading the public.\n\nThe amendment calls for monetary penalties in such cases. The bill is set to pass this week.\n\nBill C-59's proposed amendments were criticized by Alberta Premier Danielle Smith last week in a discussion about the Canadian Energy Centre -- also called the energy war room -- which announced its closure on June 11. Speaking at the Global Energy Show in Calgary, Smith falsely stated Bill C-59 \"is trying to make it illegal to celebrate and talk about our industry\" and that she wasn't sure whether the Canadian Energy Centre would be \"allowed to talk about these things,\" but also that the proposed legislation granted Alberta an exemption.\n\nThe Pathways Alliance is a marketing and lobbying organization representing the country's six largest oil sands producers: Imperial Oil, Suncor, ConocoPhillips, Cenovus, CNRL and MEG.\n\nAs previously reported by DeSmog, Canada's competition bureau was already investigating the Pathways Alliance for alleged misleading advertising before the Bill C-59 amendments. Greenpeace Canada alleged in a complaint submitted to the Competition Bureau in March of 2023 that Pathway has made false and misleading claims.\n\nPathways orchestrated a national media blitz that included a large number of advertisements placed on public transit. Ads appearing on buses, as an example, stated \"our net zero plan is in motion.\" DeSmog has also reported that Pathways Alliance has paid Google to advertise on greenwashing searches.\n\nThe notice left by Pathways on their website argues C-59 \"will create significant uncertainty for Canadian companies that want to communicate publicly about the work they are doing to improve their environmental performance, including to address climate change.\"\n\nHowever, the bill's wording clearly states that if a company wants to make environmental claims about a given product or service, it should be able to back these claims with \"an adequate and proper test.\" Speaking generally about a given company or organization's environmental interests or hopes to reduce emissions would be unlikely to be considered false or misleading statements.\n\nBut some statements may be considered misleading if they could not be proven by a reasonable test. Statements that previously appeared on Pathways' website -- which are accessible via the Internet Archive -- include:\n\nThere is considerable and mounting evidence that the only practical application of CCS is continued oil production, through a process called enhanced oil recovery (EOR). EOR was the first application of CCS, and was developed over 50 years ago. A recent DeSmog report revealed that some Canadian oil operations have only managed to continue operating because of CCS, and that they would have ceased operations entirely a decade ago otherwise.\n\n\"Canadian companies who are walking their climate talk need not worry about changes to Bill C-59,\" said Nola Poirier, senior researcher at Greenpeace Canada.\n\n\"This law will merely ensure that companies do not make false environmental claims. However, the Pathways Alliance does have reason to worry. Already the Competition Bureau is investigating the Pathways Alliance to determine whether they have contravened the Competition Act by making false or misleading environmental representations,\" said Poirier in a statement to DeSmog.\n\n\"For too long fossil fuel companies have been able to greenwash their products and actions. We look forward to strong laws that put an end to false environmental claims and hold companies accountable when they aren't telling the truth.\" According to one public health expert, CCS is the oil and gas industry's equivalent of Big Tobacco's promise of safer cigarettes from generations ago.\n\nPathways' statement further indicates that the organization believes it has a \"key role to play in reducing environmental impacts of oil sands production including helping Canada reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, while also supporting a vibrant economy and providing Canadians with secure access to affordable energy.\"\n\nPathways Alliance did not immediately respond to DeSmog's request for comment.", "source": {"uri": "desmog.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DeSmog"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The alliance, which includes oil sands producers Suncor Energy, Imperial Oil, and Cenovus, did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.\n\nClimate advocacy group Environmental Defence said Pathways Alliance's decision to take down content shows \"they don't have evidence to support the story they're selling.\" Pathways, in its note, said specific guidance from Canada's Competition Bureau may help direct its communications approach in the future, and added that the group \"remains committed to the work we are doing.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_sands", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oil sands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_neutrality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carbon neutrality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "House of Commons of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liberal Party of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_house", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Upper house"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_Bureau_(Canada)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Competition Bureau (Canada)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K\u00f6ppen_climate_classification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "K\u00f6ppen climate classification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Oil", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Imperial Oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cenovus_Energy", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cenovus Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suncor_Energy", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suncor Energy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Oil_and_Gas", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Oil and Gas", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Fats_and_Oils", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Fats and Oils", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Products_and_Services", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Products and Services", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Energy", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/20_06_2024_17_03_54_6770369.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668624", "eventUri": "eng-9668624", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

(But) it's really important that organizations that put facts out there take every care to be truthful and be grounded in reality.\"\n\nThe passage of the provision is a win for Canadian environmental groups, who have been mounting a full-fledged campaign against \"greenwashing\" -- a term given to the perceived tendency by companies to market their products and practices as more sustainable than they really are.\n\nIn the last year, Canadian green groups have lodged at least four formal complaints with the federal Competition Bureau alleging greenwashing or false environmental claims by fossil fuel companies or banks.\n\nThe Pathways Alliance was the target of one of those complaints. Environmental groups have said the consortium's ads and public claims about net-zero are misleading, as the Pathways Alliance has not yet made a final investment decision on its proposed $16.5-billion carbon capture and storage network.\n\nLeah Temper, program director with the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment, said Thursday she was \"thrilled and surprised\" to see the oilsands industry react so strongly to the passage of C-59.\n\n\"This is basically a very modest provision in the Competition Act. It simply requires companies to tell the truth and to have an evidence base to back up their claims,\" Temper said.\n\n\"So I do think this reaction is very telling.\"\n\nIn a statement, the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers said the anti-greenwashing provision will have the effect of silencing the energy industry and curtailing the ability of Canadians to participate in debates around climate and environmental policy.\n\n\"The burden of proof provision included in the amendments means those making the complaint face no risk or accountability. Rather, the burden falls entirely on companies,\" said CAPP president and CEO Lisa Baiton.\n\n\"Businesses across Canada are being put at significant risk for communicating their efforts to reduce their impact on the environment.\"\n\nBut Temper said that as climate change concerns mount, it has become increasingly common for businesses in all industries to make questionable environmental claims in their advertising.\n\n\"It has been the Wild West. Companies have been able to make almost any claim they want, using terms such as net-carbon neutral, without any reliable evidence base,\" Temper said.\n\n\"Hopefully this (C-59) will represent a sea change.\"\n\nAlberta Environment Minister Rebecca Shulz has called the anti-greenwashing provision an \"undemocratic gag order\" that creates needless uncertainty for businesses.\n\nOn Thursday, the Calgary Chamber of Commerce said the new rules run at \"cross-purposes\" to the climate ambitions of industries across all sectors.\n\nThe Chamber said the rules will also limit disclosure of climate targets and ambitions to investors and financial markets, putting Canadian companies at a distinct disadvantage relative to companies operating in other jurisdictions.\n\n\"Changes to Canada's Competition Act will be far-reaching and risk the environmental progress industries writ-large have been working toward,\" said Chamber president Deborah Yedlin.\n\nThe debate over environmental claims in advertising has been heating up worldwide.

Project details and projections are now gone from the Pathways website, social media and other public communications as the pending law will require companies to show proof when making representations about protecting, restoring or mitigating environmental, social and ecological causes or effects of climate change.\n\nAny claim \"that is not based on adequate and proper substantiation in accordance with internationally recognized methodology\" could result in penalties under the pending law.\n\nOffenders may face a maximum penalty of C$10mn for the first offense while subsequent offenses would be as much as C$15mn, or \"triple the value of the benefit derived from the anti-competitive practice.\"\n\nThe bill does not single out oil and gas companies, but the industry includes the country's largest emitters and has long been in the cross-hairs of the liberal government. Alberta's premier Danielle Smith says the pending bill will have the unintended effect by stifling \"many billions in investments in emissions technologies -- the very technologies the world needs.\"\n\nConstruction of the Pathways project is expected to begin as early as the fourth quarter 2025 with operations starting in 2029 or 2030.\n\nThe main CO2 transportation pipeline will be 24-36-inches in diameter and stretch about 400km (249 miles). It will initially tap into 13 oil sands facilities from north of Fort McMurray to the Cold Lake region, where the CO2 will be stored underground.\n\nPathways includes Canadian Natural Resources, Cenovus, Suncor, Imperial Oil, ConocoPhillips Canada and MEG Energy, which account for about 95pc of the province's roughly 3.3mn b/d of oil sands production.\n\nSome producers took down content as did industry lobby group the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP), which highlighted the \"significant\" risk the legislation creates.\n\n\"Buried deep into an omnibus bill and added at a late stage of committee review, these amendments have been put forward without consultation, clarity on guidelines, or the standards that must be met to achieve compliance,\" said CAPP president Lisa Baiton on Thursday.

To support our commitment, we have strived to be transparent about our actions and plans, which we believe is critical to building trust and driving improvement.\n\nHowever, our ability to remain transparent has been significantly compromised as a result of Bill C-59, which was recently passed and includes amendments to the Competition Act related to environmental and climate disclosure. With these changes, it is possible that certain public representations by a business about the benefits of the work it is doing to protect or restore the environment or address climate change will violate the Competition Act and subject it to significant financial penalties unless the business can adequately and properly substantiate their claims according to \"internationally recognized methodology,\" which may or may not exist.\n\nCreating a public disclosure standard that is so vague as to lack meaning and that relies on undefined \"internationally recognized methodology\" opens the door for frivolous litigation, particularly by private entities who will now be empowered to directly enforce this new provision of the Competition Act. This represents a serious threat to freedom of communication.\n\nThese amendments create significant uncertainty and risk for all Canadian companies regardless of sector, that communicate publicly about environmental performance, including actions to address climate change. As a result, we have been forced to remove information on environmental and climate performance, progress, and plans from our websites, social media platforms and other communications channels at this time. These actions are a direct consequence of this legislation and are not related to our commitments or belief in the accuracy of our environmental communications.\n\nThe result of this legislation, which has been quickly put in place with little or no consultation, is to silence Canadian businesses taking climate action. We will continue to impress on the federal government the need for clarity regarding these new amendments so that we and all other industries can share the important work we are doing to preserve and restore the environment and address climate change.", "source": {"uri": "boereport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BOE Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_sands", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oil sands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Air pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calgary", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Calgary"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Calgary"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frivolous_litigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Frivolous litigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Climate change mitigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Products_and_Services", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Products and Services", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate_Change", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Paleogeography_and_Paleoclimatology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Paleogeography and Paleoclimatology", "wgt": 24}], "image": "https://boereport.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Pathways-alliance-logo.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668624", "eventUri": "eng-9668624", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Calgary"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-06-", "textStart": 13, "textEnd": 20}], "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

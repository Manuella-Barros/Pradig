Now, the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, which is investigating antisemitism at Columbia and other campuses, has obtained and released the full text message exchanges.\n\nWhile elements of the text messages have been previously reported, the full exchanges show the university officials downplaying students' concerns about antisemitism, bashing the head of the school's Hillel and suggesting that Jewish students received attention because of money.\n\nThe conversations were conducted while the administrators were attending a May 31 panel discussion titled \"Jewish Life on Campus: Past, Present, and Future.\"\n\n\"Comes from such a place of privilege,\" wrote Susan Chang-Kim, the university's vice dean and chief administrative officer. \"Hard to hear the woe is me, we need to huddle at the Kraft Center,\" Columbia's Jewish student center, where Hillel is housed.\n\n\"Yup. Blind to the idea that non-Israel supporting Jews have no space to come together,\" responded Cristen Kromm, a dean of undergraduate student life.\n\n\"If only every identity community had these resources and support,\" Kromm added several minutes later.\n\nThe new texts also shed light on a previously reported exchange between Kromm and Chang-Kim, which the House committee said was about an October op-ed by Hillel Rabbi Yonah Hain on campus antisemitism, titled \"Sounding the alarm.\"\n\n\"And we thought Yonah sounded the alarm,\" Kromm wrote near the end of the exchange, followed by two vomit emojis.\n\n\"I'm going to throw up,\" Chang-Kim responded.\n\n\"Amazing what $$$$ can do,\" Kromm said at one point, apparently when Brian Cohen, the executive director of Columbia's Hillel, was speaking about students receiving attention in the media and in Washington, D.C.\n\nAt another point while Cohen was speaking, Chang-Kim wrote, \"He is such a problem!\"\n\n\"Painting our students as dangerous,\" she added.\n\n\"He knows exactly what he's doing and has to take full advantage of this moment. Huge fundraising potential,\" said Matthew Patashnick, an associate vice dean for student and family support, in one of the messages reported last month.\n\nAt other points in the exchange, which lasted for close to two hours, Chang-Kim wrote \"Smoke and mirrors,\" and \"Trying to be open-minded to understand but the doors are closing.\"\n\nIn another text shared with the New York Jewish Week last month, Chang-Kim texted Josef Sorett, the university's dean, while Cohen was speaking. \"He is our hero,\" Chang-Kim said, in an apparently sarcastic message. Nine minutes later, Sorett wrote, \"Lmao,\" an acronym for \"laughing my ass off.\" It was unclear whether his text was a delayed response to Chang-Kim or whether he was reacting to something else. He did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn addition to Cohen, the panelists were former law school Dean David Schizer, who co-chairs the university's antisemitism task force; Rebecca Massel, a student journalist for the Columbia Spectator, the campus newspaper; and Ian Rottenberg, the director of the school's Center for Religious Life.\n\nAn audience member sitting behind one of the deans took photos of the administrators' texts and first shared them last month with the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative news outlet that has reported aggressively about the incident and its fallout.\n\nThe university suspended Chang-Kim, Kromm and Patashnick last month after the texts came to light.\n\nThe university said on Tuesday that Sorett would remain in his position as the dean of the college, but would be recused from all matters relating to the investigation into the texts. Sorett was cooperating with the investigation, and had told his team that the other three administrators had been placed on leave pending the probe, a Columbia official told the New York Jewish Week.\n\n\"We are committed to combatting antisemitism and taking sustained, concrete action to ensure Columbia is a campus where Jewish students and everyone in our community feels safe, valued, and able to thrive,\" the official said. \"The Dean reiterated his commitment to learning from this situation and other incidents over the last year to build a community of respect and healthy dialogue.\"\n\nThe House committee that released the transcript of the texts has gained global attention in recent months for holding explosive hearings on campus antisemitism with the leaders of several elite universities. It has vowed to keep pressing the issue.\n\n\"Jewish students deserve better than to have harassment and threats against them dismissed as 'privilege,' and Jewish faculty members deserve better than to be mocked by their colleagues,\" said the committee chairwoman, Virginia Foxx, in a Tuesday statement. \"These text messages once again confirm the need for serious accountability across Columbia's campus.\"\n\nThe suspensions come as Columbia continues to grapple with months of antisemitism allegations on campus following Hamas' October 7 attack on Israel and the ensuing war in Gaza.\n\nThe school gained worldwide attention in April when pro-Palestinian students set up an encampment that sparked a nationwide movement and, critics said, created a hostile and threatening environment for Jewish students. More than 100 students were arrested at the encampment and subsequently during activists' takeover of a campus building. Soon afterward, the school canceled its main commencement ceremony.\n\nThe campus is quieter now that classes have ended, but the school's antisemitism task force, set up in the weeks after October 7, is due to release a report about incidents in which Jewish students were targeted.\n\nStudent protesters, meanwhile, have vowed to keep demonstrating even as classes have let out.

(Luke Tress)\n\nColumbia University administrators said Jewish students occupied a \"place of privilege,\" called a Hillel official a \"problem\" and wrote \"Amazing what $$$$ can do,\" during a panel on Jewish campus life in May, newly released text messages showed.\n\nColumbia had already suspended three of the four administrators involved after photos of some of the texts were first published last month. Now, the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, which is investigating antisemitism at Columbia and other campuses, has obtained and released the full text message exchanges.\n\nThe conversations, conducted while the administrators were attending a May 31 panel discussion titled \"Jewish Life on Campus: Past, Present, and Future,\" include messages in which the administrators made light of Jewish panelists' concerns about antisemitism and students feeling unwelcome at some campus spaces.\n\n\"Comes from such a place of privilege,\" wrote Susan Chang-Kim, the university's vice dean and chief administrative officer. \"Hard to hear the woe is me, we need to huddle at the Kraft Center,\" Columbia's Jewish student center, where Hillel is housed.\n\nSign up for our newsletter to get must-read New York stories each day\n\nBy submitting, I agree to the JTA/New York Jewish Week privacy policy & terms of use.\n\nPlease accept the JTA Privacy Policy\n\nBy submitting the above I agree to the privacy policy and terms of use of JTA.org\n\n\"Yup. Blind to the idea that non-Israel supporting Jews have no space to come together,\" responded Cristen Kromm, a dean of undergraduate student life.\n\n\"If only every identity community had these resources and support,\" Kromm added several minutes later.\n\nThe new texts also shed light on a previously-reported exchange between Kromm and Chang-Kim, which the House committee said was about an October op-ed by Hillel Rabbi Yonah Hain on campus antisemitism, titled \"Sounding the alarm.\"\n\n\"And we thought Yonah sounded the alarm,\" Kromm wrote near the end of the exchange, followed by two vomit emojis.\n\n\"I'm going to throw up,\" Chang-Kim responded.\n\n\"Amazing what $$$$ can do,\" Kromm said at one point, apparently when Brian Cohen, the executive director of Columbia's Hillel, was speaking about students receiving attention in the media and in Washington, D.C.\n\nAt another point while Cohen was speaking, Chang-Kim wrote, \"He is such a problem!\"\n\n\"Painting our students as dangerous,\" she added.\n\nSupport the New York Jewish Week\n\nOur nonprofit newsroom depends on readers like you. Make a donation now to support independent Jewish journalism in New York.\n\nDonate\n\n\"He knows exactly what he's doing and has to take full advantage of this moment. Huge fundraising potential,\" said Matthew Patashnick, an associate vice dean for student and family support, in one of the messages reported last month.\n\nAt other points in the exchange, which lasted for close to two hours, Chang-Kim wrote \"Smoke and mirrors,\" and \"Trying to be open minded to understand but the doors are closing.\"\n\nIn another text shared with the New York Jewish Week last month, Chang-Kim texted Josef Sorett, the university's dean, while Cohen was speaking. \"He is our hero,\" Chang-Kim said, in an apparently sarcastic message. Nine minutes later, Sorett wrote, \"Lmao,\" an acronym for \"laughing my ass off.\" It was unclear whether his text was a delayed response to Chang-Kim or whether he was reacting to something else. He did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn addition to Cohen, the panelists were former law school Dean David Schizer, who co-chairs the university's antisemitism task force; Rebecca Massel, a student journalist for the Columbia Spectator, the campus newspaper; and Ian Rottenberg, the director of the school's Center for Religious Life.\n\nAn audience member sitting behind one of the deans took photos of the administrators' texts and first shared them last month with the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative news outlet that has reported aggressively about the incident and its fallout.\n\nThe university suspended Chang-Kim, Kromm and Patashnick last month after the texts came to light.\n\nThe university said on Tuesday that Sorett would remain in his position as the dean of the college, but would be recused from all matters relating to the investigation into the texts. Sorett was cooperating with the investigation, and had told his team that the other three administrators had been placed on leave pending the probe, a Columbia spokesperson told the New York Jewish Week.\n\n\"We are committed to combatting antisemitism and taking sustained, concrete action to ensure Columbia is a campus where Jewish students and everyone in our community feels safe, valued, and able to thrive,\" the spokesperson said. \"The Dean reiterated his commitment to learning from this situation and other incidents over the last year to build a community of respect and healthy dialogue.\"\n\nThe House committee that released the transcript of the texts has gained global attention in recent months for holding explosive hearings on campus antisemitism with the leaders of several elite universities. It has vowed to keep pressing the issue.\n\n\"Jewish students deserve better than to have harassment and threats against them dismissed as 'privilege,' and Jewish faculty members deserve better than to be mocked by their colleagues,\" said committee Chairwoman Virginia Foxx in a Tuesday statement. \"These text messages once again confirm the need for serious accountability across Columbia's campus.\"\n\nThe suspensions come as Columbia continues to grapple with months of antisemitism allegations on campus following Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel and the ensuing war in Gaza.\n\nThe school gained worldwide attention in April when pro-Palestinian students set up an encampment that sparked a nationwide movement and, critics said, created a hostile and threatening environment for Jewish students. More than 100 students were arrested at the encampment, and subsequently during activists' takeover of a campus building. Soon afterward, the school canceled its main commencement ceremony.\n\nSupport the New York Jewish Week\n\nOur nonprofit newsroom depends on readers like you. Make a donation now to support independent Jewish journalism in New York.\n\nDonate\n\nThe campus is quieter now that classes have ended, but the school's antisemitism task force, set up in the weeks after Oct. 7, is due to release a report about incidents in which Jewish students were targeted.\n\nStudent protesters, meanwhile, have vowed to keep demonstrating even as classes have let out. Student groups around the city last month, including at Columbia, declared a \"Summer of Resistance,\" urging followers to take \"non-stop action\" in the coming months.", "source": {"uri": "jta.org",

The full text chat, requested by the committee, reveals a further level of vitriol.\n\nSpeakers on the panel included former Columbia Law School Dean David Schizer, who leads the school's antisemitism task force; Brian Cohen, the executive director of Columbia's Kraft Center for Jewish Life; Ian Rottenberg, the school's dean of religious life; and Rebecca Massel, a journalist with the Columbia Daily Spectator.\n\nThe exact context of some of the messages, many of which appear to be in response to specific comments made by members of the panel, is not clear.\n\nSusan Chang-Kim, the chief administrator of Columbia College; Cristen Kromm, dean of undergraduate student life; and Matthew Patashnick, associate dean of student and family support, have all been placed on leave following the Free Beacon's original report regarding the messages. The texts from the officials appeared to downplay and denigrate the concerns expressed by the Jewish campus leaders and students. Josef Sorett, the dean of Columbia College, was also involved in the chain, and remains in his post.\n\n\"Comes from such a place of privilege... hard to hear the woe is me, we need to huddle at the Kraft center. Huh??\" Chang texted the group.\n\nKromm agreed, emphasizing the needs and interests of anti-Zionist Jews. \"Yup. Blind to the idea that non-Israel supporting Jews have no space to come together.\"\n\nChang responded that she was \"trying to be open minded to understand but the doors are closing.\"\n\nAt the end of the panel, Kromm sent two vomiting emojis into the chat, to which Chang-Kim responded, \"I'm going to throw up.\"\n\nKromm added, \"amazing what $$$$ can do.\"\n\nKromm and Patashnick mocked at least one of the speakers for, they suggested, trying to portray himself as a \"hero,\" a notion that Sorett laughed at.\n\nThe administrators also dismissed the concerns raised by Columbia Hillel's Cohen as disingenuous or a ploy for other interests.\n\n\"He knows exactly what he's doing and how to take full advantage of this moment. Huge fundraising potential,\" Patashnick said, a sentiment that was endorsed by Chang-Kim and Kromm.\n\n\"He is such a problem!!!\" Chang-Kim said of one of the speakers. \"Painting our students as dangerous.\"\n\nPatashnick also complained that speakers were \"laying the case to expand physical space!\" adding, \"they will have their own dorm soon.\"\n\nKromm lamented, \"if only every identity community had these resources and support.\"\n\nThe officials also dismissed the notion that Jewish students were expelled from clubs for their identities, and largely brushed off accusations that some Columbia students had expressed support for Hamas.\n\nChang-Kim called the panel \"difficult to listen to,\" with which Sorett agreed, while Kromm called one of the speakers \"strategic\" in his portrayal of events on campus.\n\nChang-Kim also appeared to question why the issue was a subject of discussion for Columbia's board of trustees.\n\nRep. Virginia Foxx (R-NC), the chair of the House committee, condemned the officials in a statement.\n\n\"Jewish students deserve better than to have harassment and threats against them dismissed as 'privilege,' and Jewish faculty members deserve better than to be mocked by their colleagues,\" said Foxx. \"These text messages once again confirm the need for serious accountability across Columbia's campus.\"", "source": {"uri": "jewishinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jewish Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "marc_rod@jewishinsider.com", "name": "Marc Rod", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_(education)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dean (education)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_messaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Text messaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Schizer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Schizer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Law_School", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Columbia Law School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Education_and_the_Workforce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on Education and the Workforce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraft_Foods", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kraft Foods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Executive director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Daily_Spectator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Columbia Daily Spectator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emoji"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undergraduate_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Undergraduate education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillel_Cohen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hillel Cohen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Foxx", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virginia Foxx"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Board of directors"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Student", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Student", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate_Change", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Judaism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Judaism", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Religious_Texts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Religious Texts", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational_Change", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational Change", "wgt": 17}], "image": "https://jewishinsider.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/21182917/GettyImages-2149581624-1200x800.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9701675", "eventUri": "eng-9701675", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

The subsequent production offered a small but clear window into the administrators' determination to belittle the antisemitism on campus.\n\nThe text messages, which include numerous offensive messages that have not previously been reported, show senior Columbia College administrators mocking and disparaging the university's Jewish community, and trafficking in antisemitic tropes regarding Jews and money. The texts accused Jewish students of coming from a \"place of privilege,\" dismissed their concerns, disparaged officials responsible for Jewish student life, and insinuated that efforts to address the explosion of antisemitism on Columbia's campus were merely a fundraising ploy.\n\nThe new messages suggest that the administrators, Susan Chang-Kim, the vice dean and chief administrative officer of Columbia College; Cristen Kromm, the dean of undergraduate student life; Matthew Patashnick, the associate dean for student and family support; and Josef Sorett, the dean of Columbia College, who were all placed on leave pending a university investigation, see concerns about anti-Semitism as manifestations of entitlement.\n\n\"They will have their own dorm soon,\" Patashnick said about Jewish students, when the head of Columbia Hillel, Brian Cohen, said that many Jews felt uncomfortable in their dormitories following the Oct. 7 attacks.\n\n\"Comes from such a place of privilege,\" Chang-Kim texted. \"Trying to be open-minded to understand but the doors are closing.\"\n\nThe deans ridiculed Cohen's report of offering psychological counseling to Jewish and Israeli students following Oct. 7, suggesting the Jews and Israelis were receiving special treatment that was denied to other groups.\n\n\"Not all heroes wear capes,\" Patashnick texted.\n\n\"If only every identity community had these resources and support,\" Kromm replied.\n\n\"Jewish students deserve better than to have harassment and threats against them dismissed as 'privilege,' and Jewish faculty members deserve better than to be mocked by their colleagues,\" said Chairwoman Foxx. \"These text messages once again confirm the need for serious accountability across Columbia's campus.\"\n\nSeveral exchanges engaged in antisemitic stereotypes regarding Jews and money. One message stated, \"Amazing what $$$$ can do\" as panelists referenced an October 2023 op-ed on antisemitism by campus rabbi, Yonah Hain. Another charged that Brian Cohen, the Lavine Family Executive Director of Columbia/Barnard Hillel, Columbia's center for Jewish life, \"knows exactly what he's doing and how to take full advantage of this moment.

The messages, which called Jewish students \"privileged\" and \"difficult to listen to,\" have intensified discussions over whether the Ivy League campus has become a hotbed of antisemitism.\n\nThe newly released batch of text messages, which were publicized by the US House Committee on Education and the Workforce, incensed the Columbia Jewish Alumni Association. The organization stated that the university needs a \"cultural shift\" to create a safe environment for Jewish students.\n\n\"The further this unfortunate saga unfolds, the more it is clear that antisemitism runs deeper at Columbia than protests and encampments. When faculty talk, students listen,\" the Columbia Jewish Alumni Association wrote in a statement.\n\n\"We know that administrators and professors are the primary culprits of Jewish students feeling threatened at Morningside Heights [the location of the school's New York City campus] and that reality will not change until those responsible for this crisis are held accountable,\" the alumni continued. \"Columbia's epidemic of antisemitism requires a cultural shift to fix it, one that involves honest conversations around how this crisis came to be, who perpetuated it, and what needs to change to ensure that the events of last spring are not repeated in the fall semester.\"\n\nOn June 12, the Washington Free Beacon first reported that Columbia administrators belittled Jewish students and alumni in a group chat. The report set off a firestorm of outrage, resulting in the House Education and Workforce Committee demanding Columbia administrators hand over the entirety of the message exchanges. On Tuesday, the committee released the full chat log to the public.\n\nWhile listening to the panel of Jewish alumni and students speak, Chang-Kim stated that their testimonies were \"difficult to listen to\" but that she was \"trying to be open minded to understand but the doors are closing.\" Chang-Kim referred to one speaker as a \"problem!!!\" for \"painting [Columbia] students as dangerous.\"\n\nThe deans then disparaged a testimony from Brian Cohen, head of Columbia Hillel. Cohen stated that many Jewish students at Columbia felt safer spending time in the Kraft Center for Jewish Life than their own dorms following Hamas' Oct. 7 terrorist attacks on Israel, after which antisemitism on college campuses spiked to unprecedented levels.\n\nPatashnick stated that Cohen was \"taking full advantage of the moment\" and that he saw the \"huge fundraising potential\" in the midst of the controversy over campus antisemitism. Signaling her agreement, Kromm gave Patasnick's text a like and responded, \"You named it.\" Pataschnick continued, saying that Cohen was \"laying the case to case to expand physical space!\" and \"[Jewish students] will have their own dorm soon.\"\n\nColumbia University offers residential living arrangements for African American, Latino, and LGBT+, students, according to its official website. The university has also offered special graduation ceremonies for various racial and sexual minority groups.\n\nChang-Kim continued, dismissing Jewish students as \"privileged.\" Kromm agreed, expressing concern over the well-being of Jewish students who do not support Israel.\n\n\"Comes from such a place of privilege ... hard to hear the woe is me, we need to huddle at the Kraft center. Huh??\" Chang-Kim wrote.\n\n\"Yup. Blind to the idea that non-Israel supporting Jews have no place to come together,\" Kromm wrote.\n\nThe Kraft Center for Jewish Student Life is a hub for Jewish students on Columbia's campus. Its namesake, Robert Kraft, ceased his financial support for Columbia University in April, citing \"virulent hate\" against the Jewish community on campus.\n\nKromm continued, stating that Jewish students have more \"support\" than other groups at Columbia, despite widely reported antisemitic incidents rocking the campus since Oct. 7.\n\n\"If only every identity group had these resources and support,\" Kromm said, adding that Jewish students need to \"share resources!!!\"\n\nKromm fired off a pair of vomit emojis as speakers described an op-ed published by Columbia campus rabbi Yonah Hain lamenting the growing support for Hamas on campus.\n\nChang-Kim then wrote, \"I'm going to throw up.\" The timestamp on these texts align with the testimony of the daughter of a Holocaust survivor who shared how her own daughter was \"hiding in plain sight\" on Columbia's campus following the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel.\n\n\"Amazing what $$$$ can do,\" Kromm wrote in response.\n\nColumbia University has become a poster child for antisemitism in higher education following the Oct. 7 slaughters by Hamas in southern Israel. Jewish students and alumni have expressed outrage, accusing the administration of showing cold indifference to antisemitic incidents on campus. Anti-Israel activists have disrupted Columbia's classes and held unsanctioned protests on campus. Several Columbia student groups have outright banned \"Zionist\" students, a mandate that would exclude the vast majority of Jewish people.\n\nIn April, activists commandeered a central portion of Columbia's campus and erected a \"Gaza solidarity encampment.\" The encampment featured signs which explicitly endorsed Hamas and called for the eradication of Israel. Several ultra-rich Columbia alumni pulled back their donations to the university in response to the growing and palpable anti-Israel sentiment on campus.", "source": {"uri": "algemeiner.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Algemeiner"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Education_and_the_Workforce", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on Education and the Workforce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morningside_Heights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Morningside Heights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kraft", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert Kraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ivy League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Epidemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_survivors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Holocaust survivors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rabbi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quality of life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Higher education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minority group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Judaism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Judaism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Religions", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Religions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://www.algemeiner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2024-04-22T125318Z_2_LYNXNPEK3L0GJ_RTROPTP_4_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-USA-PROTESTS.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9701675", "eventUri": "eng-9701675", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-31", "textStart": 261, "textEnd": 267}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-12", "textStart": 1758, "textEnd": 1765}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 2698, "textEnd": 2704, "freq": 4}], "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

The text's timing aligns with remarks from an audience member and daughter of a Holocaust survivor, Orly Mishan, who described how her own daughter, a Columbia sophomore, \"was hiding in plain sight\" on campus after the Oct. 7 attacks.\n\n\"Amazing what $$$$ can do,\" replied Kromm, the dean of undergraduate student life.\n\nThe new messages suggest that the administrators, who were placed on leave pending a university investigation after a Free Beacon report revealed snippets of their text exchanges, see concerns about anti-Semitism as manifestations of entitlement.\n\n\"They will have their own dorm soon,\" Patashnick, the associate dean for student and family support, said of Jewish students, after the head of Columbia Hillel, Brian Cohen, said that many Jews felt more comfortable spending time at the Kraft Center he runs than in their own dormitories following the Oct. 7 attacks.\n\n\"Comes from such a place of privilege,\" Chang-Kim wrote two minutes later. \"Trying to be open-minded to understand but the doors are closing.\"\n\nThe deans also ridiculed Cohen's efforts to provide support services, including psychological counseling, to Jewish and Israeli students following Oct. 7, implying that they were receiving special treatment denied to other groups.\n\n\"Not all heroes wear capes,\" Patashnick texted sarcastically. \"If only every identity community had these resources and support,\" Kromm replied.\n\nIn 2024, Columbia hosted separate graduation events for black, Asian, Native American, LGBT, and \"Latinx\" students. Jews were one of the only minority groups not to host a ceremony of their own.\n\nThe release of the texts comes as Columbia faces renewed pressure to take action over the ordeal. A petition put forth on Tuesday by Columbia alumni, students, and community members calls on the Ivy League institution to remove Sorett, Chang-Kim, Patashnick, and Kromm \"from their positions immediately.\"\n\n\"All four of the deans implicated must be held accountable and terminated. This incident exposes a profound issue at Columbia that cannot be dismissed,\" the petition reads.\n\n\"Failure to address this quickly can only be interpreted as a lack of seriousness and urgency in dealing with campus antisemitism within Columbia's administration. Columbia University must deliver an immediate and unambiguous message that antisemitism will not be tolerated.\"\n\nSorett, Chang-Kim, Kromm, and Patashnick did not respond to requests for comment. A Columbia spokeswoman pointed the Free Beacon to a June 12 statement saying the school is \"committed to combatting antisemitism and taking sustained, concrete action to ensure Columbia is a campus where Jewish students and everyone in our community feels safe, valued, and able to thrive.\"\n\nOther text messages obtained by the Free Beacon from the same panel show the four deans dismissing claims of anti-Semitism.\n\nAt one point during the panel, Chang-Kim texted Sorett to say the panel \"is difficult to listen to but I'm trying to keep an open mind to learn about this point of view.\" Sorett responded, \"Yup.\"\n\nKromm, meanwhile, used vomit emojis -- \"\ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd2e\" -- to reference an op-ed from Columbia campus rabbi Yonah Hain that raised concerns about the \"normalization of Hamas\" on campus.\n\nAfter the release of those messages, Sorett issued a private apology to Columbia's Board of Visitors, saying the texts did not \"indicate the views of any individual or the team.\" He later informed his colleagues that Chang-Kim, Patashnick, and Kromm had been placed on leave. Sorett was not included in the disciplinary move, and a Columbia spokesman declined to say why.\n\nShortly thereafter, on June 21, the Free Beacon obtained a photo of another text sent during the panel that showed Sorett sneering at Cohen. After Chang-Kim sent Sorett a sarcastic text calling Cohen \"our hero,\" Sorett responded, \"LMAO.\"\n\nOn the same day, Sorett broke his silence on his involvement in the scandal in an email to the Board of Visitors. \"I deeply regret my role in these text exchanges and the impact they have had on our community,\" he wrote. \"I am cooperating fully with the University's investigation of these matters. I am committed to learning from this situation and to the work of confronting antisemitism, discrimination, and hate at Columbia.\"\n\nSorett sent that message after calling the cops on a Free Beacon reporter who knocked on his apartment door to ask him about his involvement in the texts. While Sorett never came to the door or asked the Free Beacon to leave, when the Free Beacon left the building, several New York City police and campus security officers were outside. A Columbia security official said Sorett \"raised a whole big issue.\"\n\nThe new texts obtained by the committee, meanwhile, show Kromm and Chang echoed an assessment from Patashnick that Cohen took \"full advantage of this moment\" for its \"huge fundraising potential.\"\n\nThose texts were sent around the time Cohen cited a visit to Columbia's campus from prominent Israeli politician and human rights activist Natan Sharansky.\n\n\"Who was the speaker he mentioned?\" Kromm asked. \"Natan Sharansky,\" Patshnick responded before sending a link to Sharansky's Wikipedia page.", "source": {"uri":

The text's timing aligns with remarks from an audience member and daughter of a Holocaust survivor, Orly Mishan, who described how her own daughter, a Columbia sophomore, \"was hiding in plain sight\" on campus after the Oct. 7 attacks.\n\n\"Amazing what $$$$ can do,\" replied Kromm, the dean of undergraduate student life.\n\nThe new messages suggest that the administrators, who were placed on leave pending a university investigation after a Free Beacon report revealed snippets of their text exchanges, see concerns about anti-Semitism as manifestations of entitlement.\n\n\"They will have their own dorm soon,\" Patashnick, the associate dean for student and family support, said of Jewish students, after the head of Columbia Hillel, Brian Cohen, said that many Jews felt more comfortable spending time at the Kraft Center he runs than in their own dormitories following the Oct. 7 attacks.\n\n\"Comes from such a place of privilege,\" Chang-Kim wrote two minutes later. \"Trying to be open minded to understand but the doors are closing.\"\n\nThe deans also ridiculed Cohen's efforts to provide support services, including psychological counseling, to Jewish and Israeli students following Oct. 7, implying that they were receiving special treatment denied to other groups.\n\n\"Not all heroes wear capes,\" Patashnick texted sarcastically. \"If only every identity community had these resources and support,\" Kromm replied.\n\nIn 2024, Columbia hosted separate graduation events for black, Asian, Native American, LGBT, and \"Latinx\" students. Jews were one of the only minority groups not to host a ceremony of their own.\n\nThe release of the texts comes as Columbia faces renewed pressure to take action over the ordeal. A petition put forth on Tuesday by Columbia alumni, students, and community members calls on the Ivy League institution to remove Sorett, Chang-Kim, Patashnick, and Kromm \"from their positions immediately.\"\n\n\"All four of the deans implicated must be held accountable and terminated. This incident exposes a profound issue at Columbia that cannot be dismissed,\" the petition reads. \"Failure to address this quickly can only be interpreted as a lack of seriousness and urgency in dealing with campus antisemitism within Columbia's administration. Columbia University must deliver an immediate and unambiguous message that antisemitism will not be tolerated.\"\n\nSorett, Chang-Kim, Kromm, and Patashnick did not respond to requests for comment.

Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.), chairwoman of the House committee who has been leading an investigation into Jew-hatred on campus, said that the texts were proof that Jews at Columbia are being undermined by their own administrators.\n\nPortions of text messages were first reported by The Washington Free Beacon in June; the release on Tuesday is the first time that the full exchange has been shared.

(The initials refer to \"laughing my ass off.\")\n\nSorett has so far avoided suspension by the university, which has been a focus of national attention after an anti-Israel \"Gaza solidarity encampment\" was established on a Columbia quad ahead of congressional testimony from the university's president in April.\n\nCopycat encampments were subsequently established on university campuses across the country.\n\nThe text messages released on Tuesday reveal that Columbia's administrators were dismissive of allegations of Jew-hatred on campus only days earlier.\n\nOrly Mishan, Columbia class of 1994, who described herself as the daughter of a Holocaust survivor and an Arab Jew who had to leave his country, tearfully told the May 31 panel that her daughter, a rising junior at Columbia, had entirely retreated from Jewish life in response to her experiences on campus.\n\n\"After Oct. 7, she stopped doing anything that was Jewish,\" Mishan said. \"She would say that she's hiding in plain sight.\"\n\n\"My daughter finally did break down towards the end of the semester, and called me and said, 'Mom, I can't eat.

Huge fundraising potential.\"\n\nThe texts' veracity and the individuals who sent them were confirmed by the House Education Committee on Tuesday, after Chairwoman Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.) requested the full exchange as part of a probe into allegations of antisemitism at Columbia.\n\nThe chats included previously unreported messages, including from Susan Chang-Kim, the vice dean and chief administrative officer of Columbia College, who said panelists came from \"such a place of privilege.\"\n\n\"Hard to hear the woe is me, we need to huddle at the Kraft center,\" said Chang-Kim, referring to the Jewish life campus building. \"Huh??\"\n\n\"Amazing what $$$$ can do,\" Kromm, the student life dean, said later in the session.\n\nColumbia said it was committed to combating antisemitism and taking action to ensure Jewish students feel safe on campus. Columbia College Dean Josef Sorett, who was in one of the group chats and chimed in with a \"Lmao,\" slang for laughing, is cooperating with an investigation while he continues to serve in the role.\n\nFoxx suggested in a statement that the texts \"again confirm the need for serious accountability\" at Columbia.\n\n\"Jewish students deserve better than to have harassment and threats against them dismissed as 'privilege,' and Jewish faculty members deserve better than to be mocked by their colleagues,\" the lawmaker said.\n\nLast spring, Columbia was roiled by campus protests against Israel's war in Gaza, including a pro-Palestinian encampment at the center of campus to demand divestment. After President Minouche Shafik summoned the NYPD to clear the demonstration, students set up new tents as a smaller group of protesters occupied a campus building.\n\nShafik again called the police, who arrested more than 100 demonstrators. Last month, the cases of 31 of the 46 people who were charged with trespassing in Hamilton Hall were dismissed by the Manhattan district attorney's office.\n\nOthers were offered a deal that would see their charges dismissed if they were not arrested again, but declined the arrangement. They're due back in court later this month.\n\nThe latest administrative shakeup comes as a top Columbia administrator who suspended two pro-Palestinian student groups last fall is retiring from the university.\n\nGerald Rosberg, the senior executive vice president of Columbia, announced in November that Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace repeatedly violated campus event policy and would lose funding.\n\nRosberg is currently one of three named defendants -- the others being Columbia trustees and Shafik -- in a New York Civil Liberties Union lawsuit challenging the suspensions. A motion to dismiss the suit is pending.\n\nA university official said the vice president planned to retire with former Columbia President Lee Bollinger but agreed to stay through the leadership transition.\n\n\"While so much of his work at Columbia took place behind the scenes,\" Shafik said in a memo Monday to students and faculty, \"Gerry has been an invaluable advisor to me over the past year, to my predecessor, Lee Bollinger, over many years, and to everyone fortunate enough to have worked with him.\"\n\nShafik credited Rosberg with the development of its satellite campus in Manhattanville, its pandemic response and the founding of the Columbia Climate School.\n\nRosberg could not immediately be reached for comment, and spokesmen would not share his last day.

The cards instruct recipients to show their student IDs and notify them of possible sanctions, including a semester's suspension, if they don't pack up and leave.\n\nBut when a cochair of Columbia's anti-Semitism committee, David Schizer, told the panel that he'd \"like to see\" this tactic used more aggressively, officials in the audience dismissed the cards as a paper tiger.\n\n\"The delegate cards don't work,\" Matthew Patashnick, Columbia's associate dean for student and family support, wrote in a message to Cristen Kromm, the dean of undergraduate student life, and Susan Chang-Kim, the vice dean and chief administrative officer. His text earned a \"like\" reaction from Kromm, who in later messages used vomit emojis to refer to a Columbia rabbi's op-ed and suggested that allegations of anti-Semitism were driven by \"$$$$.\"\n\nPatashnick and Kromm did not respond to requests for comment. Columbia spokeswoman Samantha Slater declined to comment.\n\nThe messages indicate that some of Columbia's top officials believed that their disciplinary policies were insufficient to deter the disruptive protests that consumed campus in the wake of the Oct. 7 attacks, including the weeks-long encampment that led to the occupation of a major building, Hamilton Hall, in early May.\n\nThe university first distributed delegate cards last November when over 50 students staged a sit-in at Columbia's School of Social Work. It distributed the cards again in April after protesters took over the main campus lawn, called to \"burn Tel Aviv to the ground,\" and drew outside agitators to the university's gates, which were eventually closed to protect students.\n\nColumbia president Minouche Shafik nonetheless held off issuing suspensions for weeks as she attempted to negotiate with the encampment. A decisive crackdown did not come until May 1, after students stormed Hamilton Hall and briefly trapped a janitor inside.\n\nThose events formed the backdrop for the May 31 panel, held during the university's alumni weekend, which was attended by Josef Sorett, the dean of Columbia College, along with Patashnick, Kromm, and Chang-Kim. The officials spent much of the panel exchanging derogatory text messages about the event, some of which were photographed by an audience member and first published by the Washington Free Beacon.\n\nPatashnick, Kromm, and Chang-Kim were placed on leave following the Free Beacon report. Sorett, who has remained in his post, issued a half-hearted apology for the messages but did not acknowledge his role in them.\n\n\"LMAO,\" Sorett texted Chang-Kim after the director of Columbia Hillel, Brian Cohen, said his \"soul has been broken\" by the post-Oct. 7 protests.\n\nThe new tranche of texts underscores that dismissive attitude and offers a window into how the administrators view not just Jewish students but also their own colleagues. In one exchange, which has not been previously reported, Kromm referred to Joseph Defraine Greenwell, Columbia's senior vice president for student affairs, as a \"clown\" and said Greenwell is \"too busy writing a white paper on the value of student affairs.\"\n\nGreenwell did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nOther messages suggest a contempt for Jewish leaders and an ignorance of the accommodations offered to other minority groups. After asserting that Cohen was exploiting the moment's \"fundraising potential,\" Patashnick -- who has since changed his Instagram profile picture to a photo of him standing in front of Jerusalem's Israel Museum -- predicted that Jewish students would \"have their own dorm soon.\"\n\nIn fact, Jews are one of the only groups at Columbia that do not have their own dorm. The university provides separate houses for black, \"Latinx,\" indigenous, and Muslim students who are \"interested in living among students with common identities,\" according to Columbia's housing website, which describes the dorms as \"Special Interest Communities.\" Another dorm, Q House, is \"dedicated to providing a safe living environment for LGBTQ students and their allies.\"\n\n\"Comes from such a place of privilege,\" Chang-Kim texted the group after Cohen said that many Jews felt more comfortable in the Kraft Center for Jewish Life than in their own dormitories.\n\n\"Yup,\" replied Kromm. \"Blind to the idea that non-Israel supporting Jews have no space to come together.\"", "source": {"uri": "freebeacon.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Free Beacon"},

But we must differentiate between political concerns and moral imperatives; it is a moral obligation that any laudation of the indiscriminate atrocities Hamas has perpetrated against Israelis or minimization of our campus' Jewish community's suffering not be accepted as legitimate in this discourse.\"\n\nAnother text message pushed the stereotype of Jews and money even further, mentioning Lavine Family Executive Director Brian Cohen and referring to \"huge fundraising potential\" for him.\n\nOne scathing text sent between the deans said that it was \"hard to hear the woe is me, we need to huddle at the Kraft center,\" which referenced Columbia's Kraft Center for Jewish Life.\n\nFoxx slammed the administrators in the latest release, calling for \"accountability\" on campus at Columbia.\n\n\"Jewish students deserve better than to have harassment and threats against them dismissed as 'privilege,' and Jewish faculty members deserve better than to be mocked by their colleagues,\" Foxx said in the release.\n\n\"These text messages once again confirm the need for serious accountability across Columbia's campus,\" Foxx said.\n\nThis incident at Columbia is not the first of its kind, as antisemitism has been on the rise at universities and other places in America, as The Center Square previously reported.\n\nOne text message from one of the Columbia deans referred to the administration at Columbia as being \"jokers\" for hosting the panel.\n\n\"This panel is really making the administration look like jokers,\" the dean said in one of the text messages.\n\nAnother disparaging text message from this exchange detailed how the Jewish students were \"privileged,\" referencing them as \"coming from a place of privilege.\"\n\nSome of the texts included the use of emojis that seemed to mock the university panel's antisemitism discussion even further, including the usage of a vomit emoji and a nauseous face emoji.", "source": {"uri":

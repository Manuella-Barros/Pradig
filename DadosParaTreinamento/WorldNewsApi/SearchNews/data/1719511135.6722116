{"id": 223737056, "title": "Our Percy was murdered in front of her children by a predator who should have been locked up - we need answers", "text": "Just two weeks earlier, Perseverance Ncube had been celebrating her 35th birthday. A mum-of-two, she had battled adversity but had managed to build a future for herself and her family. A single parent, orphaned at the age of six, she worked two jobs to provide everything she could for her two young children. But her quiet, happy life was brought to a brutal end when a ghost from her past re-emerged. A jealous, violent ex-partner, who would not leave her alone. Obert Moyo was on licence following his release from prison when he murdered Perseverance, or Percy as she was fondly known by her loved ones. READ MORE: The evil monster who tore a family apart after murdering the woman he claimed to love He was also living in the UK illegally. Moyo, who previously lived in Brighton, had been sentenced to 14 years in prison in 2013 for a horrendous attack on another ex-partner. He broke into the woman\u2019s place of work, punched and strangled her and cut her face with a blade. Following his release from jail, Moyo moved north. He met Percy at Potter House church in Bolton town centre in 2021. She was aware of his past, but despite the reservations of friends, and given her trusting nature, Percy gave him a chance. The \u2018intense\u2019 relationship lasted about 18 months, before she caught him messaging and dating other women and told him it was over. He began stalking Percy for months, with neighbours seeing him hanging around outside her home in Little Hulton, Salford. His anger only heightened when he discovered that Percy had begun a new relationship. Moyo turned up outside her house seven times before he eventually murdered Ms Ncube in the early hours of November 10 last year. Her two children were awoken by their mother\u2019s screams, as Moyo attacked her in her bed. When she managed to make a run for it, he pursued her out of the house and down the street. She was able to call 999 as she fought for her life. But armed with a skewer, Moyo caught her and stabbed her to the heart. Her children knelt by her side and preyed that their mum would pull through. He denied murdering her right up until the day he was due to go on trial when he belatedly confessed. Now weeks into his life sentence, with a minimum of 27 years in prison to serve before he can even be considered for release, Percy\u2019s family have spoken out to the Manchester Evening News to express grave concerns as to how Moyo was at liberty to commit this horrendous crime. They want to ensure no family goes through the unbearable trauma that they have endured. \u201cPercy's murder feels so surreal,\u201d her family said in a statement shared with the M.E.N. \u201cYou often hear about horrific murders and crimes on the news, and you pray that it never happens to you or your loved ones. So, to be experiencing this is completely unbearable. It\u2019s terrifying to think about how this predator was allowed to roam our streets and enter society when he was clearly a danger to women.\u201d It is unclear exactly when Moyo was released from prison, but he was handed a 14 year sentence in 2013. As is standard practice, criminals serve either half or two-thirds of their sentence in prison before being granted release under certain conditions. Moyo was at liberty in April 2021 by the time he first met Percy. As part of his release from prison, Moyo was obligated to inform the probation service if he began any new relationships, but he didn\u2019t. At his sentencing hearing, prosecutors said he may well have been recalled to prison if his probation officer knew the true picture. Percy knew about this obligation and had urged Moyo to comply, but he ignored her pleas. Percy\u2019s family said they were sickened to learn Moyo had stalked her for weeks before the killing. \u201cOur family is completely devastated and traumatised by Percy's death,\u201d they said. \u201cEverything has changed, including our relationships. Trusting people is hard now because you genuinely never know who someone is. \u201cPercy was loved by so many. She would give you the clothes off her back, and she worked really hard to provide a future and community for her children. \u201cPercy had the loudest laugh, and you would hear her before you saw her. Even after the hardships she experienced in her life, she persevered and built a life and an amazing support system. \u201cWe miss and love her deeply. One thing we can say is that we showed and told her we loved her all the time. She celebrated her 35th birthday two weeks before her death with her closest friends and family. She knew she was loved, everyone in her life made sure of that. \u201cNow, we're trying to move on and do what's right for her young children. We're incredibly thankful for the support we've received from Percy's friends and the community; they've really lifted us up during this nightmare.\u201d As well as being on licence, Moyo was an illegal immigrant. It is understood he arrived in the country in the early 2000s on a flight from South Africa, and has remained in the UK ever since. He made failed asylum applications, and Moyo was fitted with an electronic tag as part of being bailed by the Home Office. \u201cWe are seeking answers from the Home Office and Probation on why Obert was allowed to be released early from prison and why he wasn't deported soon after his 14-year conviction,\u201d Percy\u2019s family said. \u201cWe don't want to hear 'thoughts, prayers, and sympathies' from them - we want answers and real actions to understand why this happened and to prevent it from happening to other families again.\u201d The M.E.N. asked the Home Office and the probation service for comment. A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cOur thoughts and sympathies are with Ms Ncube\u2019s family. We often deal with significant and complex challenges when seeking to return those who have no right to be in the UK to their country of origin or lawful place of return. \u201cThe government is doing everything possible to reduce legal challenges and to increase the numbers of FNOs [foreign national offenders] being removed.\u201d A Probation Service spokesperson said: \u201cThis was a horrific crime and our thoughts remain with the family of Perseverance Ncube. Serious further offences are rare but have a devastating impact on victims and their families which is why each one is thoroughly investigated so any necessary action can be taken to keep our streets safe.\u201d Detective Chief Inspector Gina Brennand of Greater Manchester Police said: \u201cMoyo was an illegal immigrant. He was on prison licence having served a 14 year term for a violent offence against another woman. He is a danger to women. \u201cPercy's children have been unspeakably brave in trying to save their mother's life. I'd like to pay credit to them and all of those who tried to save her life in the immediate aftermath of Moyo's fatal attack.\u201d Sentencing Moyo earlier this month, Judge Patrick Field KC said of the children: \u201cTheir loss is incalculable. What they witnessed was utterly terrible.\u201c He told Moyo, of Pennington Road, Bolton, who sat with his head in his hands throughout the hearing: \u201cThis was a calculated, premeditated, brutal and wicked offence. I am sure to the appropriate standard that you intended to kill Ms Ncube.\u201c", "summary": "Perseverance Ncube's family have spoken out after her killer Obert Moyo was jailed earlier this month, raising serious questions about his handling by the Probation Service and Home Office", "url": "https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/our-percy-murdered-front-children-29226829", "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29233068.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Percy2.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 15:20:39", "author": "Andrew Bardsley", "authors": ["Andrew Bardsley"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.172}

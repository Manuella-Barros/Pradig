Matviichuk, whose Center for Civil Liberties jointly won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2022, visited Canada this week to meet with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who described her on the social platform X as a \u201cproud Ukrainian who is dedicating her life to defending civil liberties in her homeland and abroad.\u201d During her trip to Ottawa, she sat down with Stephenson and discussed her work documenting more than 72,000 reported human rights abuses during the war, now in its third year. Matviichuk says some of the most egregious crimes have been committed against children, as part of what she condemns as a \u201cwidespread\u201d and \u201cdeliberate\u201d attempt to erase their Ukrainian identities. Last year, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for Putin and Russia\u2019s commissioner for children\u2019s rights for the \u201cunlawful deportation\u201d of Ukrainian children to Russia. Moscow says it does not recognize the arrest warrants. It is hard to get an exact figure, but Ukrainian authorities estimate as many as 20,000 children have been taken. Russia denies this. \u201cThere is an accountability gap,\u201d said Matviichuk. \u201cWe have to create a special tribunal on aggression.\u201d The ICC can\u2019t prosecute the crime of aggression unless both the victim and \u201caggressor state\u201d have ratified and accepted the court\u2019s jurisdiction. Without the creation of a special tribunal, Matviichuk, warns it will be difficult to bring the Russian president to justice. Matviichuk says she is in touch with human rights advocates in Russia, who share heart-wrenching stories of stolen Ukrainian children. She recounted one case, where a young boy was separated from his teenage sister, adopted by a Russian family and given a new name. \u201cHe was crying and said, \u2018This is not my name, I have another name, where\u2019s my sister?\u2019\u201d said Matviichuk. \u201cThis policy destroyed their identity.\u201d \u2014 with files from the Associated Press", "summary": "Nobel laureate Oleksandra Matviichuk is urging the international community to prosecute Russian President Vladimir Putin who she calls the \u201cbiggest child kidnapper in the world.\u201d", "url": "https://globalnews.ca/news/10552752/vladimir-putin-ukrainian-child-kidnapping/", "image": "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/CP171900427.jpg?quality=85&#038;strip=all", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 15:15:33", "author": "Touria Izri", "authors": ["Touria Izri"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ca", "sentiment": -0.059}

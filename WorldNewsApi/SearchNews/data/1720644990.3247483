Editor\u2019s note: This has been translated from Spanish by a member of the editorial board. I am 26 years old, I was born in Mexico City and I am the first commercial pilot in my family. I currently fly as first officer (second in command) on airplanes that belong to the Airbus A320 family for the Mexican airline Volaris, based in Tijuana. These airplanes fly at approximately 39,000 feet at more than 500 miles per hour. I was very fortunate to grow up with the love and support of my parents, Uriel and Edith Astivia, who never limited my dreams, always encouraged me to be whatever I wanted, and, above all, taught me the importance of effort and perseverance. Reaching the sky was only the beginning of this dream and being a woman has never been an obstacle. From a very young age, my passion for traveling, seeing new places and learning new cultures started. My family and I traveled frequently, and every time I got on a plane, it filled me with fascination to be there, in such a wonderful artifact. Airports felt like another home. Seeing the pilots and flight attendants, so elegant and with such important jobs, filled me with joy. So when the time came to decide what I wanted to be as an adult, it was very clear I wanted to be a pilot. In my experience, people who are in aviation are rarely the first in their families to do so. In Mexico, in many cases, they have a father, mother, grandfather or uncle who were pilots or flight attendants. But for those of us who do not have family or acquaintances in the field, it is a world full of uncertainty and challenges. That's one of the reasons why it fills me with pride to be the first in my family who dared to enter such a beautiful profession. The road has not been easy at all \u2014 I have encountered many obstacles, such as bureaucracy, machismo, loneliness and distance from the people I love, missing important holidays like Christmas at home and missing out on personal family events. But just as I have had challenges, I have been able to learn from captains with a lot of experience, who after 15 years flying do not lose their capacity for wonder when we get to see unique things. My profession has given me the best sunrises and sunsets that I have seen in my life. And I have lived through the moments of the people I take to their destinations. Nothing fills me with more happiness than seeing the encounters of people who are greeted by their loved ones after leaving the plane, the hugs and tears of happiness when the doors of the airport open and they see each other. And how children are amazed when they get to see the cockpit door open and when the young girls ask me if I am the pilot, and their excitement to know that they can be absolutely whatever they want to be. I also get to see people who are traveling on a plane for the first time and I have the privilege of transporting them. Carrying out a role so full of responsibility \u2014 transporting around 200 people per flight safely and efficiently \u2014 requires study, patience, order and discipline, and simulator sessions every six months where we study in detail the possible failures of the plane and learn to solve them. And it is not only about continually studying the plane, its systems, the weather and the mountains. It is also correct decision-making and learning to work as a team with your crew. And I love when I get to share the cabin with a female captain, because it fills me with motivation to one day be on the left side as first in command. Fortunately, every day I have more female pilot friends, who are breaking the stereotype that aviation is \u201ca man's world\u201d \u2014 because it is not like that. It is full of us, whether as pilots, flight attendants or even in the maintenance area. And if I am clear about one thing, it is that my colleagues leave their soul in what they do. They work with so much passion, love and dedication. So I hope to spend much more time in this industry and continue to see how it continues to be filled with brave and valuable women, full of things to contribute. Finally, I would like to invite everyone to follow their dreams no matter how difficult they seem.", "summary": "The road to becoming a pilot has not been easy.

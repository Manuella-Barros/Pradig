(AP Photo/Michel Euler, File)PARIS (AP) - French authorities on Friday raised preliminary terrorism charges against an 18-year-old accused of a plot targeting spectators attending soccer games at the upcoming Paris Olympics. The interior minister said it was the first such thwarted plot targeting the Games, which start in eight weeks as France is on its highest threat alert level. The man is accused of planning a \"~'violent action\" on behalf of the Islamic State group's jihadist ideology, the national counterterrorism prosecutor's office said in a statement Friday. The man, who was not identified, is behind held in custody pending further investigation. Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said in a statement that members of the General Directorate of Internal Security arrested an 18-year-old man from Chechnya on May 22 on suspicion of being behind a plan to attack soccer events that will be held in the southern city of Saint-Etienne. According to the initial investigation, the man was preparing an attack targeting the Geoffroy-Guichard stadium in Saint-Etienne that will host several soccer matches during the Summer Games. The planned attack was to target spectators and police forces, the statement said. The suspect wanted to attack the Olympic events \"to die and become a martyr,\" the statement also said. France is on in its highest security alert ahead of the Paris Olympics and Paralympics, which are expected to draw millions of visitors, and run July 26-Aug. 11. Soccer matches will take place in cities across France before the final in Paris' Stade de France. Darmanin, the interior minister, did not cite a specific security threat against the soccer event, but has said there are multiple potential threats, including those from Islamic extremist groups, violent environmental activists, far-right groups and cyberattacks from Russia or other adversaries. The Paris Olympics organizing committee said it was made aware of the arrest and praised intelligence and security services. \"~'Security is the highest priority of Paris 2024. We are working daily in close coordination with the Interior Ministry and all stakeholders - and will continue to be fully mobilized,\" it said in a statement. Security concerns are notably high for the the exceptional opening ceremony, which brings more than 100 world leaders to the French capital. It involves boats carrying athletes along the Seine River on a 6-kilometer (3.7-mile) open-air parade and huge crowds watching from the embankments. In April, French President Emmanuel Macron said the July 26 opening ceremony could be moved instead to the country's national stadium if the security threat is deemed too high. Organizers had originally planned to host as many as 600,000 people, most watching free of charge from riverbanks. But security and logistical concerns have led the government to progressively scale back its ambitions. Earlier this year, the overall number of spectators was reduced to around 300,000. The French government also decided that tourists won't be given free access to watch the opening ceremony because of security concerns. Free access will be invitation-only instead. Extra security is also on hand for the Olympic torch relay, which passed on Friday through the monastery outcropping of Mont-Saint-Michel, which sees thousands of tourists daily. ___ Follow AP

(AP Photo/Michel Euler, File)PARIS (AP) - French authorities have handed preliminary terrorism charges to an 18-year-old accused of a plot targeting spectators attending Olympic soccer games. The man is accused of planning a \"~'violent action\" on behalf of the Islamic State group's jihadist ideology, the national counterterrorism prosecutor's office said in a statement Friday. The man, who was not identified, is behind held in custody pending further investigation. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below. PARIS (AP) - France's security authorities have foiled a plan to attack soccer events during the upcoming Paris Olympics, the country's interior minister said Friday. It was the first such thwarted plot targeting the Games, which start in eight weeks as France is on its highest threat alert level. Gerald Darmanin said in a statement that members of the General Directorate of Internal Security arrested an 18-year-old man from Chechnya on May 22 on suspicion of being behind a plan to attack soccer events that will be held in the southern city of Saint-Etienne. According to the initial investigation, the man was preparing an attack targeting the Geoffroy-Guichard stadium in Saint-Etienne that will host several soccer matches during the Summer Games. The planned attack was to target spectators and police forces, the statement said. The suspect wanted to attack the Olympic events \"to die and become a martyr,\" the statement also said. The Paris Olympics will run from July 26-Aug. 11. Soccer matches will take place in cities across France before the final in Paris' Stade de France. France is on in its highest security alert ahead of the Paris Olympics and Paralympics, which are expected to draw millions of visitors. Darmanin, the interior minister, did not cite a specific security threat against the soccer event, but has said there are multiple potential threats, including those from Islamic extremist groups, violent environmental activists, far-right groups and cyberattacks from Russia or other adversaries. The Paris Olympics organizing committee said it was made aware of the arrest and praised intelligence and security services. \"~'Security is the highest priority of Paris 2024. We are working daily in close coordination with the Interior Ministry and all stakeholders - and will continue to be fully mobilized,\" it said in a statement. Security concerns are notably high for the the exceptional opening ceremony, which brings more than 100 world leaders to the French capital. It involves boats carrying athletes along the Seine River on a 6-kilometer (3.7-mile) open-air parade and huge crowds watching from the embankments. In April, French President Emmanuel Macron said the July 26 opening ceremony could be moved instead to the country's national stadium if the security threat is deemed too high. Organizers had originally planned to host as many as 600,000 people, most watching free of charge from riverbanks. But security and logistical concerns have led the government to progressively scale back its ambitions. Earlier this year, the overall number of spectators was reduced to around 300,000. The French government also decided that tourists won't be given free access to watch the opening ceremony because of security concerns. Free access will be invitation-only instead. Extra security is also on hand for the Olympic torch relay, which passed on Friday through the monastery outcropping of Mont-Saint-Michel, which sees thousands of tourists daily. ___ Follow AP

It involves boats carrying athletes along the River Seine on a 6-kilometer (3.7-mile) parade and huge crowds watching from the embankments.\n\nIn April, French President Emmanuel Macron said the July 26 opening ceremony for the Paris Olympics planned on the River Seine could be moved instead to the country's national stadium if the security threat is deemed too high.\n\nMacron said France's law enforcement forces will be mobilized at an exceptional level for the security of the open-air event, \"but if we think there are risks, depending on our analysis of the context, we have fallback scenarios.\"\n\nOrganizers had originally planned a grandiose opening ceremony for as many as 600,000 people, most watching free of charge from riverbanks.

It was the first such thwarted plot targeting the Games, which start in eight weeks as France is on its highest threat alert level.\n\nGerald Darmanin said in a statement that members of the General Directorate of Internal Security arrested an 18-year-old man from Chechnya on May 22 on suspicion of being behind a plan to attack soccer events that will be held in the southern city of Saint-Etienne.\n\nAccording to the initial investigation, the man was preparing an attack targeting the Geoffroy-Guichard stadium in Saint-Etienne that will host several soccer matches during the Summer Games. The planned attack was to target spectators and police forces, the statement said. The suspect wanted to attack the Olympic events \"to die and become a martyr,\" the statement also said.\n\nThe Paris Olympics will run from July 26-Aug. 11. Soccer matches will take place in cities across France before the final in Paris' Stade de France.\n\nFrance is on in its highest security alert ahead of the Paris Olympics and Paralympics, which are expected to draw millions of visitors.\n\nDarmanin, the interior minister, did not cite a specific security threat against the soccer event, but has said there are multiple potential threats, including those from Islamic extremist groups, violent environmental activists, far-right groups and cyberattacks from Russia or other adversaries.\n\nThe Paris Olympics organizing committee said it was made aware of the arrest and praised intelligence and security services. ''Security is the highest priority of Paris 2024. We are working daily in close coordination with the Interior Ministry and all stakeholders -- and will continue to be fully mobilized,'' it said in a statement.\n\nSecurity concerns are notably high for the the exceptional opening ceremony, which brings more than 100 world leaders to the French capital. It involves boats carrying athletes along the Seine River on a 6-kilometer (3.7-mile) open-air parade and huge crowds watching from the embankments.\n\nIn April, French President Emmanuel Macron said the July 26 opening ceremony could be moved instead to the country's national stadium if the security threat is deemed too high.\n\nOrganizers had originally planned to host as many as 600,000 people, most watching free of charge from riverbanks. But security and logistical concerns have led the government to progressively scale back its ambitions. Earlier this year, the overall number of spectators was reduced to around 300,000.\n\nThe French government also decided that tourists won't be given free access to watch the opening ceremony because of security concerns. Free access will be invitation-only instead.\n\nExtra security is also on hand for the Olympic torch relay, which passed on Friday through the monastery outcropping of Mont-Saint-Michel, which sees thousands of tourists daily.\n\nFollow AP coverage of Paris Olympics https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\n\nThe Associated Press", "source": {"uri": "princegeorgecitizen.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Prince George Citizen"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interior_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interior minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-\u00c9tienne", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Saint-\u00c9tienne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-\u00c9tienne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G\u00e9rald_Darmanin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "G\u00e9rald Darmanin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chechnya", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chechnya"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chechnya"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestapo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gestapo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_extremism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Islamic extremism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martyr", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Martyr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mont-Saint-Michel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mont-Saint-Michel"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_France", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_the_Interior_(France)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minister of the Interior (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_flame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic flame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Advisories_and_Patches", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Advisories and Patches", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/FAQs,_Help,_and_Tutorials", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/FAQs, Help, and Tutorials", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/shared/feeds/cp/2024/05/e6fea8d6-3351-4deb-8926-7a867e3ce36b.jpg;w=1200;h=800;mode=crop", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9614740", "eventUri": "eng-9614740", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-26", "dateEnd": "-08-11", "textStart": 980, "textEnd": 995}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-22", "textStart": 443, "textEnd": 449}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-26", "textStart": 2214, "textEnd": 2221}], "sentiment": -0.3411764705882353, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

The interior minister said it was the first such thwarted plot targeting the Games, which start in eight weeks as France is on its highest threat alert level.\n\nThe man is accused of planning a ''violent action'' on behalf of the Islamic State group's jihadist ideology, the national counterterrorism prosecutor's office said in a statement Friday.

''Security is the highest priority of Paris 2024. We are working daily in close coordination with the Interior Ministry and all stakeholders -- and will continue to be fully mobilized,'' it said in a statement.\n\nSecurity concerns are notably high for the the exceptional opening ceremony, which brings more than 100 world leaders to the French capital. It involves boats carrying athletes along the Seine River on a 6-kilometer (3.7-mile) open-air parade and huge crowds watching from the embankments.\n\nIn April, French President Emmanuel Macron said the July 26 opening ceremony could be moved instead to the country's national stadium if the security threat is deemed too high.\n\nOrganizers had originally planned to host as many as 600,000 people, most watching free of charge from riverbanks. But security and logistical concerns have led the government to progressively scale back its ambitions. Earlier this year, the overall number of spectators was reduced to around 300,000.\n\nThe French government also decided that tourists won't be given free access to watch the opening ceremony because of security concerns. Free access will be invitation-only instead.\n\nExtra security is also on hand for the Olympic torch relay, which passed on Friday through the monastery outcropping of Mont-Saint-Michel, which sees thousands of tourists daily.\n\nFollow AP coverage of Paris Olympics https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The interior minister said it was the first such thwarted plot targeting the Games, which start in eight weeks as France is on its highest threat alert level.\n\nThe man is accused of planning a ''violent action'' on behalf of the Islamic State group's jihadist ideology, the national counterterrorism prosecutor's office said in a statement Friday. The man, who was not identified, is behind held in custody pending further investigation.\n\nInterior Minister Gerald Darmanin said in a statement that members of the General Directorate of Internal Security arrested an 18-year-old man from Chechnya on May 22 on suspicion of being behind a plan to attack soccer events that will be held in the southern city of Saint-Etienne.\n\nAccording to the initial investigation, the man was preparing an attack targeting the Geoffroy-Guichard stadium in Saint-Etienne that will host several soccer matches during the Summer Games. The planned attack was to target spectators and police forces, the statement said. The suspect wanted to attack the Olympic events \"to die and become a martyr,\" the statement also said.\n\nFrance is on in its highest security alert ahead of the Paris Olympics and Paralympics, which are expected to draw millions of visitors, and run July 26-Aug. 11. Soccer matches will take place in cities across France before the final in Paris' Stade de France.\n\nDarmanin, the interior minister, did not cite a specific security threat against the soccer event, but has said there are multiple potential threats, including those from Islamic extremist groups, violent environmental activists, far-right groups and cyberattacks from Russia or other adversaries.\n\nThe Paris Olympics organizing committee said it was made aware of the arrest and praised intelligence and security services. ''Security is the highest priority of Paris 2024. We are working daily in close coordination with the Interior Ministry and all stakeholders -- and will continue to be fully mobilized,'' it said in a statement.\n\nSecurity concerns are notably high for the the exceptional opening ceremony, which brings more than 100 world leaders to the French capital. It involves boats carrying athletes along the Seine River on a 6-kilometer (3.7-mile) open-air parade and huge crowds watching from the embankments.\n\nIn April, French President Emmanuel Macron said the July 26 opening ceremony could be moved instead to the country's national stadium if the security threat is deemed too high.\n\nOrganizers had originally planned to host as many as 600,000 people, most watching free of charge from riverbanks. But security and logistical concerns have led the government to progressively scale back its ambitions. Earlier this year, the overall number of spectators was reduced to around 300,000.\n\nThe French government also decided that tourists won't be given free access to watch the opening ceremony because of security concerns. Free access will be invitation-only instead.\n\nExtra security is also on hand for the Olympic torch relay, which passed on Friday through the monastery outcropping of Mont-Saint-Michel, which sees thousands of tourists daily.\n\nFollow AP coverage of Paris Olympics https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro

Earlier this year, the overall number of spectators was reduced to about 300,000.\n\nThe French government also decided that tourists will not be given free access to watch the opening ceremony because of security concerns. Free access will be invitation-only instead.\n\nExtra security is also on hand for the Olympic torch relay, which passed on Friday through the monastery outcrop of Mont Saint-Michel, which draws thousands of tourists daily.", "source": {"uri": "shropshirestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Shropshire Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The planned attack was to target spectators and police forces, the statement said. The suspect wanted to attack the Olympic events \"to die and become a martyr,\" the statement also said.\n\nThe Paris Olympics will run from July 26-Aug. 11. Soccer matches will take place in cities across France before the final in Paris' Stade de France.\n\nFrance is on high security alert ahead of the Paris Olympics and Paralympics, which are expected to draw millions of visitors to the country.\n\nDarmanin, the interior minister, did not cite a specific security threat against the soccer event, but said there are multiple potential threats, including those from Islamic extremist groups, violent environmental activists, far-right groups and cyberattacks from Russia or other adversaries.\n\nSecurity concerns are notably high for the the exceptional opening ceremony, which bring more than 100 world leaders to the French capital. It involves boats carrying athletes along the River Seine on a 6-kilometer (3.7-mile) parade and huge crowds watching from the embankments.\n\nIn April, French President Emmanuel Macron said the July 26 opening ceremony for the Paris Olympics planned on the River Seine could be moved instead to the country's national stadium if the security threat is deemed too high.\n\nMacron said France's law enforcement forces will be mobilized at an exceptional level for the security of the open-air event, \"but if we think there are risks, depending on our analysis of the context, we have fallback scenarios.\"\n\nOrganizers had originally planned a grandiose opening ceremony for as many as 600,000 people, most watching free of charge from riverbanks.

In October 2020, another teenage Chechen extremist, who had come to France as a refugee, beheaded a teacher in a suburb northwest of Paris. And last October, a 20-year-old Chechen who had sworn allegiance to the Islamic State killed a teacher in the northern town of Arras.

northern French town of Arras, shocking the country.\n\nThe traditional Olympic torch relay is currently underway in France, with the Olympic flame on a 12,000-kilometre trip surrounded by a \"security bubble\" of 100 officers including anti-drone specialists and anti-terror police.\n\nA total of 78 people were arrested for trying to disrupt the relay and 30 suspect drones were intercepted during the first three weeks, according to figures from the interior ministry this week.\n\nThe Olympics have been attacked in the past -- most infamously in 1972 in Munich and again in

( Image Source :Getty Images )\n\nFrench authorities have raised preliminary terrorism charges against an 18-year-old man accused of plotting an attack on spectators at the upcoming Paris Olympics. French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin confirmed on Friday that this is the first thwarted plot targeting the Games, which are set to commence in eight weeks amid heightened security, news agency AP reported.\n\nThe suspect, who remains unidentified, allegedly planned a \"violent action\" inspired by the Islamic State group's jihadist ideology, according to the national counterterrorism prosecutor's office, AP's report stated. He is currently being held in custody pending further investigation.\n\nFrench Interior Minister Darmanin revealed that members of the General Directorate of Internal Security apprehended the 18-year-old from Chechnya on May 22. The suspect is accused of targeting the Geoffroy-Guichard stadium in Saint-Etienne, which is scheduled to host several soccer matches during the Summer Games. The planned attack aimed at both spectators and police forces, with the suspect reportedly seeking to \"die and become a martyr\", the report mentioned.\n\nThe Paris Olympics, which will run from 26 July to 11 August, are set to draw millions of visitors. Soccer matches are slated to take place across various cities in France, culminating in the final at Paris' Stade de France. The Games have placed the country on its highest security alert, with authorities wary of threats from Islamic extremist groups, violent environmental activists, far-right groups, and potential cyberattacks from adversaries, including Russia.\n\nThe Paris Olympics organising committee acknowledged the arrest and commended the efforts of intelligence and security services. \"Security is the highest priority of Paris 2024. We are working daily in close coordination with the Interior Ministry and all stakeholders -- and will continue to be fully mobilised,\" it stated.\n\nALSO READ | 2024 Paris Olympics: Over 60% Menu Set To Be Vegan, Vegetarian In Paris Games\n\nSecurity concerns are particularly acute for the opening ceremony, which is expected to attract over 100 world leaders, AP reported. Initially planned as an open-air parade along the Seine River, involving boats carrying athletes, the ceremony's scale has been progressively reduced due to security and logistical concerns. French President Emmanuel Macron has indicated that the ceremony could be relocated to the national stadium if the threat level remains high.\n\nEarlier plans to accommodate up to 600,000 spectators have been halved to around 300,000, with free access to the opening ceremony restricted to invitation-only due to security issues. Enhanced security measures are also in place for the Olympic torch relay, which recently passed through the historic site of Mont-Saint-Michel, drawing thousands of tourists daily, according to AP.", "source": {"uri": "news.abplive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "english"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_the_Interior_(France)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minister of the Interior (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islamic State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterterrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Counterterrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G\u00e9rald_Darmanin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "G\u00e9rald Darmanin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ideology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getty_Images", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Getty Images"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jihadism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jihadism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "News agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_extremism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Islamic extremism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martyr", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Martyr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-\u00c9tienne", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saint-\u00c9tienne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-\u00c9tienne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chechnya", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chechnya"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chechnya"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mont-Saint-Michel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mont-Saint-Michel"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberattack", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cyberattack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestapo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gestapo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Advisories_and_Patches", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Advisories and Patches", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/FAQs,_Help,_and_Tutorials", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/FAQs, Help, and Tutorials", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2024/05/31/3ef9abebf15b355a5c21513405cc08c2171717878061625_original.jpg?impolicy=abp_cdn&imwidth=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9614740", "eventUri": "eng-9614740", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-26", "dateEnd": "-08-11", "textStart": 65, "textEnd": 85, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-22", "textStart": 969, "textEnd": 975}], "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 454875885, "relevance": 2}

Pinch-hitter Rob Refsnyder singled home the tying run before Duran tagged on Devers\u2019 fly ball and slid home just ahead of left fielder Stuart Fairchild\u2019s throw from foul ground. \u201cI decided to go home right away on the sacrifice fly,\u201d Duran said. \u201cI was fully committed to going home.\u201d Kenley Jansen retired the Reds in the ninth for his 14th save in 15 chances. He got a huge assist from Duran, who leaped to get his glove above the center field fence to rob Fairchild of a tying home run. \u201cI thought the ball was way gone,\u201d Red Sox manager Alex Cora said. \u201cI just hit it to the wrong part of the field,\u201d Fairchild said. \u201cI saw it go up, and off the bat I was pretty stoked. And obviously he made a great catch.\u201d Jansen\u2019s save was his 434th, and he moved ahead of Baltimore\u2019s Craig Kimbrel into sole possession of fifth on the career list. Dominic Smith homered in the fifth inning and Connor Wong doubled home another run in the sixth as Boston overcame a rocky start by Nick Pivetta, who allowed three runs in 4 1/3 innings. Spencer Steer hit a two-run homer and Elly De La Cruz had a solo shot for Cincinnati, which won the first game of the interleague series 5-2 on Friday night. The Reds ran themselves out of two more runs. TJ Friedl was thrown out at the plate trying to score on grounder to third base in the fifth inning, and Jake Fraley was caught trying to come home on a dribbler fielded by Wong out in the front of the plate. Frankie Montas had a solid outing for the Reds, allowing two runs and five hits through six innings with four strikeouts and a walk. \u201cHe threw tons of strikes with all of his pitches,\u201d Cincinnati manager David Bell said. \u201cAnd if he continues to do that with all of his stuff, he has a lot of success ahead. Justin Wilson (1-1) was charged with the two Boston runs in the eighth. Zack Kelly (2-1) got the final out in the seventh inning and picked up the win. TRAINER\u2019S ROOM Red Sox: OF Wilyer Abreu was back in the lineup for the first time since June 2. The 24-year-old rookie was sidelined with a right ankle sprain. He had two hits and scored on Saturday.

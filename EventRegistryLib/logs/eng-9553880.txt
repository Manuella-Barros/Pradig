Russia's emergency service said a drone attack damaged a pumping station building at Gazprom's Neftekhim Salavat oil processing, petrochemical and fertiliser complex in Bashkiria, Russia's largest such plant, state RIA news agency reported.\n\nThe governor of the region said the plant was functioning as usual despite the attack. Reuters could not establish where the drone was launched and what kind of device it was. The nearest government-held part of Ukraine is about 1,400 km away. The Kyiv source said the drone flew 1,500 km, calling it a record, and hit a catalytic cracking unit in an attack that showed \"Russian refineries and oil depots serving the military complex cannot feel safe even in the deep rear\".\n\nMoscow says such attacks amount to terrorism and has launched what it says are revenge strikes that have pounded Ukraine's energy infrastructure since mid-March, raising fears about the resilience of the Ukrainian power system. Kyiv has stepped up its drone attacks on oil processing facilities in Russia since the start of the year, disrupting 15% of Russia's oil refining capacity according to an estimate by a NATO official at the beginning of April.\n\nReuters calculations on April 15 showed that Russia had been able to repair some key oil refineries hit by drones, reducing capacity idled by the attacks to about 10% from almost 14% at the end of March. REACHING PARITY\n\nUnable to rapidly match Russia's vast arsenal of cruise and ballistic missiles, Kyiv has focused on developing and producing long-range drones so it can hit back at Russia, which has bombed Ukraine throughout the 26-month-old invasion. The head of the state arms manufacturer said on Wednesday that Ukraine was producing the same number of deep strike drones as Russia, claiming to have reached parity on a key type of weapon Moscow has used for long-range attacks.\n\nThe Ukrainian source said that Kyiv's drones also struck two oil depots near the town of Anapa in Russia's southern Krasnodar region causing large-scale fires overnight. Both attacks were conducted by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), the source said. The depots were used as transshipment points to supply fuel to Russian troops in the nearby occupied peninsula of Crimea, the source said.\n\nRussian authorities said a Ukrainian drone attack caused a fire and damaged several oil tanks at a refinery in Krasnodar region.

The facility is more than 700 miles from the Ukrainian border, in a sign that Ukraine is increasingly capable of striking further into Russia.\n\nAn official from Ukraine's special services, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive military matters, said Ukraine was behind the assault. The official said Ukraine was also responsible for two other drone strikes overnight that hit oil depots in Russia's Krasnodar region, southeast of Ukraine.\n\nThe strikes follow some 20 similar attacks since the beginning of the year. Military analysts say they are an attempt by Ukraine to disrupt the Russian military's logistical routes and combat operations by targeting the facilities that supply fuel for its tanks, ships, and planes.\n\nUkrainian officials also hope the strikes can undermine the Russian energy complex, which is at the core of the country's economy and war effort -- accounting for about one-third of Russia's federal budget revenue -- although it is too early to say whether they can have any serious impact.\n\nThe United States government has publicly urged Ukraine to stop its attacks on Russian oil refineries out of concern that they could affect global oil markets.\n\nBut Ukraine has instead doubled down on its strategy. Last month, Ukraine struck Russia's third-largest refinery, located about 800 miles from its border with Russia. The refinery hit Thursday is also one of Russia's biggest, with a capacity to process 10 million metric tons of oil a year, according to Gazprom, its owner.\n\nKhabirov, the head of the Bashkiria region, said the attack did not disrupt the refinery's operations. He described the strike as \"an attempt to discredit our holiday,\" in reference to Russia's commemoration of the Soviet Union's victory in World War II.\n\nUkraine's rationale for these attacks appears to be that by disrupting Russian military logistics, it could buy time for Ukrainian troops on the battlefield, who are outnumbered, undergunned, and steadily losing ground to Russian forces.\n\nIn recent months, Ukraine has increasingly been relying on asymmetrical tactics to disrupt Russian operations, including sabotage activities against railway infrastructure and ammunition depots.\n\n\"It's no secret that a big army like Russia, with a lot of equipment, consumes a lot of fuel,\" said Serhii Kuzan, chair of the Ukrainian Center for Security and Cooperation, an independent research group.\n\n\"So the strategy here is very simple: create fuel shortages,\" he said, both in the long term by attacking refineries and in the short term by targeting oil depots.\n\nThe two oil depots that were hit Thursday in the Krasnodar region are near Novorossiysk, a major Russian port that is home to part of the Black Sea Fleet. They are also close to the Russian-occupied Crimean Peninsula, where the Russian military has stockpiled fuel and ammunition that it funnels to the battlefields in southern Ukraine.\n\nRussian local authorities confirmed that several drones had fallen on the oil depots, starting a fire and damaging several tanks.\n\nThe Russian state-run news agency TASS on Thursday blamed Ukraine for the recent attacks on oil facilities.\n\nRussia has targeted Ukraine's logistical lines and energy system on a much larger scale, with relentless assaults on power facilities and transportation infrastructure. On Wednesday, Russian missiles and drones damaged several power plants across Ukraine, officials said, part of a concerted effort to degrade Ukraine's energy grid and deepen the hardship for civilians.\n\nThe Ukrainian strikes against Russian oil refineries appear to have more than an immediate military objective. They are also seemingly aimed at putting pressure on the Russian economy, experts say.\n\nDamien Ernst, an energy specialist and professor at the University of Liege in Belgium, said the strikes have taken more than 10 percent of Russia's oil-refining capacity offline, temporarily reducing the country's ability to turn its crude oil into usable products such as gasoline, diesel, and petrol.\n\n\"There are shortages of diesel and petrol in some regions and prices are rising,\" said Ernst. But he added that Russia's prewar oil refining capacity covered about twice the amount consumed domestically, meaning that gasoline shortages at Russian pumps are a long way off.\n\nStill, Russia increased gasoline imports from neighboring Belarus in March, according to Reuters, and imposed a six-month ban on gasoline exports in March.\n\nErnst added that the strikes have had no major effect on international crude oil prices -- as the US government feared -- because Russia now exports more of its crude oil, including large amounts to India, to compensate for the loss in refining capacity, and because there is currently a surplus of crude oil on international markets.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The facility is more than 700 miles from the Ukrainian border, in a sign that Ukraine is increasingly capable of striking further into Russia.\n\nAn official from Ukraine's special services, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive military matters, said Ukraine was behind the assault. The official said Ukraine was also responsible for two other drone strikes overnight that hit oil depots in Russia's Krasnodar region, southeast of Ukraine.\n\nThe strikes follow some 20 similar attacks since the beginning of the year. Military analysts say they are an attempt by Ukraine to disrupt the Russian military's logistical routes and combat operations by targeting the facilities that supply fuel for its tanks, ships and planes.\n\nUkrainian officials also hope the strikes can undermine the Russian energy complex, which is at the core of the country's economy and war effort -- accounting for about a third of Russia's federal budget revenue -- although it is too early to say whether they can have any serious impact.\n\nThe United States government has publicly urged Kyiv to stop its attacks on Russian oil refineries out of concern that they could affect global oil markets.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_refinery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oil refinery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiy_Khabirov", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Radiy Khabirov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bashkir_Autonomous_Soviet_Socialist_Republic", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bashkir Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_operation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military operation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salavat,_Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Salavat, Russia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Salavat, Russia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakhstan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kazakhstan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kazakhstan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krasnodar", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Krasnodar"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Krasnodar"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Preparation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/09/multimedia/09ukraine-strikes-1-bjlw/09ukraine-strikes-1-bjlw-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553880", "eventUri": "eng-9553880", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

Marjorie Taylor Greene tried and failed in a sudden move Wednesday to oust Speaker Mike Johnson, her long-shot effort swiftly and resoundingly rejected by Democrats and Republicans tired of the political chaos.\n\nOne of former President Donald Trump's biggest supporters in Congress, Greene stood on the House floor and read a long list of \"transgressions\" she said Johnson had committed as speaker. Colleagues booed in protest.\n\nGreene, of Georgia, criticized Johnson's leadership as \"pathetic, weak and unacceptable.\"\n\nAs she recited the grievance-laden measure that lasted more than 10 minutes, Republicans lined up on the House floor to shake Johnson's hand and pat him on the back.\n\n\"Given a choice between advancing Republican priorities or allying with Democrats to preserve his own personal power, Johnson regularly chooses to ally himself with Democrats,\" Greene said, reading from her resolution.\n\nShe concluded with the official call for his removal: \"Now, therefore be it resolved that the office of the speaker of the House of Representatives is hereby declared to be vacant.\"\n\nNo sooner had Greene triggered the vote on her motion to vacate the House speaker from his office than Republican Majority Leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana countered by calling first for a vote to table it.\n\nAn overwhelming majority, 359-43, kept Johnson in his job, for now. Seven Democrats voted \"present\" and 32 voted against putting the motion down, with the others joining Republicans in helping Johnson keep the House speakership.\n\n\"As I've said from the beginning, and I've made clear here every day, I intend to do my job,\" Johnson said afterward. \"And I'll let the chips fall where they may. In my view, that is leadership.\"\n\nIt's the second time in a matter of months that Republicans have worked to oust their own House speaker, an unheard-of level of party turmoil, with a move rarely seen in U.S. history.\n\nThe tally shows the strengths but also the stark limits of Johnson's hold on the gavel, and the risks ahead for any Republican trying to lead the GOP in the Trump era. Without Democratic help, Johnson likely would have faced a more dismal outcome.\n\nAll told, 11 Republicans voted to proceed with Greene's effort, more than it took to oust then-House speaker Kevin McCarthy last fall, which was a first in U.S. history. And the threat still lingers -- any single lawmaker can call up the motion to vacate the House speaker.\n\nJohnson said he hoped it \"is the end of the personality politics.\"\n\nAs Greene pressed ahead with the snap vote despite pushback from Republicans at the highest levels, including Trump, GOP lawmakers filtered toward Johnson, giving him pats on the back and grasping his shoulder to assure him of their support.\n\nThe Georgia Republican had vowed weeks ago she would force a vote on the motion to vacate the Republican House speaker if he dared to advance a foreign aid package for Ukraine, which was overwhelmingly approved late last month and signed into law.\n\nBut in recent days it seemed her effort had cooled, as she and Johnson met repeatedly for a potential resolution.\n\nJohnson, of Louisiana, marched on, saying he had been willing to take the risk to approve the foreign aid, believing it was important for the U.S. to back Ukraine against Russia's invasion and explaining he wanted to be on the \"right side of history.\"\n\nIn a highly unusual move, the House speaker received a boost from Democrats led by Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, whose leadership team had said it was time to \"turn the page\" on the GOP turmoil and vote to table Greene's resolution -- almost ensuring Johnson's job is saved, for now.\n\n\"Our decision to stop Marjorie Taylor Greene from plunging the country into further chaos is rooted in our commitment to solve problems,\" Jeffries said after the vote.\n\nTrump had also weighed in after Johnson trekked to Mar-a-Lago last month for support, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee giving the House speaker his nod of approval. And Trump's hand-picked leader at the Republican National Committee urged House Republicans off the move.\n\nAhead of House voting, Trump said on social media, \"I absolutely love Marjorie Taylor Greene,\" but he said Republicans need to be fighting now to defeat Democrats in the November election. He urged Republicans to table Greene's motion.\n\n\"At some point, we may very well be, but this is not the time,\" Trump said, to oust the House speaker.\n\nThe move now poses its own political risks for Greene, a high-profile provocateur who has moved to the forefront of the party with her own massive following and proximity to Trump.\n\nGreene was determined to force her colleagues to be on the record with their vote -- putting them in the politically uncomfortable position of backing the House speaker and being seen as joining forces with Democrats to save him.\n\n\"I'm proud of what I did today,\" Greene said afterward on the Capitol steps.\n\nWhile reporters and camera crews crowded around Greene and ally Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., a group of other Republicans gathered on the steps trying to shift the attention away from her and make their own views known.\n\nMassie and fellow Republican Paul Gosar, of Arizona, were the only ones who had publicly said they would support Greene in her efforts to recall Johnson.\n\nRep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., said of those trying to remove the House speaker, \"They're pretty good at getting attention, but they have not been recognized for their ability to get things done.\"\n\nHe said if they keep pushing to oust Johnson, \"I think you can expect more of the same: Failure.\"\n\nRep. Carlos Gim\u00e9nez, a Florida Republican, said of Greene, \"She doesn't represent the Republican Party. I'm tired of of this being the face or the voice of the party and getting attention. That's all she wants, is the attention.\"\n\nRep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., called for Greene and Massie to be punished for their actions.\n\nHad Democrats not taken the unusual move to help, the vote most likely would have ended differently for Johnson, who holds one of the slimmest majorities in the House in modern times, with no votes to spare.\n\nLast year, the House chamber was hurled into chaos when eight Republicans voted to remove McCarthy as House speaker and Democrats declined to help save him.\n\nOusting McCarthy resulted in a nearly monthlong search for a new GOP leader, bringing the chamber to a standstill with an episode Republicans wanted to avoid repeating ahead of the November election.\n\nInformation for this article was contributed by Lisa Mascaro, Kevin Freking, Stephen Groves, Mary Clare Jalonick, Michelle Price and Farnoush Amiri of The Associated Press and by Catie Edmondson, Carl Hulse and Kayla Guo of The New York Times.\n\nRep.

Without Democratic help, Johnson would have certainly faced a more dismal outcome.\n\nAll told, 11 Republicans voted to proceed with Greene's effort, more than it took to oust then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy last fall, a first in U.S. history. And the threat still lingers -- any single lawmaker can call up the motion to vacate the Speaker.\n\nJohnson said he hoped it \"is the end of the personality politics.\"\n\nAs Greene pressed ahead with the snap vote despite pushback from Republicans at the highest levels, including Trump, GOP lawmakers filtered towards Johnson, giving him pats on the back and grasping his shoulder to assure him of their support.\n\nThe Georgia Republican had vowed weeks ago she would force a vote on the motion to vacate the Republican Speaker if he dared to advance a foreign aid package for Ukraine, which was overwhelmingly approved late last month and signed into law.\n\nBut in recent days it seemed her effort had cooled, as she and Johnson met repeatedly for a potential resolution.\n\nJohnson of Louisiana marched on, saying he had been willing to take the risk to approve the foreign aid, believing it was important for the U.S. to back Ukraine against Russia's invasion and explaining he wanted to be on the \"right side of history.\"\n\nIn a highly unusual move, the speaker received a boost from Democrats led by Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, whose leadership team had said it was time to \"turn the page\" on the GOP turmoil and vote to table Greene's resolution -- almost ensuring Johnson's job is saved, for now.\n\n\"Our decision to stop Marjorie Taylor Greene from plunging the country into further chaos is rooted in our commitment to solve problems,\" Jeffries said after the vote.\n\nTrump had also weighed in after Johnson trekked to Mar-a-Lago last month for support, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee giving the Speaker his nod of approval. And Trump's hand-picked leader at the Republican National Committee urged House Republicans off the move.\n\nAhead of House voting, Trump said on social media, \"I absolutely love Marjorie Taylor Greene,\" but he said Republicans need to be fighting now to defeat Democrats in the November election. He urged Republicans to table Greene's motion.\n\n\"At some point, we may very well be, but this is not the time,\" Trump said, to oust the speaker.\n\nThe move now poses its own political risks for Greene, a high-profile provocateur who has moved to the forefront of the party with her own massive following and proximity to Trump.\n\nGreene was determined to force her colleagues to be on the record with their vote - putting them in the politically uncomfortable position of backing the speaker and seen as joining forces with Democrats to save him.\n\n\"I'm proud of what I did today,\" Greene said afterward on the Capitol steps.\n\nWhile reporters and camera crews crowded around Greene and ally Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, a group of other Republicans gathered on the steps trying to shift the attention away from her and make their own views known.\n\nRep. Dusty Johnson, a South Dakota Republican, said of those trying to remove the Speaker, \"They're pretty good at getting attention, but they have not been recognized for their ability to get things done.\"\n\nHe said if they keep pushing to oust the Speaker, \"I think you can expect more of the same: Failure.\"\n\nRep. Carlos Gim\u00e9nez, a Florida Republican, said of Greene: \"She doesn't represent the Republican Party. I'm tired of of this being the face or the voice of the party and getting attention. That's all she wants, is the attention.\"\n\nRep. Mike Lawler, a New York Republican, called for Greene and Massie to be punished for their actions.\n\nHad Democrats not taken the unusual move to help, the vote would most likely have ended differently for Johnson who holds one of the slimmest majorities in the House in modern times, with no votes to spare.\n\nLast year, the House chamber was hurled into chaos when eight Republicans voted to remove McCarthy from the Speaker's office and Democrats declined to help save him.\n\nOusting McCarthy resulted in a nearly monthlong search for a new GOP leader, bringing the chamber to a standstill with an episode Republicans wanted to avoid ahead of the November election.\n\n___\n\nRepublished with permission of The Associated Press.", "source": {"uri": "floridapolitics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Florida Politics - Campaigns & Elections.

Marjorie Taylor Greene tried and failed in a brazen push to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson, but the resounding rejection by Democrats and Republicans does not guarantee an end to the political chaos.One of Donald Trumps biggest supporters in Congress, Greene stood on the House floor late Wednesday and read a long list of transgressions she said Johnson had committed as speaker, from his passage of a 95 billion national security package with aid for Ukraine to his reliance on Democrats to wield power.\n\nHardline Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene tried and failed in a brazen push to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson, but the resounding rejection by Democrats and Republicans does not guarantee an end to the political chaos.\n\nOne of Donald Trump's biggest supporters in Congress, Greene stood on the House floor late Wednesday and read a long list of \"transgressions\" she said Johnson had committed as speaker, from his passage of a $95 billion national security package with aid for Ukraine to his reliance on Democrats to wield power. Colleagues booed in protest. But Greene soldiered on, criticizing Johnson's leadership as \"pathetic, weak and unacceptable.\" After Greene triggered the vote on her motion to vacate the speaker from his office, Republican Majority Leader Steve Scalise quickly countered by calling first for a vote to table it.\n\nAn overwhelming majority, 359-43, kept Johnson in his job, for now.\n\n\"As I've said from the beginning, and I've made clear here every day, I intend to do my job,\" Johnson said afterward. \"And I'll let the chips fall where they may. In my view, that is leadership.\" It's the second time in a matter of months that Republicans have worked to oust their own speaker, an unheard of level of party upheaval with a move rarely seen in U.S. history. While the outcome temporarily calms the latest source of House disruption, the vote tally shows the strengths but also the stark limits of Johnson's hold on the gavel, and the risks ahead for any Republican trying to lead the GOP. Without Democratic help, Johnson would have certainly faced a more dismal outcome. All told, 11 Republicans voted to proceed with Greene's effort, more than it took to oust then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy last fall, a first in U.S. history. But by relying on Democratic backing, Johnson risks inciting more criticism that he is insufficiently loyal to the party.\n\nAnd the threat still lingers -- any single lawmaker can call up the motion to vacate the speaker. Even though Trump provided a needed nod of support for Johnson at crucial moments, it's not bankable going forward. The former president posed an idle warning about potentially ousting the speaker as voting was getting underway.\n\n\"At some point, we may very well be, but this is not the time,\" Trump said on social media.\n\nTrump also made clear he still valued Greene, perhaps his biggest ally in the House, even as he rejected her proposal. ''I absolutely love Marjorie Taylor Greene,\" he said as he urged Republicans to table her motion.\n\nAs Greene pressed ahead with the snap vote, GOP lawmakers filtered towards Johnson, giving him pats on the back and grasping his shoulder to assure him of their support.\n\nThe Georgia Republican had vowed weeks ago she would force a vote on the motion to vacate the Republican speaker if he dared to advance the foreign aid package for Ukraine, which was overwhelmingly approved late last month and signed into law. But in recent days it seemed her effort had cooled, as she and Johnson met repeatedly for a potential resolution. Johnson of Louisiana marched on, saying he had been willing to take the risk to approve the foreign aid, believing it was important for the U.S. to back Ukraine against Russia's invasion and explaining he wanted to be on the \"right side of history.\" Highly unusual, the boost from Democrats led by Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, showed the exhaustion in Congress over the far-right antics. Jeffries and his leadership team had said it was time to \"turn the page\" on the GOP turmoil and vote to table Greene's resolution -- ensuring Johnson's job is saved, for now. \"Our decision to stop Marjorie Taylor Greene from plunging the country into further chaos is rooted in our commitment to solve problems,\" Jeffries said after the vote.\n\nBut Democrats have also made clear their help was for this moment alone, and not a promise of an enduring partnership for Johnson's survival. Asked about a future motion to vacate the speaker, Jeffries said, \"Haven't given it a thought.\" The move now poses its own political risks for Greene, a high-profile provocateur who has moved to the forefront of the party with her own massive following and proximity to Trump. Greene was determined to force her colleagues to be on the record with their vote - putting them in the politically uncomfortable position of backing the speaker and seen as joining forces with Democrats to save him. \"I'm proud of what I did today,\" Greene said afterward on the Capitol steps.\n\nWhile reporters and camera crews crowded around Greene and ally Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., a group of other Republicans gathered on the steps trying to shift the attention away from her and make their own views known.\n\nRep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., said of those trying to remove the speaker, \"They're pretty good at getting attention, but they have not been recognized for their ability to get things done.'' He said if they keep pushing to oust the speaker, ''I think you can expect more of the same: Failure.\" Reps. Carlos Gim\u00e9nez, a Florida Republican, said of Greene: \"She doesn't represent the Republican Party. I'm tired of of this being the face or the voice of the party and getting attention. That's all she wants, is the attention.\" Rep.

Last year, the House chamber was hurled into chaos when eight Republicans voted to remove McCarthy from the speaker's office and Democrats declined to help save him. Ousting McCarthy resulted in a nearly monthlong search for a new GOP leader, bringing the chamber to a standstill with an episode Republicans wanted to avoid ahead of the November election.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_to_vacate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Motion to vacate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Scalise", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Scalise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Lawler", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Lawler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusty_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dusty Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Massie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Massie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_A._Gim\u00e9nez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos A.

Thomas Massie, R-Ky., speaks to reporters after she tried and failed to oust Speaker Mike Johnson, her long-shot effort swiftly and resoundingly rejected by Democrats and Republicans tired of the political chaos, at the Capitol in Washington, Wednesday, May 8, 2024.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Hardline Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene tried and failed in sudden action Wednesday to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson, her long-shot effort swiftly and resoundingly rejected by Democrats and Republicans tired of the political chaos.\n\nOne of Donald Trump's biggest supporters in Congress, Greene stood on the House floor and read a long list of \"transgressions\" she said Johnson had committed as speaker. Colleagues booed in protest.\n\nGreene criticized Johnson's leadership as \"pathetic, weak and unacceptable.\"\n\nAfter Greene triggered the vote on her motion to vacate the speaker from his office, Republican Majority Leader Steve Scalise quickly countered by calling first for a vote to table it.\n\nAn overwhelming majority, 359-43, kept Johnson in his job, for now.\n\n\"As I've said from the beginning, and I've made clear here every day, I intend to do my job,\" Johnson said afterward. \"And I'll let the chips fall where they may. In my view, that is leadership.\"\n\nIt's the second time in a matter of months that Republicans have worked to oust their own speaker, an unheard of level of party turmoil with a move rarely seen in U.S. history.\n\nThe tally shows the strengths but also the stark limits of Johnson's hold on the gavel, and the risks ahead for any Republican trying to lead the GOP in the Trump era. Without Democratic help, Johnson would have certainly faced a more dismal outcome.\n\nAll told, 11 Republicans voted to proceed with Greene's effort, more than it took to oust then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy last fall, a first in U.S. history. And the threat still lingers -- any single lawmaker can call up the motion to vacate the speaker.\n\nJohnson said he hoped it \"is the end of the personality politics.\"\n\nAs Greene pressed ahead with the snap vote despite pushback from Republicans at the highest levels, including Trump, GOP lawmakers filtered towards Johnson, giving him pats on the back and grasping his shoulder to assure him of their support.\n\nThe Georgia Republican had vowed weeks ago she would force a vote on the motion to vacate the Republican speaker if he dared to advance a foreign aid package for Ukraine, which was overwhelmingly approved late last month and signed into law.\n\nBut in recent days it seemed her effort had cooled, as she and Johnson met repeatedly for a potential resolution.\n\nJohnson of Louisiana marched on, saying he had been willing to take the risk to approve the foreign aid, believing it was important for the U.S. to back Ukraine against Russia's invasion and explaining he wanted to be on the \"right side of history.\"\n\nIn a highly unusual move, the speaker received a boost from Democrats led by Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, whose leadership team had said it was time to \"turn the page\" on the GOP turmoil and vote to table Greene's resolution -- almost ensuring Johnson's job is saved, for now.\n\n\"Our decision to stop Marjorie Taylor Greene from plunging the country into further chaos is rooted in our commitment to solve problems,\" Jeffries said after the vote.\n\nTrump had also weighed in after Johnson trekked to Mar-a-Lago last month for support, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee giving the speaker his nod of approval. And Trump's hand-picked leader at the Republican National Committee urged House Republicans off the move.\n\nAhead of House voting, Trump said on social media, \"I absolutely love Marjorie Taylor Greene,\" but he said Republicans need to be fighting now to defeat Democrats in the November election. He urged Republicans to table Greene's motion.\n\n\"At some point, we may very well be, but this is not the time,\" Trump said, to oust the speaker.\n\nThe move now poses its own political risks for Greene, a high-profile provocateur who has moved to the forefront of the party with her own massive following and proximity to Trump.\n\nGreene was determined to force her colleagues to be on the record with their vote - putting them in the politically uncomfortable position of backing the speaker and seen as joining forces with Democrats to save him.\n\n\"I'm proud of what I did today,\" Greene said afterward on the Capitol steps.\n\nWhile reporters and camera crews crowded around Greene and ally Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., a group of other Republicans gathered on the steps trying to shift the attention away from her and make their own views known.\n\nRep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., said of those trying to remove the speaker, \"They're pretty good at getting attention, but they have not been recognized for their ability to get things done.\"\n\nHe said if they keep pushing to oust the speaker, \"I think you can expect more of the same: Failure.\"\n\nReps. Carlos Gim\u00e9nez, a Florida Republican, said of Greene: \"She doesn't represent the Republican Party. I'm tired of of this being the face or the voice of the party and getting attention. That's all she wants, is the attention.\"\n\nRep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., called for Greene and Massie to be punished for their actions.\n\nHad Democrats not taken the unusual move to help, the vote would most likely have ended differently for Johnson who holds one of the slimmest majorities in the House in modern times, with no votes to spare.\n\nLast year, the House chamber was hurled into chaos when eight Republicans voted to remove McCarthy from the speaker's office and Democrats declined to help save him.\n\nOusting McCarthy resulted in a nearly monthlong search for a new GOP leader, bringing the chamber to a standstill with an episode Republicans wanted to avoid ahead of the November election.\n\nAssociated Press writers Stephen Groves, Mary Clare Jalonick, Michelle Price and Farnoush Amiri contributed to this report.", "source":

The former president posed an idle warning about potentially ousting the speaker as voting was getting underway.\n\n\"At some point, we may very well be, but this is not the time,\" Trump said on social media.\n\nTrump also made clear he still valued Greene, perhaps his biggest ally in the House, even as he rejected her proposal. \"I absolutely love Marjorie Taylor Greene,\" he said as he urged Republicans to table her motion.\n\nAs Greene pressed ahead with the snap vote, GOP lawmakers filtered towards Johnson, giving him pats on the back and grasping his shoulder to assure him of their support.\n\nThe Georgia Republican had vowed weeks ago she would force a vote on the motion to vacate the Republican speaker if he dared to advance the foreign aid package for Ukraine, which was overwhelmingly approved late last month and signed into law.\n\nBut in recent days it seemed her effort had cooled, as she and Johnson met repeatedly for a potential resolution.\n\nJohnson of Louisiana marched on, saying he had been willing to take the risk to approve the foreign aid, believing it was important for the U.S. to back Ukraine against Russia's invasion and explaining he wanted to be on the \"right side of history.\"\n\nHighly unusual, the boost from Democrats led by Rep.

Thomas Massie, R-Ky., speaks to reporters after she tried and failed to oust Speaker Mike Johnson, her long-shot effort swiftly and resoundingly rejected by Democrats and Republicans tired of the political chaos, at the Capitol in Washington, Wednesday, May 8, 2024. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)\n\nHardline Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene tried and failed in sudden action Wednesday to oust Speaker Mike Johnson, her long-shot effort swiftly and resoundingly rejected by Democrats and Republicans tired of the political chaos.\n\nOne of Donald Trump's biggest supporters in Congress, Greene stood on the House floor and read a long list of \"transgressions\" she said Johnson had committed as speaker. Colleagues booed in protest.\n\nGreene of Georgia criticized Johnson's leadership as \"pathetic, weak and unacceptable.\"\n\nNo sooner than Greene triggered the vote on her motion to vacate the speaker from his office, the Republican Majority Leader Steve Scalise countered by calling first for a vote to table it.\n\nAn overwhelming majority, 359-43, kept Johnson in his job, for now.\n\n\"As I've said from the beginning, and I've made clear here every day, I intend to do my job,\" Johnson said afterward. \"And I'll let the chips fall where they may. In my view, that is leadership.\"\n\nIt's the second time in a matter of months that Republicans have worked to oust their own speaker, an unheard of level of party turmoil with a move rarely seen in U.S. history.\n\nThe tally shows the strengths but also the stark limits of Johnson's hold on the gavel, and the risks ahead for any Republican trying to lead the GOP as it redefines its mission in the Trump era. Without Democratic help, Johnson would have certainly faced a more dismal outcome.\n\nAll told 11 Republicans voted to proceed with Greene's effort, more than it took to oust then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy last fall, a first in U.S. history. And the threat still lingers -- any single lawmaker can call up the motion to vacate the speaker.\n\nJohnson said he hoped it \"is the end of the personality politics.\"\n\nAs Greene pressed ahead with the snap vote despite pushback from Republicans at the highest levels, including Trump, GOP lawmakers filtered towards Johnson, giving him pats on the back and grasping his shoulder to assure him of their support.\n\nThe Georgia Republican had vowed weeks ago she would force a vote on the motion to vacate the Republican speaker if he dared to advance a foreign aid package with funds for Ukraine, which was overwhelmingly approved late last month and signed into law.\n\nBut in recent days it seemed her effort had cooled, as she and Johnson met repeatedly for a potential resolution.\n\nJohnson of Louisiana marched on, saying he had been willing to take the risk to approve the foreign aid, believing it was important for the U.S. to back Ukraine against Russia's invasion and explaining he wanted to be on the \"right side of history.\"\n\nIn a highly unusual move, the speaker received a boost from Democrats led by Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, whose leadership team had said it was time to \"turn the page\" on the GOP turmoil and vote to table Greene's resolution -- almost ensuring Johnson's job is saved, for now.\n\n\"Our decision to stop Marjorie Taylor Greene from plunging the country into further chaos is rooted in our commitment to solve problems,\" Jeffries said after the vote.\n\nTrump had also weighed in after Johnson trekked to Mar-a-Lago last month for support, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee giving the speaker his nod of approval. And Trump's hand-picked leader at the Republican National Committee urged House Republicans off the move.\n\nAhead of House voting, Trump said on social media, \"I absolutely love Marjorie Taylor Greene,\" but he said Republicans need to be fighting now to defeat Democrats in the November election. He urged Republicans to table Greene's motion.\n\n\"At some point, we may very well be, but this is not the time,\" Trump said, to oust the speaker.\n\nThe move now poses its own political risks for Greene, a high-profile provocateur who has moved to the forefront of the party with her own massive following and proximity to Trump.\n\nGreene was determined to force her colleagues to be on the record with their vote - putting them in the politically uncomfortable position of backing the speaker and seen as joining forces with Democrats to save him.\n\n\"I'm proud of what I did today,\" Greene said afterward on the Capitol steps.\n\nWhile reporters and camera crews crowded around Greene and ally Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., a group of other Republicans gathered on the steps trying to shift the attention away from her and make their own views known.\n\nRep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., said of those trying to remove the speaker, \"They're pretty good at getting attention, but they have not been recognized for their ability to get things done.\"\n\nHe said if they keep pushing to oust the speaker, \"I think you can expect more of the same: Failure.\"\n\nReps. Carlos Gim\u00e9nez, a Florida Republican, said of Greene: \"She doesn't represent the Republican Party. I'm tired of of this being the face or the voice of the party and getting attention. That's all she wants, is the attention.\"\n\nRep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., called for Greene and Massie to be punished for their actions.\n\nHad Democrats not taken the unusual move to help, the vote would most likely have ended differently for Johnson who holds one of the slimmest majorities in the House in modern times, with no votes to spare.\n\nLast year, the House chamber was hurled into chaos when eight Republicans voted to remove McCarthy from the speaker's office and Democrats declined to help save him.\n\nOusting McCarthy resulted in a nearly monthlong search for a new GOP leader, bringing the chamber to a standstill with an episode Republicans wanted to avoid ahead of the November election.", "source": {"uri": "castanet.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Castanet"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Massie", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Massie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Scalise", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Scalise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Canadian_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Canadian Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Lawler", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Lawler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusty_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dusty Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_A._Gim\u00e9nez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos A.

Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort to oust Speaker Mike Johnson, but chaos lingers", "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hardline Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene tried and failed in a brazen push to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson, but the resounding rejection by Republicans and Democrats tired of the turmoil does not guarantee an end to the GOP chaos.\n\nOne of Donald Trump's biggest supporters in Congress, Greene stood on the House floor late Wednesday and read a long list of \"transgressions\" she said Johnson had committed as speaker, from his passage of a $95 billion national security package with aid for Ukraine to his reliance on Democrats wield power.\n\nColleagues booed in protest. But Greene soldiered on, criticizing Johnson's leadership as \"pathetic, weak and unacceptable.\"\n\nAfter Greene triggered the vote on her motion to vacate the Republican speaker from his office, Republican Majority Leader Steve Scalise quickly countered by calling first for a vote to table it.\n\nAn overwhelming majority, 359-43, kept Johnson in his job, for now.\n\n\"As I've said from the beginning, and I've made clear here every day, I intend to do my job,\" Johnson said afterward. \"And I'll let the chips fall where they may. In my view, that is leadership.\"\n\nIt's the second time in a matter of months that Republicans have worked to oust their own speaker, an unheard of level of party upheaval with a move rarely seen in U.S. history.\n\nWhile the outcome temporarily calms the latest source of House disruption, the vote tally shows the strengths but also the stark limits of Johnson's hold on the gavel, and the risks ahead for any Republican trying to lead the GOP.\n\nWithout Democratic help, Johnson would have certainly faced a more dismal outcome. All told, 11 Republicans voted to proceed with Greene's effort, more than it took to oust then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy last fall, a first in U.S. history.\n\nBut by relying on Democratic backing, Johnson risks inciting more criticism that he is insufficiently loyal to the party.\n\nAnd the threat still lingers -- any single lawmaker can call up the motion to vacate the speaker.\n\nEven though Trump provided a needed nod of support for Johnson at crucial moments, it's not bankable going forward. The former president posed an idle warning about potentially ousting the speaker as voting was getting underway.\n\n\"At some point, we may very well be, but this is not the time,\" Trump said on social media.\n\nTrump also made clear he still valued Greene, perhaps his biggest ally in the House, even as he rejected her proposal. \"I absolutely love Marjorie Taylor Greene,\" he said as he urged Republicans to table her motion.\n\nAs Greene pressed ahead with the snap vote, GOP lawmakers filtered towards Johnson, giving him pats on the back and grasping his shoulder to assure him of their support.\n\nThe Georgia Republican had vowed weeks ago she would force a vote on the motion to vacate the Republican speaker if he dared to advance the foreign aid package for Ukraine, which was overwhelmingly approved late last month and signed into law.\n\nBut in recent days it seemed her effort had cooled, as she and Johnson met repeatedly for a potential resolution.\n\nJohnson of Louisiana marched on, saying he had been willing to take the risk to approve the foreign aid, believing it was important for the U.S. to back Ukraine against Russia's invasion and explaining he wanted to be on the \"right side of history.\"\n\nHighly unusual, the boost from Democrats led by Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, showed the exhaustion in Congress over the far-right antics. Jeffries and his leadership team had said it was time to \"turn the page\" on the GOP turmoil and vote to table Greene's resolution -- ensuring Johnson's job is saved, for now.\n\n\"Our decision to stop Marjorie Taylor Greene from plunging the country into further chaos is rooted in our commitment to solve problems,\" Jeffries said after the vote.\n\nBut Democrats have also made clear their help was for this moment alone, and not a promise of an enduring partnership for Johnson's survival.\n\nAsked about a future motion to vacate the speaker, Jeffries said, \"Haven't given it a thought.\"\n\nThe move now poses its own political risks for Greene, a high-profile provocateur who has moved to the forefront of the party with her own massive following and proximity to Trump.\n\nGreene was determined to force her colleagues to be on the record with their vote - putting them in the politically uncomfortable position of backing the speaker and seen as joining forces with Democrats to save him.\n\n\"I'm proud of what I did today,\" Greene said afterward on the Capitol steps.\n\nWhile reporters and camera crews crowded around Greene and ally Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., a group of other Republicans gathered on the steps trying to shift the attention away from her and make their own views known.\n\nRep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., said of those trying to remove the speaker, \"They're pretty good at getting attention, but they have not been recognized for their ability to get things done.\"\n\nHe said if they keep pushing to oust the speaker, \"I think you can expect more of the same: Failure.\"\n\nReps. Carlos Gim\u00e9nez, a Florida Republican, said of Greene: \"She doesn't represent the Republican Party. I'm tired of of this being the face or the voice of the party and getting attention. That's all she wants, is the attention.\"\n\nRep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., called for Greene and Massie to be punished for their actions.\n\nHad Democrats not taken the unusual move to help, the vote would most likely have ended differently for Johnson who holds one of the slimmest majorities in the House in modern times, with no votes to spare.\n\nLast year, the House chamber was hurled into chaos when eight Republicans voted to remove McCarthy from the speaker's office and Democrats declined to help save him.\n\nOusting McCarthy resulted in a nearly monthlong search for a new GOP leader, bringing the chamber to a standstill with an episode Republicans wanted to avoid ahead of the November election.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Stephen Groves, Mary Clare Jalonick, Michelle Price and Farnoush Amiri contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@tribtown.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_to_vacate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Motion to vacate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "History of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Scalise", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Scalise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Lawler", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Lawler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusty_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dusty Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Massie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Massie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_A._Gim\u00e9nez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos A.

Colleagues booed in protest.\n\nGreene criticized Johnson's leadership as \"pathetic, weak and unacceptable.\"\n\nAfter Greene triggered the vote on her motion to vacate the speaker from his office, Republican Majority Leader Steve Scalise quickly countered by calling first for a vote to table it.\n\nAn overwhelming majority, 359-43, kept Johnson in his job, for now.\n\n\"As I've said from the beginning, and I've made clear here every day, I intend to do my job,\" Johnson said afterward. \"And I'll let the chips fall where they may. In my view, that is leadership.\"\n\nIt's the second time in a matter of months that Republicans have worked to oust their own speaker, an unheard of level of party turmoil with a move rarely seen in U.S. history.\n\nThe tally shows the strengths but also the stark limits of Johnson's hold on the gavel, and the risks ahead for any Republican trying to lead the GOP in the Trump era. Without Democratic help, Johnson would have certainly faced a more dismal outcome.\n\nAll told, 11 Republicans voted to proceed with Greene's effort, more than it took to oust then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy last fall, a first in U.S. history. And the threat still lingers -- any single lawmaker can call up the motion to vacate the speaker.\n\nJohnson said he hoped it \"is the end of the personality politics.\"\n\nAs Greene pressed ahead with the snap vote despite pushback from Republicans at the highest levels, including Trump, GOP lawmakers filtered towards Johnson, giving him pats on the back and grasping his shoulder to assure him of their support.\n\nThe Georgia Republican had vowed weeks ago she would force a vote on the motion to vacate the Republican speaker if he dared to advance a foreign aid package for Ukraine, which was overwhelmingly approved late last month and signed into law.\n\nBut in recent days it seemed her effort had cooled, as she and Johnson met repeatedly for a potential resolution.\n\nJohnson of Louisiana marched on, saying he had been willing to take the risk to approve the foreign aid, believing it was important for the U.S. to back Ukraine against Russia's invasion and explaining he wanted to be on the \"right side of history.\"\n\nIn a highly unusual move, the speaker received a boost from Democrats led by Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, whose leadership team had said it was time to \"turn the page\" on the GOP turmoil and vote to table Greene's resolution -- almost ensuring Johnson's job is saved, for now.\n\n\"Our decision to stop Marjorie Taylor Greene from plunging the country into further chaos is rooted in our commitment to solve problems,\" Jeffries said after the vote.\n\nTrump had also weighed in after Johnson trekked to Mar-a-Lago last month for support, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee giving the speaker his nod of approval. And Trump's hand-picked leader at the Republican National Committee urged House Republicans off the move.\n\nAhead of House voting, Trump said on social media, \"I absolutely love Marjorie Taylor Greene,\" but he said Republicans need to be fighting now to defeat Democrats in the November election. He urged Republicans to table Greene's motion.\n\n\"At some point, we may very well be, but this is not the time,\" Trump said, to oust the speaker.\n\nThe move now poses its own political risks for Greene, a high-profile provocateur who has moved to the forefront of the party with her own massive following and proximity to Trump.\n\nGreene was determined to force her colleagues to be on the record with their vote - putting them in the politically uncomfortable position of backing the speaker and seen as joining forces with Democrats to save him.\n\n\"I'm proud of what I did today,\" Greene said afterward on the Capitol steps.\n\nWhile reporters and camera crews crowded around Greene and ally Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., a group of other Republicans gathered on the steps trying to shift the attention away from her and make their own views known.\n\nRep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., said of those trying to remove the speaker, \"They're pretty good at getting attention, but they have not been recognized for their ability to get things done.\"\n\nHe said if they keep pushing to oust the speaker, \"I think you can expect more of the same: Failure.\"\n\nReps. Carlos Gim\u00e9nez, a Florida Republican, said of Greene: \"She doesn't represent the Republican Party. I'm tired of of this being the face or the voice of the party and getting attention. That's all she wants, is the attention.\"\n\nRep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., called for Greene and Massie to be punished for their actions.\n\nHad Democrats not taken the unusual move to help, the vote would most likely have ended differently for Johnson who holds one of the slimmest majorities in the House in modern times, with no votes to spare.\n\nLast year, the House chamber was hurled into chaos when eight Republicans voted to remove McCarthy from the speaker's office and Democrats declined to help save him.\n\nOusting McCarthy resulted in a nearly monthlong search for a new GOP leader, bringing the chamber to a standstill with an episode Republicans wanted to avoid ahead of the November election.\n\n__\n\nAssociated Press writers Stephen Groves, Mary Clare Jalonick, Michelle Price and Farnoush Amiri contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "oneidadispatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Oneida Dispatch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@oneidadispatch.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greene_County,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Greene County, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Greene County, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Scalise", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Scalise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Lawler", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Lawler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusty_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dusty Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Massie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Massie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_A._Gim\u00e9nez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos A.

Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort to oust Speaker Mike Johnson, but chaos lingers - The Daily Reporter - Greenfield Indiana", "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hardline Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene tried and failed in a brazen push to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson, but the resounding rejection by Republicans and Democrats tired of the turmoil does not guarantee an end to the GOP chaos.\n\nOne of Donald Trump's biggest supporters in Congress, Greene stood on the House floor late Wednesday and read a long list of \"transgressions\" she said Johnson had committed as speaker, from his passage of a $95 billion national security package with aid for Ukraine to his reliance on Democrats wield power.\n\nColleagues booed in protest. But Greene soldiered on, criticizing Johnson's leadership as \"pathetic, weak and unacceptable.\"\n\nAfter Greene triggered the vote on her motion to vacate the Republican speaker from his office, Republican Majority Leader Steve Scalise quickly countered by calling first for a vote to table it.\n\nAn overwhelming majority, 359-43, kept Johnson in his job, for now.\n\n\"As I've said from the beginning, and I've made clear here every day, I intend to do my job,\" Johnson said afterward. \"And I'll let the chips fall where they may. In my view, that is leadership.\"\n\nIt's the second time in a matter of months that Republicans have worked to oust their own speaker, an unheard of level of party upheaval with a move rarely seen in U.S. history.\n\nWhile the outcome temporarily calms the latest source of House disruption, the vote tally shows the strengths but also the stark limits of Johnson's hold on the gavel, and the risks ahead for any Republican trying to lead the GOP.\n\nWithout Democratic help, Johnson would have certainly faced a more dismal outcome. All told, 11 Republicans voted to proceed with Greene's effort, more than it took to oust then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy last fall, a first in U.S. history.\n\nBut by relying on Democratic backing, Johnson risks inciting more criticism that he is insufficiently loyal to the party.\n\nAnd the threat still lingers -- any single lawmaker can call up the motion to vacate the speaker.\n\nEven though Trump provided a needed nod of support for Johnson at crucial moments, it's not bankable going forward. The former president posed an idle warning about potentially ousting the speaker as voting was getting underway.\n\n\"At some point, we may very well be, but this is not the time,\" Trump said on social media.\n\nTrump also made clear he still valued Greene, perhaps his biggest ally in the House, even as he rejected her proposal. \"I absolutely love Marjorie Taylor Greene,\" he said as he urged Republicans to table her motion.\n\nAs Greene pressed ahead with the snap vote, GOP lawmakers filtered towards Johnson, giving him pats on the back and grasping his shoulder to assure him of their support.\n\nThe Georgia Republican had vowed weeks ago she would force a vote on the motion to vacate the Republican speaker if he dared to advance the foreign aid package for Ukraine, which was overwhelmingly approved late last month and signed into law.\n\nBut in recent days it seemed her effort had cooled, as she and Johnson met repeatedly for a potential resolution.\n\nJohnson of Louisiana marched on, saying he had been willing to take the risk to approve the foreign aid, believing it was important for the U.S. to back Ukraine against Russia's invasion and explaining he wanted to be on the \"right side of history.\"\n\nHighly unusual, the boost from Democrats led by Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, showed the exhaustion in Congress over the far-right antics. Jeffries and his leadership team had said it was time to \"turn the page\" on the GOP turmoil and vote to table Greene's resolution -- ensuring Johnson's job is saved, for now.\n\n\"Our decision to stop Marjorie Taylor Greene from plunging the country into further chaos is rooted in our commitment to solve problems,\" Jeffries said after the vote.\n\nBut Democrats have also made clear their help was for this moment alone, and not a promise of an enduring partnership for Johnson's survival.\n\nAsked about a future motion to vacate the speaker, Jeffries said, \"Haven't given it a thought.\"\n\nThe move now poses its own political risks for Greene, a high-profile provocateur who has moved to the forefront of the party with her own massive following and proximity to Trump.\n\nGreene was determined to force her colleagues to be on the record with their vote - putting them in the politically uncomfortable position of backing the speaker and seen as joining forces with Democrats to save him.\n\n\"I'm proud of what I did today,\" Greene said afterward on the Capitol steps.\n\nWhile reporters and camera crews crowded around Greene and ally Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., a group of other Republicans gathered on the steps trying to shift the attention away from her and make their own views known.\n\nRep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., said of those trying to remove the speaker, \"They're pretty good at getting attention, but they have not been recognized for their ability to get things done.\"\n\nHe said if they keep pushing to oust the speaker, \"I think you can expect more of the same: Failure.\"\n\nReps. Carlos Gim\u00e9nez, a Florida Republican, said of Greene: \"She doesn't represent the Republican Party. I'm tired of of this being the face or the voice of the party and getting attention. That's all she wants, is the attention.\"\n\nRep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., called for Greene and Massie to be punished for their actions.\n\nHad Democrats not taken the unusual move to help, the vote would most likely have ended differently for Johnson who holds one of the slimmest majorities in the House in modern times, with no votes to spare.\n\nLast year, the House chamber was hurled into chaos when eight Republicans voted to remove McCarthy from the speaker's office and Democrats declined to help save him.\n\nOusting McCarthy resulted in a nearly monthlong search for a new GOP leader, bringing the chamber to a standstill with an episode Republicans wanted to avoid ahead of the November election.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Stephen Groves, Mary Clare Jalonick, Michelle Price and Farnoush Amiri contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "greenfieldreporter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Greenfield Daily Reporter"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@greenfieldreporter.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_to_vacate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Motion to vacate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "History of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Scalise", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Scalise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Lawler", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Lawler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusty_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dusty Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Massie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Massie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_A._Gim\u00e9nez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos A.

Marjorie Taylor Greene's Effort to Oust Speaker Mike Johnson, but Chaos Lingers | LatestLY", "body": "Washington, May 9 (AP) Hardline Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene tried and failed in a brazen push to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson, but the resounding rejection by Democrats and Republicans does not guarantee an end to the political chaos.\n\nOne of Donald Trump's biggest supporters in Congress, Greene stood on the House floor late Wednesday and read a long list of \"transgressions\" she said Johnson had committed as speaker, from his passage of a $95 billion national security package with aid for Ukraine to his reliance on Democrats to wield power.\n\nAlso Read | Israel-Hamas War: 30 Killed During IDF's Continuing Ground Assault in Gaza's Rafah.\n\nColleagues booed in protest. But Greene soldiered on, criticizing Johnson's leadership as \"pathetic, weak and unacceptable.\"\n\nAfter Greene triggered the vote on her motion to vacate the speaker from his office, Republican Majority Leader Steve Scalise quickly countered by calling first for a vote to table it.\n\nAlso Read | Barron Trump Steps Into Political Arena: Donald Trump's Youngest Son To Make Political Debut As Florida Delegate to the Republican Convention.\n\nAn overwhelming majority, 359-43, kept Johnson in his job, for now.\n\n\"As I've said from the beginning, and I've made clear here every day, I intend to do my job,\" Johnson said afterward. \"And I'll let the chips fall where they may. In my view, that is leadership.\"\n\nIt's the second time in a matter of months that Republicans have worked to oust their own speaker, an unheard of level of party upheaval with a move rarely seen in U.S. history.\n\nWhile the outcome temporarily calms the latest source of House disruption, the vote tally shows the strengths but also the stark limits of Johnson's hold on the gavel, and the risks ahead for any Republican trying to lead the GOP.\n\nWithout Democratic help, Johnson would have certainly faced a more dismal outcome. All told, 11 Republicans voted to proceed with Greene's effort, more than it took to oust then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy last fall, a first in U.S. history.\n\nBut by relying on Democratic backing, Johnson risks inciting more criticism that he is insufficiently loyal to the party.\n\nAnd the threat still lingers -- any single lawmaker can call up the motion to vacate the speaker.\n\nEven though Trump provided a needed nod of support for Johnson at crucial moments, it's not bankable going forward. The former president posed an idle warning about potentially ousting the speaker as voting was getting underway.\n\n\"At some point, we may very well be, but this is not the time,\" Trump said on social media.\n\nTrump also made clear he still valued Greene, perhaps his biggest ally in the House, even as he rejected her proposal. \"I absolutely love Marjorie Taylor Greene,\" he said as he urged Republicans to table her motion.\n\nAs Greene pressed ahead with the snap vote, GOP lawmakers filtered towards Johnson, giving him pats on the back and grasping his shoulder to assure him of their support.\n\nThe Georgia Republican had vowed weeks ago she would force a vote on the motion to vacate the Republican speaker if he dared to advance the foreign aid package for Ukraine, which was overwhelmingly approved late last month and signed into law.\n\nBut in recent days it seemed her effort had cooled, as she and Johnson met repeatedly for a potential resolution.\n\nJohnson of Louisiana marched on, saying he had been willing to take the risk to approve the foreign aid, believing it was important for the U.S. to back Ukraine against Russia's invasion and explaining he wanted to be on the \"right side of history.\"\n\nHighly unusual, the boost from Democrats led by Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, showed the exhaustion in Congress over the far-right antics. Jeffries and his leadership team had said it was time to \"turn the page\" on the GOP turmoil and vote to table Greene's resolution -- ensuring Johnson's job is saved, for now.\n\n\"Our decision to stop Marjorie Taylor Greene from plunging the country into further chaos is rooted in our commitment to solve problems,\" Jeffries said after the vote.\n\nBut Democrats have also made clear their help was for this moment alone, and not a promise of an enduring partnership for Johnson's survival.\n\nAsked about a future motion to vacate the speaker, Jeffries said, \"Haven't given it a thought.\"\n\nThe move now poses its own political risks for Greene, a high-profile provocateur who has moved to the forefront of the party with her own massive following and proximity to Trump.\n\nGreene was determined to force her colleagues to be on the record with their vote - putting them in the politically uncomfortable position of backing the speaker and seen as joining forces with Democrats to save him.\n\n\"I'm proud of what I did today,\" Greene said afterward on the Capitol steps.\n\nWhile reporters and camera crews crowded around Greene and ally Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., a group of other Republicans gathered on the steps trying to shift the attention away from her and make their own views known.\n\nRep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., said of those trying to remove the speaker, \"They're pretty good at getting attention, but they have not been recognized for their ability to get things done.\"\n\nHe said if they keep pushing to oust the speaker, \"I think you can expect more of the same: Failure.\"\n\nReps. Carlos Gim\u00e9nez, a Florida Republican, said of Greene: \"She doesn't represent the Republican Party. I'm tired of of this being the face or the voice of the party and getting attention. That's all she wants, is the attention.\"\n\nRep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., called for Greene and Massie to be punished for their actions.\n\nHad Democrats not taken the unusual move to help, the vote would most likely have ended differently for Johnson who holds one of the slimmest majorities in the House in modern times, with no votes to spare.\n\nLast year, the House chamber was hurled into chaos when eight Republicans voted to remove McCarthy from the speaker's office and Democrats declined to help save him.\n\nOusting McCarthy resulted in a nearly monthlong search for a new GOP leader, bringing the chamber to a standstill with an episode Republicans wanted to avoid ahead of the November election.

Colleagues booed in protest.\n\nGreene criticised Johnson's leadership as \"pathetic, weak and unacceptable.\"\n\nAfter Greene triggered the vote on her motion to vacate the speaker from his office, Republican Majority Leader Steve Scalise quickly countered by calling first for a vote to table it.\n\nAn overwhelming majority, 359-43, kept Johnson in his job, for now.\n\n\"As I've said from the beginning, and I've made clear here every day, I intend to do my job,\" Johnson said afterward. \"And I'll let the chips fall where they may.

Without Democratic help, Johnson would have certainly faced a more dismal outcome.\n\nAll told, 11 Republicans voted to proceed with Greene's effort, more than it took to oust then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy last fall, a first in US history.

And Trump's hand-picked leader at the Republican National Committee urged House Republicans off the move.\n\nAhead of House voting, Trump said on social media, \"I absolutely love Marjorie Taylor Greene,\" but he said Republicans need to be fighting now to defeat Democrats in the November election. He urged Republicans to table Greene's motion.\n\n\"At some point, we may very well be, but this is not the time,\" Trump said, to oust the speaker.\n\nThe move now poses its own political risks for Greene, a high-profile provocateur who has moved to the forefront of the party with her own massive following and proximity to Trump.\n\nGreene was determined to force her colleagues to be on the record with their vote - putting them in the politically uncomfortable position of backing the speaker and seen as joining forces with Democrats to save him.\n\n\"I'm proud of what I did today,\" Greene said afterward on the Capitol steps.\n\nWhile reporters and camera crews crowded around Greene and ally Representative Thomas Massie, R-Ky., a group of other Republicans gathered on the steps trying to shift the attention away from her and make their own views known.\n\nRepresentative Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., said of those trying to remove the speaker, \"They're pretty good at getting attention, but they have not been recognised for their ability to get things done.\"\n\nHe said if they keep pushing to oust the speaker, \"I think you can expect more of the same: Failure.\"\n\nRepresentative Carlos Gim\u00e9nez, a Florida Republican, said of Greene: \"She doesn't represent the Republican Party.

Marjorie Taylor Greene tried and failed in sudden action Wednesday to oust Speaker Mike Johnson, her long-shot effort swiftly and resoundingly rejected by Democrats and Republicans tired of the political chaos.\n\nOne of Donald Trump's biggest supporters in Congress, Greene stood on the House floor and read a long list of \"transgressions\" she said Johnson had committed as speaker. Colleagues booed in protest.\n\nGreene of Georgia criticized Johnson's leadership as \"pathetic, weak and unacceptable.\"\n\nNo sooner than Greene triggered the vote on her motion to vacate the speaker from his office, the Republican Majority Leader Steve Scalise countered by calling first for a vote to table it.\n\nAn overwhelming majority, 359-43, kept Johnson in his job, for now.\n\nIt's the second time in a matter of months that Republicans have tried to oust their own speaker, an unheard of level of party turmoil with a move rarely seen in U.S. history.\n\nAs Greene pressed ahead despite pushback from Republicans at the highest levels, including Trump, GOP lawmakers filtered towards Johnson, giving him pats on the back and grasping his shoulder to assure him of their support.\n\n\"As I've said from the beginning, and I've made clear here every day, I intend to do my job,\" Johnson said afterward. \"And I'll let the chips fall where they may. In my view, that is leadership.\"\n\nJohnson said the \"distraction\" was behind him and said he hoped it \"is the end of the personality politics.\"\n\nThe Georgia Republican had vowed she would force a vote on the motion to vacate the Republican speaker if he dared to advance a foreign aid package with funds for Ukraine, which was overwhelmingly approved late last month and signed into law.\n\nBut in recent days it seemed her effort had cooled, as she and Johnson met repeatedly for a potential resolution.\n\nJohnson of Louisiana marched on, saying he had been willing to take the risk to approve the foreign aid, believing it was important for the U.S. to back Ukraine against Russia's invasion and explaining he wanted to be on the \"right side of history.\"\n\nIn a highly unusual move, the speaker received a boost from Democrats led by Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, whose leadership team had said it was time to \"turn the page\" on the GOP turmoil and vote to table Greene's resolution -- almost ensuring Johnson's job is saved, for now.\n\n\"Our decision to stop Marjorie Taylor Green from plunging the country into further chaos is rooted in our commitment to solve problems,\" Jeffries said after the vote.\n\nTrump had also weighed in after Johnson trekked to Mar-a-Lago last month for support, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee giving the speaker his nod of approval. And Trump's hand-picked leader at the Republican National Committee urged House Republicans off the move.\n\nAhead of House voting, Trump said on social media, \"I absolutely love Marjorie Taylor Greene,\" but he said Republicans need to be fighting now to defeat Democrats in the November election. He urged Republicans to table Greene's motion.\n\n\"At some point, we may very well be, but this is not the time,\" Trump said, to oust the speaker.\n\nThe move now poses its own political risks for Greene, a high-profile provocateur.\n\nGreene was determined to force her colleagues to be on the record with their vote - putting them in the politically uncomfortable position of backing the speaker and seen as joining forces with Democrats to save him.\n\nThe tally showed the strength, but also the weakness, of her effort, as most lawmakers voted to move past the infighting and allow the Republican speaker, just six months in the office, to keep the gavel.\n\n\"The Democrats saved him,\" Greene said afterward.\n\nWithout Democratic support, the vote would most likely have ended differently for Johnson who holds one of the slimmest majorities in the House in modern times, with no votes to spare.\n\nLast year, the House chamber was brought to a standstill when eight Republicans voted to oust Kevin McCarthy from the speaker's office and Democrats declined to help save him, the first such removal of a House speaker in U.S. history.\n\nOusting McCarthy resulted in a nearly monthlong search for a new GOP leader, throwing the chamber into turmoil with an episode Republicans wanted to avoid before seeking voter support in the November election.\n\n__\n\nAssociated

Marjorie Taylor Greene to call a vote to remove Mike Johnson as speaker of the House. The vote was 359-43 with seven members voting present. 196 Republicans and 163 Democrats voted to table the motion.\n\n\"Hopefully, this is the end of the personality politics and the frivolous character assassination that has defined the 118th Congress,\" Johnson told reporters after the vote. \"It's regrettable. It's not who we are as Americans and we're better than this -- we need to get beyond it.\"\n\nAs promised, House Democrats largely supported Johnson in setting aside the call for his removal, making Greene's endeavor symbolic. Only 10 Republicans voted alongside Greene.\n\nThe vote was the culmination of weeks of threats from the Georgia Republican.\n\nRelated: House Democratic leaders say they would help save Speaker Johnson's job\n\nWhile the measure failed, Greene and other Republicans remain angry with Johnson's reliance on votes from Democrats to pass major legislation.\n\n\"Mike Johnson worked with [Senate Majority Leader] Chuck Schumer rather than the conference and gave Joe Biden and the Democrats everything they wanted -- no different from how a Speaker Hakeem Jeffries would have done,\" Greene said on the floor, reading a litany of criticisms against Johnson.\n\n\"This is the uni-party for the American people watching,\" Greene said as the House chamber erupted into boos as she brought forward the motion to vacate.\n\nGreene has been weighing whether to trigger a vote to oust Johnson since she filed the motion in March, after objecting to his negotiating with Democrats on a $1.2 trillion spending package that ultimately passed the House with more Democratic support than Republican support.\n\nLast week, Greene threatened to move forward with the motion to vacate after the House voted on an aid bill for Ukraine.\n\nTwo Republican co-sponsored her resolution -- Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar and Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie.\n\nGreene met twice this week with Johnson, including an over two-hour meeting on Monday.\n\n\"Everybody was listening -- it wasn't a shouting match,\" Massie said of the Monday meeting. \"[Greene] and I decided to give Speaker Johnson one last chance to say he's going to be with the Republicans and not with the Democrats, and there are some litmus tests on that.\"\n\nGreene and Massie said those litmus tests include no additional funding for Ukraine, no funding toward the special counsel investigation into former President Donald Trump, and Johnson only bringing legislation to the floor that has the support of the majority of the GOP conference.\n\nRelated: Majorie Taylor Greene is planning a vote next week to oust Speaker Johnson\n\nIn an appearance on Steve Bannon's \"War Room\" podcast Tuesday, Greene said she also wants twelve separate appropriations bills and not another omnibus led by Schumer \"rammed down our throat.\"\n\n\"That will not be tolerated again,\" she said, adding that if House Republicans don't get the twelve distinct bills, she wants to see a one percent cut to spending.\n\nAlthough members of the hardline House Freedom Caucus have expressed dissatisfaction with Johnson's actions in his short tenure as speaker, most say they still don't want to put the conference through another speaker fight.\n\nGreene has also been under pressure from former President Trump. Greene and Trump spoke over the weekend and Trump urged her to back down, according to a source familiar with the conversation.\n\nAfter the vote on Wednesday, Trump took to social media to request that Republican members vote to table the motion.\n\n\"We're not in a position of voting on a Motion to Vacate,\" he wrote. \"At some point, we may very well be, but this is not the time.\"", "source": {"uri": "opb.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "opb"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/118th_United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "118th United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Massie", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Massie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

But Greene soldiered on, criticizing Johnson's leadership as \"pathetic, weak and unacceptable.\"\n\nAfter Greene triggered the vote on her motion to vacate the speaker from his office, Republican Majority Leader Steve Scalise quickly countered by calling first for a vote to table it.\n\nAn overwhelming majority, 359-43, kept Johnson in his job, for now.\n\n\"As I've said from the beginning, and I've made clear here every day, I intend to do my job,\" Johnson said afterward. \"And I'll let the chips fall where they may.

All told, 11 Republicans voted to proceed with Greene's effort, more than it took to oust then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy last fall, a first in U.S. history.\n\nBut by relying on Democratic backing, Johnson risks inciting more criticism that he is insufficiently loyal to the party.\n\nAnd the threat still lingers -- any single lawmaker can call up the motion to vacate the speaker.\n\nEven though Trump provided a needed nod of support for Johnson at crucial moments, it's not bankable going forward. The former president posed an idle warning about potentially ousting the speaker as voting was getting underway.\n\n\"At some point, we may very well be, but this is not the time,\" Trump said on social media.\n\nTrump also made clear he still valued Greene, perhaps his biggest ally in the House, even as he rejected her proposal. \"I absolutely love Marjorie Taylor Greene,\" he said as he urged Republicans to table her motion.\n\nAs Greene pressed ahead with the snap vote, GOP lawmakers filtered towards Johnson, giving him pats on the back and grasping his shoulder to assure him of their support.\n\nThe Georgia Republican had vowed weeks ago she would force a vote on the motion to vacate the Republican speaker if he dared to advance the foreign aid package for Ukraine, which was overwhelmingly approved late last month and signed into law.\n\nBut in recent days it seemed her effort had cooled, as she and Johnson met repeatedly for a potential resolution.\n\nJohnson of Louisiana marched on, saying he had been willing to take the risk to approve the foreign aid, believing it was important for the U.S. to back Ukraine against Russia's invasion and explaining he wanted to be on the \"right side of history.\"\n\nHighly unusual, the boost from Democrats led by Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, showed the exhaustion in Congress over the far-right antics. Jeffries and his leadership team had said it was time to \"turn the page\" on the GOP turmoil and vote to table Greene's resolution -- ensuring Johnson's job is saved, for now.\n\n\"Our decision to stop Marjorie Taylor Greene from plunging the country into further chaos is rooted in our commitment to solve problems,\" Jeffries said after the vote.\n\nBut Democrats have also made clear their help was for this moment alone, and not a promise of an enduring partnership for Johnson's survival.\n\nAsked about a future motion to vacate the speaker, Jeffries said, \"Haven't given it a thought.\"\n\nThe move now poses its own political risks for Greene, a high-profile provocateur who has moved to the forefront of the party with her own massive following and proximity to Trump.\n\nGreene was determined to force her colleagues to be on the record with their vote - putting them in the politically uncomfortable position of backing the speaker and seen as joining forces with Democrats to save him.\n\n\"I'm proud of what I did today,\" Greene said afterward on the Capitol steps.\n\nWhile reporters and camera crews crowded around Greene and ally Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., a group of other Republicans gathered on the steps trying to shift the attention away from her and make their own views known.\n\nRep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., said of those trying to remove the speaker, \"They're pretty good at getting attention, but they have not been recognized for their ability to get things done.\"\n\nHe said if they keep pushing to oust the speaker, \"I think you can expect more of the same: Failure.\"\n\nReps.

Greene's effort to oust Speaker Mike Johnson, but chaos remains", "body": "WASHINGTON -- Hardline Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene tried and failed in a brazen push to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson, but the resounding rejection by Republicans and Democrats tired of the turmoil does not guarantee an end to the GOP chaos.\n\nOne of Donald Trump's biggest supporters in Congress, Greene stood on the House floor late Wednesday and read a long list of \"transgressions\" she said Johnson had committed as speaker, from his passage of a $95 billion national security package with aid for Ukraine to his reliance on Democrats wield power.\n\nAdvertisementAdvertisement\n\nColleagues booed in protest. But Greene soldiered on, criticizing Johnson's leadership as \"pathetic, weak and unacceptable.\"\n\nPolitical Points\n\nGet the latest politics news from North Texas and beyond.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nOr with:\n\nGoogleFacebook\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nAfter Greene triggered the vote on her motion to vacate the Republican speaker from his office, Republican Majority Leader Steve Scalise quickly countered by calling first for a vote to table it.\n\nAn overwhelming majority, 359-43, kept Johnson in his job, for now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"As I've said from the beginning, and I've made clear here every day, I intend to do my job,\" Johnson said afterward. \"And I'll let the chips fall where they may. In my view, that is leadership.\"\n\nIt's the second time in a matter of months that Republicans have worked to oust their own speaker, an unheard of level of party upheaval with a move rarely seen in U.S. history.\n\nAdvertisementSaved by Democrats\n\nWhile the outcome temporarily calms the latest source of House disruption, the vote tally shows the strengths but also the stark limits of Johnson's hold on the gavel, and the risks ahead for any Republican trying to lead the GOP.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWithout Democratic help, Johnson would have certainly faced a more dismal outcome. All told, 11 Republicans voted to proceed with Greene's effort, more than it took to oust then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy last fall, a first in U.S. history.\n\nBut by relying on Democratic backing, Johnson risks inciting more criticism that he is insufficiently loyal to the party.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the threat still lingers -- any single lawmaker can call up the motion to vacate the speaker.\n\nEven though Trump provided a needed nod of support for Johnson at crucial moments, it's not bankable going forward. The former president posed an idle warning about potentially ousting the speaker as voting was getting underway.\n\n\"At some point, we may very well be, but this is not the time,\" Trump said on social media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump also made clear he still valued Greene, perhaps his biggest ally in the House, even as he rejected her proposal. \"I absolutely love Marjorie Taylor Greene,\" he said as he urged Republicans to table her motion.\n\nAs Greene pressed ahead with the snap vote, GOP lawmakers filtered towards Johnson, giving him pats on the back and grasping his shoulder to assure him of their support.\n\nThe Georgia Republican had vowed weeks ago she would force a vote on the motion to vacate the Republican speaker if he dared to advance the foreign aid package for Ukraine, which was overwhelmingly approved late last month and signed into law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut in recent days it seemed her effort had cooled, as she and Johnson met repeatedly for a potential resolution.\n\nJohnson of Louisiana marched on, saying he had been willing to take the risk to approve the foreign aid, believing it was important for the U.S. to back Ukraine against Russia's invasion and explaining he wanted to be on the \"right side of history.\"\n\nHighly unusual, the boost from Democrats led by Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, showed the exhaustion in Congress over the far-right antics. Jeffries and his leadership team had said it was time to \"turn the page\" on the GOP turmoil and vote to table Greene's resolution -- ensuring Johnson's job is saved, for now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Our decision to stop Marjorie Taylor Greene from plunging the country into further chaos is rooted in our commitment to solve problems,\" Jeffries said after the vote.\n\nBut Democrats have also made clear their help was for this moment alone, and not a promise of an enduring partnership for Johnson's survival.\n\nAsked about a future motion to vacate the speaker, Jeffries said, \"Haven't given it a thought.\"\n\nAdvertisement'Proud of what I did'\n\nThe move now poses its own political risks for Greene, a high-profile provocateur who has moved to the forefront of the party with her own massive following and proximity to Trump.\n\nGreene was determined to force her colleagues to be on the record with their vote -- putting them in the politically uncomfortable position of backing the speaker and seen as joining forces with Democrats to save him.\n\n\"I'm proud of what I did today,\" Greene said afterward on the Capitol steps.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile reporters and camera crews crowded around Greene and ally Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., a group of other Republicans gathered on the steps trying to shift the attention away from her and make their own views known.\n\nRep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., said of those trying to remove the speaker, \"They're pretty good at getting attention, but they have not been recognized for their ability to get things done.\"\n\nHe said if they keep pushing to oust the speaker, \"I think you can expect more of the same: Failure.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReps. Carlos Gim\u00e9nez, a Florida Republican, said of Greene: \"She doesn't represent the Republican Party. I'm tired of of this being the face or the voice of the party and getting attention.

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), while 196 Republicans embraced keeping Johnson in the speaker's job. Democrats also overwhelmingly voted to save the GOP speaker, 163 in support of keeping him and 32 against. The overall vote was 359-43, with seven Democratic lawmakers voting present.\n\nAll 11 Republicans who supported Greene's push to consider ousting Johnson were members of the far-right House Freedom Caucus, while all Democrats who voted in opposition of Johnson's leadership or voted present were liberals.\n\nJohnson expressed appreciation for lawmakers' overwhelming \"show of confidence to defeat this misguided effort.\"\n\n\"Hopefully, this is the end of the personality politics and the frivolous character assassination that has defined the 118th Congress,\" Johnson said. \"It's regrettable, it's not who we are as Americans, and we're better than this. We need to get beyond it.\"\n\nThe vast majority of House Republicans sided with Johnson, despite the fact that his right flank is infuriated by his work to pass crucial legislation with Democratic votes. More government-minded Republicans, however, are tired of the constant drama and loss of focus on retaining the GOP majority in November. Johnson points out that it is difficult governing in a House where Republicans have a slender majority and must work with a Democratic-led Senate and White House.\n\nAfter threatening to do so for months, Greene officially filed her motion Wednesday, prompting boos from fellow Republicans and moves to immediately derail the effort. In response, Greene said, \"This is the uniparty for the American people watching.\"\n\nJohnson continued to mingle with Republicans, shaking hands and cracking smiles after the House overwhelmingly saved him from being ousted. After the vote series ended Wednesday, Johnson briefly met with Greene on the House floor.\n\nA remarkable number of House Republicans joined with Democrats to rescue the speaker, who has been in the job for a little over six months. Johnson earned grudging respect from more traditional Republicans for ensuring that the government didn't run out of funding and sending aid to U.S. allies Israel and Ukraine, but he only did so with Democratic support, infuriating members such as Greene.\n\nJohnson has also been emboldened by the backing of former president Donald Trump, who reiterated his support for the Louisiana Republican over the weekend.\n\nIn a message posted on Truth Social right after the vote, Trump lauded Johnson as \"a good man who is trying very hard.\" He argued that with a House \"Majority of One,\" Republicans \"have to be fighting the Radical Left Democrats, and all the Damage they have done to our Country\" because otherwise their infighting will be portrayed as \"CHAOS\" and \"negatively affect everything.\"\n\n\"We're not in a position of voting on a Motion to Vacate. At some point, we may very well be, but this is not the time,\" Trump said, while praising Greene as someone with \"Spirit\" and \"Fight.\"\n\nGreene said she was \"thankful for President Trump's support\" even though his statement against the motion to vacate \"unfortunately\" came after the vote occurred. She was mum when pressed repeatedly on whether she would file such a motion in the future, pointing out that Trump did not rule out supporting it.\n\n\"I think it's important for us to pursue our Republican agenda. Our Republican agenda is what our Republican colleagues should be supporting, not the Democrat agenda,\" Greene said.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) would not say after the vote whether Democrats would come to Johnson's rescue if Greene or another Republican would move to oust him again, but he repeated that the caucus would \"continue to solve problems for everyday Americans to put people over politics, as we once again did today.\"\n\nJohnson has evolved in the speaker's job over his short tenure, and he declared this week that he intended to continue governing House Republicans past the 2024 elections.\n\n\"I intend to lead this conference in the future,\" Johnson said Tuesday. \"We have plans for the next Congress, and we've been outlining a lot of that.\n\nThe tide in Greene's battle to oust Johnson probably turned when House Democratic leadership announced that they would support defeating Greene's effort. Even though some Democratic lawmakers dissented, Jeffries and his lieutenants argued that Johnson had delivered on Ukraine aid and that Democrats should be focused on looking like the adults in the room capable of governing.\n\nAfter the House clerk read Greene's motion Wednesday afternoon, House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) officially moved to kill it. The chamber overwhelmingly yelled \"yea\" in almost unanimous agreement, while Greene and Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) were the only two heard saying \"nay.\" The chamber erupted in laughter.\n\nJohnson was on the House floor as Greene moved against him. He stood alongside his chief of staff and mingled with members. Scalise looked serious and contemplative over the gravity of the moment.\n\nGreene's motion comes days after she and Massie met repeatedly with Johnson to outline demands for him to accept, or face a vote against his speakership. Greene and Massie sat together in the chamber, and along with Rep. Paul A. Gosar (R-Ariz.) are the only publicly declared lawmakers who want to eject Johnson.\n\nThe pair of hard-liners demanded that Johnson no longer send aid to Ukraine this year; only put bills on the floor that a majority of Republicans agree with; move to defund any Justice Department investigation into Trump; and pass a dozen individual spending bills or institute a 1 percent cut across government agencies.\n\nJohnson denied negotiating with the pair after House Republicans expressed fears that he would be cutting deals in a manner similar to what eventually led to the ouster of Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) last October. Greene and Massie met with Johnson again Tuesday in hopes that the speaker would give them an answer.\n\nJohnson's response never came. Sources familiar with the speaker's thinking said Johnson was not going to publicly announce his position under the circumstances.\n\nHis lack of response sparked Greene's decision to introduce her motion under special rules Wednesday afternoon. She was immediately greeted with \"boos\" from fellow House Republican colleagues.\n\nGreene has become the second Republican over the past year to introduce a motion to topple their party's speaker under special rules that force the House to take up the measure in 48 hours. But unlike the successful ouster of McCarthy, which was spearheaded by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), this time Democrats had pledged to maintain order in the House by keeping Johnson as speaker.\n\nGreene had threatened to move against the speaker since earlier this year. She filed her motion in March after Johnson relied on Democrats to fund the government multiple times since taking the top job more than six months ago. It wasn't until after a majority of Republicans opposed Johnson's plan to send $61 billion in new funds for Ukraine that Greene pledged to act.", "source": {"uri": "matzav.com", "dataType": "news",

Mike Johnson as House Speaker | Politics", "body": "Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene initiated a vote to remove Speaker Mike Johnson due to his support for Ukraine aid. Despite Republican opposition, the vote is likely to be imminent. Johnson has gained support from Democrats, as well as Trump and the Republican National Committee. Greene's move could result in a lengthy search for a new GOP leader if Johnson is removed.\n\nHardline Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene called Wednesday for a vote to oust Speaker Mike Johnson, pressing ahead with her long-shot effort despite pushback from Republicans at the highest levels tired of the political chaos. Greene, who is one of Donald Trump's biggest supporters in Congress, stood on the House floor and read a long list of \"transgressions\" she said Johnson had committed as speaker. Colleagues booed in protest.\n\nThe vote, which under House rules is required within two days, could happen imminently. The Georgia Republican had vowed she would force a vote on the motion to vacate the Republican speaker if he dared to advance a foreign aid package with funds for Ukraine, which was overwhelmingly approved late last month and signed into law. But in recent days it seemed her effort had cooled, as she and Johnson met repeatedly for a potential resolution. Johnson of Louisiana marched on, saying he had been willing to take the risk, believing it was important for the U.S. to back Ukraine against Russia's invasion and explaining he wanted to be on the \"right side of history.\" \"I just have to do my job every day,\" Johnson said Monday.\n\nIn a highly unusual move, the speaker received a boost from Democrats led by Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, whose leadership team has said it was time to \"turn the page\" on the GOP turmoil and vote to table Greene's resolution -- almost ensuring Johnson's job is saved, for now. Trump also weighed in after Johnson trekked to Mar-a-Lago for a visit, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee giving the speaker his nod of approval. And Trump's hand-picked leader at the Republican National Committee urged House Republicans off the move. The move now poses its own political risks for Greene, R-Ga., a high-profile provocateur. Forcing the vote could bring the House chamber to a standstill, as happened last year when eight Republicans voted to ousted Kevin McCarthy from the speaker's office, and Democrats declined to help save him. Or it could be over in a matter of minutes, as Democrats join Republicans to table the effort.\n\nOusting McCarthy resulted in a nearly monthlong search for a new GOP leader, and there is no immediate successor if Johnson is removed.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Subcultures", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Subcultures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Squash", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Squash", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/27_05_2019_11_50_40_2945094.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551299", "eventUri": "eng-9551299", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

Marjorie Taylor Greene to call a vote to remove Mike Johnson as speaker of the House. The vote was 359-43 with seven members voting present. 196 Republicans and 163 Democrats voted to table the motion.\n\n\"Hopefully, this is the end of the personality politics and the frivolous character assassination that has defined the 118th Congress,\" Johnson told reporters after the vote. \"It's regrettable. It's not who we are as Americans and we're better than this -- we need to get beyond it.\"\n\nOnly 10 Republicans voted alongside Greene.\n\nAs promised, House Democrats largely supported Johnson in setting aside the call for his removal, making Greene's endeavor symbolic.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries called Greene a \"chaos agent\" in remarks after the vote.\n\n\"The only thing we ask of our House Republican colleagues is for traditional Republicans to further isolate the extreme MAGA Republican wing of the GOP, which has visited nothing but chaos and dysfunction on the American people,\" he said.\n\nThe vote was the culmination of weeks of threats from the Georgia Republican.\n\nWhile the measure failed, Greene and other Republicans remain angry with Johnson's reliance on votes from Democrats to pass major legislation.\n\n\"Mike Johnson worked with [Senate Majority Leader] Chuck Schumer rather than the conference and gave Joe Biden and the Democrats everything they wanted -- no different from how a Speaker Hakeem Jeffries would have done,\" Greene said on the floor, reading a litany of criticisms against Johnson.\n\n\"This is the uni-party for the American people watching,\" Greene said as the House chamber erupted into boos as she brought forward the motion to vacate.\n\nGreene has been weighing whether to trigger a vote to oust Johnson since shefiled the motion in March, after objecting to his negotiating with Democrats on a$1.2 trillion spending packagethat ultimately passed the House with more Democratic support than Republican support.\n\nLast week, Greene threatened to move forward with the motion to vacate after the House voted on an aid bill for Ukraine.\n\nTwo Republican co-sponsored her resolution -- Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar and Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie.\n\nGreene met twice this week with Johnson, including an over two-hour meeting on Monday.\n\n\"Everybody was listening -- it wasn't a shouting match,\" Massie said of the Monday meeting. \"[Greene] and I decided to give Speaker Johnson one last chance to say he's going to be with the Republicans and not with the Democrats, and there are some litmus tests on that.\"\n\nGreene and Massie said those litmus tests include no additional funding for Ukraine, no funding toward the special counsel investigation into former President Donald Trump, and Johnson only bringing legislation to the floor that has the support of the majority of the GOP conference.\n\nIn an appearance on Steve Bannon's \"War Room\" podcast Tuesday, Greene said she also wants twelve separate appropriations bills and not another omnibus led by Schumer \"rammed down our throat.\"\n\n\"That will not be tolerated again,\" she said, adding that if House Republicans don't get the twelve distinct bills, she wants to see a one percent cut to spending.\n\nAlthough members of the hardline House Freedom Caucus have expressed dissatisfaction with Johnson's actions in his short tenure as speaker, most say they still don't want to put the conference through another speaker fight.\n\nGreene has also been under pressure from former President Trump. Greene and Trump spoke over the weekend and Trump urged her to back down, according to a source familiar with the conversation.\n\nAfter the vote on Wednesday, Trump took to social media to request that Republican members vote to table the motion.\n\n\"We're not in a position of voting on a Motion to Vacate,\" he wrote. \"At some point, we may very well be, but this is not the time.\"", "source": {"uri": "wfae.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "WFAE 90.7 - Charlotte's NPR News Source"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/118th_United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "118th United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Massie", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Massie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Marjorie Taylor Greene tried and failed in sudden action Wednesday to oust Speaker Mike Johnson, her long-shot effort swiftly and resoundingly rejected by Democrats and Republicans tired of the political chaos.\n\nOne of Donald Trump's biggest supporters in Congress, Greene stood on the House floor and read a long list of \"transgressions\" she said Johnson had committed as speaker. Colleagues booed in protest.\n\nGreene of Georgia criticized Johnson's leadership as \"pathetic, weak and unacceptable.\"\n\nNo sooner than Greene triggered the vote on her motion to vacate the speaker from his office, the Republican Majority Leader Steve Scalise countered by calling first for a vote to table it.\n\nAn overwhelming majority, 359-43, kept Johnson in his job, for now.\n\nSecond such action in recent months\n\nIt's the second time in a matter of months that Republicans have tried to oust their own speaker, an unheard of level of party turmoil with a move rarely seen in U.S. history.\n\nAs Greene pressed ahead despite pushback from Republicans at the highest levels, GOP lawmakers filtered towards Johnson, giving him pats on the back and grasping his shoulder to assure him of their support.\n\n\"We need steady hands at the wheel,\" Johnson said afterward. \"The country desperately needs a functioning Congress.\"\n\nThe Georgia Republican had vowed she would force a vote on the motion to vacate the Republican speaker if he dared to advance a foreign aid package with funds for Ukraine, which was overwhelmingly approved late last month and signed into law.\n\nBut in recent days it seemed her effort had cooled, as she and Johnson met repeatedly for a potential resolution.\n\nJohnson of Louisiana marched on, saying he had been willing to take the risk, believing it was important for the U.S. to back Ukraine against Russia's invasion and explaining he wanted to be on the \"right side of history.\"\n\n\"I just have to do my job every day,\" Johnson said Monday.\n\nIn a highly unusual move, the speaker received a boost from Democrats led by Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, whose leadership team had said it was time to \"turn the page\" on the GOP turmoil and vote to table Greene's resolution -- almost ensuring Johnson's job is saved, for now.\n\nTrump weigns in\n\nTrump also weighed in after Johnson trekked to Mar-a-Lago for a visit, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee giving the speaker his nod of approval. And Trump's hand-picked leader at the Republican National Committee urged House Republicans off the move.\n\nAhead of the vote, Trump said on social media, \"I absolutely love Marjorie Taylor Greene,\" but he said Republicans need to be fighting now to defeat Democrats in the November election.\n\n\"This is not the time,\" Trump said, to oust the speaker.\n\nThe move now poses its own political risks for Greene, a high-profile provocateur.\n\nGreene was determined to force her colleagues to be on the record with their vote -- putting them in the politically uncomfortable position of backing the speaker and seen as joining forces with Democrats to save him.\n\nThe tally showed the strength, but also the weakness, of her effort, as most lawmakers voted to move past the infighting and allow the Republican speaker, just six months in the office, to keep the gavel.\n\nLast year, the House chamber was brought to a standstill when eight Republicans voted to oust Kevin McCarthy from the speaker's office, and Democrats declined to help save him.\n\nOusting McCarthy resulted in a nearly monthlong search for a new GOP leader, throwing the chamber into turmoil with an

In my view, that is leadership.\"\n\nIt's the second time in a matter of months that Republicans have worked to oust their own speaker, an unheard of level of party upheaval with a move rarely seen in U.S. history.\n\nWhile the outcome temporarily calms the latest source of House disruption, the vote tally shows the strengths but also the stark limits of Johnson's hold on the gavel, and the risks ahead for any Republican trying to lead the GOP.\n\nWithout Democratic help, Johnson would have certainly faced a more dismal outcome. All told, 11 Republicans voted to proceed with Greene's effort, more than it took to oust then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy last fall, a first in U.S. history.\n\nBut by relying on Democratic backing, Johnson risks inciting more criticism that he is insufficiently loyal to the party.\n\nAnd the threat still lingers -- any single lawmaker can call up the motion to vacate the speaker.\n\nEven though Trump provided a needed nod of support for Johnson at crucial moments, it's not bankable going forward. The former president posed an idle warning about potentially ousting the speaker as voting was getting underway.\n\n\"At some point, we may very well be, but this is not the time,\" Trump said on social media.\n\nTrump also made clear he still valued Greene, perhaps his biggest ally in the House, even as he rejected her proposal. \"I absolutely love Marjorie Taylor Greene,\" he said as he urged Republicans to table her motion.\n\nAs Greene pressed ahead with the snap vote, GOP lawmakers filtered towards Johnson, giving him pats on the back and grasping his shoulder to assure him of their support.\n\nThe Georgia Republican had vowed weeks ago she would force a vote on the motion to vacate the Republican speaker if he dared to advance the foreign aid package for Ukraine, which was overwhelmingly approved late last month and signed into law.\n\nBut in recent days it seemed her effort had cooled, as she and Johnson met repeatedly for a potential resolution.\n\nJohnson of Louisiana marched on, saying he had been willing to take the risk to approve the foreign aid, believing it was important for the U.S. to back Ukraine against Russia's invasion and explaining he wanted to be on the \"right side of history.\"\n\nHighly unusual, the boost from Democrats led by Rep.

Jeffries and his leadership team had said it was time to \"turn the page\" on the GOP turmoil and vote to table Greene's resolution -- ensuring Johnson's job is saved, for now.\n\n\"Our decision to stop Marjorie Taylor Greene from plunging the country into further chaos is rooted in our commitment to solve problems,\" Jeffries said after the vote.\n\nBut Democrats have also made clear their help was for this moment alone, and not a promise of an enduring partnership for Johnson's survival.\n\nAsked about a future motion to vacate the speaker, Jeffries said, \"Haven't given it a thought.\"\n\nThe move now poses its own political risks for Greene, a high-profile provocateur who has moved to the forefront of the party with her own massive following and proximity to Trump.\n\nGreene was determined to force her colleagues to be on the record with their vote - putting them in the politically uncomfortable position of backing the speaker and seen as joining forces with Democrats to save him.\n\n\"I'm proud of what I did today,\" Greene said afterward on the Capitol steps.\n\nWhile reporters and camera crews crowded around Greene and ally Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., a group of other Republicans gathered on the steps trying to shift the attention away from her and make their own views known.\n\nRep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., said of those trying to remove the speaker, \"They're pretty good at getting attention, but they have not been recognized for their ability to get things done.\"\n\nHe said if they keep pushing to oust the speaker, \"I think you can expect more of the same: Failure.\"\n\nReps. Carlos Gim\u00e9nez, a Florida Republican, said of Greene: \"She doesn't represent the Republican Party. I'm tired of of this being the face or the voice of the party and getting attention. That's all she wants, is the attention.\"\n\nRep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., called for Greene and Massie to be punished for their actions.\n\nHad Democrats not taken the unusual move to help, the vote would most likely have ended differently for Johnson who holds one of the slimmest majorities in the House in modern times, with no votes to spare.\n\nLast year, the House chamber was hurled into chaos when eight Republicans voted to remove McCarthy from the speaker's office and Democrats declined to help save him.\n\nOusting McCarthy resulted in a nearly monthlong search for a new GOP leader, bringing the chamber to a standstill with an episode Republicans wanted to avoid ahead of the November election.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_to_vacate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Motion to vacate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "History of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Scalise", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Scalise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Lawler", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Lawler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusty_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dusty Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Massie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Massie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_A._Gim\u00e9nez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos A.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, to stand down in her effort to oust Mike Johnson on Wednesday. Trump defended Greene but said now is 'not the time' for her motion, and said it is 'his request' that Republicans vote to table the motion - even though the post was after the vote to table had passed. 'I absolutely love Marjorie Taylor Greene. She's got Spirit, she's got Fight, and I believe she'll be around, and on our side, for a long time to come,' he wrote. 'With a Majority of One, shortly growing to three or four, we're not in a position of voting on a Motion to Vacate. At some point, we may very well be, but this is not the time.'\n\nTrump went on: 'If we show DISUNITY, which will be portrayed as CHAOS, it will negatively affect everything!' He called Mike Johnson a 'good man who is trying very hard.' Greene, R-Ga. (pictured), was left humiliated in Congress on Wednesday as her bid to oust Speaker Mike Johnson spectacularly failed. Just 10 Republican colleagues joined the GOP firebrand in voting to advance the motion to vacate that would kick the speaker out of office. It took just 30 minutes for her effort to collapse in scenes reminiscent of the circus that led to the vote to get rid of Kevin McCarthy. Only 43 House members voted to move Greene's motion forward.\n\nA vote to 'table' or kill, the motion succeeded 359 to 43. The typically reserved Johnson let loose after the vote: 'Hopefully, this is the end of the personality politics and the frivolous character assassination that has defined the 118th Congress.' Only thirty-two Democrats voted against the effort to kill the motion, a spectacular reversal from months ago when all Democrats voted with eight Republicans to kick out McCarthy. More Republicans - 11 - voted to oust Johnson than McCarthy - eight - even as the Louisiana Republican had at one time been pitched as the conservative alternative to his California counterpart. Greene had been met with boos and eye rolls as she called up her motion during votes on Wednesday. Members of the GOP accused her of throwing a 'tantrum' and attention-seeking as she brought her motion to vacate to the House floor on Wednesday night.\n\nThe Georgia lawmaker has pressed ahead with trying to dethrone Johnson, even though it had virtually no support. She made her motion to vacate him privileged on Wednesday evening, prompting a frenzied vote on whether or not to fire him that had to occur within two legislative days. Knowing Democrats would not support advancing the motion, Johnson took Greene head-on and called the vote immediately. The movement came after four plus hours of meetings this week between Greene and Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and the speaker where the rabble-rousing pair laid out a list of demands for Johnson. 'Speaker Johnson has not lived up to a single one of his self-imposed tenets,' Greene said.\n\nRepublicans have increasingly grown frustrated with Greene and her efforts to throw the House back into chaos, just like after the ouster of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy . 'It's times like this you need a bar in this place,' Rep. Dave Joyce, R-Ohio, muttered as he came off the House floor. 'You're not the Republican Party!' Rep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Fla., heckled Greene as she gaggled with reporters after the vote.' Moscow Marjorie has clearly gone off the deep end -- maybe the result of a space laser,' said Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y. Asked if he thought Greene should be punished, Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., said: 'One dumpster fire at a time.' On the House floor, Greene railed against the two-part spending bill that funded the government for fiscal year 2024, a bill that reauthorized spy tool FISA without warrants and a foreign aid package that did not include border security.\n\nJohnson spearheaded a $95 billion foreign policy bill that passed last month with Democrat support authorizing nearly $61 billion to Ukraine , along with billions to Israel and Taiwan . He was forced to rely on support from Democrats as he presides over a tiny one-vote majority in the House, and it's challenging to get the unruly GOP conference in line. 'Excuses like 'this is just how you have to govern' and divided government are pathetic, weak and unacceptable. Even with our razor thin Republican majority, we could have at least secured the border,' Greene said. Greene accused Johnson of 'aiding and abetting Democrats' to 'destroy our country,' as Democrats booed her and Johnson shook hands and smiled at the Republicans who support him. Just one day earlier, Greene and Massie said they would give Johnson some time to respond to their demands.\n\nThose demands included 'not another red cent for Ukraine,' adhering to the so-called 'Hastert Rule' which means not bringing legislation to the floor that does not have the support of a majority of Republicans. And another is to defund Special Counsel Jack Smith's investigation into former President Donald Trump for 'inciting' the January 6 riot and for his alleged mishandling of classified documents - which the Democratic-led Senate and White House would never agree to. 'You can't make things happen instantly. And we all are aware and understanding of that. So now the ball is in his court, and he's supposed to be reaching out to us, hopefully soon,' Greene said.\n\nIf Congress can't pass all 12 spending bills to fund the government in fiscal year 2025 by September 30, Greene and Massie wanted a continuing resolution to punt the deadline through the November elections with an automatic one percent cut. He 'shacked up with Democrats to get FISA without warrants, to get the minibus passed, and to get the funding for Ukraine,' said Massie. of the speaker 'It's time for him to come home now.' Greene, Massie and Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., had all co-sponsored the motion to vacate. Democrats gave advance notice that they would vote to table - or kill - the motion, essentially taking air out of the Republican trio's threat.\n\nStill, Johnson spent hours with Greene this week, as some Republicans questioned why he would negotiate with his biggest GOP antagonist. 'It's not a negotiation,' he insisted. 'Everybody knows I have lengthy discussions, detailed discussions, on a daily basis with members across the conference. Greene has increasingly found herself at odds with former President Donald Trump in her crusade against Johnson. Trump has publicly supported the speaker and noted the difficulties of operating under a one-vote majority.\n\nRecent reports came to light of a phone call where Trump told Greene to back off of the ouster. Greene declined to share details on whether the former president was supportive of her motion. 'I have to tell you, I love President Trump. My conversations with him are fantastic. And again, I'm not going to go into details. You want to know why I'm not insecure about that. And I don't have to go into the details here with you guys,' she told reporters.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort to remove Speaker Johnson from office", "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hardline Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene tried and failed in sudden action Wednesday to oust Speaker Mike Johnson, her long-shot effort swiftly and resoundingly rejected by Democrats and Republicans tired of the political chaos.\n\nOne of Donald Trump's biggest supporters in Congress, Greene stood on the House floor and read a long list of \"transgressions\" she said Johnson had committed as speaker. Colleagues booed in protest.\n\nGreene of Georgia criticized Johnson's leadership as \"pathetic, weak and unacceptable.\"\n\nNo sooner than Greene triggered the vote on her motion to vacate the speaker from his office, the Republican Majority Leader Steve Scalise countered by calling first for a vote to table it.\n\nAn overwhelming majority, 359-43, kept Johnson in his job, for now.\n\n\"As I've said from the beginning, and I've made clear here every day, I intend to do my job,\" Johnson said afterward. \"And I'll let the chips fall where they may. In my view, that is leadership.\"\n\nIt's the second time in a matter of months that Republicans have worked to oust their own speaker, an unheard of level of party turmoil with a move rarely seen in U.S. history.\n\nThe tally shows the strengths but also the stark limits of Johnson's hold on the gavel, and the risks ahead for any Republican trying to lead the GOP in the Trump era. Without Democratic help, Johnson would have certainly faced a more dismal outcome.\n\nAll told 11 Republicans voted to proceed with Greene's effort, more than it took to oust then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy last fall, a first in U.S. history. And the threat still lingers -- any single lawmaker can call up the motion to vacate the speaker.\n\nJohnson said he hoped it \"is the end of the personality politics.\"\n\nAs Greene pressed ahead with the snap vote despite pushback from Republicans at the highest levels, including Trump, GOP lawmakers filtered towards Johnson, giving him pats on the back and grasping his shoulder to assure him of their support.\n\nThe Georgia Republican had vowed weeks ago she would force a vote on the motion to vacate the Republican speaker if he dared to advance a foreign aid package for Ukraine, which was overwhelmingly approved late last month and signed into law.\n\nBut in recent days it seemed her effort had cooled, as she and Johnson met repeatedly for a potential resolution.\n\nJohnson of Louisiana marched on, saying he had been willing to take the risk to approve the foreign aid, believing it was important for the U.S. to back Ukraine against Russia's invasion and explaining he wanted to be on the \"right side of history.\"\n\nIn a highly unusual move, the speaker received a boost from Democrats led by Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, whose leadership team had said it was time to \"turn the page\" on the GOP turmoil and vote to table Greene's resolution -- almost ensuring Johnson's job is saved, for now.\n\n\"Our decision to stop Marjorie Taylor Greene from plunging the country into further chaos is rooted in our commitment to solve problems,\" Jeffries said after the vote.\n\nToday's Top Headlines Mica Miller's final hours: NC sheriff releases findings of Myrtle Beach woman's death Timeline: What happened on the day Mica Miller died?

And Trump's hand-picked leader at the Republican National Committee urged House Republicans off the move.\n\nAhead of House voting, Trump said on social media, \"I absolutely love Marjorie Taylor Greene,\" but he said Republicans need to be fighting now to defeat Democrats in the November election. He urged Republicans to table Greene's motion.\n\n\"At some point, we may very well be, but this is not the time,\" Trump said, to oust the speaker.\n\nThe move now poses its own political risks for Greene, a high-profile provocateur who has moved to the forefront of the party with her own massive following and proximity to Trump.\n\nGreene was determined to force her colleagues to be on the record with their vote - putting them in the politically uncomfortable position of backing the speaker and seen as joining forces with Democrats to save him.\n\n\"I'm proud of what I did today,\" Greene said afterward on the Capitol steps.\n\nWhile reporters and camera crews crowded around Greene and ally Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., a group of other Republicans gathered on the steps trying to shift the attention away from her and make their own views known.\n\nRep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., said of those trying to remove the speaker, \"They're pretty good at getting attention, but they have not been recognized for their ability to get things done.\"\n\nHe said if they keep pushing to oust the speaker, \"I think you can expect more of the same: Failure.\"\n\nReps. Carlos Gim\u00e9nez, a Florida Republican, said of Greene: \"She doesn't represent the Republican Party. I'm tired of of this being the face or the voice of the party and getting attention. That's all she wants, is the attention.\"\n\nRep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., called for Greene and Massie to be punished for their actions.\n\nHad Democrats not taken the unusual move to help, the vote would most likely have ended differently for Johnson who holds one of the slimmest majorities in the House in modern times, with no votes to spare.\n\nLast year, the House chamber was hurled into chaos when eight Republicans voted to remove McCarthy from the speaker's office and Democrats declined to help save him.\n\nOusting McCarthy resulted in a nearly monthlong search for a new GOP leader, bringing the chamber to a standstill with an episode Republicans wanted to avoid ahead of the November election.\n\nAssociated Press writers Stephen Groves, Mary Clare Jalonick, Michelle Price and Farnoush Amiri contributed to this report.", "source":

It seems the Democrats really like this Johnson guy.\n\nMakes you wonder, doesn't it?\n\nSo the latest is that Speaker Mike Johnson and his crew just took in a win.\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene tried to oust him but the hordes of Dems and most Republicans swarmed in to protect him.\n\nThe scoreboard speaks volumes: 359-43 to table Greene's motion.\n\nOnly 10 Republicans sided with Greene.\n\nLooks like Johnson's got the speaker's chair on lockdown, at least for now.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and his allies beat back a dramatic effort by far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene to oust him from power Wednesday, ending -- for now -- months of threats against his speakership.\n\nThe vote to \"table\" or kill Greene's motion to vacate the speaker's chair was 359-43. Just 10 Republicans voted with Greene, R-Ga.; seven Democrats voted present.\n\nThere were 196 Republicans and 163 Democrats who voted to kill Greene's motion; along with the 11 Republicans, 32 Democrats voted to move forward with her motion.\n\n\"I appreciate the show of confidence from my colleagues to defeat this misguided effort,\" Johnson said in Statuary Hall, just off the House floor, after the vote. \"Hopefully, this is the end of the personality politics and the frivolous character assassination that has defined the 118th Congress. It's regrettable. It's not who we are as Americans, and we're better than this. We need to get beyond it.\"\n\nGreene, who had threatened for weeks to force the issue, dragged her feet as it became clear she didn't have enough support to remove Johnson. Unlike in last year's successful vote to remove former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., many Democrats had made it clear they would vote to save Johnson, especially after he helped stave off a government shutdown, pushed through the renewal of a critical intelligence surveillance spy tool and passed billions of dollars in foreign aid for Ukraine after months of delays.\n\nDuring the last vote series of the week, Greene stood on the floor and announced she was filing a privileged motion to vacate the speaker's chair. Colleagues promptly booed her.\n\n\"This is the 'uniparty' for the American people watching,\" she said in response to the boos, pointing with both hands at Republicans and Democrats in the chamber.\n\nJohnson's mentor and top ally, Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., moved immediately to \"table,\" or \"kill,\" Greene's motion. Johnson's GOP allies were in a strong position to beat back her efforts given that Democratic leaders said on April 30 that their rank-and-file members would help dismiss her motion.\n\n\"Amid this circus, House Democrats have been the adults in the room,\" said Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., a moderate who is running for governor. \"We have too much work to do to waste time on petty political games.\"\n\nThat saves Johnson's job at least temporarily, though the fact that Democrats voted to keep him in power is sure to infuriate conservative activists and outside groups. And nothing would prevent Greene or any other conservative foe from forcing another vote on his fate down the road.\n\nThe 10 Republicans who voted with Greene against tabling the motion were Warren Davidson of Ohio, Alex Mooney of West Virginia, Barry Moore of Alabama, Victoria Spartz of Indiana, Chip Roy of Texas, Eric Burlison of Missouri and Paul Gosar, Eli Crane and Andy Biggs, all of Arizona.\n\nHowever, it isn't clear all of them would have voted on a resolution to oust Johnson had the motion to table failed; Roy said he was undecided.\n\nWhile Greene was passionate about toppling Johnson, her campaign never really gained momentum among her colleagues. Conservatives Massie and Gosar were the only co-sponsors of her resolution. And under normal circumstances, those three GOP votes would have been enough to depose Johnson given the GOP's razor-thin majority if all Democrats voted to remove him.\n\nBut members of both parties are still smarting from the paralysis that took over the House for three weeks last fall after Johnson's predecessor, McCarthy, became the first speaker to be ousted in the middle of a congressional term. Greene, a staunch McCarthy ally, vehemently opposed ousting him and ultimately voted no.\n\nThe idea of Democrats' stepping in to save Johnson began bubbling up over the past several months, with members publicly and privately saying they would vote against Greene's effort in favor of governing.\n\nIn her resolution, and on the floor, Greene quoted Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., who said in a recent CBS \"60 Minutes\" interview: \"Even though we're in the minority, we effectively have been governing as if we were in the majority, because we continue to provide a majority of the votes necessary to get things done. Those are just the facts.\"\n\n\"Speaker Johnson's tenure is defined by one self-serving characteristic,\" Greene said on the floor before the vote. \"When given a choice between advancing Republican priorities or allied with the Democrats to preserve his own personal power, Johnson regularly chooses to ally himself with Democrats.\"\n\nAlthough he signed on to Greene's motion to vacate, Massie repeatedly said he didn't want to force a vote to oust Johnson and cause similar chaos and instead pressed him to resign voluntarily.\n\nLawmakers, including many conservatives, have said they don't want a repeat of the fall speaker fight. In an interview last weekend, Republican National Committee Chair Michael Whatley urged party unity when he was asked about Greene's threat to force a vote to oust Johnson, arguing that the GOP wouldn't be able to flip the Senate and expand its House majority if the party is divided.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting nugget in this whole saga today was when President Trump weighed in.\n\nThat's a VERY interesting post and multiple layers in there to dissect.\n\nFirst, he shows he's on team MTG (and Gaetz) by giving her support first and foremost.\n\nHe then shifts and makes a case for Republican Unity right now, backing the Motion to Table, which keeps Johnson in place.\n\nHe then gives conflicting statements on Speaker Johnson, saying he is a good man who is trying hard, but that he wishes different things had been done over the last two months.\n\nHe also seems to indicate when the Republicans have a stronger majority, he will be in favor of a Motion to Vacate.\n\nI told you, a lot of layers in there!\n\nSo is Trump blindly supporting Speaker Johnson like some feared?\n\nI find it curious that so many on both sides came to his aid in this vote.", "source": {"uri": "100percentfedup.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "100 Percent Fed Up"}, "authors": [{"uri": "m_winger@100percentfedup.com", "name": "M Winger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/118th_United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "118th United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_to_vacate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motion to vacate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort to remove Speaker Johnson from office", "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hardline Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene tried and failed in sudden action Wednesday to oust Speaker Mike Johnson, her long-shot effort swiftly and resoundingly rejected by Democrats and Republicans tired of the political chaos.\n\nOne of Donald Trump's biggest supporters in Congress, Greene stood on the House floor and read a long list of \"transgressions\" she said Johnson had committed as speaker. Colleagues booed in protest.\n\nGreene of Georgia criticized Johnson's leadership as \"pathetic, weak and unacceptable.\"\n\nNo sooner than Greene triggered the vote on her motion to vacate the speaker from his office, the Republican Majority Leader Steve Scalise countered by calling first for a vote to table it.\n\nAn overwhelming majority, 359-43, kept Johnson in his job, for now.\n\nIt's the second time in a matter of months that Republicans have tried to oust their own speaker, an unheard of level of party turmoil with a move rarely seen in U.S. history.\n\nAs Greene pressed ahead despite pushback from Republicans at the highest levels, GOP lawmakers filtered towards Johnson, giving him pats on the back and grasping his shoulder to assure him of their support.\n\n\"We need steady hands at the wheel,\" Johnson said afterward. \"The country desperately needs a functioning Congress.\"\n\nThe Georgia Republican had vowed she would force a vote on the motion to vacate the Republican speaker if he dared to advance a foreign aid package with funds for Ukraine, which was overwhelmingly approved late last month and signed into law.\n\nBut in recent days it seemed her effort had cooled, as she and Johnson met repeatedly for a potential resolution.\n\nJohnson of Louisiana marched on, saying he had been willing to take the risk, believing it was important for the U.S. to back Ukraine against Russia's invasion and explaining he wanted to be on the \"right side of history.\"\n\n\"I just have to do my job every day,\" Johnson said Monday.\n\nIn a highly unusual move, the speaker received a boost from Democrats led by Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, whose leadership team had said it was time to \"turn the page\" on the GOP turmoil and vote to table Greene's resolution -- almost ensuring Johnson's job is saved, for now.\n\nTrump also weighed in after Johnson trekked to Mar-a-Lago for a visit, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee giving the speaker his nod of approval. And Trump's hand-picked leader at the Republican National Committee urged House Republicans off the move.\n\nAhead of the vote, Trump said on social media, \"I absolutely love Marjorie Taylor Greene,\" but he said Republicans need to be fighting now to defeat Democrats in the November election.\n\n\"This is not the time,\" Trump said, to oust the speaker.\n\nThe move now poses its own political risks for Greene, a high-profile provocateur.\n\nGreene was determined to force her colleagues to be on the record with their vote - putting them in the politically uncomfortable position of backing the speaker and seen as joining forces with Democrats to save him.\n\nThe tally showed the strength, but also the weakness, of her effort, as most lawmakers voted to move past the infighting and allow the Republican speaker, just six months in the office, to keep the gavel.\n\nLast year, the House chamber was brought to a standstill when eight Republicans voted to oust Kevin McCarthy from the speaker's office, and Democrats declined to help save him.\n\nOusting McCarthy resulted in a nearly monthlong search for a new GOP leader, throwing the chamber into turmoil with an episode Republicans wanted to avoid before seeking voter support in the November election.\n\n__\n\nAssociated Press writers Stephen Groves and Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.\n\nLisa Mascaro

Marjorie Taylor Greene", "body": "The House overwhelmingly voted to kill a move by Republican hard-liners aimed at ousting House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), saving an unlikely speaker of an unruly House six months after GOP lawmakers moved to oust his predecessor.\n\nOnly 11 Republicans supported the move to \"table\" a measure by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), while 196 Republicans embraced keeping Johnson in the speaker's job. Democrats also overwhelmingly voted to save the GOP speaker, 163 in support of keeping him and 32 against doing so. The overall vote was 359-43, with seven Democratic lawmakers voting present.\n\nGreene officially filed her motion Wednesday, prompting boos from fellow Republicans and moves to immediately derail the effort. In response, Greene said, \"This is the uniparty for the American people watching.\"\n\nJohnson continued to mingle with Republicans, shaking hands and cracking smiles after the House overwhelmingly saved him from being ousted.\n\nA remarkable number of House Republicans joined with Democrats to rescue the speaker, who has only been in the job for a little over six months. Johnson earned grudging respect from more traditional Republicans for ensuring the government didn't run out of funding and sending aid to U.S. allies and Israel and Ukraine, but he only did so with Democratic support, infuriating members like Greene.\n\nJohnson has also been emboldened by the support of former president Donald Trump, who reiterated his support for the Louisiana Republican over the weekend.\n\nAfter the House clerk read Greene's motion on Wednesday afternoon, House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) officially moved to kill Greene's resolution. The chamber overwhelmingly yelled \"yay\" in almost unanimous agreement, while Greene and Massie were the only two heard to say \"nay.\" The chamber erupted in laughter.\n\nJohnson was on the House floor as Greene moved against him. He stood alongside his chief of staff and mingled with members. Scalise looked serious and contemplative of the moment.\n\nGreene's motion comes days after she and Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) met repeatedly with Johnson to outline demands for him to accept or face a vote against his speakership. Greene and Massie sat together in the chamber and along with Rep. Paul A. Gosar (R-Ariz.) are the only publicly declared lawmakers who want to eject Johnson.\n\nThe pair of hard-liners demanded that Johnson no longer send aid to Ukraine this year; only put bills on the floor that a majority of Republicans agree with; move to defund any Justice Department investigation into Trump; and pass a dozen individual spending bills or institute a 1 percent cut across government agencies.\n\nJohnson denied negotiating with the pair after House Republicans balked that he would be cutting deals in a similar manner that eventually led to Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) ouster last October. Greene and Massie met with Johnson again on Tuesday where they had hoped the speaker would give them an answer.\n\nJohnson's response never came. Sources familiar with the speaker's thinking said that Johnson was not going to publicly announce his position under the circumstances.\n\nHis lack of response sparked Greene's decision to introduce her motion under special rules Wednesday afternoon, where she was immediately greeted with \"boos\" from fellow House Republican colleagues.\n\nGreene has become the second Republican over the past year to introduce a motion to topple their party's speaker had she gone through with moving her \"motion to vacate\" under special rules that force the House to take up the measure over the next 48 hours. But unlike the successful ouster of then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), which was spearheaded by Rep.

Marjorie Taylor Greene called Wednesday for a vote to oust Speaker Mike Johnson, pressing ahead with her long-shot effort despite pushback from Republicans at the highest levels tired of the political chaos.\n\nGreene, who is one of Donald Trump\u00b4s biggest supporters in Congress, stood on the House floor and read a long list of \"transgressions\" she said Johnson had committed as speaker. Colleagues booed in protest.\n\nThe vote, which under House rules is required within two days, could happen imminently.\n\nThe Georgia Republican had vowed she would force a vote on the motion to vacate the Republican speaker if he dared to advance a foreign aid package with funds for Ukraine, which was overwhelmingly approved late last month and signed into law.\n\nBut in recent days it seemed her effort had cooled, as she and Johnson met repeatedly for a potential resolution.\n\nJohnson of Louisiana marched on, saying he had been willing to take the risk, believing it was important for the U.S. to back Ukraine against Russia\u00b4s invasion and explaining he wanted to be on the \"right side of history.\"\n\nRep.

Hakeem Jeffries of New York, whose leadership team has said it was time to \"turn the page\" on the GOP turmoil and vote to table Greene\u00b4s resolution - almost ensuring Johnson\u00b4s job is saved, for now.\n\nTrump also weighed in after Johnson trekked to Mar-a-Lago for a visit, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee giving the speaker his nod of approval. And Trump\u00b4s hand-picked leader at the Republican National Committee urged House Republicans off the move.\n\nThe move now poses its own political risks for Greene, R-Ga., a high-profile provocateur.\n\nForcing the vote could bring the House chamber to a standstill, as happened last year when eight Republicans voted to ousted Kevin McCarthy from the speaker\u00b4s office, and Democrats declined to help save him.\n\nOr it could be over in a matter of minutes, as Democrats join Republicans to table the effort.\n\nOusting McCarthy resulted in a nearly monthlong search for a new GOP leader, and there is no immediate successor if Johnson is removed.\n\nSpeaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., speaks during a news conference amid threats that Rep.

Marjorie Taylor Greene on Wednesday officially triggered a vote on her motion to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson, but within minutes Democrats joined almost all Republicans to overwhelmingly reject her move.\n\nThere were audible boos from lawmakers in the chamber as Greene spoke at length about her grievances with Johnson as she called for a vote.\n\nThe Georgia congresswoman, flanked by co-sponsor GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, asserted Johnson had \"not lived up to a single one\" of the promises he made the Republican conference after he was elected to the top post in October.\n\n\"By passing the Democrats' agenda and handcuffing the Republicans' ability and influence legislation, our elected Republican Speaker Mike Johnson has aided and abetted the Democrats and the Biden administration in destroying our country,\" Greene said.\n\nJohnson was on the House floor with his leadership team as Greene read her resolution.\n\nThe House quickly moved to hold a vote on a motion to table, or effectively kill, Greene's effort to oust Johnson. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise rose to request the vote on tabling Greene's resolution, which passed with bipartisan support.\n\nThe final vote to dismiss Greene's motion was 359-43 with seven lawmakers voting present. Lawmakers cheered when the tally was read out.\n\nEleven Republicans and 32 Democrats voted against killing Greene's motion.\n\nJohnson joked with reporters after the vote, saying, \"it's just another Wednesday on Capitol Hill.\"\n\nThe speaker called Greene's resolution a \"misguided effort,\" and thanked his colleagues for supporting him.\n\n\"Hopefully, this is the end of the personality politics and the frivolous character assassination that has defined the 118th Congress. It's regrettable. It's not who we are as Americans and we're better than this. We need to get beyond it,\" Johnson said.\n\nGreene told ABC News Senior Congressional Correspondent Rachel Scott after the vote that she was not surprised by the vote against her motion to vacate the speaker's chair.\n\n\"I think this is exactly the American people needed to see,\" she said.\n\n\"I didn't run for Congress to come up here and join the uni-party, and the uni-party was on full display today,\" she added. \"As a matter of fact, [the Republican Party] proved they're ready to do everything with the Democrats.\"\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said his party's decision to help save Johnson's job was aimed at restoring common sense and quelling chaos in Washington.\n\n\"Our decision to stop Marjorie Taylor Greene, from plunging the House of Representatives and the country into further chaos is rooted in our commitment to solve problems for everyday Americans in a bipartisan manner,\" the New York congressman told reporters. \"We need more common sense and less chaos in Washington, D.C. Marjorie Taylor Greene and extreme MAGA Republicans are chaos agents.\"\n\nWhen asked repeatedly whether Democrats would vote to save Johnson again if further motions to remove him are filed -- or if Democrats would demand concessions from Johnson to do so in the future -- Jeffries said \"the vote clearly speaks for itself.\"\n\n\"It was a vote of conscience. It was overwhelming. It was decisive. And we need to move forward as a Congress,\" he added.\n\nGreene did not answer when asked if she plans on trying to kick out Johnson again.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, who has backed Johnson during his feud with Greene, said in a post on Truth Social that now was not the time to be making motions to vacate.\n\n\"If we show DISUNITY, which will be portrayed as CHAOS, it will negatively affect everything! Mike Johnson is a good man who is trying very hard. I also wish certain things were done over the last period of two months, but we will get them done, together,\" he said.\n\nNevertheless, Greene said she was thankful for Trump's support.\n\nGreene's move Wednesday was a sudden shift in tactics after she appeared to be backing off her weekslong threat, following back-to-back meetings with Johnson on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nIn between meetings, she had given Johnson a list of demands she wanted implemented, which included no more aid to Ukraine and defunding special counsel Jack Smith's office.\n\nABC News' Allison Pecorin and Rachel Scott contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Massie", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Massie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/118th_United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "118th United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

It seems the Democrats really like this Johnson guy.\n\nMakes you wonder, doesn't it?\n\nSo the latest is that Speaker Mike Johnson and his crew just took in a win.\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene tried to oust him but the hordes of Dems and most Republicans swarmed in to protect him.\n\nThe scoreboard speaks volumes: 359-43 to table Greene's motion.\n\nOnly 10 Republicans sided with Greene.\n\nLooks like Johnson's got the speaker's chair on lockdown, at least for now.\n\nNBC News reports:\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and his allies beat back a dramatic effort by far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene to oust him from power Wednesday, ending -- for now -- months of threats against his speakership.\n\nThe vote to \"table\" or kill Greene's motion to vacate the speaker's chair was 359-43. Just 10 Republicans voted with Greene, R-Ga.; seven Democrats voted present.\n\nThere were 196 Republicans and 163 Democrats who voted to kill Greene's motion; along with the 11 Republicans, 32 Democrats voted to move forward with her motion.\n\n\"I appreciate the show of confidence from my colleagues to defeat this misguided effort,\" Johnson said in Statuary Hall, just off the House floor, after the vote. \"Hopefully, this is the end of the personality politics and the frivolous character assassination that has defined the 118th Congress. It's regrettable. It's not who we are as Americans, and we're better than this. We need to get beyond it.\"\n\nGreene, who had threatened for weeks to force the issue, dragged her feet as it became clear she didn't have enough support to remove Johnson. Unlike in last year's successful vote to remove former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., many Democrats had made it clear they would vote to save Johnson, especially after he helped stave off a government shutdown, pushed through the renewal of a critical intelligence surveillance spy tool and passed billions of dollars in foreign aid for Ukraine after months of delays.\n\nDuring the last vote series of the week, Greene stood on the floor and announced she was filing a privileged motion to vacate the speaker's chair. Colleagues promptly booed her.\n\n\"This is the 'uniparty' for the American people watching,\" she said in response to the boos, pointing with both hands at Republicans and Democrats in the chamber.\n\nJohnson's mentor and top ally, Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., moved immediately to \"table,\" or \"kill,\" Greene's motion. Johnson's GOP allies were in a strong position to beat back her efforts given that Democratic leaders said on April 30 that their rank-and-file members would help dismiss her motion.\n\n\"Amid this circus, House Democrats have been the adults in the room,\" said Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., a moderate who is running for governor. \"We have too much work to do to waste time on petty political games.\"\n\nThat saves Johnson's job at least temporarily, though the fact that Democrats voted to keep him in power is sure to infuriate conservative activists and outside groups. And nothing would prevent Greene or any other conservative foe from forcing another vote on his fate down the road.\n\nThe 10 Republicans who voted with Greene against tabling the motion were Warren Davidson of Ohio, Alex Mooney of West Virginia, Barry Moore of Alabama, Victoria Spartz of Indiana, Chip Roy of Texas, Eric Burlison of Missouri and Paul Gosar, Eli Crane and Andy Biggs, all of Arizona.\n\nHowever, it isn't clear all of them would have voted on a resolution to oust Johnson had the motion to table failed; Roy said he was undecided.\n\nWhile Greene was passionate about toppling Johnson, her campaign never really gained momentum among her colleagues. Conservatives Massie and Gosar were the only co-sponsors of her resolution. And under normal circumstances, those three GOP votes would have been enough to depose Johnson given the GOP's razor-thin majority if all Democrats voted to remove him.\n\nBut members of both parties are still smarting from the paralysis that took over the House for three weeks last fall after Johnson's predecessor, McCarthy, became the first speaker to be ousted in the middle of a congressional term. Greene, a staunch McCarthy ally, vehemently opposed ousting him and ultimately voted no.\n\nThe idea of Democrats' stepping in to save Johnson began bubbling up over the past several months, with members publicly and privately saying they would vote against Greene's effort in favor of governing.\n\nIn her resolution, and on the floor, Greene quoted Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., who said in a recent CBS \"60 Minutes\" interview: \"Even though we're in the minority, we effectively have been governing as if we were in the majority, because we continue to provide a majority of the votes necessary to get things done. Those are just the facts.\"\n\n\"Speaker Johnson's tenure is defined by one self-serving characteristic,\" Greene said on the floor before the vote. \"When given a choice between advancing Republican priorities or allied with the Democrats to preserve his own personal power, Johnson regularly chooses to ally himself with Democrats.\"\n\nAlthough he signed on to Greene's motion to vacate, Massie repeatedly said he didn't want to force a vote to oust Johnson and cause similar chaos and instead pressed him to resign voluntarily.\n\nLawmakers, including many conservatives, have said they don't want a repeat of the fall speaker fight. In an interview last weekend, Republican National Committee Chair Michael Whatley urged party unity when he was asked about Greene's threat to force a vote to oust Johnson, arguing that the GOP wouldn't be able to flip the Senate and expand its House majority if the party is divided.\n\nWATCH the longer video:\n\nPerhaps the most interesting nugget in this whole saga today was when President Trump weighed in.\n\nHe posted this to his TruthSocial,\n\nThat's a VERY interesting post and multiple layers in there to dissect.\n\nFirst, he shows he's on team MTG (and Gaetz) by giving her support first and foremost.\n\nHe then shifts and makes a case for Republican Unity right now, backing the Motion to Table, which keeps Johnson in place.\n\nHe then gives conflicting statements on Speaker Johnson, saying he is a good man who is trying hard, but that he wishes different things had been done over the last two months.\n\nHe also seems to indicate when the Republicans have a stronger majority, he will be in favor of a Motion to Vacate.\n\nI told you, a lot of layers in there!\n\nSo is Trump blindly supporting Speaker Johnson like some feared?\n\nI don't think so.\n\nWhat do you think about Speaker Mike Johnson?\n\nI find it curious that so many on both sides came to his aid in this vote.", "source": {"uri": "en-volve.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "enVolve"}, "authors": [{"uri": "a_m_smith@en-volve.com", "name": "A.M.

Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort to remove Speaker Johnson from office", "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hardline Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene stunned colleagues Wednesday by calling for a vote to oust Speaker Mike Johnson, but lawmakers quickly rejected it.\n\nGreene pressed ahead with her long-shot effort despite pushback from Republicans at the highest levels tired of the political chaos.\n\nOne of Donald Trump's biggest supporters in Congress, Greene stood on the House floor and read a long list of \"transgressions\" she said Johnson had committed as speaker. Colleagues booed in protest.\n\nIt was the second time in a matter of months that Republicans have tried to oust their own speaker, an unheard-of level of party turmoil with a move rarely seen in U.S. history.\n\nGreene of Georgia criticized Johnson's leadership as \"pathetic, weak and unacceptable.\"\n\nGOP lawmakers filtered towards Johnson, giving him pats on the back and grasping his shoulder to assure him of their support.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steve Scalise quickly moved to table the effort -- essentially stopping it from going forward. The motion to table was swiftly approved.\n\nThe Georgia Republican had vowed she would force a vote on the motion to vacate the Republican speaker if he dared to advance a foreign aid package with funds for Ukraine, which was overwhelmingly approved late last month and signed into law.\n\nBut in recent days it seemed her effort had cooled, as she and Johnson met repeatedly for a potential resolution.\n\nJohnson of Louisiana marched on, saying he had been willing to take the risk, believing it was important for the U.S. to back Ukraine against Russia's invasion and explaining he wanted to be on the \"right side of history.\"\n\n\"I just have to do my job every day,\" Johnson said Monday.\n\nIn a highly unusual move, the speaker received a boost from Democrats led by Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, whose leadership team had said it was time to \"turn the page\" on the GOP turmoil and vote to table Greene's resolution -- almost ensuring Johnson's job is saved, for now.\n\nTrump also weighed in after Johnson trekked to Mar-a-Lago for a visit, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee giving the speaker his nod of approval. And Trump's hand-picked leader at the Republican National Committee urged House Republicans off the move.\n\nThe move now poses its own political risks for Greene, R-Ga., a high-profile provocateur.\n\nForcing the vote could bring the House chamber to a standstill, as happened last year when eight Republicans voted to oust Kevin McCarthy from the speaker's office, and Democrats declined to help save him.\n\nOusting McCarthy resulted in a nearly monthlong search for a new GOP leader, and there is no immediate successor if Johnson is removed.", "source": {"uri": "fox8.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox 8 News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@fox8.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Scalise", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steve Scalise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://fox8.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2024/05/AP24128731268548.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551299", "eventUri": "eng-9551299", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

Marjorie Taylor Greene and Thomas Massie on May 6.\n\nThe House voted overwhelmingly to set aside a motion by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., to call a vote to remove House Speaker Mike Johnson. The vote was 359-43 with seven members voting present. Democrats provided many of the votes.\n\nThe vote was the culmination of weeks of threats from Greene. While the measure failed, Greene and other Republicans remain angry with Johnson's reliance on votes from Democrats to pass major legislation.\n\n\"Mike Johnson worked with [Senate Majority Leader] Chuck Schumer rather than the conference and gave Joe Biden and the Democrats everything they wanted -- no different from how a Speaker Hakeem Jeffries would have done,\" Greene said, reading a litany of criticisms against Johnson.\n\n\"This is the uni-party for the American people watching,\" Greene said as the House chamber erupted into boos as she brought forward the motion to vacate.\n\nJohnson has operated for nearly two months with the constant threat that any action could trigger a vote to remove him from his job.\n\nBut top House Democrats have said they'll support Johnson, something that makes Greene's endeavor symbolic and also bolsters her argument that Johnson is operating too closely with Democrats.\n\nGreene has been weighing whether to trigger a vote to oust Johnson since she filed the motion in March, after objecting to his negotiating with Democrats on a $1.2 trillion spending package that ultimately passed the House with more Democratic support than Republican support.\n\nLast week, Greene threatened to move forward with the motion to vacate after the House voted on an aid bill for Ukraine.\n\nShe boasts two Republican co-sponsors to the resolution -- Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar and Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie.\n\nGreene met twice this week with Johnson, including an over two-hour meeting on Monday.\n\n\"Everybody was listening -- it wasn't a shouting match,\" Massie said of the Monday meeting. \"[Greene] and I decided to give Speaker Johnson one last chance to say he's going to be with the Republicans and not with the Democrats, and there are some litmus tests on that,\" he said.\n\nGreene and Massie said those litmus tests include no additional funding for Ukraine, no funding toward the special counsel investigation into former President Donald Trump, and Johnson only bringing legislation to the floor that has the support of the majority of the GOP conference.\n\nIn an appearance on Steve Bannon's \"War Room\" podcast Tuesday, Greene said she also wants twelve separate appropriations bills and not another omnibus led by Schumer \"rammed down our throat.\"\n\n\"That will not be tolerated again,\" she said, adding that if House Republicans don't get the twelve distinct bills, she wants to see a one percent cut to spending.\n\nAlthough members of the hardline House Freedom Caucus have expressed dissatisfaction with Johnson's actions in his short tenure as speaker, most say they still don't want to put the conference through another speaker fight.\n\nGreene has also been under pressure from former President Trump.

Marjorie Taylor Greene proceeded with her threat to try to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson Wednesday, calling for a vote on a motion to vacate the speaker from the House floor that lawmakers quickly voted to table -- that is, to kill it -- in a stunning scene that marked a major reversal from a day earlier, and put the threat that had loomed over the speaker to rest.\n\n\"The form of the resolution is as follows: declaring the office of the speaker of the House of Representatives to be vacant,\" the Georgia Republican said, as many in the House chamber booed her. \"This is the uniparty for the American people watching.\"\n\nShortly after Greene moved forward with the motion, triggering a snap vote, the House voted 359 to 43 to table the motion. The bulk of Democrats joined with most House Republicans to do so. Just 11 House Republicans voted against the motion to table.\n\nThe move by Greene marked a reversal from a day earlier, when she appeared to retreat from her threat to trigger a vote to remove Johnson.\n\n\"Right now the ball is in Mike Johnson's court,\" Greene had said after meeting with the speaker on Tuesday.\n\nBut Greene moved forward Wednesday evening and in doing so, she teed up a snap vote that had to take place within two legislative days on whether Johnson should remain speaker. Within minutes, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise motioned to table Greene's effort.\n\nGoing into the vote, Greene had the public backing of only two other House Republicans, Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Paul Gosar of Arizona. Meanwhile, Democrats had pledged to save Johnson after he shepherded a foreign aid bill through the chamber last month.\n\nMinority Leader Hakeem Jeffries explained on \"60 Minutes\" why Democrats would be willing to save Johnson's speakership. \"Our view would traditionally be, 'Let the other side work its own mess out,'\" Jeffries said. \"But when that mess starts to impact the ability to do the job on behalf of the American people, then the responsible thing at that moment might be for us to make clear that we will not allow the extremists to throw the Congress and the country into chaos.\"\n\nHe also suggested that given the sliver of a majority Johnson has as speaker, House Democrats are enormously powerful. \"Even though we're in the minority, we effectively have been governing as if we were in the majority because we continue to provide a majority of the votes necessary to get things done,\" he said. \"Those are just the facts.\"\n\nGreene has been dangling the threat over Johnson since March after he relied on Democrats to push through a $1.2 trillion spending bill to avert a partial government shutdown. Johnson met with Greene on two occasions in as many days this week, where she said she made a list of demands in order to stand down. And Greene has faced intense pressure from her Republican colleagues to reverse course.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump said Wednesday in a social media post that \"this is not the time\" for a motion to vacate, and offered support for Johnson, calling him a \"good man who is trying very hard.\" He added, \"I also wish certain things were done over the last period of two months, but we will get them done, together.\"\n\nThe threat to Johnson's speakership came just months after former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy was ousted in a historic vote that marked the first time a speaker had been removed from his post during a legislative session. Eight House Republicans joined with every Democrat in voting to remove him, leading to a weeks-long effort within the GOP conference to select McCarthy's replacement.\n\nMcCarthy's removal was prompted by similar frustrations from members of his conference, who opposed his move to work with Democratic lawmakers to keep the government funded. But the chaos that ensued when the House sat without a speaker for weeks, coupled with the reality that Johnson generally enjoys more goodwill among his conference than his predecessor, appeared to make lawmakers less willing to make the same choice this time around.\n\nIn remarks to reporters after the vote, Johnson defended himself as a \"lifelong movement conservative Republican,\" and said the nation \"desperately needs a functioning Congress.\" The Louisiana Republican called Greene's attempt to oust him \"misguided.\"\n\n\"Hopefully, this is the end of the personality politics and the frivolous character assassination that has defined 118th Congress,\" he said. \"It's regrettable. It's not who we are as Americans, and we're better than this. We need to get beyond it.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_to_vacate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motion to vacate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Gosar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul Gosar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Massie", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Massie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Scalise", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steve Scalise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/60_Minutes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "60 Minutes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speaker (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/118th_United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "118th United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Marjorie Taylor Greene tried and failed in sudden action Wednesday to oust Speaker Mike Johnson, her long-shot effort swiftly and resoundingly rejected by Democrats and Republicans tired of the political chaos.\n\nWashington, May 9 (AP) Hardline Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene tried and failed in sudden action Wednesday to oust Speaker Mike Johnson, her long-shot effort swiftly and resoundingly rejected by Democrats and Republicans tired of the political chaos.\n\nOne of Donald Trump's biggest supporters in Congress, Greene stood on the House floor and read a long list of \"transgressions\" she said Johnson had committed as speaker. Colleagues booed in protest.\n\nAlso Read | What Is West Nile Fever? As Cases Reported in Kerala, Know All About Symptoms, Causes and Treatment for West Nile Virus Infection.\n\nGreene of Georgia criticized Johnson's leadership as \"pathetic, weak and unacceptable.\"\n\nNo sooner than Greene triggered the vote on her motion to vacate the speaker from his office, the Republican Majority Leader Steve Scalise countered by calling first for a vote to table it.\n\nAlso Read | NEET Exam 2024: NTA Holds NEET UG Undergraduate Medical Entrance Exam Today, Check Dress Code Guidelines, Reporting Time, List of Prohibited Items and Other Important Instructions.\n\nAn overwhelming majority, 359-43, kept Johnson in his job, for now.\n\nIt's the second time in a matter of months that Republicans have tried to oust their own speaker, an unheard of level of party turmoil with a move rarely seen in U.S. history.\n\nAs Greene pressed ahead despite pushback from Republicans at the highest levels, GOP lawmakers filtered towards Johnson, giving him pats on the back and grasping his shoulder to assure him of their support.\n\n\"We need steady hands at the wheel,\" Johnson said afterward. \"The country desperately needs a functioning Congress.\"\n\nThe Georgia Republican had vowed she would force a vote on the motion to vacate the Republican speaker if he dared to advance a foreign aid package with funds for Ukraine, which was overwhelmingly approved late last month and signed into law.\n\nBut in recent days it seemed her effort had cooled, as she and Johnson met repeatedly for a potential resolution.\n\nJohnson of Louisiana marched on, saying he had been willing to take the risk, believing it was important for the U.S. to back Ukraine against Russia's invasion and explaining he wanted to be on the \"right side of history.\"\n\n\"I just have to do my job every day,\" Johnson said Monday.\n\nIn a highly unusual move, the speaker received a boost from Democrats led by Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, whose leadership team had said it was time to \"turn the page\" on the GOP turmoil and vote to table Greene's resolution -- almost ensuring Johnson's job is saved, for now.\n\nTrump also weighed in after Johnson trekked to Mar-a-Lago for a visit, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee giving the speaker his nod of approval. And Trump's hand-picked leader at the Republican National Committee urged House Republicans off the move.\n\nAhead of the vote, Trump said on social media, \"I absolutely love Marjorie Taylor Greene,\" but he said Republicans need to be fighting now to defeat Democrats in the November election.\n\n\"This is not the time,\" Trump said, to oust the speaker.\n\nThe move now poses its own political risks for Greene, a high-profile provocateur.\n\nGreene was determined to force her colleagues to be on the record with their vote - putting them in the politically uncomfortable position of backing the speaker and seen as joining forces with Democrats to save him.\n\nThe tally showed the strength, but also the weakness, of her effort, as most lawmakers voted to move past the infighting and allow the Republican speaker, just six months in the office, to keep the gavel.\n\nLast year, the House chamber was brought to a standstill when eight Republicans voted to oust Kevin McCarthy from the speaker's office, and Democrats declined to help save him.\n\nOusting McCarthy resulted in a nearly monthlong search for a new GOP leader, throwing the chamber into turmoil with an episode Republicans wanted to avoid before seeking voter support in the November election.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., to call a vote to remove House Speaker Mike Johnson. The vote was 359-43 with seven members voting present. Democrats provided many of the votes.\n\nThe vote was the culmination of weeks of threats from Greene. While the measure failed, Greene and other Republicans remain angry with Johnson's reliance on votes from Democrats to pass major legislation.\n\n\"Mike Johnson worked with [Senate Majority Leader] Chuck Schumer rather than the conference and gave Joe Biden and the Democrats everything they wanted -- no different from how a Speaker Hakeem Jeffries would have done,\" Greene said, reading a litany of criticisms against Johnson.\n\n\"This is the uni-party for the American people watching,\" Greene said as the House chamber erupted into boos as she brought forward the motion to vacate.\n\nJohnson has operated for nearly two months with the constant threat that any action could trigger a vote to remove him from his job.\n\nBut top House Democrats have said they'll support Johnson, something that makes Greene's endeavor symbolic and also bolsters her argument that Johnson is operating too closely with Democrats.\n\nGreene has been weighing whether to trigger a vote to oust Johnson since she filed the motion in March, after objecting to his negotiating with Democrats on a $1.2 trillion spending package that ultimately passed the House with more Democratic support than Republican support.\n\nLast week, Greene threatened to move forward with the motion to vacate after the House voted on an aid bill for Ukraine.\n\nShe boasts two Republican co-sponsors to the resolution -- Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar and Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie.\n\nGreene met twice this week with Johnson, including an over two-hour meeting on Monday.\n\n\"Everybody was listening -- it wasn't a shouting match,\" Massie said of the Monday meeting. \"[Greene] and I decided to give Speaker Johnson one last chance to say he's going to be with the Republicans and not with the Democrats, and there are some litmus tests on that,\" he said.\n\nGreene and Massie said those litmus tests include no additional funding for Ukraine, no funding toward the special counsel investigation into former President Donald Trump, and Johnson only bringing legislation to the floor that has the support of the majority of the GOP conference.\n\nIn an appearance on Steve Bannon's \"War Room\" podcast Tuesday, Greene said she also wants twelve separate appropriations bills and not another omnibus led by Schumer \"rammed down our throat.\"\n\n\"That will not be tolerated again,\" she said, adding that if House Republicans don't get the twelve distinct bills, she wants to see a one percent cut to spending.\n\nAlthough members of the hardline House Freedom Caucus have expressed dissatisfaction with Johnson's actions in his short tenure as speaker, most say they still don't want to put the conference through another speaker fight.\n\nGreene has also been under pressure from former President Trump.

Marjorie Taylor Greene fails in attempt to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson * Michigan Advance", "body": "WASHINGTON -- Efforts by a small group of far-right U.S. House Republicans to remove Speaker Mike Johnson from his leadership role failed Wednesday night, ending weeks of infighting about whether the Louisianan should remain the head of that chamber.\n\nRepublican lawmakers joined by Democrats voted 359-43 to table, or set aside, the so-called motion to vacate that Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene originally filed in March, before spending weeks calling for Johnson to resign.\n\nGreene was backed by Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie and Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar ahead of the vote, though a few more GOP lawmakers signaled their frustrations with Johnson's leadership by voting to move ahead with a vote, instead of tabling it.\n\nGreene, reading from her lengthy motion to vacate before the vote, rejected Johnson bringing broadly bipartisan bills to the House floor during his six months as speaker.\n\nThe government funding bills, Greene said, showed that \"Johnson supported fully funding abortion, the trans agenda, the climate agenda, foreign wars and Biden's border crisis, rather than ensuring liberty, opportunity and security for all Americans.\"\n\n\"Mike Johnson is ill-equipped to handle the rigors or the job of speaker of the House and has allowed a uniparty -- one that fuels foreign wars, tramples on civil liberties and increases our disastrous national debt -- to take complete control of the House of Representatives,\" Greene said.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, moved to table Greene's motion.\n\nJohnson, speaking to reporters in Statuary Hall, said he appreciated \"the show of confidence from my colleagues to defeat this misguided effort.\"\n\n\"Hopefully, this is the end of the personality politics and the frivolous character assassination that has defined the 118th Congress,\" Johnson said. \"It's regrettable. It's not who we are as Americans. And we're better than this. We need to get beyond it.\"\n\nJohnson said he planned to work throughout the year to grow the Republican majority in the House and elect Donald Trump as president during November's elections.\n\n\"I'm proud to serve in this position. It's not one that I aspired to. It's not one that I ever expected to have or planned for, but it is the honor of my life and career to do this,\" Jonson said. \"And I will do it, so long as this body will have me do that.\"\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Democratic Whip Katherine Clark and Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar announced last week they would vote to keep Johnson in the speaker's office.\n\n\"We will vote to table Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's Motion to Vacate the Chair,\" they wrote at the time. \"If she invokes the motion, it will not succeed.\"\n\nGreene and Massie met with Johnson for two hours on Monday and about 90 minutes on Tuesday, laying out their requirements for not offering the motion to vacate. Greene said the ball was in Johnson's court on whether to comply with the changes or not.\n\nThe vote was considerably different from the vote to remove former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, that took place in October after Florida GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz filed another motion to vacate.\n\nEight Republicans and the chamber's Democrats all voted to remove McCarthy from his leadership post.\n\nThe House Republican Conference then spent weeks debating behind closed doors who should become their nominee for speaker -- first selecting Scalise, who withdrew after just one day without holding a floor vote; then choosing Ohio's Jim Jordan, who took his bid to the floor for a series of failed votes; and then Minnesota Rep. Tom Emmer, who withdrew after just hours as the nominee.\n\nHouse Republicans then voted to nominate Johnson, who received unanimous support from fellow GOP lawmakers during the floor vote.\n\nJohnson held that leadership role for less than six months before Greene began calling for him to step down from the speaker's office or face a motion to vacate him from the office on the House floor.\n\nGreene and others have become increasingly angry that Johnson has brought bipartisan bills to the floor for votes, including government funding legislation, the reauthorization of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and a $95 billion aid package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.\n\nJohnson's detractors argue that he should have done more to push for conservative policy wins, even though any legislation that passes the House must move through the Democratic-controlled Senate and avoid President Joe Biden's veto pen in order to become law.\n\nGreene has also argued that Johnson allowing broadly bipartisan legislation to pass on the House floor could risk Republican candidates' chances of winning seats during the November elections.", "source": {"uri":

Marjorie Taylor Greene to oust him from power Wednesday, ending -- for now -- months of threats against his speakership.\n\nThe vote to \"table\" or kill Greene's motion to vacate the speaker's chair was 359-43. Just 10 Republicans voted with Greene, R-Ga.; seven Democrats voted present.\n\nThere were 196 Republicans and 163 Democrats who voted to kill Greene's motion; along with the 11 Republicans, 32 Democrats voted to move forward with her motion.\n\n\"I appreciate the show of confidence from my colleagues to defeat this misguided effort,\" Johnson said in Statuary Hall, just off the House floor, after the vote. \"Hopefully, this is the end of the personality politics and the frivolous character assassination that has defined the 118th Congress. It's regrettable. It's not who we are as Americans, and we're better than this. We need to get beyond it.\"\n\nGreene, who had threatened for weeks to force the issue, dragged her feet as it became clear she didn't have enough support to remove Johnson. Unlike in last year's successful vote to remove former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., many Democrats had made it clear they would vote to save Johnson, especially after he helped stave off a government shutdown, pushed through the renewal of a critical intelligence surveillance spy tool and passed billions of dollars in foreign aid for Ukraine after months of delays.\n\nDuring the last vote series of the week, Greene stood on the floor and announced she was filing a privileged motion to vacate the speaker's chair. Colleagues promptly booed her.\n\n\"This is the 'uniparty' for the American people watching,\" she said in response to the boos, pointing with both hands at Republicans and Democrats in the chamber.\n\nJohnson's mentor and top ally, Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., moved immediately to \"table,\" or \"kill,\" Greene's motion. Johnson's GOP allies were in a strong position to beat back her efforts given that Democratic leaders said on April 30 that their rank-and-file members would help dismiss her motion.\n\n\"Amid this circus, House Democrats have been the adults in the room,\" said Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., a moderate who is running for governor. \"We have too much work to do to waste time on petty political games.\"\n\nThat saves Johnson's job at least temporarily, though the fact that Democrats voted to keep him in power is sure to infuriate conservative activists and outside groups. And nothing would prevent Greene or any other conservative foe from forcing another vote on his fate down the road.\n\nThe 10 Republicans who voted with Greene against tabling the motion were Warren Davidson of Ohio, Alex Mooney of West Virginia, Barry Moore of Alabama, Victoria Spartz of Indiana, Chip Roy of Texas, Eric Burlison of Missouri and Paul Gosar, Eli Crane and Andy Biggs, all of Arizona.\n\nHowever, it isn't clear all of them would have voted on a resolution to oust Johnson had the motion to table failed; Roy said he was undecided.\n\nWhile Greene was passionate about toppling Johnson, her campaign never really gained momentum among her colleagues. Conservatives Massie and Gosar were the only co-sponsors of her resolution. And under normal circumstances, those three GOP votes would have been enough to depose Johnson given the GOP's razor-thin majority if all Democrats voted to remove him.\n\nBut members of both parties are still smarting from the paralysis that took over the House for three weeks last fall after Johnson's predecessor, McCarthy, became the first speaker to be ousted in the middle of a congressional term. Greene, a staunch McCarthy ally, vehemently opposed ousting him and ultimately voted no.\n\nThe idea of Democrats' stepping in to save Johnson began bubbling up over the past several months, with members publicly and privately saying they would vote against Greene's effort in favor of governing.\n\nIn her resolution, and on the floor, Greene quoted Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., who said in a recent CBS \"60 Minutes\" interview: \"Even though we're in the minority, we effectively have been governing as if we were in the majority, because we continue to provide a majority of the votes necessary to get things done. Those are just the facts.\"\n\nDemocrats cheered as she quoted their leader.\n\n\"Speaker Johnson's tenure is defined by one self-serving characteristic,\" Greene said on the floor before the vote. \"When given a choice between advancing Republican priorities or allied with the Democrats to preserve his own personal power, Johnson regularly chooses to ally himself with Democrats.\"\n\nAlthough he signed on to Greene's motion to vacate, Massie repeatedly said he didn't want to force a vote to oust Johnson and cause similar chaos and instead pressed him to resign voluntarily.\n\nLawmakers, including many conservatives, have said they don't want a repeat of the fall speaker fight. In an interview last weekend, Republican National Committee Chair Michael Whatley urged party unity when he was asked about Greene's threat to force a vote to oust Johnson, arguing that the GOP wouldn't be able to flip the Senate and expand its House majority if the party is divided.\n\n\"We need to make sure that all of the Republicans understand the gravity of this election cycle, and they do, and we need to make sure that we are on the same page as we're moving forward,\" Whatley said days before the vote.\n\nJohnson allies lashed out at Greene as she filed her motion. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., chair of the Republican Main Street Caucus and no relation to the speaker, ran to cameras on the steps of the Capitol to bash her.\n\n\"We know that this motion is not going to do one thing to make America stronger. It's not going to do one thing to deliver a conservative victory,\" he said. \"She is engaged in a failing act of political theater. ... We're going to do what adults do; we're going to ignore the tantrums and instead work to actually govern this country.\"\n\nAsked whether Greene should be punished for her actions, moderate Rep. Marc Molinaro, R-N.Y., said, \"There should be accountability for those who continue to make this about themselves.\"\n\n\"Lies and dishonesty are a hell of a lot louder than truth and earnestness,\" he said. \"I will leave to you to figure out which side of that equation she is on.\"\n\nAfter the House voted to table, former President Donald Trump wrote on his social media platform that \"I absolutely love Marjorie Taylor Greene\" but said he prefers to see party unity, adding that \"it is my request\" that Republicans vote to table her motion.\n\nIn the end, Trump had no impact on the vote -- it was already finished by the time he published his post.\n\nWhile some Republicans called for retribution against Greene, including stripping her of committee assignments, Johnson sought out the colleague who tried to topple him. He was spotted at the end of Wednesday's vote series hurrying down the center aisle to catch up with Greene and Massie.\n\nJohnson wrapped his arm around Massie and chatted with Greene for several minutes in the back of the chamber.\n\n\"I just talked with them about what they did and why and ... told them that was disappointing and regretful, but we move forward,\" Johnson said.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/118th_United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "118th United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_to_vacate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motion to vacate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Gosar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Gosar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort to oust Speaker Mike Johnson from his leadership post.\n\nThe resounding vote in Johnson's favor - which came with the help of Democrats - brings to an end the most serious challenge to the speakership the Louisiana Republican has faced, at least for now.\n\nAs he navigates a razor-thin majority, the failed ouster effort gives Johnson the opportunity to argue it is time to move on to other issues, though support from Democrats may open him up to more criticism from his right flank.\n\nJohnson spoke briefly with reporters following the vote, calling Greene's campaign against him \"misguided\" and thanking colleagues for a \"show of confidence\" in his leadership.\n\n\"I want to say that I appreciate the show of confidence for my colleagues to defeat this misguided effort,\" he said. \"I've made clear here every day, I intend to do my job, I intend to do what I believe to be the right thing, which I was elected to do. And I'll let the chips fall where they may.\"\n\nGreene had dangled the threat of triggering a vote against the speaker for weeks, a push that reopened bitter divisions within the House GOP conference as many members opposed ousting Johnson.\n\nJohnson was elected speaker last year after conservative hardliners voted to oust former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a historic and unprecedented vote that sparked a tumultuous period of infighting as Republicans struggled to unify around a new leader before eventually coalescing around the Louisiana Republican.\n\nThe House on Wednesday voted to table - or kill - Greene's push to remove Johnson by a tally of 359 to 43. Eleven Republicans voted against tabling.\n\nIn the wake of Johnson's push to pass a major foreign aid package over the objections of hardline conservatives, House Democratic leadership had announced that Democrats would help Johnson keep his job by voting to table.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, Greene did not rule out forcing another vote against Johnson in the future and suggested that a statement from former President Donald Trump on Truth Social supports the potential for a motion to vacate at some point - despite the fact that he urged members to vote to kill her resolution.\n\nPressed by CNN's Manu Raju on whether she would trigger a vote again this Congress, Greene did not answer directly but said she is \"thankful\" for Trump's support and pointed to the fact that he said on Truth Social that \"at some point\" Republicans may be in a position of voting on a motion to vacate.\n\n\"He also said in that statement that we may have to vacate and that's something that I think people need to pay attention to,\" Greene said.\n\nAsked whether she believes Trump was wrong to urge members to vote to table, the congresswoman said, \"I stand with President Trump. I support President Trump. I've talked to him every day about this.\"\n\nGreene and Johnson - as well as Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky - met over several days earlier this week, where Greene outlined her concerns with Johnson's leadership and her priorities. The House was on the verge of recessing for the week when Greene pulled up her motion to vacate the chair, which started a two-legislative-day clock for GOP leaders to hold a vote on her measure.\n\nHouse Republicans were completely caught off guard by Greene's decision to trigger her motion, multiple Republican sources told CNN. GOP leadership did not see this coming and thought after the two productive meetings between Johnson and Greene that there was at least more time before any next steps were taken, the sources added.\n\n\"I was shocked,\" GOP Rep.

Marjorie Taylor Greene's Effort to Remove Speaker Johnson from Office | LatestLY", "body": "Washington, May 9 (AP) Hardline Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene tried and failed in sudden action Wednesday to oust Speaker Mike Johnson, her long-shot effort swiftly and resoundingly rejected by Democrats and Republicans tired of the political chaos.\n\nOne of Donald Trump's biggest supporters in Congress, Greene stood on the House floor and read a long list of \"transgressions\" she said Johnson had committed as speaker. Colleagues booed in protest.\n\nAlso Read | Hardeep Singh Nijjar Killing: Suspect in Killing of Khalistan Separatist Claims He Entered Canada Using 'Study Permit', Says Report.\n\nGreene of Georgia criticized Johnson's leadership as \"pathetic, weak and unacceptable.\"\n\nNo sooner than Greene triggered the vote on her motion to vacate the speaker from his office, the Republican Majority Leader Steve Scalise countered by calling first for a vote to table it.\n\nAlso Read | India Will Offer Alternative To China for Investors With PM Narendra Modi, Mukesh Ambani, Gautam Adani Reshaping Nation to Become Economic Superpower, Reports CNN.\n\nAn overwhelming majority, 359-43, kept Johnson in his job, for now.\n\nIt's the second time in a matter of months that Republicans have tried to oust their own speaker, an unheard of level of party turmoil with a move rarely seen in U.S. history.\n\nAs Greene pressed ahead despite pushback from Republicans at the highest levels, GOP lawmakers filtered towards Johnson, giving him pats on the back and grasping his shoulder to assure him of their support.\n\n\"We need steady hands at the wheel,\" Johnson said afterward. \"The country desperately needs a functioning Congress.\"\n\nThe Georgia Republican had vowed she would force a vote on the motion to vacate the Republican speaker if he dared to advance a foreign aid package with funds for Ukraine, which was overwhelmingly approved late last month and signed into law.\n\nBut in recent days it seemed her effort had cooled, as she and Johnson met repeatedly for a potential resolution.\n\nJohnson of Louisiana marched on, saying he had been willing to take the risk, believing it was important for the U.S. to back Ukraine against Russia's invasion and explaining he wanted to be on the \"right side of history.\"\n\n\"I just have to do my job every day,\" Johnson said Monday.\n\nIn a highly unusual move, the speaker received a boost from Democrats led by Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, whose leadership team had said it was time to \"turn the page\" on the GOP turmoil and vote to table Greene's resolution -- almost ensuring Johnson's job is saved, for now.\n\nTrump also weighed in after Johnson trekked to Mar-a-Lago for a visit, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee giving the speaker his nod of approval. And Trump's hand-picked leader at the Republican National Committee urged House Republicans off the move.\n\nAhead of the vote, Trump said on social media, \"I absolutely love Marjorie Taylor Greene,\" but he said Republicans need to be fighting now to defeat Democrats in the November election.\n\n\"This is not the time,\" Trump said, to oust the speaker.\n\nThe move now poses its own political risks for Greene, a high-profile provocateur.\n\nGreene was determined to force her colleagues to be on the record with their vote - putting them in the politically uncomfortable position of backing the speaker and seen as joining forces with Democrats to save him.\n\nThe tally showed the strength, but also the weakness, of her effort, as most lawmakers voted to move past the infighting and allow the Republican speaker, just six months in the office, to keep the gavel.\n\nLast year, the House chamber was brought to a standstill when eight Republicans voted to oust Kevin McCarthy from the speaker's office, and Democrats declined to help save him.\n\nOusting McCarthy resulted in a nearly monthlong search for a new GOP leader, throwing the chamber into turmoil with an episode Republicans wanted to avoid before seeking voter support in the November election.

Marjorie Taylor Greene effort", "body": "Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., are seen on the House floor before Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida addressed a joint meeting of Congress in U.S. Capitol on Thursday, April 11, 2024.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and his allies beat back a dramatic effort by far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene to oust him from power on Wednesday, ending -- for now -- months of threats against his speakership.\n\nThe lopsided vote to \"table\" or kill Greene's motion to vacate the speaker's chair was 359-43. Just 10 Republicans voted with Greene, seven Democrats voted present.\n\nThere were 196 Republicans and 163 Democrats who voted to kill Greene's motion; along with the 11 Republicans, 32 Democrats voted to move forward with her motion to oust Johnson.\n\nThe vote came after weeks of threats from Greene to force the issue and after dragging her feet as it became clear she didn't have enough support to remove the speaker. Unlike last year's successful vote to remove former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., many Democrats had made clear they would vote to rescue Johnson, particularly after he green-lit votes on bipartisan measures to fund the government and approve Ukraine aid.\n\n\"Speaker Johnson's tenure is defined by one self-serving characteristic: when given a choice between advancing Republican priorities or allied with the Democrats to preserve his own personal power, Johnson regularly chooses to ally himself with Democrats,\" Greene said on the floor prior to the vote\n\nDuring the last vote series of the week, Greene stood on the floor and announced she was filing a privileged motion to vacate the speaker's chair, which forced a vote on Johnson's future. She was promptly booed by colleagues as she formally announced the effort.\n\n\"This is the 'uniparty' for the American people watching,\" she said in response to the boos, pointing with both hands at Republicans and Democrats.\n\nJohnson allies moved immediately to \"table\" or \"kill Greene's vacate motion. His GOP allies were in a strong position to beat back Greene's efforts given that Democratic leaders said on April 30 that their rank-and-file members would help dismiss Greene's motion to vacate the speaker's chair.\n\nThat saves Johnson's job at least temporarily, though the fact that Democrats cast votes to keep him in power is sure to infuriate conservative activists and outside groups. And nothing would prevent Greene or any other conservative foe from forcing another vote on Johnson's fate down the road.\n\nWhile passionate about toppling Johnson, her campaign never really gained momentum among her colleagues. Conservative Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., co-sponsored her vacate resolution. And under normal circumstances, those three GOP votes would have been enough to depose Johnson given the GOP's razor-thin majority and if all Democrats voted to remove him.\n\nBut members of both parties are still smarting from the paralysis that took over the House for three weeks last fall after Johnson's predecessor, McCarthy, became the first speaker to be ousted from his job in the middle of the congressional term. Greene, a staunch McCarthy ally, vehemently opposed ousting McCarthy and ultimately voted no.\n\nIn her resolution, and on the House floor, Greene quoted House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., saying in a recent CBS \"60 Minutes\" interview: \"Even though we're in the minority, we effectively have been governing as if we were in the majority because we continue to provide a majority of the votes necessary to get things done. Those are just the facts.\"\n\nAlthough he signed on to Greene's motion to vacate, Massie repeatedly said he didn't want to force a vote to oust him and cause similar chaos, instead pressing Johnson to resign voluntarily.\n\nLawmakers, including many conservatives, have said they don't want a repeat of the fall speaker fight.\n\nThe idea of Democrats stepping in to save Johnson began bubbling up over the past several months.", "source": {"uri": "cnbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNBC"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scott_wong@cnbc.com", "name": "Scott Wong", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "rebecca_kaplan@cnbc.com", "name": "Rebecca Kaplan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_to_vacate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motion to vacate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fumio_Kishida", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fumio Kishida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Japan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(parliamentary_procedure)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Motion (parliamentary procedure)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Gosar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Gosar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Massie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Massie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/60_Minutes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "60 Minutes"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107400009-1712854997081-gettyimages-2147056533-japan_meeting_165_041124.jpeg?v=1712855116&w=1920&h=1080", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551299", "eventUri": "eng-9551299", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-30", "textStart": 2130, "textEnd": 2138}, {"amb": false, "date": "2011-04-", "textStart": 222, "textEnd": 230}], "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

Here's why...", "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) - Mike Johnson's job isn't safe yet.\n\nIn a stunning show of unity in the often divided House, Democrats joined a majority of Republicans on Wednesday to save the GOP speaker from an attempt by fellow Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene to remove him from his post.\n\nBut while Democrats in the minority threw the Louisiana congressman a life raft by voting on his side, they made clear they might not do so again. That means the threat for Johnson still lingers as Greene and other lawmakers can at any time call up another motion to oust him.\n\nThe episode highlights the increasingly precarious situation for Johnson, who faces the same conservative forces that took down his predecessor, Kevin McCarthy, but with an even smaller majority that has forced him to continuously rely on Democratic support to carry out the most basic functions of legislating. Republicans control the House by the barest of margins, 217-213.\n\nHere\u00b4s what to know about how the House can remove a speaker and what\u00b4s ahead for Johnson:\n\nThe current rules of the House allow any lawmaker - Democrat or Republican - to put forward a resolution declaring the speaker's chair vacant. If the House approves the resolution, it has the effect of ousting the speaker from office.\n\nSpeaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., speaks at a news conference amid threats that Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., a staunch ally of former President Donald Trump, is threatening to oust Johnson from his leadership post, at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, May 7, 2024. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)\n\nThe \"motion to vacate\" has existed for most of congressional history. But it had never been deployed successfully until last October when a rebel band of Republicans joined with Democrats to oust McCarthy as speaker.\n\nMcCarthy\u00b4s removal came, in part, as the result of the concessions he was forced to make to win the speaker\u00b4s gavel in the first place. Among the concessions was agreeing that a motion to vacate could be triggered by a single member - the threshold that historically has been the norm, but that had been abandoned by Democrats in the majority.\n\nProponents of allowing a single lawmaker to file the motion said it promotes accountability, noting its long history in the House.\n\nAt any point, a member of the House can introduce a privileged resolution - a designation that gives it priority over other measures - to declare the office of the speaker of the House of Representatives vacant.\n\nOnce the motion is introduced, the lawmaker sponsoring it can request a vote on the House floor. Such a request forces House leaders to take action within two legislative days.\n\nBut there are procedural motions that members of either party can make to slow or stop the process - and that's exactly what happened when Greene called for a vote Wednesday on removing Johnson.\n\nThe No. 2 House Republican, Steve Scalise, immediately made a motion to \"table\" Greene's resolution, which defeats it if successful. The vote to table was fast and overwhelming, with lawmakers voting 359-43 to defeat her effort and keep Johnson in the job.\n\nThe speaker had fought for months to navigate an increasingly fractured Republican conference, which has - in effect - been operating in the majority in name only since January 2023.\n\nRepublicans unanimously chose Johnson late last year to replace McCarthy after several candidates for the job failed to gain enough support. His conservative bent was seen as a welcome departure by the most extreme members of his party who had accused McCarthy for years of being too moderate.\n\nBut Greene, who became a McCarthy ally late in his tenure, has been skeptical of Johnson\u00b4s speakership from the beginning. While she criticized her fellow far-right colleagues for toppling McCarthy, she had warned Johnson for months that she would try to remove him in a similar fashion if he were to push ahead with a package to support Ukraine as it battles Russia\u00b4s invasion.\n\n\"He should not bring funding for Ukraine,\" Greene had told reporters.\n\nBut Johnson did just that last month when he advanced a foreign aid package for Ukraine to the floor where it was overwhelmingly approved and signed into law.\n\nOther Republicans are also critical of Johnson, including Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who was a co-sponsor of Greene's resolution to oust him.\n\nIt remains to be seen, but the vote Wednesday showed Johnson's job is far from safe.\n\nWithout Democratic help, Johnson could have easily been ousted. Eleven Republicans voted to proceed with Greene\u00b4s effort, more than the number of GOP votes it took to oust McCarthy last fall. Seven Democrats voted present and all but 32 of the others voted with Republicans to block the effort to oust him.\n\n\"Our decision to stop Marjorie Taylor Greene from plunging the country into further chaos is rooted in our commitment to solve problems,\" Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said after the vote.\n\nAsked what they might do if there were another attempt to oust the speaker, Jeffries said, \"Haven\u00b4t given it a thought.\"\n\nSome Republicans are frustrated by the threats to Johnson and were dismissive of Greene. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., said of those trying to remove the speaker, \"They\u00b4re pretty good at getting attention, but they have not been recognized for their ability to get things done.\"\n\nHe said if they keep pushing to oust the speaker, \"I think you can expect more of the same: Failure.\"\n\nThe speaker of the House, under the rules of the chamber, is required to keep a list of individuals who can act as speaker pro tempore in the event a chair is vacated. The list, which is oddly written by the sitting speaker at any given time, remains with the House clerk and would be made public if the speakership were vacant.\n\nThe first person on that list would be named speaker pro tempore and their first order of business would be to hold an election for a new speaker. The House then would vote as many times as it took to elect a speaker.\n\nIn the case of McCarthy, the role of speaker pro tem fell to his close confidant Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., the chair of the House Financial Services Committee. He was in the role for three weeks, until Johnson's election.\n\nAssociated Press writers Lisa Mascaro, Kevin Freking and Stephen Groves contributed to this report.\n\nRep.

Marjorie Taylor Greene tried and failed in sudden action Wednesday to oust Speaker Mike Johnson, her long-shot effort swiftly and resoundingly rejected by Democrats and Republicans tired of the political chaos.\n\nOne of Donald Trump's biggest supporters in Congress, Greene stood on the House floor and read a long list of \"transgressions\" she said Johnson had committed as speaker. Colleagues booed in protest.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber?

Hakeem Jeffries of New York, whose leadership team had said it was time to \"turn the page\" on the GOP turmoil and vote to table Greene's resolution -- almost ensuring Johnson's job is saved, for now.\n\n\"Our decision to stop Marjorie Taylor Green from plunging the country into further chaos is rooted in our commitment to solve problems,\" Jeffries said after the vote.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nTrump had also weighed in after Johnson trekked to Mar-a-Lago last month for support, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee giving the speaker his nod of approval. And Trump's hand-picked leader at the Republican National Committee urged House Republicans off the move.\n\nAhead of House voting, Trump said on social media, \"I absolutely love Marjorie Taylor Greene,\" but he said Republicans need to be fighting now to defeat Democrats in the November election. He urged Republicans to table Greene's motion.\n\n\"At some point, we may very well be, but this is not the time,\" Trump said, to oust the speaker.\n\nThe move now poses its own political risks for Greene, a high-profile provocateur.\n\nGreene was determined to force her colleagues to be on the record with their vote - putting them in the politically uncomfortable position of backing the speaker and seen as joining forces with Democrats to save him.\n\nThe tally showed the strength, but also the weakness, of her effort, as most lawmakers voted to move past the infighting and allow the Republican speaker, just six months in the office, to keep the gavel.\n\n\"The Democrats saved him,\" Greene said afterward.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nWithout Democratic support, the vote would most likely have ended differently for Johnson who holds one of the slimmest majorities in the House in modern times, with no votes to spare.\n\nLast year, the House chamber was brought to a standstill when eight Republicans voted to oust Kevin McCarthy from the speaker's office and Democrats declined to help save him, the first such removal of a House speaker in U.S. history.\n\nOusting McCarthy resulted in a nearly monthlong search for a new GOP leader, throwing the chamber into turmoil with an episode Republicans wanted to avoid before seeking voter support in the November election.\n\n__\n\nAssociated Press writers Stephen Groves, Mary Clare Jalonick and Michelle Price contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "thepeterboroughexaminer.com", "dataType": "news",

Marjorie Taylor Greene has dangled the possibility of forcing a vote to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson, and has been leading a public charge to try to make that a reality.\n\nAfter weeks of threats, meetings with the speaker and making demands, the Georgia Republican triggered her motion to vacate on May 8.\n\nHere's what has happened so far:\n\nGreen makes it official and files a motion to vacate the speaker saying he \"betrayed our conference and broke our rules\" by working with Democrats to pass a $1.2 trillion package to fund the government but does not make it \"privileged\" -- requiring a House vote.\n\nMORE: Marjorie Taylor Greene backs off threat to oust Johnson as speaker\n\nJohnson addresses Greene's accusations in an interview with Fox News. \"I think that all of my other Republican colleagues recognize this is a distraction from our mission,\" he said.\n\nThe congresswoman sends a letter to her Republican colleagues explaining why she filed a motion to oust Johnson, calling his actions \"a complete and total surrender.\"\n\nGreene meets with Johnson, telling reporters she's closely watching his next moves on the reauthorization of Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) -- which allows the U.S. government to collect electronic communications of non-Americans located outside the country without a warrant -- and Ukraine aid.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, a key ally of Greene, holds a news conference with Johnson at Mar-a-Lago. The former president says Johnson is \"doing a very good job ... He's doing about as good as you're going to do. And I'm sure that Marjorie understands that.\"\n\nMORE: In scathing letter, GOP's Marjorie Taylor Greene slams Johnson with speakership under threat\n\nFISA reauthorization passes in the House. Johnson casts a deciding vote to kill an amendment that would require warrants for certain surveillance -- a priority of Greene and other GOP hard-liners. The congresswoman expresses anger but doesn't call for a vote to vacate the speaker.\n\nA $95 billion foreign aid package passes, including assistance for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. Greene says she's giving colleagues the weeklong recess to \"think about\" whether Johnson should go. She signals she wants to call a vote to oust him when the House returns from a recess.\n\nGreene doesn't trigger a vote to oust Johnson after the House returns from its recess.\n\nHouse Democratic leaders announce they'll vote to save Johnson if a motion to vacate is brought to the floor for a vote. After this statement is released, Greene signals she will trigger a vote on a motion to vacate.\n\nGreene and her co-sponsor Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky hold a press conference outside the Capitol, where the congresswoman announces she would trigger a motion to vacate vote \"next week\" to allow GOP colleagues to weigh their support through the weekend.\n\nTrump brings Johnson on stage at a Republican National Committee spring retreat luncheon and praises the speaker. He emphasizes \"the need for party unity, collaboration and expanding the GOP's House majority.\"\n\nTrump also calls Greene and tells her to drop her push to oust Johnson, sources told ABC News.\n\nGreene does not immediately call a vote when the House resumes its session. At Greene's request, she meets with Johnson for more than two hours. After the meeting, Greene says they had a long discussion but does not divulge further details. Johnson said he had \"a lengthy, constructive meeting\" with Greene and Massie.\n\nGreene and Massie meet with Johnson for a second time in as many days. The meeting lasts about 90 minutes. Following this meeting, Greene says she's giving the speaker time to meet her list of four demands: no future funding for Ukraine; implementing the Hastert rule, which states the majority of the majority must support any bill; defunding special counsels and passing a continuing resolution to enact a 1% spending cut if not all 12 appropriation bills are passed individually.\n\nThe congresswoman did not impose a deadline for when the speaker must get back to her.\n\nGreene officially triggered a vote on her motion to remove Johnson on the House floor.\n\nDemocratic and Republican House members booed Greene as she listed off her previously mentioned grievances against Johnson in her resolution.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia to oust him from his post, after Democrats linked arms with most Republicans to fend off a second attempt by GOP hard-liners to strip the gavel from their party leader.\n\nThe vote to kill the effort was an overwhelming 359-43, with seven voting \"present.\" Democrats flocked to Johnson's rescue, with all but 39 of them voting with Republicans to block the effort to oust him.\n\nMembers of the minority party in the House have never propped up the other party's speaker, and when the last Republican to hold the post, Kevin McCarthy, faced a removal vote last fall, Democrats voted en masse to allow the motion to move forward and then to jettison him, helping lead to his historic ouster.\n\nSign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times\n\nThis time, the Democratic support made the critical difference, allowing Johnson, who has a minuscule majority, to avoid a removal vote altogether. While for weeks Greene had appeared to be on a political island in her drive to get rid of yet another GOP speaker, 11 Republicans ultimately voted to allow her motion to move forward.\n\nThat was the same number of Republicans who voted in October to allow the bid to remove McCarthy to advance -- but back then, they were joined by every Democrat.\n\n\"I appreciate the show of confidence from my colleagues to defeat this misguided effort,\" Johnson told reporters shortly after Wednesday's vote. \"As I've said from the beginning and I've made clear here every day, I intend to do my job. I intend to do what I believe to be the right thing, which is what I was elected to do, and I'll let the chips fall where they may. In my view, that is leadership.\"\n\n\"Hopefully,\" he added, \"this is the end of the personality politics and the frivolous character assassination that has defined the 118th Congress.\"\n\nThe lopsided vote solidified the dynamic that has defined Johnson's speakership, like McCarthy's before him: Each time the Republican leader has been faced with a critical task, such as averting a government shutdown or a catastrophic default on the nation's debt, he has relied on a bipartisan coalition of mainstream lawmakers to steer around far-right opposition and provide the votes to accomplish it.\n\nThe result has been the empowerment of Democrats at the expense of the hard right, the very phenomenon that Greene raged against as she rose on the House floor Wednesday -- drawing boos from some of her colleagues -- to lay out a scathing case against Johnson and what she called the \"uniparty\" he empowered.\n\n\"Our decision to stop Marjorie Taylor Greene from plunging the House of Representatives and the country into further chaos is rooted in our commitment to solve problems for everyday Americans in a bipartisan manner,\" Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the Democratic leader, told reporters shortly after the vote. \"We will continue to govern in a reasonable, responsible and results-oriented fashion, and put people over politics all day and every day.\"\n\nGreene's move to oust Johnson came roughly three weeks after the speaker pushed through a long-stalled $95 billion national security spending package to aid Israel, Ukraine and other U.S. allies over the objections of Greene and other right-wing Republicans who staunchly opposed sending additional aid to Ukraine.\n\nLawmakers loudly jeered Greene as she called up the resolution and read it aloud. As she recited the measure, a screed that lasted more than 10 minutes, Republicans lined up on the House floor to shake Johnson's hand and pat him on the back.\n\n\"Given a choice between advancing Republican priorities or allying with Democrats to preserve his own personal power, Johnson regularly chooses to ally himself with Democrats,\" Greene said, reading from her resolution.\n\nShe concluded with the official call for his removal: \"Now, therefore be it resolved that the office of the speaker of the House of Representatives is hereby declared to be vacant.\"\n\nIt marked the second time in less than a year that Republicans have sought to depose their own speaker, coming about seven months after GOP rebels succeeded, with Democratic support, in removing McCarthy.\n\nEarlier in the week, Greene had seemed to hesitate over whether she would actually call the ouster vote. For two consecutive days, she met for hours with Johnson, flanked by her chief ally, Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, and floated a list of demands in exchange for not calling the vote.\n\nAmong the demands were cutting off all future U.S. aid to Ukraine, defunding the Justice Department and imposing a 1% across the board cut on all spending bills if lawmakers are unable to negotiate a deal to fund the government in September.\n\nBut Johnson had remained cool to their entreaties, and told reporters that he was not negotiating with Greene and Massie.\n\nThat put Greene, whose combative political brand is premised on her unrelenting appetite to fight with the establishment of her party, out on a limb. She had little choice but to call up a vote she knew would fail, but had been threatening for weeks. Even after Jeffries made it clear that Democrats would vote to block any ouster attempt, she was still determined to undermine Johnson publicly and force Democrats to bail him out.\n\n\"This is exactly what the American people needed to see,\" she told reporters on the House steps after the vote. \"I didn't run for Congress to come up here and join the uniparty, and the uniparty was on full display today.\"\n\n\"The Democrats now control Speaker Johnson,\" she added.\n\nJust 32 Democrats voted to allow Greene's motion to move forward, while another seven voted \"present,\" registering no position.\n\nGreene initially filed the motion against Johnson in late March, just as lawmakers were voting on a $1.2 trillion spending bill he pushed through the House over the opposition of the majority of Republicans. She called the move a \"betrayal\" and said she wanted to send the speaker a \"warning,\" then left the threat dangling for weeks.\n\nJohnson plowed ahead anyway, putting together an aid package for Ukraine -- a move Greene previously said was a red line that would prompt her to seek his ouster, but which did not lead her to immediately make good on her threat.\n\n\"I'm actually going to let my colleagues go home and hear from their constituents,\" Greene said following the vote, predicting that Republicans would join her bid to get rid of Johnson after getting an earful from voters irate about the foreign aid bill. Instead, many of them heard just the opposite and returned to Washington voicing skepticism about removing Johnson.\n\nIf she had been successful Wednesday, Greene would have prompted only the second vote on the House floor in more than 100 years on whether to oust the speaker. When Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida instigated McCarthy's removal in October, such a spectacle had not been seen in the chamber since 1910.\n\nBut this time, Greene had a more difficult time finding support for removing the speaker. House Republicans were wary of throwing the chamber into another period of chaos like the one that paralyzed the House for weeks after McCarthy's ouster, and have privately seethed about the public disarray Greene's threat has sown.\n\nEven ultraconservatives like Gaetz expressed uneasiness with firing another speaker, suggesting that the move risked handing over control of the House to Democrats given Republicans' rapidly narrowing margin of control.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump also came to Johnson's defense, urging Republicans on social media minutes after the vote to kill Greene's effort, arguing that polling showed Republicans doing well in the November elections, and that a show of division would undermine the party.\n\n\"If we show DISUNITY, which will be portrayed as CHAOS, it will negatively affect everything!\" he wrote.\n\nHe called Johnson \"a good man who is trying very hard,\" but did not slam the door altogether on the idea of removing him.\n\n\"We're not in a position\" to do so now, with such a small Republican majority in the House, Trump wrote. \"At some point, we may very well be, but this is not the time.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com",

Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., to call a vote to remove House Speaker Mike Johnson. The vote was 359-43 with seven members voting present. Democrats provided many of the votes.\n\nThe vote was the culmination of weeks of threats from Greene. While the measure failed, Greene and other Republicans remain angry with Johnson's reliance on votes from Democrats to pass major legislation.\n\n\"Mike Johnson worked with [Senate Majority Leader] Chuck Schumer rather than the conference and gave Joe Biden and the Democrats everything they wanted -- no different from how a Speaker Hakeem Jeffries would have done,\" Greene said, reading a litany of criticisms against Johnson.\n\n\"This is the uni-party for the American people watching,\" Greene said as the House chamber erupted into boos as she brought forward the motion to vacate.\n\nJohnson has operated for nearly two months with the constant threat that any action could trigger a vote to remove him from his job.\n\nGreene has been weighing whether to trigger a vote to oust Johnson since shefiled the motion in March, after objecting to his negotiating with Democrats on a$1.2 trillion spending packagethat ultimately passed the House with more Democratic support than Republican support.\n\nLast week, Greene threatened to move forward with the motion to vacate after the House voted on an aid bill for Ukraine.\n\nShe boasts two Republican co-sponsors to the resolution -- Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar and Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie.\n\nGreene met twice this week with Johnson, including an over two-hour meeting on Monday.\n\n\"Everybody was listening -- it wasn't a shouting match,\" Massie said of the Monday meeting. \"[Greene] and I decided to give Speaker Johnson one last chance to say he's going to be with the Republicans and not with the Democrats, and there are some litmus tests on that,\" he said.\n\nGreene and Massie said those litmus tests include no additional funding for Ukraine, no funding toward the special counsel investigation into former President Donald Trump, and Johnson only bringing legislation to the floor that has the support of the majority of the GOP conference.\n\nIn an appearance on Steve Bannon's \"War Room\" podcast Tuesday, Greene said she also wants twelve separate appropriations bills and not another omnibus led by Schumer \"rammed down our throat.\"\n\n\"That will not be tolerated again,\" she said, adding that if House Republicans don't get the twelve distinct bills, she wants to see a one percent cut to spending.\n\nAlthough members of the hardline House Freedom Caucus have expressed dissatisfaction with Johnson's actions in his short tenure as speaker, most say they still don't want to put the conference through another speaker fight.\n\nGreene has also been under pressure from former President Trump. Greene and Trump spoke over the weekend and Trump urged her to back down, according to a source familiar with the conversation.", "source": {"uri": "kgou.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "KGOU 106.3"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Massie", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Massie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Gosar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul Gosar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mueller_special_counsel_investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mueller special counsel investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bannon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Bannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Caucus", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedom Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/abdf252/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3996x2098+0+949/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.npr.org%2Fassets%2Fimg%2F2024%2F05%2F06%2Fgettyimages-2151781796_sq-09d298eb5f0bc2028d088444f438de12a4d59ee6.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551299", "eventUri": "eng-9551299", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort to oust Speaker Mike Johnson from his leadership post.\n\nThe resounding vote in Johnson's favor - which came with the help of Democrats - brings to an end the most serious challenge to the speakership the Louisiana Republican has faced, at least for now.\n\nAs he navigates a razor-thin majority, the failed ouster effort gives Johnson the opportunity to argue it is time to move on to other issues, though support from Democrats may open him up to more criticism from his right flank.\n\nJohnson spoke briefly with reporters following the vote, calling Greene's campaign against him \"misguided\" and thanking colleagues for a \"show of confidence\" in his leadership.\n\n\"I want to say that I appreciate the show of confidence for my colleagues to defeat this misguided effort,\" he said. \"I've made clear here every day, I intend to do my job, I intend to do what I believe to be the right thing, which I was elected to do. And I'll let the chips fall where they may.\"\n\nGreene had dangled the threat of triggering a vote against the speaker for weeks, a push that reopened bitter divisions within the House GOP conference as many members opposed ousting Johnson.\n\nJohnson was elected speaker last year after conservative hardliners voted to oust former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a historic and unprecedented vote that sparked a tumultuous period of infighting as Republicans struggled to unify around a new leader before eventually coalescing around the Louisiana Republican.\n\nThe House on Wednesday voted to table - or kill - Greene's push to remove Johnson by a tally of 359 to 43. Eleven Republicans voted against tabling.\n\nIn the wake of Johnson's push to pass a major foreign aid package over the objections of hardline conservatives, House Democratic leadership had announced that Democrats would help Johnson keep his job by voting to table.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, Greene did not rule out forcing another vote against Johnson in the future and suggested that a statement from former President Donald Trump on Truth Social supports the potential for a motion to vacate at some point - despite the fact that he urged members to vote to kill her resolution.\n\nPressed by CNN's Manu Raju on whether she would trigger a vote again this Congress, Greene did not answer directly but said she is \"thankful\" for Trump's support and pointed to the fact that he said on Truth Social that \"at some point\" Republicans may be in a position of voting on a motion to vacate.\n\n\"He also said in that statement that we may have to vacate and that's something that I think people need to pay attention to,\" Greene said.\n\nAsked whether she believes Trump was wrong to urge members to vote to table, the congresswoman said, \"I stand with President Trump. I support President Trump. I've talked to him every day about this.\"\n\nHouse Republicans caught off guard\n\nGreene and Johnson - as well as Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky - met over several days earlier this week, where Greene outlined her concerns with Johnson's leadership and her priorities. The House was on the verge of recessing for the week when Greene pulled up her motion to vacate the chair, which started a two-legislative-day clock for GOP leaders to hold a vote on her measure.\n\nHouse Republicans were completely caught off guard by Greene's decision to trigger her motion, multiple Republican sources told CNN. GOP leadership did not see this coming and thought after the two productive meetings between Johnson and Greene that there was at least more time before any next steps were taken, the sources added.\n\n\"I was shocked,\" GOP Rep. Austin Scott of Georgia told CNN.\n\nCNN's Haley Talbot contributed to this report.\n\nThis headline and story have been updated with additional developments.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Marjorie Taylor Greene Triggers Effort to Remove House Speaker Mike Johnson From Office", "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hardline Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene called Wednesday for a vote to oust Speaker Mike Johnson, pressing ahead with her long-shot effort despite pushback from Republicans at the highest levels tired of the political chaos.\n\nGreene, who is one of Donald Trump's biggest supporters in Congress, stood on the House floor and read a long list of \"transgressions\" she said Johnson had committed as speaker. Colleagues booed in protest.\n\nThe vote, which under House rules is required within two days, could happen imminently.\n\nThe Georgia Republican had vowed she would force a vote on the motion to vacate the Republican speaker if he dared to advance a foreign aid package with funds for Ukraine, which was overwhelmingly approved late last month and signed into law.\n\nBut in recent days it seemed her effort had cooled, as she and Johnson met repeatedly for a potential resolution.\n\nJohnson of Louisiana marched on, saying he had been willing to take the risk, believing it was important for the U.S. to back Ukraine against Russia's invasion and explaining he wanted to be on the \"right side of history.\"\n\n\"I just have to do my job every day,\" Johnson said Monday.\n\nIn a highly unusual move, the speaker received a boost from Democrats led by Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, whose leadership team has said it was time to \"turn the page\" on the GOP turmoil and vote to table Greene's resolution -- almost ensuring Johnson's job is saved, for now.\n\nTrump also weighed in after Johnson trekked to Mar-a-Lago for a visit, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee giving the speaker his nod of approval. And Trump's hand-picked leader at the Republican National Committee urged House Republicans off the move.\n\nThe move now poses its own political risks for Greene, R-Ga., a high-profile provocateur.\n\nForcing the vote could bring the House chamber to a standstill, as happened last year when eight Republicans voted to ousted Kevin McCarthy from the speaker's office, and Democrats declined to help save him.\n\nOr it could be over in a matter of minutes, as Democrats join Republicans to table the effort.\n\nOusting McCarthy resulted in a nearly monthlong search for a new GOP leader, and there is no immediate successor if Johnson is removed.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., forced the House to vote on a \"motion to vacate,\" a procedural tool that if passed, would have forcibly removed Johnson, from the speakership.\n\nBut the vast majority of House Republicans and Democrats joined together on Wednesday to dismiss Greene's motion through what's known as a motion to table by a vote of 359-43, drowning out the conservative renegades who have often thrown the lower chamber into chaos in pursuit of their goals.\n\nGreene initiated her push to oust Johnson in March, but withheld calling up a vote for over a month, sowing doubt among lawmakers over how serious the Georgia Republican's threats were.\n\nDemocrats joined the majority of Republicans to defeat Greene's effort after Johnson passed a long-awaited foreign aid package that sent $95 billion to key U.S. allies, including Ukraine. Democrats commended the speaker for not bowing to his hard-right flank, which has grown increasingly hostile toward any continued U.S. assistance to the war-torn nation.\n\n\"We will vote to table Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's Motion to Vacate the Chair. If she invokes the motion, it will not succeed,\" House Democratic leader said in a statement last week.\n\nSome Democrats still moved to advance Greene's motion, having reservations about saving the speaker over his key role in efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Democratic lawmakers also took aim at Johnson's conservative credentials such as his anti-abortion views.\n\nHouse Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., the No. 3 ranking House Democrat, framed the vote last week as an effort against Greene, rather than one saving Johnson, saying \"We want to turn the page and we want to move on.\"\n\nThe vote was a stark contrast from last year when a set of different conservative rebels moved to oust Johnson's predecessor, former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. That time, Democrats unanimously voted to remove McCarthy, who drew much more scorn from them compared to Johnson.\n\nBut even though the hard right has had wide-ranging grievances against the speaker, there was little appetite among other conservatives to oust Johnson in an election year, with some members preferring to litigate a speaker fight in the next Congress.\n\nDemocrats control the Senate and the White House, which means bills have required bipartisan support in recent years if lawmakers want to get anything done. However, Greene and her fellow conservatives have railed against Johnson for working with Democrats to pass critical legislation, including funding the government and reauthorizing a foreign surveillance program.\n\nUltraconservatives have repeatedly criticized Johnson as the speaker of the \"uniparty,\" a pejorative term used to criticize bipartisanship. The vote on Wednesday, where Democrats swooped in to rescue Johnson only further hardened their anger.\n\n\"They failed us. They funded the uniparty agenda. They funded the status quo that Washington D.C. just wants to keep going and going,\" Greene said at a press conference last week announcing her intentions to move forward to remove Johnson.\n\nWhile Johnson is likely to stay on as speaker after beating back Greene's effort, nothing is stopping Greene from trying to oust Johnson again. Current House rules allow just one member to file a motion to vacate.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: House kills push from Marjorie Taylor Greene to oust Mike Johnson", "source":

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) from his top leadership position, bringing an end to a weekslong saga of the Georgia Republican seeking to leverage her motion to vacate to make conservative demands in the lower chamber.\n\nLawmakers voted 359-43 to table the motion, effectively killing the measure before it could be brought to the floor for a final vote. The motion succeeded after 163 Democrats joined nearly all Republicans in tabling the bill.\n\nOnly 11 Republicans voted against tabling the bill. Seven Democrats voted present.\n\nGreene noticed her motion to vacate on Wednesday evening, over one month after she initially filed it on the House floor. The Georgia Republican outlined several charges against Johnson, accusing the speaker of violating his promises and working too closely with House Democrats on key legislation.\n\n\"We need a new speaker,\" Greene told reporters Friday. \"This is not personal against Mike Johnson. He's a very good man, and I have respect for him as a person, but he is not doing the job. The proof is in the vote count today. He passed a budget that should have never been brought to the floor, did not represent our conference, and it was passed with the Democrats.\"\n\nHouse leaders brought the motion to the floor just moments after it was called.\n\nSeveral of Greene's Republican colleagues decried the move, accusing her of triggering the motion simply to get attention.\n\n\"I've got bad news for Marjorie,\" said Rep. Dusty Johnson (R-SD). \"People are going to pay attention to this story for about an hour and they're going to go back to real life. This is not going to make her any more famous than she already is.\"\n\nWhen asked if Greene herself should be kicked out of the Republican conference, Dusty Johnson said, \"One dumpster fire at a time.\"\n\n\"Moscow Marjorie has clearly gone off the deep end -- maybe the result of a space laser,\" said Rep. Mike Lawler (R-NY).\n\nGreene initially filed her motion to vacate in late March, holding the measure over Johnson's head as he looks to navigate his conference through votes on key legislation. Greene followed through with that threat last week, telling reporters last week she would \"absolutely\" be putting the measure on the floor sometime this week for a vote.\n\nGreene announced her motion on the floor during votes on Wednesday afternoon, which was met with boos from members of both parties. Greene yelled back, \"This is the uniparty for the American people watching.\"\n\nHowever, the move comes as House Democratic leadership came out against the motion to vacate on Tuesday, vowing to table the legislation should it come to the floor. That decision gives Johnson considerable cover as several House Republicans have also expressed opposition to removing the speaker, possibly making the motion dead on arrival.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nGreene has refused to back down from her threats, saying she would give Democrats \"the chance\" to elect him as their speaker.\n\n\"I'm a big believer in recorded votes because putting Congress on record allows every American to see the truth and provides transparency to our votes,\" Greene said. \"Americans deserve to see the Uniparty on full display. I'm about to give them their coming out party!\"\n\nGreene also accused Johnson of orchestrating a \"slimy backroom deal\" to save his speakership, something the speaker said he did not do. He said during the GOP leadership press conference on Tuesday that he did not hear about Democratic leaders' statement to table a possible motion to vacate until reporters asked him.\n\n\"I've never requested assistance from anyone. I'm not focused on that at all,\" Johnson said earlier this month.\n\nA motion to vacate requires only a simple majority to pass, meaning if all Democrats voted to oust Johnson, it would only take two Republicans to join in order to pass. However, a handful of Democrats have expressed support to defend Johnson.\n\nInstead, Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) had publicly called on Johnson to resign voluntarily, giving Republicans an opportunity to choose a new speaker without repeating the three-week period in October when the House went without a speaker and all floor action was stalled.\n\nMassie said he had pushed Johnson to resign rather than risk an ouster, but the speaker has repeatedly declined. The Kentucky Republican predicted the motion to vacate \"will get called\" and Johnson would \"lose more votes than Kevin McCarthy.\" McCarthy was ousted after eight Republicans joined all Democrats to support the motion.\n\nHowever, Johnson had remained defiant, telling reporters earlier this month, \"I am not resigning. And it is, in my view, an absurd notion.\"\n\nMeanwhile, some other House Republicans are quietly pursuing their own path to raising the threshold for the motion to vacate. Rep. Dusty Johnson (R-SD) announced the effort two weeks ago, and at least a dozen lawmakers have expressed support for the idea, a source familiar confirmed to the Washington Examiner.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\n\"Again, we've got a small group of people who are upset that they're not getting their way,\" Dusty Johnson said in a video. \"It's the era of divided government. Nobody gets everything they want. They want to throw out the current speaker of the House. It's a terrible idea. I'm working with a group of members to change the rules so they can't get that done so that one knucklehead can't put the whole House into disarray by forcing another speaker vote.\"\n\nSeveral Republicans have decried the motion to remove the second speaker over the course of one year, noting that although there haven't been conversations about a rescue plan, they would hope Democrats would not aid in removing Johnson.\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Matt Gaetz (R-FL) did last year to queue up a vote that led to Kevin McCarthy's ouster as speaker.\n\nUnlike what happened with McCarthy, who was forced out of the role in a bipartisan vote, Johnson had the backing of Democrats who said they would vote to table a motion to vacate the chair brought by Greene.\n\nJohnson also got a boost from former President Donald Trump, now the likely GOP nominee in the 2024 election, who stood with Johnson at Mar-a-Lago in April and said the speaker was \"doing a very good job.\"\n\nWhen the vote finally did take place, 196 Republicans and 163 Democrats voted to table the motion from Greene.

(Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)\n\nWASHINGTON -- Efforts by a small group of far-right U.S. House Republicans to remove Speaker Mike Johnson from his leadership role failed Wednesday night, ending weeks of infighting about whether the Louisianan should remain the head of that chamber.\n\nRepublican lawmakers joined by Democrats voted 359-43 to table, or set aside, the so-called motion to vacate that Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene originally filed in March, before spending weeks calling for Johnson to resign.\n\nGreene was backed by Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie and Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar ahead of the vote, though a few more GOP lawmakers signaled their frustrations with Johnson's leadership by voting to move ahead with a vote, instead of voting to table it.\n\nGreene, reading from her lengthy motion to vacate before the vote, rejected Johnson bringing broadly bipartisan bills to the House floor during his six months as speaker.\n\nThe government funding bills, Greene said, showed that \"Johnson supported fully funding abortion, the trans agenda, the climate agenda, foreign wars and Biden's border crisis, rather than ensuring liberty, opportunity and security for all Americans.\"\n\n\"Mike Johnson is ill-equipped to handle the rigors or the job of speaker of the House and has allowed a uniparty -- one that fuels foreign wars, tramples on civil liberties and increases our disastrous national debt -- to take complete control of the House of Representatives,\" Greene said.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, moved to table Greene's motion.\n\nJohnson, speaking to reporters in Statuary Hall, said he appreciated \"the show of confidence from my colleagues to defeat this misguided effort.\"\n\n\"Hopefully, this is the end of the personality politics and the frivolous character assassination that has defined the 118th Congress,\" Johnson said. \"It's regrettable. It's not who we are as Americans. And we're better than this. We need to get beyond it.\"\n\nJohnson said he planned to work throughout the year to grow the Republican majority in the House and elect Donald Trump as president during November's elections.\n\n\"I'm proud to serve in this position. It's not one that I aspired to. It's not one that I ever expected to have or planned for, but it is the honor of my life and career to do this,\" Johnson said. \"And I will do it, so long as this body will have me do that.\"\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Democratic Whip Katherine Clark and Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar announced last week they would vote to keep Johnson in the speaker's office.\n\n\"We will vote to table Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's Motion to Vacate the Chair,\" they wrote at the time. \"If she invokes the motion, it will not succeed.\"\n\nGreene and Massie met with Johnson for two hours on Monday and about 90 minutes on Tuesday, laying out their requirements for not offering the motion to vacate. Greene said the ball was in Johnson's court on whether to comply with the changes or not.\n\nThe vote was considerably different from the vote to remove former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, that took place in October after Florida GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz filed another motion to vacate.\n\nEight Republicans and the chamber's Democrats all voted to remove McCarthy from his leadership post.\n\nThe House Republican Conference then spent weeks debating behind closed doors who should become their nominee for speaker -- first selecting Scalise, who withdrew after just one day without holding a floor vote; then choosing Ohio's Jim Jordan, who took his bid to the floor for a series of failed votes; and then Minnesota Rep. Tom Emmer, who withdrew after just hours as the nominee.\n\nHouse Republicans then voted to nominate Johnson, who received unanimous support from fellow GOP lawmakers during the floor vote.\n\nJohnson held that leadership role for less than six months before Greene began calling for him to step down from the speaker's office or face a motion to vacate him from the office on the House floor.\n\nGreene and others have become increasingly angry that Johnson has brought bipartisan bills to the floor for votes, including government funding legislation, the reauthorization of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and a $95 billion aid package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.\n\nJohnson's detractors argue that he should have done more to push for conservative policy wins, even though any legislation that passes the House must move through the Democratic-controlled Senate and avoid President Joe Biden's veto pen in order to become law.\n\nGreene has also argued that Johnson allowing broadly bipartisan legislation to pass on the House floor could risk Republican candidates' chances of winning seats during the November elections.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com",

Marjorie Taylor Greene calls for vote to remove House Speaker Mike Johnson from office", "body": "WASHINGTON -- Hardline Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene called Wednesday for a vote to oust Speaker Mike Johnson, pressing ahead with her long-shot effort despite pushback from Republicans at the highest levels tired of the political chaos.\n\nSpeaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., speaks during a news conference at the Capitol in Washington on Tuesday. On Wednesday, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., a staunch ally of former President Donald Trump, moved to oust Johnson from his leadership post. J. Scott Applewhite/Associated Press\n\nGreene, who is one of Donald Trump's biggest supporters in Congress, stood on the House floor and read a long list of \"transgressions\" she said Johnson had committed as speaker. Colleagues booed in protest.\n\nThe vote, which under House rules is required within two days, could happen imminently.\n\nThe Georgia Republican had vowed she would force a vote on the motion to vacate the Republican speaker if he dared to advance a foreign aid package with funds for Ukraine, which was overwhelmingly approved late last month and signed into law.\n\nBut in recent days it seemed her effort had cooled, as she and Johnson met repeatedly for a potential resolution.\n\nJohnson of Louisiana marched on, saying he had been willing to take the risk, believing it was important for the U.S. to back Ukraine against Russia's invasion and explaining he wanted to be on the \"right side of history.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I just have to do my job every day,\" Johnson said Monday.\n\nIn a highly unusual move, the speaker received a boost from Democrats led by Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, whose leadership team has said it was time to \"turn the page\" on the Republican turmoil and vote to table Greene's resolution -- almost ensuring Johnson's job is saved, for now.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., leaves a meeting with House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., whom she has vowed to remove from his leadership post, at the Capitol in Washington on Tuesday. J. Scott Applewhite/Associated Press\n\nTrump also weighed in after Johnson trekked to Mar-a-Lago for a visit, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee giving the speaker his nod of approval. And Trump's hand-picked leader at the Republican National Committee urged House Republicans off the move.\n\nThe move now poses its own political risks for Greene, R-Ga., a high-profile provocateur.\n\nForcing the vote could bring the House chamber to a standstill, as happened last year when eight Republicans voted to ousted Kevin McCarthy from the speaker's office, and Democrats declined to help save him.\n\nOr it could be over in a matter of minutes, as Democrats join Republicans to table the effort.\n\nOusting McCarthy resulted in a nearly monthlong search for a new Republican leader, and there is no immediate successor if Johnson is removed.\n\nCopy the Story Link Related Headlines Rep.

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) to remove Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) from his top perch.\n\nWithin an hour of Greene declaring that she was going through with her motion to vacate the chair -- an announcement met by a wave of boos in the chamber -- members overwhelmingly voted to table the measure by a 359-43 tally.\n\nThe measure was introduced in a privileged fashion, meaning leadership had two legislative days to act on it, similar to what Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) did last year to queue up a vote that led to Kevin McCarthy's ouster as speaker.\n\nUnlike what happened with McCarthy, who lacked support from across the aisle when he was forced out of the role, Johnson had the backing of Democrats who said they would vote to table a motion to vacate the chair brought by Greene.\n\nHe also got a boost from former President Donald Trump, now the likely GOP nominee in the 2024 election, who stood with Johnson at Mar-a-Lago in April and said the speaker was \"doing a very good job.\"\n\nWhen the vote finally did take place, 196 Republicans and 163 Democrats voted to table the motion from Greene.

Thomas Massie (R-KY) and Paul Gosar (R-AZ), supported Greene last month as she refused to relent on her campaign against Johnson.\n\nJohnson and Greene met over the past couple days during which Greene made a series of what she said were \"suggestions,\" including defunding special counsel Jack Smith's inquiries into Trump and no more financial aid for Ukraine.\n\nRecent polling from Monmouth University showed just one in five Americans wanted Johnson to be replaced as speaker.\n\nTrump posted to Truth Social on Wednesday, around the time of the vote on tabling Greene's motion, complimenting Johnson, as well as Greene.

Marjorie Taylor Greene proceeded with her threat to try to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson Wednesday, calling for a vote on a motion to vacate the speaker from the House floor that lawmakers quickly voted to table -- that is, to kill it -- in a stunning scene that marked a major reversal from a day earlier -- and put the threat that had loomed over the speaker to rest.\n\n\"The form of the resolution is as follows: declaring the office of the speaker of the House of Representatives to be vacant,\" the Georgia Republican said, as many in the House chamber booed her. \"This is the uniparty for the American people watching.\"\n\nShortly after Greene moved forward with the motion, triggering a snap vote, the House voted 359 to 43 to table the motion. The bulk of Democrats joined with House Republicans to do so.\n\nThe move marked a reversal from a day earlier, when Greene appeared to retreat from her threat to trigger a vote to remove Johnson.\n\n\"Right now the ball is in Mike Johnson's court,\" Greene had said after meeting with the speaker on Tuesday.\n\nBut Greene moved forward Wednesday evening and in doing so, she teed up a snap vote that must take place within two legislative days on whether Johnson should remain speaker.\n\nGreene had the public backing of only two other House Republicans, Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Paul Gosar of Arizona. Meanwhile, Democrats had pledged to save Johnson after he shepherded a foreign aid bill through the chamber last month.\n\nMinority Leader Hakeem Jeffries explained on \"60 Minutes\" why Democrats would be willing to save Johnson's speakership. \"Our view would traditionally be, 'Let the other side work its own mess out,'\" Jeffries said. \"But when that mess starts to impact the ability to do the job on behalf of the American people, then the responsible thing at that moment might be for us to make clear that we will not allow the extremists to throw the Congress and the country into chaos.\"\n\nHe also suggested that given the sliver of a majority Johnson has as speaker, House Democrats are enormously powerful. \"Even though we're in the minority, we effectively have been governing as if we were in the majority because we continue to provide a majority of the votes necessary to get things done,\" he said. \"Those are just the facts.\"\n\nGreene has been dangling the threat over Johnson since March, when she first introduced the motion to vacate. Johnson met with Greene on two occasions in as many days this week, where she said she made a list of demands in order to stand down.

Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort to oust Speaker Mike Johnson from his leadership post.\n\nThe resounding vote in Johnson's favor - which came with the help of Democrats - brings to an end the most serious challenge to the speakership the Louisiana Republican has faced, at least for now.\n\nAs he navigates a razor-thin majority, the failed ouster effort gives Johnson the opportunity to argue it is time to move on to other issues, though support from Democrats may open him up to more criticism from his right flank.\n\nJohnson spoke briefly with reporters following the vote, calling Greene's campaign against him \"misguided\" and thanking colleagues for a \"show of confidence\" in his leadership.\n\n\"I want to say that I appreciate the show of confidence for my colleagues to defeat this misguided effort,\" he said. \"I've made clear here every day, I intend to do my job, I intend to do what I believe to be the right thing, which I was elected to do. And I'll let the chips fall where they may.\"\n\nGreene had dangled the threat of triggering a vote against the speaker for weeks, a push that reopened bitter divisions within the House GOP conference as many members opposed ousting Johnson.\n\nJohnson was elected speaker last year after conservative hardliners voted to oust former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a historic and unprecedented vote that sparked a tumultuous period of infighting as Republicans struggled to unify around a new leader before eventually coalescing around the Louisiana Republican.\n\nThe House on Wednesday voted to table - or kill - Greene's push to remove Johnson by a tally of 359 to 43. Eleven Republicans voted against tabling.\n\nIn the wake of Johnson's push to pass a major foreign aid package over the objections of hardline conservatives, House Democratic leadership had announced that Democrats would help Johnson keep his job by voting to table.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, Greene did not rule out forcing another vote against Johnson in the future and suggested that a statement from former President Donald Trump on Truth Social supports the potential for a motion to vacate at some point - despite the fact that he urged members to vote to kill her resolution.\n\nPressed by CNN's Manu Raju on whether she would trigger a vote again this Congress, Greene did not answer directly but said she is \"thankful\" for Trump's support and pointed to the fact that he said on Truth Social that \"at some point\" Republicans may be in a position of voting on a motion to vacate.\n\n\"He also said in that statement that we may have to vacate and that's something that I think people need to pay attention to,\" Greene said.\n\nAsked whether she believes Trump was wrong to urge members to vote to table, the congresswoman said, \"I stand with President Trump. I support President Trump. I've talked to him every day about this.\"\n\nGreene and Johnson - as well as Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky - met over several days earlier this week, where Greene outlined her concerns with Johnson's leadership and her priorities. The House was on the verge of recessing for the week when Greene pulled up her motion to vacate the chair, which started a two-legislative-day clock for GOP leaders to hold a vote on her measure.\n\nHouse Republicans were completely caught off guard by Greene's decision to trigger her motion, multiple Republican sources told CNN. GOP leadership did not see this coming and thought after the two productive meetings between Johnson and Greene that there was at least more time before any next steps were taken, the sources added.\n\n\"I was shocked,\" GOP Rep. Austin Scott of Georgia told CNN.\n\nCNN's Haley Talbot contributed to this report.\n\nThis headline and story have been updated with additional developments.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

With a 217-213 majority, Republicans can only lose one vote in a party-line roll call. Greene was joined in her call to oust Johnson by Rep.

Another 196 Republicans backed keeping Johnson as speaker.\n\nAll six members of Louisiana's House delegation voted to kill the effort to remove Johnson.\n\n\"Just another Wednesday on Capitol Hill,\" Johnson quipped to reporters after the vote.\n\n\"Hopefully, this is the end of the personality politics and the frivolous character assassination that has defined the 118th Congress. It's regrettable and it's not who we are as Americans. We're better than this. We need to get beyond it,\" he added.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Georgia, was the architect of the failed ouster. She officially triggered a \"motion to vacate\" that she had filed a month ago after Johnson relied on Democratic votes to pass $1.2 trillion government funding measures that right-wingers hated, but that kept the federal government from shutting down.\n\nGreene and Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Kentucky, last week promised to bring their motion up sometime before the House left on Friday. But Greene's decision to do it Wednesday evening came as something of a surprise.\n\nShe and Massie had a couple of meetings with Johnson behind closed doors over the past couple of days. Greene had indicated as late as Tuesday night that some sort of d\u00e9tente was possible and that they might not bring up the resolution asking for a House vote on Johnson's future.\n\nAs Greene read her motion to vacate, the chamber erupted in boos. \"This is the uniparty for the American people watching,\" Greene responded, referring to her term for the shared stances of traditional Democratic and Republican parties.\n\nShe was repeatedly interrupted.\n\nGreene and her supporters faulted Johnson for using Democrats to pass the appropriations bills, to approve funding for Ukraine's two-year effort to fend off the Russian invasion, and for appropriating money to build a new headquarters building for the FBI, as well as a long list of other deeds.\n\n\"Speaker Johnson has not lived up to one of his self-imposed tenets,\" Greene said.\n\nRepublicans hold a narrow 217-214 majority in the House. The five political caucuses within the majority don't often agree on much. The loss of two GOP votes means that legislation can't pass with only Republican votes.\n\nJohnson has said repeatedly and reiterated Wednesday night that he has no choice but negotiate with Democrats, thereby giving conservatives some input on policies.\n\nGreene called that statement an excuse that is \"pathetic weak and unacceptable.\" Johnson minimizes conservative goals in order to find Democratic votes, she added.\n\nAlmost every day of his six months as the highest ranking elected Republican, Johnson has had trouble corralling the GOP majority. His unpopularity in the House turned around recently after taking daring strategies to get \"must pass\" bills through the process.\n\n\"The Speaker of the House serves the whole House, that's the job,\" Johnson said. \"But I am a lifelong, movement conservative Republican and I intend to continue to govern in accordance with those core principles.\"\n\nJohnson stood to the side of the chamber with members of his staff during the official reading of Greene's removal resolution. After the vote he shook hands with representatives.\n\nJohnson was elected speaker Oct. 25 following three weeks of GOP turmoil after Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., was ousted by far-right Republicans and Democrats over similar complaints. He was elevated from a minor leadership position after three of the party's leaders, including Scalise, tried and failed to win enough Republican votes.", "source": {"uri": "nola.com", "dataType":

Here's why his job is far from safe.", "body": "Democrats joined a majority of Republicans on Wednesday to save Speaker Mike Johnson from an attempt by GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene to remove him from the job\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Mike Johnson's job isn't safe yet.\n\nIn a stunning show of unity in the often divided House, Democrats joined a majority of Republicans on Wednesday to save the GOP speaker from an attempt by fellow Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene to remove him from his post.\n\nBut while Democrats in the minority threw the Louisiana congressman a life raft by voting on his side, they made clear they might not do so again. That means the threat for Johnson still lingers as Greene and other lawmakers can at any time call up another motion to oust him.\n\nThe episode highlights the increasingly precarious situation for Johnson, who faces the same conservative forces that took down his predecessor, Kevin McCarthy, but with an even smaller majority that has forced him to continuously rely on Democratic support to carry out the most basic functions of legislating. Republicans control the House by the barest of margins, 217-213.\n\nHere's what to know about how the House can remove a speaker and what's ahead for Johnson:\n\nWHAT IS A MOTION TO VACATE?\n\nThe current rules of the House allow any lawmaker -- Democrat or Republican -- to put forward a resolution declaring the speaker's chair vacant. If the House approves the resolution, it has the effect of ousting the speaker from office.\n\nThe \"motion to vacate\" has existed for most of congressional history. But it had never been deployed successfully until last October when a rebel band of Republicans joined with Democrats to oust McCarthy as speaker.\n\nMcCarthy's removal came, in part, as the result of the concessions he was forced to make to win the speaker's gavel in the first place. Among the concessions was agreeing that a motion to vacate could be triggered by a single member -- the threshold that historically has been the norm, but that had been abandoned by Democrats in the majority.\n\nProponents of allowing a single lawmaker to file the motion said it promotes accountability, noting its long history in the House.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\nAt any point, a member of the House can introduce a privileged resolution -- a designation that gives it priority over other measures -- to declare the office of the speaker of the House of Representatives vacant.\n\nOnce the motion is introduced, the lawmaker sponsoring it can request a vote on the House floor. Such a request forces House leaders to take action within two legislative days.\n\nBut there are procedural motions that members of either party can make to slow or stop the process -- and that's exactly what happened when Greene called for a vote Wednesday on removing Johnson.\n\nThe No. 2 House Republican, Steve Scalise, immediately made a motion to \"table\" Greene's resolution, which defeats it if successful. The vote to table was fast and overwhelming, with lawmakers voting 359-43 to defeat her effort and keep Johnson in the job.\n\nWHO IS TRYING TO OUST JOHNSON AND WHY?\n\nThe speaker had fought for months to navigate an increasingly fractured Republican conference, which has -- in effect -- been operating in the majority in name only since January 2023.\n\nRepublicans unanimously chose Johnson late last year to replace McCarthy after several candidates for the job failed to gain enough support. His conservative bent was seen as a welcome departure by the most extreme members of his party who had accused McCarthy for years of being too moderate.\n\nBut Greene, who became a McCarthy ally late in his tenure, has been skeptical of Johnson's speakership from the beginning. While she criticized her fellow far-right colleagues for toppling McCarthy, she had warned Johnson for months that she would try to remove him in a similar fashion if he were to push ahead with a package to support Ukraine as it battles Russia's invasion.\n\n\"He should not bring funding for Ukraine,\" Greene had told reporters.\n\nBut Johnson did just that last month when he advanced a foreign aid package for Ukraine to the floor where it was overwhelmingly approved and signed into law.\n\nOther Republicans are also critical of Johnson, including Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who was a co-sponsor of Greene's resolution to oust him.\n\nCOULD THERE BE ENOUGH VOTES TO OUST JOHNSON?\n\nIt remains to be seen, but the vote Wednesday showed Johnson's job is far from safe.\n\nWithout Democratic help, Johnson could have easily been ousted. Eleven Republicans voted to proceed with Greene's effort, more than the number of GOP votes it took to oust McCarthy last fall. Seven Democrats voted present and all but 32 of the others voted with Republicans to block the effort to oust him.\n\n\"Our decision to stop Marjorie Taylor Greene from plunging the country into further chaos is rooted in our commitment to solve problems,\" Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said after the vote.\n\nAsked what they might do if there were another attempt to oust the speaker, Jeffries said, \"Haven't given it a thought.\"\n\nSome Republicans are frustrated by the threats to Johnson and were dismissive of Greene. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., said of those trying to remove the speaker, \"They're pretty good at getting attention, but they have not been recognized for their ability to get things done.\"\n\nHe said if they keep pushing to oust the speaker, \"I think you can expect more of the same: Failure.\"\n\nIF JOHNSON IS OUSTED, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN NEXT?\n\nThe speaker of the House, under the rules of the chamber, is required to keep a list of individuals who can act as speaker pro tempore in the event a chair is vacated. The list, which is oddly written by the sitting speaker at any given time, remains with the House clerk and would be made public if the speakership were vacant.\n\nThe first person on that list would be named speaker pro tempore and their first order of business would be to hold an election for a new speaker. The House then would vote as many times as it took to elect a speaker.\n\nIn the case of McCarthy, the role of speaker pro tem fell to his close confidant Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., the chair of the House Financial Services Committee. He was in the role for three weeks, until Johnson's election.\n\nAssociated Press writers Lisa Mascaro, Kevin Freking and Stephen Groves contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "wsiltv.com",

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) to oust the GOP leader from the top job for his willingness to cut deals with Democrats on weighty legislation.\n\nThe chamber voted 359-43-7 on a motion to table, or dismiss, Greene's motion-to-vacate resolution, preventing the removal proposal from being considered.\n\nIn an extraordinary move in the deeply divided House, 163 Democrats -- more than three-quarters of their Caucus -- voted to keep Johnson in power. And in a demonstration of the GOP's support for Johnson, only 11 conservative Republicans voted to send Greene's motion to the floor. The chamber erupted in boos on both sides of the aisle when Greene began reading her resolution.\n\nThe outcome was not a surprise.\n\nDemocratic leaders had announced last week that they would protect Johnson from Greene's removal gambit. But it dealt a major blow to the Georgia firebrand, who has alienated a vast majority of the GOP conference -- including many like-minded Johnson critics -- and, perhaps more significantly, bucked the position of former President Trump, who has gone out of his way to demonstrate his support for Johnson amid Greene's removal threat.\n\nHighlighting that division, Trump on Wednesday praised Greene's \"spirit\" but urged GOP lawmakers to vote to sink her resolution to unite against Democrats in a statement posted minutes after the vote had already taken place.\n\n\"[I]f we show DISUNITY, which will be portrayed as CHAOS, it will negatively affect everything!\" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. \"Mike Johnson is a good man who is trying very hard.\"\n\nThe vote means that Johnson, who won the gavel in October following the ouster of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), will remain in the top job heading into November's elections -- for now. Greene on Wednesday would not rule out a subsequent vote on Johnson's ouster.\n\nBut the vote puts him in the precarious position of being a GOP Speaker propped up by Democrats, which could earn him the ire of conservatives who have already forecast that he won't lead the party in the next Congress.\n\nIn brief remarks delivered shortly after Wednesday's vote, Johnson thanked his colleagues for their support.\n\n\"I appreciate the show of confidence from my colleagues to defeat this misguided effort,\" he said. \"That is certainly what it was.\"\n\n\"As I've said from the beginning and I've made clear every day, I intend to do my job. I intend to do what I believe to be the right thing, which is what I was elected to do, and I'll let the chips fall where they may,\" he continued. \"In my view, that is leadership.\"\n\nThe vote came after Greene -- joined by Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), who also backed Johnson's ejection -- had huddled with the Speaker for hours in his office early this week when the pair demanded changes to his leadership approach. The duo wanted assurances that Johnson would bring no more bills to the floor that lacked the support of a majority of the GOP conference. They also wanted to extract a promise that the Speaker would back no more funding for Ukraine.\n\nOn Tuesday, Greene said the ball was in Johnson's court to respond to those demands. Her move Wednesday to force a vote on his removal indicates he rejected them.\n\n\"We tried to work a process with the Speaker and when it came very apparent yesterday that he wasn't actually going to put these things into action, that was it,\" she said. \"It was like why are we gonna keep dragging this out? And so we decided to call the vote today.\"\n\nGreene had filed her initial motion-to-vacate resolution more than a month ago, after Johnson had championed legislation to fund the federal government through September. But she escalated the threat on Wednesday afternoon by forcing the proposal to the floor for consideration, which came as a surprise to many lawmakers in both parties after it appeared that the Georgia Republican was backing off her threat.\n\n\"Everything that we had heard was that this wasn't coming,\" said Rep. Austin Scott (R-Ga.). \"I'm a little shocked, to be honest with you, that it is.\"\n\nBut the removal resolution had a very short shelf life. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.) immediately motioned to table the measure, setting up the vote that killed it with vast Democratic support.\n\nThose dynamics marked a sharp departure from the successful vote to remove McCarthy in October, which Democrats supported unanimously. But Democrats emphasized that their votes were not an endorsement of Johnson's conservative track record, which includes efforts to ban abortion and deny gay rights, but reflected his willingness to cut bipartisan deals on big-ticket legislation -- and their desire to deny Greene a victory.\n\n\"Our decision to stop Marjorie Taylor Greene from plunging the House of Representatives and the country into further chaos is rooted in our commitment to solve problems for everyday Americans in a bipartisan manner,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) said after the vote. \"We need more commonsense and less chaos in Washington, D.C.\"\n\nThe vote capped off a weeks-long saga over when -- and at times, if -- Greene would move to oust Johnson, which had emerged as a parlor game of sorts on Capitol Hill.\n\nGreene filed her motion to vacate in March as the House was voting on a sprawling government funding bill, which the Georgia Republican opposed. The firebrand's ire with Johnson grew more pronounced after he backed a measure to reauthorize the U.S.'s warrantless surveillance powers. And it hit a boiling point last month when the Speaker muscled through a foreign aid package that included billions of dollars in aid for Ukraine.\n\nThose frustrations led Greene last week to vow to force a vote on Johnson's ouster this week, putting a timeline on the highly anticipated reference after weeks of waffling.\n\nBut upon her return to Washington this week, Greene requested a meeting with Johnson and huddled in his office for hours on Monday and Tuesday, leading many to believe that she may be pulling back the reins on her very public ploy.\n\nAt the eleventh hour, Greene made a series of demands of Johnson as a final offramp for the ouster vote, including only bringing bills to the floor that have support from a majority of the GOP conference, a practice known as the Hastert rule, committing to not passing any additional aid for Ukraine; defunding special counsels, including Jack Smith, who is investigating former President Trump; and imposing a 1-percent spending cut across the board if Congress does not complete its regular appropriations process by Sept. 30.\n\nWhen the Speaker did not give in to the requests -- he insisted that his talks with Greene were \"not a negotiation\" -- the Georgia Republican said she decided to plow ahead.\n\n\"We're not going to have a House majority if we keep Mike Johnson,\" she warned last week when vowing to bring her motion to the floor.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_lillis@thehill.com", "name": "Mike Lillis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false},

Marjorie Taylor Greene for trying to have him fired, but other Republicans are done with the chaos she and her rabble-rousing cohorts have brought on this Congress.\n\n'I don't hold grudges. I've got to work with everybody. I told her last night before she left the floor, let's move on, Marjorie,' Johnson told 'Fox and Friends' on Thursday.\n\nJohnson told Politico he told Greene on the House floor after the vote: 'I'm not angry about this. We have to work together. And I want to work with you guys and those ideas we were talking about. I'm still working on them, so I hope we can put this behind us and move forward.'\n\nJohnson said Greene signaled a willingness to work with him.\n\nOther Republicans have not been so kind to the Georgia firebrand - and some have quietly suggested she be removed from committees.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson has insisted he's not holding any 'grudges' against Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene for trying to have him fired, but other Republicans are done with the chaos she and her rabble-rousing cohorts have brought on this Congress\n\n'I don't hold grudges. I've got to work with everybody. I told her last night before she left the floor, let's move on, Marjorie,' Johnson told 'Fox and Friends' on Thursday\n\nJohnson, however, has already signaled that removing members from committees as retribution could have consequences, and is unlikely to heed such calls.\n\n'They probably want to kick me off committees. They probably want a primary,' Greene acknowledged after the failed vote on Wednesday. 'I say, go ahead.'\n\nIdeas that have been floated include allowing the GOP conference to vote on removing a member from committees or even from the conference itself if they force a motion to vacate.\n\nThe biggest change less troublesome Republicans have demanded is to the rule former Speaker Kevin McCarthy agreed to allowing a single member to file a motion to vacate and force a vote on the House floor. That rule change led to his ultimate demise - Democrats did not swoop in to help the way they did with Johnson.\n\nIt's unlikely they could do this before next Congress. With a one-vote margin and right-wing conservatives opposed to it, they'd need Democratic help to change the rules. That is almost certain to be further than Democrats are willing to go to help the speaker.\n\nRep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., said the ones who voted to table, or kill, the motion to oust Johnson would be the ones who faced consequences, predicting they would 'take an ass-whooping from their base.'\n\nIn addition to two movements to oust speakers, Republicans have thwarted the leadership agenda by opposing typically mundane procedural votes that set up a final vote on legislation.\n\nMembers have already proposed removing Republicans who oppose the speaker's priority legislation on the Rules Committee, through which nearly all bills pass.\n\n'Members who refuse to support the Speaker's agenda should resign from the Rules Committee immediately. If they refuse, they should be removed immediately. They are there on behalf of the conference, not themselves,' Rep. Mike Lawler wrote on X weeks ago. He reignited those calls after the Wednesday vote.\n\nJust 10 Republican colleagues joined the Greene in voting to advance the motion to vacate that would kick the speaker out of office.\n\nIt took just 30 minutes for her effort to collapse in scenes reminiscent of the circus that led to the vote to get rid of Kevin McCarthy.\n\nOnly 43 House members voted to move Greene's motion forward.\n\nA vote to 'table' or kill, the motion succeeded 359 to 43.\n\nThe typically reserved Johnson let loose after the vote: 'Hopefully, this is the end of the personality politics and the frivolous character assassination that has defined the 118th Congress.'\n\nEven former President Donald Trump came out against the motion.\n\nTrump defended Greene but said now is 'not the time' for her motion, and said it is 'his request' that Republicans vote to table the motion - even though the post was after the vote to table had passed.\n\n'I absolutely love Marjorie Taylor Greene. She's got Spirit, she's got Fight, and I believe she'll be around, and on our side, for a long time to come,' he wrote.\n\n'With a Majority of One, shortly growing to three or four, we're not in a position of voting on a Motion to Vacate. At some point, we may very well be, but this is not the time.'\n\nTrump went on: 'If we show DISUNITY, which will be portrayed as CHAOS, it will negatively affect everything!'\n\nHe called Mike Johnson a 'good man who is trying very hard.'\n\nOnly thirty-two Democrats voted against the effort to kill the motion, a spectacular reversal from months ago when all Democrats voted with eight Republicans to kick out McCarthy.\n\nMore Republicans - 11 - voted to oust Johnson than McCarthy - eight - even as the Louisiana Republican had at one time been pitched as the conservative alternative to his California counterpart.\n\nGreene had been met with boos and eye rolls as she called up her motion during votes on Wednesday.\n\nMembers of the GOP accused her of throwing a 'tantrum' and attention-seeking as she brought her motion to vacate to the House floor on Wednesday night.\n\n'It's times like this you need a bar in this place,' Rep. Dave Joyce, R-Ohio, muttered as he came off the House floor.\n\n'You're not the Republican Party!' Rep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Fla., heckled Greene as she gaggled with reporters after the vote.\n\n'Moscow Marjorie has clearly gone off the deep end -- maybe the result of a space laser,' said Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y.\n\nAsked if he thought Greene should be punished, Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., said: 'One dumpster fire at a time.'\n\nMeanwhile on the House floor, Greene railed against the two-part spending bill that funded the government for fiscal year 2024, a bill that reauthorized spy tool FISA without warrants and a foreign aid package that did not include border security.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_to_vacate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Motion to vacate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_&_Friends", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fox & Friends"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Rules", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on Rules"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_McCarthy_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin McCarthy (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Massie", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Massie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliamentary procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Lawler", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Lawler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/118th_United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "118th United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusty_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dusty Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_A._Gim\u00e9nez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos A.

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) has initiated the process to vote on the removal of House Speaker Mike Johnson. The House now has a two-day window to vote on her motion to vacate, marking the second time in seven months there's been an attempt to oust the speaker from within the Republican Party.\n\nAccording to a report from Politico, \"House leaders are expected to immediately move forward on a vote to block her effort, according to a person familiar with leadership's plans.\"\n\nGreene and her ally in the ouster effort, Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), opted to move on their resolution after Johnson didn't move quickly on a slew of their demands, some of which they wanted attached to a Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization bill. Greene had pushed for Johnson to agree to four key demands, including not passing further Ukraine aid and defunding the special counsel probes into Donald Trump in upcoming appropriations bills.\n\nThe speaker had largely shrugged off the two hardliners and the House is expected to pass a one-week FAA extension in the afternoon vote. Johnson hasn't indicated that any of their asks would be included in a broader reauthorization bill Congress will have to consider later this month.\n\nMany members booed and heckled Greene as she read her resolution on the House floor. She fired back that her colleagues were part of the \"uni-party,\" a term conservatives use to deride Republicans who work with Democrats.\n\nGreene's attempt to oust Johnson was quickly defeated in the House, with 11 Republicans voting to move forward with it, and several Democrats voting against it.\n\nIt's still unclear if Greene or other Johnson critics will force another ouster vote before the end of the year. But Wednesday's vote marks a victory for Johnson, letting him avoid the same fate as his predecessor, Kevin McCarthy, who was ejected from the speakership in October.\n\nGreene's threat has hovered over the House for more than six weeks, when the Georgia Republican first introduced her resolution but didn't immediately trigger a vote. Instead, she held it over Johnson's head as he navigated a controversial spy program and tens of billions of dollars in new Ukraine aid through Congress. He was able to muscle both through with Democratic help, despite fierce opposition from his right flank.\n\nThis wasn't particularly surprising, as House Democrats had previously indicated willingness to help block efforts to oust Johnson.\n\n\"We will vote to table Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's Motion to Vacate the Chair. If she invokes the motion, it will not succeed,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.), Minority Whip Katherine Clark (Mass.), and Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar (Calif.) said in a statement last month.\n\n\"If the Democrats want to elect him Speaker (and some Republicans want to support the Democrats' chosen Speaker), I'll give them the chance to do it,\" Greene said at the time. \"I'm a big believer in recorded votes because putting Congress on record allows every American to see the truth and provides transparency to our votes.\"\n\nRelated: Just Who Will Speaker Johnson Be Working for When Democrats Stymie GOP Efforts to Depose Him?\n\nAs PJ Media's Rick Moran noted last month, this would be an unprecedented move that would raise questions about whose interests Speaker Johnson would be beholden to. For now, he can thank the Democrats for saving him.

Marjorie Taylor Greene triggers effort to remove House Speaker Mike Johnson from office - WDEF", "body": "By LISA MASCARO and KEVIN FREKING/Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Hardline Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene called Wednesday for a vote to oust Speaker Mike Johnson, pressing ahead with her long-shot effort despite pushback from Republicans at the highest levels tired of the political chaos.\n\nGreene, who is one of Donald Trump's biggest supporters in Congress, stood on the House floor and read a long list of \"transgressions\" she said Johnson had committed as speaker. Colleagues booed in protest.\n\nThe vote, which under House rules is required within two days, could happen imminently.\n\nThe Georgia Republican had vowed she would force a vote on the motion to vacate the Republican speaker if he dared to advance a foreign aid package with funds for Ukraine, which was overwhelmingly approved late last month and signed into law.\n\nBut in recent days it seemed her effort had cooled, as she and Johnson met repeatedly for a potential resolution.\n\nJohnson of Louisiana marched on, saying he had been willing to take the risk, believing it was important for the U.S. to back Ukraine against Russia's invasion and explaining he wanted to be on the \"right side of history.\"\n\n\"I just have to do my job every day,\" Johnson said Monday.\n\nIn a highly unusual move, the speaker received a boost from Democrats led by Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, whose leadership team has said it was time to \"turn the page\" on the GOP turmoil and vote to table Greene's resolution -- almost ensuring Johnson's job is saved, for now.\n\nTrump also weighed in after Johnson trekked to Mar-a-Lago for a visit, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee giving the speaker his nod of approval.

Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort to remove Speaker Johnson from office", "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hardline Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene stunned colleagues Wednesday calling for a vote to oust Speaker Mike Johnson, but lawmakers quickly rejected it.\n\nGreene pressed ahead with her long-shot effort despite pushback from Republicans at the highest levels tired of the political chaos.\n\nOne of Donald Trump's biggest supporters in Congress, Greene stood on the House floor and read a long list of \"transgressions\" she said Johnson had committed as speaker. Colleagues booed in protest.\n\nIt was the second time in a matter of months that Republicans have tried to oust their own speaker, an unheard-of level of party turmoil with a move rarely seen in U.S. history.\n\nGreene of Georgia criticized Johnson's leadership as \"pathetic, weak and unacceptable.\"\n\nGOP lawmakers filtered towards Johnson, giving him pats on the back and grasping his shoulder to assure him of their support.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steve Scalise quickly moved to table the effort -- essentially stopping it from going forward. The motion to table was swiftly approved.\n\nThe Georgia Republican had vowed she would force a vote on the motion to vacate the Republican speaker if he dared to advance a foreign aid package with funds for Ukraine, which was overwhelmingly approved late last month and signed into law.\n\nBut in recent days it seemed her effort had cooled, as she and Johnson met repeatedly for a potential resolution.\n\nJohnson of Louisiana marched on, saying he had been willing to take the risk, believing it was important for the U.S. to back Ukraine against Russia's invasion and explaining he wanted to be on the \"right side of history.\"\n\n\"I just have to do my job every day,\" Johnson said Monday.\n\nIn a highly unusual move, the speaker received a boost from Democrats led by Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, whose leadership team had said it was time to \"turn the page\" on the GOP turmoil and vote to table Greene's resolution -- almost ensuring Johnson's job is saved, for now.\n\nTrump also weighed in after Johnson trekked to Mar-a-Lago for a visit, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee giving the speaker his nod of approval. And Trump's hand-picked leader at the Republican National Committee urged House Republicans off the move.\n\nThe move now poses its own political risks for Greene, R-Ga., a high-profile provocateur.\n\nForcing the vote could bring the House chamber to a standstill, as happened last year when eight Republicans voted to ousted Kevin McCarthy from the speaker's office, and Democrats declined to help save him.\n\nOusting McCarthy resulted in a nearly monthlong search for a new GOP leader, and there is no immediate successor if Johnson is removed.\n\nMore from this section\n\nProtect Yourself and Your Family: Visit 'Psychiatry: An Industry of Death Exhibit' in New York.

Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort remove Mike Johnson as House speaker.\n\nThe vote to table the Georgia Republican's motion to vacate was 259 in favor and 43 opposed. Greene and 10 other Republicans voted against the motion to table. So did 32 Democrats.\n\nBut the vast majority of House members decided to kill Greene's efforts, a resounding rebuke after she railed for weeks against Johnson's leadership.\n\nBoth Republican and Democratic colleagues booed loudly as Greene, a Republican from Rome, laid out her case against Johnson during a speech on the House floor Wednesday afternoon. She was interrupted by jeers several times as she spoke.\n\nAlthough Greene knew that her motion to vacate was likely to fail, Greene said previously that she wanted the vote to happen anyway so that voters can know where their lawmakers stand on the issue. She is expected to address the media later this evening.\n\nEarlier this week, Greene had put a pause on her efforts to remove Johnson as speaker. The two met privately on Monday.\n\nShe asked him to make four assurances to prevent the ouster vote, such as to not bring to the floor any additional money to help Ukraine in its war with Russia and to agree not to send bills to the floor that don't have the support of a majority of Republicans.\n\nNeither she nor Johnson confirmed whether an agreement was reached.\n\nBut in a surprise move on Wednesday, Greene moved forward with the vote on her motion to vacate.\n\nNow that her effort has failed, it is unclear how Greene will proceed. She can file another motion to vacate at anytime. Democrats who helped save Johnson have indicated they may not keep the same posture if multiple votes are called.\n\n________", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greene_County,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Greene County, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Greene County, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_to_vacate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motion to vacate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russo-Ukrainian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Stop-Motion", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Stop-Motion", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://resources.arcamax.com/newspics/288/28852/2885259.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551299", "eventUri": "eng-9551299", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Matt Gaetz, a Republican from Florida, used in October to oust former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy.\n\nBut 359 members of the U.S. House -- both Democrats and Republicans -- voted to save Johnson. That included all but one of North Carolina's representatives. Rep. Valerie Foushee, a Democrat from Orange County, did not vote.\n\n\"I voted against firing the Speaker because we can't capitulate to a few extreme members who are willing to throw Congress into chaos just to get more attention,\" said Rep. Jeff Jackson, a Democrat from Charlotte, in a news release. \"Now that we've defeated their latest stunt, I'm hopeful we can quickly move on and get some things done to actually serve the country.\"\n\nGreene has been threatening to take down Johnson for weeks after Congress passed a $95 billion foreign aid package to help Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. Greene accused Johnson of betraying the Republican Party for allowing money to go to Ukraine, despite 101 House Republicans voting for its passage.\n\nSince then, she has called for Johnson to either resign, meet her demands or face a motion to vacate.\n\nShe, Rep. Charles Massie, a Republican from Kentucky, and Johnson have held several meetings together over the past two days prior to Greene bringing the vote to the floor.\n\nDemocrats side with Republicans\n\nJohnson told reporters he was not negotiating with her, and Democrats warned they would help Republicans maintain the House.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump weighed in, calling for Republicans to vote to table Greene's motion.\n\nAfter McCarthy was voted out last year, it threw Congress into three weeks of turmoil and Republican infighting. That left Rep. Patrick McHenry, a Republican from Lincoln County, running the House in the interim. McCarthy had named McHenry his successor in case something were to happen to him.\n\nDemocrats kept their promise Wednesday night.\n\nImmediately after Greene brought her motion to the floor, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise motioned to table Greene's bill, which would immediately kill it, if House members agreed to it.\n\nIn total, 359 members of the U.S. House voted to kill Greene's bill and save Johnson's job.

Here's why his job is far from safe.", "body": "In a stunning show of unity in the often divided House, Democrats joined a majority of Republicans on Wednesday to save the GOP speaker from an attempt by fellow Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene to remove him from his post.\n\nBut while Democrats in the minority threw the Louisiana congressman a life raft by voting on his side, they made clear they might not do so again. That means the threat for Johnson still lingers as Greene and other lawmakers can at any time call up another motion to oust him.\n\nThe episode highlights the increasingly precarious situation for Johnson, who faces the same conservative forces that took down his predecessor, Kevin McCarthy, but with an even smaller majority that has forced him to continuously rely on Democratic support to carry out the most basic functions of legislating. Republicans control the House by the barest of margins, 217-213.\n\nHere's what to know about how the House can remove a speaker and what's ahead for Johnson:\n\nThe current rules of the House allow any lawmaker -- Democrat or Republican -- to put forward a resolution declaring the speaker's chair vacant. If the House approves the resolution, it has the effect of ousting the speaker from office.\n\nThe \"motion to vacate\" has existed for most of congressional history. But it had never been deployed successfully until last October when a rebel band of Republicans joined with Democrats to oust McCarthy as speaker.\n\nMcCarthy's removal came, in part, as the result of the concessions he was forced to make to win the speaker's gavel in the first place. Among the concessions was agreeing that a motion to vacate could be triggered by a single member -- the threshold that historically has been the norm, but that had been abandoned by Democrats in the majority.\n\nProponents of allowing a single lawmaker to file the motion said it promotes accountability, noting its long history in the House.\n\nAt any point, a member of the House can introduce a privileged resolution -- a designation that gives it priority over other measures -- to declare the office of the speaker of the House of Representatives vacant.\n\nOnce the motion is introduced, the lawmaker sponsoring it can request a vote on the House floor. Such a request forces House leaders to take action within two legislative days.\n\nBut there are procedural motions that members of either party can make to slow or stop the process -- and that's exactly what happened when Greene called for a vote Wednesday on removing Johnson.\n\nThe No. 2 House Republican, Steve Scalise, immediately made a motion to \"table\" Greene's resolution, which defeats it if successful. The vote to table was fast and overwhelming, with lawmakers voting 359-43 to defeat her effort and keep Johnson in the job.\n\nThe speaker had fought for months to navigate an increasingly fractured Republican conference, which has -- in effect -- been operating in the majority in name only since January 2023.\n\nRepublicans unanimously chose Johnson late last year to replace McCarthy after several candidates for the job failed to gain enough support. His conservative bent was seen as a welcome departure by the most extreme members of his party who had accused McCarthy for years of being too moderate.\n\nBut Greene, who became a McCarthy ally late in his tenure, has been skeptical of Johnson's speakership from the beginning. While she criticized her fellow far-right colleagues for toppling McCarthy, she had warned Johnson for months that she would try to remove him in a similar fashion if he were to push ahead with a package to support Ukraine as it battles Russia's invasion.\n\n\"He should not bring funding for Ukraine,\" Greene had told reporters.\n\nBut Johnson did just that last month when he advanced a foreign aid package for Ukraine to the floor where it was overwhelmingly approved and signed into law.\n\nOther Republicans are also critical of Johnson, including Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who was a co-sponsor of Greene's resolution to oust him.\n\nIt remains to be seen, but the vote Wednesday showed Johnson's job is far from safe.\n\nWithout Democratic help, Johnson could have easily been ousted. Eleven Republicans voted to proceed with Greene's effort, more than the number of GOP votes it took to oust McCarthy last fall. Seven Democrats voted present and all but 32 of the others voted with Republicans to block the effort to oust him.\n\n\"Our decision to stop Marjorie Taylor Greene from plunging the country into further chaos is rooted in our commitment to solve problems,\" Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said after the vote.\n\nAsked what they might do if there were another attempt to oust the speaker, Jeffries said, \"Haven't given it a thought.\"\n\nSome Republicans are frustrated by the threats to Johnson and were dismissive of Greene. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., said of those trying to remove the speaker, \"They're pretty good at getting attention, but they have not been recognized for their ability to get things done.\"\n\nHe said if they keep pushing to oust the speaker, \"I think you can expect more of the same: Failure.\"\n\nThe speaker of the House, under the rules of the chamber, is required to keep a list of individuals who can act as speaker pro tempore in the event a chair is vacated. The list, which is oddly written by the sitting speaker at any given time, remains with the House clerk and would be made public if the speakership were vacant.\n\nThe first person on that list would be named speaker pro tempore and their first order of business would be to hold an election for a new speaker. The House then would vote as many times as it took to elect a speaker.\n\nIn the case of McCarthy, the role of speaker pro tem fell to his close confidant Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., the chair of the House Financial Services Committee. He was in the role for three weeks, until Johnson's election.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Lisa Mascaro, Kevin Freking and Stephen Groves contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "mcall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Morning Call"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@mcall.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_to_vacate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Motion to vacate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Scalise", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steve Scalise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliamentary procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusty_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dusty Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_pro_tempore", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President pro tempore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Massie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Massie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Financial_Services", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on Financial Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_tempore", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro tempore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_McHenry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick McHenry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speaker (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Audio/Do-It-Yourself", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Audio/Do-It-Yourself", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.mcall.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Congress_Speaker_87042.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551299", "eventUri": "eng-9551299", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

The 43 House members who voted against blocking Greene's measure to remove Johnson consisted of 11 Republicans and 32 Democrats.\n\nBoth the GOP and the Democrats said they did not want a repeat of the weeks of chaos that engulfed the lower chamber when Kevin McCarthy was ousted as House Speaker last October. With the GOP having just a one-seat majority in the House, Greene's motion was destined to fail as the Democrats vowed to side with the Republicans in voting to keep Johnson in his role.\n\nThe MAGA congresswoman has been attacked by her GOP colleagues for pushing through with the vote regardless. Greene was reportedly booed by fellow Republicans after introducing her motion to vacate plans on the chamber floor.\n\nGreene's office has been contacted for comment via email.\n\n\"All of us in life get to decide how we handle disappointment: you can be productive or you can be destructive,\" South Dakota Congressman Dusty Johnson said at the Capitol ahead of the resolution vote. \"Ms. Marjorie Taylor Greene is choosing destructive.\n\n\"Most of us by the time we turn 12 years old figured out the tantrums don't actually work, but apparently not everybody in Congress got the memo.\"\n\nNew York GOP Rep. Mike Lawler added: \"Moscow Marjorie has clearly gone off the deep end, maybe the result of a space laser.\n\n\"But this type of tantrum is absolutely unacceptable, and it does nothing to further the cause of the conservative movement.\n\n\"The only people who have stymied our ability to govern are the very people that have pulled these types of stunts throughout the course of this Congress to undermine the House Republican majority,\" Lawler said.\n\nFlorida Rep. Matt Gaetz, who spearheaded the move to vacate McCarthy, said he voted to table Greene's motion as it would damage the GOP in this election year.\n\n\"I voted to table the motion for one principal reason - with a two seat majority in an election year I believe 2-3 Republicans could be susceptible to bribes to resign or even vote for a Democrat,\" Gaetz posted on X, formerly Twitter. \"Democrats would then instantly deem Trump an 'insurrectionist' to bar him from the ballot. House Republicans must do better. We must be led better. We must return Trump to the White House.\"\n\nElsewhere, Trump said that while he does \"love\" Greene, she should not be pushing to remove the Republican House Speaker.\n\n\"With a Majority of One, shortly growing to three or four, we're not in a position of voting on a Motion to Vacate,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\n\"At some point, we may very well be, but this is not the time. We are leading in the Presidential Polls by a lot, both Nationally and in the Swing States. Likewise, we are doing well in the Senate, and I believe will do well in the House. But if we show DISUNITY, which will be portrayed as CHAOS, it will negatively affect everything!\"\n\nAfter the House voted to keep him in his job, Johnson said: \"Hopefully this is the end of the personality politics and the frivolous character assassination that has defined the 118th Congress.\"\n\nGreene herself said she was not surprised that the House voted to quash her attempt against Johnson.\n\n\"I think this is exactly what the American people needed to see,\" she said.\n\n\"I didn't run for Congress to come up here and join the Uniparty, and the Uniparty was on full display today. As a matter of fact, [the Republican Party] proved they're ready to do everything with the Democrats.\"\n\nIn a statement explaining why a majority of Democrats voted to keep Johnson in his role, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said: \"Our decision to stop Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene from plunging the House of Representatives and the country into further chaos is rooted in our commitment to solving problems for everyday Americans in a bipartisan manner.\n\n\"We need more common sense and less chaos in Washington, D.C. Marjorie Taylor Greene and the extreme MAGA Republicans are chaos agents. House Democrats are change agents.

Marjorie Taylor Greene triggers effort to remove House Speaker Mike Johnson from office", "body": "WASHINGTON -- Hardline Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene called Wednesday for a vote to oust Speaker Mike Johnson, pressing ahead with her long-shot effort despite pushback from Republicans at the highest levels tired of the political chaos.\n\nGreene, who is one of Donald Trump's biggest supporters in Congress, stood on the House floor and read a long list of \"transgressions\" she said Johnson had committed as speaker. Colleagues booed in protest.\n\nThe vote, which under House rules is required within two days, could happen imminently.\n\nThe Georgia Republican had vowed she would force a vote on the motion to vacate the Republican speaker if he dared to advance a foreign aid package with funds for Ukraine, which was overwhelmingly approved late last month and signed into law.\n\nBut in recent days it seemed her effort had cooled, as she and Johnson met repeatedly for a potential resolution.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nJohnson of Louisiana marched on, saying he had been willing to take the risk, believing it was important for the U.S. to back Ukraine against Russia's invasion and explaining he wanted to be on the \"right side of history.\"\n\n\"I just have to do my job every day,\" Johnson said Monday.\n\nIn a highly unusual move, the speaker received a boost from Democrats led by Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, whose leadership team has said it was time to \"turn the page\" on the GOP turmoil and vote to table Greene's resolution -- almost ensuring Johnson's job is saved, for now.\n\nTrump also weighed in after Johnson trekked to Mar-a-Lago for a visit, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee giving the speaker his nod of approval. And Trump's hand-picked leader at the Republican National Committee urged House Republicans off the move.\n\nThe move now poses its own political risks for Greene, R-Ga., a high-profile provocateur.\n\nForcing the vote could bring the House chamber to a standstill, as happened last year when eight Republicans voted to ousted Kevin McCarthy from the speaker's office, and Democrats declined to help save him.\n\nOr it could be over in a matter of minutes, as Democrats join Republicans to table the effort.\n\nOusting McCarthy resulted in a nearly monthlong search for a new GOP leader, and there is no immediate successor if Johnson is removed.\n\nTags Wire Dcc Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up!

He and his leadership team have promised to vote to table Greene's motion, essentially saving Johnson's job.\n\nBut Johnson insisted Tuesday he has no interest in relinquishing the gavel any time soon. Even though some Republicans have said he should step aside, Johnson said he intends to continue leading the House Republicans well into next year.", "source": {"uri": "4029tv.com", "dataType":

Marjorie Taylor Greene's attempt to oust Speaker Mike Johnson on Wednesday evening, with nearly all Republicans and most Democrats coming to Johnson's rescue.\n\nThe final tally was 359-43, with 11 Republicans and 32 Democrats voting against the motion to table Greene's resolution. Seven Democrats voted \"present.\"\n\nGreene, R-Ga., made her long-telegraphed move against Johnson after reading a lengthy litany of complaints about his tenure in office, which began in late October, on the floor. She offered her resolution to declare the office of the speaker vacant during a break in other legislative business.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., tried to dispense with the clerk's formal reading of the resolution on the floor, which is typically done by unanimous consent. Is this case, there was an objection and the entire resolution was read out.\n\nThen Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., a onetime speaker contender himself, offered his motion to table Greene's resolution.\n\nGreene has said that Johnson is a \"Democrat speaker\" and is particularly upset that Johnson brought to the floor compromise fiscal 2024 appropriations legislation and a war supplemental package that included aid for Ukraine.\n\nGreene initially introduced the measure after the passage of the second of the two appropriations packages, leading to weeks of speculation of if and when she would make her move.\n\nBut former President Donald Trump intervened and tried to persuade Greene to back down, according to reports, leading to speculation that the situation might be defused.\n\nIt had appeared that Greene and her ally Thomas Massie, R-Ky., had put their effort on pause Tuesday, after meetings with Johnson on Monday and Tuesday in which they delivered four \"requests\" to the speaker. They were joined by Arizona's Paul Gosar, the only other Republican to publicly back the effort.\n\nThe trio is asking that Johnson bring legislation to the floor only that has the support of a majority of the conference; oppose any additional Ukraine aid; defund the Office of Special Counsel Jack Smith; and include a 1% across-the-board spending cut in a continuing resolution that will be needed past Sept. 30 if all fiscal 2025 appropriations bills are not passed in time.\n\nJohnson, however, said he is not negotiating with Greene and her allies.\n\nIn a statement posted on his social media account after the vote Wednesday, Trump offered praise for both Greene and Johnson, but said he opposed the motion to vacate, arguing it would \"negatively affect everything!\"\n\nThough only a handful of Republicans have come out against Johnson, that would have been enough if Democrats took the same approach they did in October and voted to oust former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.\n\nBut when Congress returned from its recess last week, Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and his two deputies put speculation to rest by declaring they would vote to table Greene's motion to vacate.\n\n\"At this moment, upon completion of our national security work, the time has come to turn the page on this chapter of Pro-Putin Republican obstruction,\" Jeffries, Whip Katherine M. Clark, D-Mass., and Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., said in their statement.\n\nAnd Greene has not secured much support from her Republican colleagues; though 10 other Republicans joined her in voting against the motion to table on Wednesday, it's not clear how many of those would actually vote to sack Johnson if Greene's motion to vacate the office actually came to a vote.\n\nA vast majority of the conference wants to avoid the chaos of last October, when McCarthy became the first speaker ever removed from office under a motion to vacate.\n\n\"I do think it's a distraction to put a lot of energy in this, when other problems are out there,\" Rep. Ryan Zinke, R-Mont., said. \"I would prefer we focus on the border, focus on the Israeli problem with ammunition, focus on what we can do rather than these leadership distractions.\"\n\nRep. Mike Garcia, R-Calif., who is in a tight reelection race, said a motion to vacate is divisive.\n\n\"This type of drama right now is an unnecessary tactic,\" he said. \"I think she's depreciated the value of it to zero.\"\n\nIn October, eight Republicans, led by Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., joined with every Democrat to oust McCarthy. Gaetz moved against McCarthy after he put a \"clean\" stopgap spending measure on the floor.\n\nThat kicked off a three-week period in which the House was paralyzed as three different Republicans -- Scalise, Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., were all nominated by the conference but blocked by a group of dug-in opponents.\n\nThat paved the way for Johnson's dark horse candidacy and out-of-nowhere ascension to the speakership.\n\nSince then, he has negotiated with Democrats to avoid a government shutdown and fund the government for fiscal 2024, and moved additional aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.\n\nJohnson's decision to move funding for allies appears to have played a major role in Democrats' move to protect him. The speaker had stated he needed changes to the country's immigration and border enforcement laws to move Ukraine aid, but ended up bringing legislation to the floor without border provisions.\n\nSince Greene's intent became known, there have been rumblings among GOP critics that it was time for those seeking to remove Johnson -- and potentially trigger more instability within their party and in Congress -- to face consequences, such as removal from committees.\n\nGreene has said that doesn't bother her, considering Democrats did that when they were in control and it didn't dent her political popularity. Nonetheless, talk of consequences continued up through the vote on Wednesday night.\n\n\"I think that remains to be seen,\" said Rep. Austin Scott, R-Ga., who himself was briefly a candidate for speaker last October.\n\nAside from Greene, Massie and Gosar, other Republicans who voted \"no\" on the motion to table Wednesday night included Andy Biggs and Eli Crane of Arizona; Eric Burlison of Missouri; Warren Davidson of Ohio; Chip Roy of Texas; Alex X. Mooney of West Virginia; Barry Moore of Alabama; and Victoria Spartz of Indiana, who was coming off a tough primary win in the Hoosier state on Tuesday night.\n\n\"I appreciate the show of confidence from my colleagues in this misguided effort,\" Johnson told reporters after the vote. \"I intend the do the right thing, what I was elected to do, and I'll let the chips fall where they may.\"\n\n\"In my view, that is leadership. And that's what's called for in the times in which we live.\"\n\n(Roll Call's David Lerman and Paul V. Fontelo contributed to this report.)\n\n\u00a92024 CQ-Roll Call, Inc., All Rights Reserved.

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) pulled the trigger on Wednesday on her motion to oust Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) from the speakership, a move that sets up a full vote in the House on his fate.\n\nWhile that vote will mark the second time in seven months that House Republicans have voted on removing their own Speaker -- an unprecedented sign of chaos -- Greene is all but certain to fail in her quest to boot Johnson as Democrats will likely help table the motion.\n\nFor starters, the Georgia Republican has only garnered two additional members to publicly support her motion, Reps. Thomas Massie (R-KY) and Paul Gosar (R-AZ). The latter has expressed to reporters that he does not believe the motion to vacate should be triggered this week.\n\nTwo would be enough to oust Johnson if no Democrats came to his aid, but luckily for the Speaker, Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) and the Democratic caucus are set to bail him out.\n\nThey're coming to his rescue for the same reason that MAGA conservatives are irate with Johnson: his championing of a huge aid package for Ukraine that passed the House on April 20.\n\n\"At this moment, upon completion of our national security work, the time has come to turn the page on this chapter of Pro-Putin Republican obstruction,\" House Democratic leaders said in a statement on Tuesday. \"We will vote to table Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's Motion to Vacate the Chair. If she invokes the motion, it will not succeed.\"\n\nThat announcement, which comes after weeks of signaling that Democrats would rescue Johnson if he secured a Ukraine aid package, means Greene's gambit will fall flat this time.\n\nIndeed, Greene acknowledged this reality -- but said she believes people should still go on record with their support for Johnson.\n\n\"Mike Johnson is officially the Democrat Speaker of the House,\" Greene said in a post on X in response to the Democratic leaders' statement. \"I'm a big believer in recorded votes because putting Congress on record allows every American to see the truth and provides transparency to our votes. Americans deserve to see the Uniparty on full display.

Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort to remove Speaker Johnson from office", "body": "Greene pressed ahead with her long-shot effort despite pushback from Republicans at the highest levels tired of the political chaos.\n\nOne of Donald Trump's biggest supporters in Congress, Greene stood on the House floor and read a long list of \"transgressions\" she said Johnson had committed as speaker. Colleagues booed in protest.\n\nIt was the second time in a matter of months that Republicans have tried to oust their own speaker, an unheard-of level of party turmoil with a move rarely seen in U.S. history.\n\nGreene of Georgia criticized Johnson's leadership as \"pathetic, weak and unacceptable.\"\n\nGOP lawmakers filtered towards Johnson, giving him pats on the back and grasping his shoulder to assure him of their support.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steve Scalise quickly moved to table the effort -- essentially stopping it from going forward. The motion to table was swiftly approved.\n\nThe Georgia Republican had vowed she would force a vote on the motion to vacate the Republican speaker if he dared to advance a foreign aid package with funds for Ukraine, which was overwhelmingly approved late last month and signed into law.\n\nBut in recent days it seemed her effort had cooled, as she and Johnson met repeatedly for a potential resolution.\n\nJohnson of Louisiana marched on, saying he had been willing to take the risk, believing it was important for the U.S. to back Ukraine against Russia's invasion and explaining he wanted to be on the \"right side of history.\"\n\n\"I just have to do my job every day,\" Johnson said Monday.\n\nIn a highly unusual move, the speaker received a boost from Democrats led by Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, whose leadership team had said it was time to \"turn the page\" on the GOP turmoil and vote to table Greene's resolution -- almost ensuring Johnson's job is saved, for now.\n\nTrump also weighed in after Johnson trekked to Mar-a-Lago for a visit, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee giving the speaker his nod of approval. And Trump's hand-picked leader at the Republican National Committee urged House Republicans off the move.\n\nThe move now poses its own political risks for Greene, R-Ga., a high-profile provocateur.\n\nForcing the vote could bring the House chamber to a standstill, as happened last year when eight Republicans voted to ousted Kevin McCarthy from the speaker's office, and Democrats declined to help save him.\n\nOusting McCarthy resulted in a nearly monthlong search for a new GOP leader, and there is no immediate successor if Johnson is removed.", "source": {"uri": "weareiowa.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Local 5 - weareiowa.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@weareiowa.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "History of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Scalise", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steve Scalise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://media.tegna-media.com/assets/CCT/images/c7f5c644-3075-48a6-aac4-7e39b5daacf7/c7f5c644-3075-48a6-aac4-7e39b5daacf7_1140x641.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551299", "eventUri": "eng-9551299", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Marjorie Taylor Greene's attempt to oust Speaker Mike Johnson on Wednesday night, with nearly all Republicans and most Democrats coming to Johnson's rescue.\n\nThe final tally was 359-43, with 11 Republicans and 32 Democrats voting against the motion to table Greene's resolution. Seven Democrats voted \"present.\"\n\nGreene, R-Ga., made her long-telegraphed move against Johnson after reading a lengthy litany of complaints about his tenure in office, which began in late October, on the floor. She offered her resolution to declare the office of the speaker vacant during a break in other legislative business.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., tried to dispense with the clerk's formal reading of the resolution on the floor, which is typically done by unanimous consent. Is this case, there was an objection and the entire resolution was read out.\n\nThen Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., a onetime speaker contender himself, offered his motion to table Greene's resolution.\n\nGreene has said that Johnson is a \"Democrat speaker\" and is particularly upset that Johnson brought to the floor compromise fiscal 2024 appropriations legislation and a war supplemental package that included aid for Ukraine.\n\nGreene initially introduced the measure after the passage of the second of the two appropriations packages, leading to weeks of speculation of if and when she would make her move.\n\nBut former President Donald Trump intervened and tried to persuade Greene to back down, according to reports, leading to speculation that the situation might be defused.\n\nIt had appeared that Greene and her ally Thomas Massie, R-Ky., had put their effort on pause Tuesday, after meetings with Johnson on Monday and Tuesday in which they delivered four \"requests\" to the speaker. They were joined by Arizona's Paul Gosar, the only other Republican to publicly back the effort.\n\nThe trio is asking that Johnson only bring legislation to the floor that has the support of a majority of the conference; oppose any additional Ukraine aid; defund the Office of Special Counsel Jack Smith; and include a 1 percent across-the-board spending cut in a continuing resolution that will be needed past Sept. 30 if all fiscal 2025 appropriations bills are not passed in time.\n\n[Greene's 'vacate' push on hold amid ongoing talks with speaker]\n\nJohnson, however, said he is not negotiating with Greene and her allies.\n\nIn a statement posted on his social media account after the vote Wednesday, Trump offered praise for both Greene and Johnson, but said he opposed the motion to vacate, arguing it would \"negatively affect everything!\"\n\nThough only a handful of Republicans have come out against Johnson, that would have been enough if Democrats took the same approach they did in October and voted to oust former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.\n\nBut when Congress returned from its recess last week, Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and his two deputies put speculation to rest by declaring they would vote to table Greene's motion to vacate.\n\n\"At this moment, upon completion of our national security work, the time has come to turn the page on this chapter of Pro-Putin Republican obstruction,\" Jeffries, Whip Katherine M. Clark, D-Mass., and Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., said in their statement.\n\nAnd Greene has not secured much support from her Republican colleagues; though 10 other Republicans joined her in voting against the motion to table on Wednesday, it's not clear how many of those would actually vote to sack Johnson if Greene's motion to vacate the office actually came to a vote.\n\nA vast majority of the conference wants to avoid the chaos of last October, when McCarthy became the first speaker ever removed from office under a motion to vacate.\n\n\"I do think it's a distraction to put a lot of energy in this, when other problems are out there,\" Rep. Ryan Zinke, R-Mont., said. \"I would prefer we focus on the border, focus on the Israeli problem with ammunition, focus on what we can do rather than these leadership distractions.\"\n\nRep. Mike Garcia, R-Calif., who is in a tight reelection race, said a motion to vacate is divisive.\n\n\"This type of drama right now is an unnecessary tactic,\" he said. \"I think she's depreciated the value of it to zero.\"\n\nIn October, eight Republicans, led by Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., joined with every Democrat to oust McCarthy. Gaetz moved against McCarthy after he put a \"clean\" stopgap spending measure on the floor.\n\nThat kicked off a three-week period in which the House was paralyzed as three different Republicans -- Scalise, Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., were all nominated by the conference but blocked by a group of dug-in opponents.\n\nThat paved the way for Johnson's dark horse candidacy and out-of-nowhere ascension to the speakership.\n\nSince then, he has negotiated with Democrats to avoid a government shutdown and fund the government for fiscal 2024, and moved additional aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.\n\nJohnson's decision to move funding for allies appears to have played a major role in Democrats' move to protect him. The speaker had stated he needed changes to the country's immigration and border enforcement laws to move Ukraine aid, but ended up bringing legislation to the floor without border provisions.\n\nSince Greene's intent became known, there have been rumblings among GOP critics that it was time for those seeking to remove Johnson -- and potentially trigger more instability within their party and in Congress -- to face consequences, such as removal from committees.\n\nGreene has said that doesn't bother her, considering Democrats did that when they were in control and it didn't dent her political popularity. Nonetheless, talk of consequences continued up through the vote on Wednesday night.\n\n\"I think that remains to be seen,\" said Rep. Austin Scott, R-Ga., who himself was briefly a candidate for speaker last October.\n\nAside from Greene, Massie and Gosar, other Republicans who voted \"no\" on the motion to table Wednesday night included Andy Biggs and Eli Crane of Arizona; Eric Burlison of Missouri; Warren Davidson of Ohio; Chip Roy of Texas; Alex X. Mooney of West Virginia; Barry Moore of Alabama; and Victoria Spartz of Indiana, who was coming off a tough primary win in the Hoosier state on Tuesday night.\n\n\"I appreciate the show of confidence from my colleagues in this misguided effort,\" Johnson told reporters after the vote. \"I intend the do the right thing, what I was elected to do, and I'll let the chips fall where they may.\"\n\n\"In my view, that is leadership. And that's what's called for in the times in which we live.\"", "source": {"uri": "rollcall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Roll Call"}, "authors": [{"uri": "peter_cohn@rollcall.com", "name":

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) pulled the trigger on Wednesday on her motion to oust Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) from the speakership, a move that sets up a full vote in the House on his fate within days.\n\nWhile that vote will mark the second time in seven months that House Republicans have voted on removing their own Speaker -- an unprecedented sign of chaos -- Greene is all but certain to fail in her quest to boot Johnson as Democrats will likely help table the motion.\n\nFor starters, the Georgia Republican has only garnered two additional members to publicly support her motion, Reps. Thomas Massie (R-KY) and Paul Gosar (R-AZ). The latter has expressed to reporters that he does not believe the motion to vacate should be triggered this week.\n\nTwo would be enough to oust Johnson if no Democrats came to his aid, but luckily for the Speaker, Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) and the Democratic caucus are set to bail him out.\n\nThey're coming to his rescue for the same reason that MAGA conservatives are irate with Johnson: his championing of a huge aid package for Ukraine that passed the House on April 20.\n\n\"At this moment, upon completion of our national security work, the time has come to turn the page on this chapter of Pro-Putin Republican obstruction,\" House Democratic leaders said in a statement on Tuesday. \"We will vote to table Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's Motion to Vacate the Chair. If she invokes the motion, it will not succeed.\"\n\nThat announcement, which comes after weeks of signaling that Democrats would rescue Johnson if he secured a Ukraine aid package, means Greene's gambit will fall flat this time.\n\nIndeed, Greene acknowledged this reality -- but said she believes people should still go on record with their support for Johnson.\n\n\"Mike Johnson is officially the Democrat Speaker of the House,\" Greene said in a post on X in response to the Democratic leaders' statement. \"I'm a big believer in recorded votes because putting Congress on record allows every American to see the truth and provides transparency to our votes. Americans deserve to see the Uniparty on full display. I'm about to give them their coming out party!\"\n\nThe move comes after a week during which Massie and Greene met with Johnson numerous times to try and work out a deal to avoid triggering the motion to vacate.\n\nGreene said she demanded of Johnson a number of things including: observing the Hastert Rule (majority of the majority must support any bill), no more funding for Ukraine, and to defund special counsel investigations.", "source": {"uri": "thedailybeast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Beast"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Democratic_Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "House Democratic Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_to_vacate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Motion to vacate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Gosar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul Gosar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Massie", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Massie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hastert_Rule", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hastert Rule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_576,w_1024,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1714506782/GettyImages-2150351603_hehvsb", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551299", "eventUri": "eng-9551299", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-20", "textStart": 1257, "textEnd": 1265}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Hakeem Jeffries of New York, whose leadership team had said it was time to \"turn the page\" on the GOP turmoil and vote to table Greene's resolution -- almost ensuring Johnson's job is saved, for now.\n\nTrump also weighed in after Johnson trekked to Mar-a-Lago for a visit, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee giving the speaker his nod of approval. And Trump's hand-picked leader at the Republican National Committee urged House Republicans off the move.\n\nAhead of the vote, Trump said on social media, \"I absolutely love Marjorie Taylor Greene,\" but he said Republicans need to be fighting now to defeat Democrats in the November election.\n\n\"This is not the time,\" Trump said, to oust the speaker.\n\nThe move now poses its own political risks for Greene, a high-profile provocateur.\n\nGreene was determined to force her colleagues to be on the record with their vote - putting them in the politically uncomfortable position of backing the speaker and seen as joining forces with Democrats to save him.\n\nNational Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Speaker Johnson search for offramp as vote on his ouster simmers By LISA MASCARO, KEVIN FREKING and STEPHEN GROVES - Associated Press\n\nThe tally showed the strength, but also the weakness, of her effort, as most lawmakers voted to move past the infighting and allow the Republican speaker, just six months in the office, to keep the gavel.\n\nLast year, the House chamber was brought to a standstill when eight Republicans voted to oust Kevin McCarthy from the speaker's office, and Democrats declined to help save him.\n\nOusting McCarthy resulted in a nearly monthlong search for a new GOP leader, throwing the chamber into turmoil with an episode Republicans wanted to avoid before seeking voter support in the November election.\n\nThese 8 Republicans stood apart to remove Kevin McCarthy as House speaker Rep.

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) triggered her motion to vacate House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) on Wednesday, starting the clock for leadership to bring the measure to the floor.\n\nGreene filed her motion as privileged, putting a notice on the legislation that would require GOP leaders to bring it to the floor within two legislative days. It's unclear when leadership will call a vote, as lawmakers are scheduled to adjourn for recess for the rest of the weekend and are not slated to return until Tuesday.\n\nGreene initially filed her motion to vacate in late March, holding the measure over Johnson's head as he looks to navigate his conference through votes on key legislation. Greene followed through with that threat last week, telling reporters last week she would \"absolutely\" be putting the measure on the floor sometime this week for a vote.\n\nGreene announced her motion on the floor during votes on Wednesday afternoon, which was met with boos from members of both parties. Greene yelled back: \"This is the uniparty for the American people watching.\"\n\nHowever, the move comes as House Democratic leadership came out against the motion to vacate on Tuesday, vowing to table the legislation should it come to the floor. That decision gives Johnson considerable cover as several House Republicans have also expressed opposition to removing the speaker, possibly making the motion dead on arrival.\n\nGreene has refused to back down from her threats, saying she would give Democrats \"the chance\" to elect him as their speaker.\n\n\"I'm a big believer in recorded votes because putting Congress on record allows every American to see the truth and provides transparency to our votes,\" Greene said. \"Americans deserve to see the Uniparty on full display. I'm about to give them their coming out party!\"\n\nGreene also accused Johnson of orchestrating a \"slimy backroom deal\" to save his speakership, something the speaker said he did not do. He said during the GOP leadership press conference on Tuesday that he did not hear about Democratic leaders' statement to table a possible motion to vacate until reporters asked him.\n\n\"I've never requested assistance from anyone. I'm not focused on that at all,\" Johnson said earlier this month.\n\nA motion to vacate requires only a simple majority to pass, meaning if all Democrats voted to oust Johnson, it would only take two Republicans to join in order to pass. However, a handful of Democrats have expressed support to defend Johnson.\n\nInstead, Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) had publicly called on Johnson to resign voluntarily, giving Republicans an opportunity to choose a new speaker without repeating the three-week period in October when the House went without a speaker and all floor action was stalled.\n\nMassie said he had pushed Johnson to resign rather than risk an ouster, but the speaker has repeatedly declined. The Kentucky Republican predicted the motion to vacate \"will get called\" and Johnson would \"lose more votes than Kevin McCarthy.\" McCarthy was ousted after eight Republicans joined all Democrats to support the motion.\n\nHowever, Johnson has remained defiant, telling reporters earlier this month, \"I am not resigning. And it is, in my view, an absurd notion.\"\n\nMeanwhile, some other House Republicans are quietly pursuing their own path to raising the threshold for the motion to vacate. Rep. Dusty Johnson (R-SD) announced the effort two weeks ago, and at least a dozen lawmakers have expressed support for the idea, a source familiar confirmed to the Washington Examiner.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\n\"Again, we've got a small group of people who are upset that they're not getting their way,\" Dusty Johnson said in a video. \"It's the era of divided government. Nobody gets everything they want. They want to throw out the current speaker of the House. It's a terrible idea. I'm working with a group of members to change the rules so they can't get that done so that one knucklehead can't put the whole House into disarray by forcing another speaker vote.\"\n\nSeveral Republicans have decried the motion to remove the second speaker over the course of one year, noting that although there haven't been conversations about a rescue plan, they would hope Democrats would not aid in removing Johnson.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cami_mondeaux@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Cami Mondeaux", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_to_vacate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Motion to vacate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Massie", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Massie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Majority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speaker (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusty_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dusty Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Examiner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington Examiner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Subcultures", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Subcultures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://wex-s3.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/AP24102538770942-2-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551299", "eventUri": "eng-9551299", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

The final vote to dismiss of Greene's motion was 359-43 with seven lawmakers voting present.\n\nGreene's move Wednesday was a sudden shift after she appeared to be backing off her weekslong threat following back-to-back meetings with Johnson on Monday and Tuesday.", "source": {"uri": "abc7.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC7"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Massie", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Massie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Scalise", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Scalise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/14746687_MTG-Motion-To-Vacate-img.jpg?w=1600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551299", "eventUri": "eng-9551299", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

It was a bipartisan effort to save Johnson as the Democrats made good on their promise to save him should the vote happen.\n\nGreene's attempt to kick out Johnson was a long-shot to begin with as both Democrats and Republicans have expressed that they are already tired of the political chaos, having learned from the chaos that happened after Matt Gaetz had Kevin McCarthy kicked out of the speakership.\n\nAs Greene stood to force the vote, the MAGA Republican read a long list of \"transgressions\" she claimed Johnson did as House Speaker. However, the rest of the House immediately let her know how they felt as they booed her. Despite this, Greene still criticized Johnson's leadership as \"pathetic, weak and unacceptable.\"\n\nWhen she triggered the vote on her motion to vacate the speakership, she was immediately countered by Republican Majority Leader Steve Scalise, who then called for a vote to table it. This led the House to table the motion 359-43, which meant that in the meantime, Johnson is still the House Speaker.\n\n\"As I've said from the beginning, and I've made clear here every day, I intend to do my job,\" said Mike Johnson in a statement after the vote. \"And I'll let the chips fall where they may. In my view, that is leadership.\"\n\nIt was noted that even though the vote to save him was overwhelming, it still showed that Johnson still has many weaknesses as Shouse Speaker as his majority was so thin that he had to rely on the Democrats to save him.\n\nThe humiliating defeat at the hands of a bipartisan coalition has Greene already signaling that she is not going to pursue her threat of ousting Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson any further, according to ABC News.\n\nREAD MORE: Republican Infighting Continues as House GOP Blames Marjorie Taylor Greene for Lack of Border Wins, Call Her an 'Idiot'\n\n\"I will tell you one thing I did say in there: I am so done with words,\" she told reporters who were waiting for her on the Capitol steps. \"For me, it is all about actions. And that is all the American people care about.\"\n\nThe Georgia Republican also noted that she is not imposing a deadline for Johnson to comply with her four \"suggestions,\" adding that \"These are not complicated things that we're talking about, and having the majority of Republicans support for bills that are brought to the floor. Yeah, that's very reasonable.\"\n\nAfter her attempt to get a new House Speaker went up in flames, Newsweek is reporting that the controversial Republican is losing her \"sway\" with Republican frontrunner Donald Trump, whom she is an avowed loyalist.\n\nRepublican strategist Susan Del Percio said that the former president \"simply doesn't seem interested in backing her chaotic play,\" with Trump openly giving his support to Johnson.\n\n\"Greene has also known for weeks that Trump himself has little appetite for this fight. Just a few weeks ago, after Greene first said she would attempt to remove Johnson, the speaker traveled down to Mar-a-Lago for a photo op with Trump. 'I stand with the speaker,' Trump stated, while also noting that Greene was 'a very good friend,\" she added. \"They may still be friends, but she no longer has much sway over Trump-if she ever had any.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Kevin McCarthy Says He Is Not Speaker of the House Anymore Because Matt Gaetz 'Slept With a 17-Year-Old'", "source": {"uri": "latinpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Latin Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rick_martin@latinpost.com", "name": "Rick Martin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Speaker (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Gaetz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matt Gaetz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_McCarthy_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin McCarthy (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Scalise", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steve Scalise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_leader", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Majority leader"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://1622179098.rsc.cdn77.org/data/thumbs/full/151314/820/0/0/0/marjorie-taylor-greene-effort-to-remove-house-speaker-mike-johnson-swiftly-killed-congresswoman-reportedly-losing-sway-with-donald-trump.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551299", "eventUri": "eng-9551299", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort to oust Speaker Mike Johnson from his leadership post.\n\nThe resounding vote in Johnson's favor - which came with the help of Democrats - brings to an end the most serious challenge to the speakership the Louisiana Republican has faced, at least for now.\n\nAs he navigates a razor-thin majority, the failed ouster effort gives Johnson the opportunity to argue it is time to move on to other issues, though support from Democrats may open him up to more criticism from his right flank.\n\nJohnson spoke briefly with reporters following the vote, calling Greene's campaign against him \"misguided\" and thanking colleagues for a \"show of confidence\" in his leadership.\n\n\"I want to say that I appreciate the show of confidence for my colleagues to defeat this misguided effort,\" he said. \"I've made clear here every day, I intend to do my job, I intend to do what I believe to be the right thing, which I was elected to do. And I'll let the chips fall where they may.\"\n\nGreene had dangled the threat of triggering a vote against the speaker for weeks, a push that reopened bitter divisions within the House GOP conference as many members opposed ousting Johnson.\n\nJohnson was elected speaker last year after conservative hardliners voted to oust former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a historic and unprecedented vote that sparked a tumultuous period of infighting as Republicans struggled to unify around a new leader before eventually coalescing around the Louisiana Republican.\n\nThe House on Wednesday voted to table - or kill - Greene's push to remove Johnson by a tally of 359 to 43. Eleven Republicans voted against tabling.\n\nIn the wake of Johnson's push to pass a major foreign aid package over the objections of hardline conservatives, House Democratic leadership had announced that Democrats would help Johnson keep his job by voting to table.\n\nGreene and Johnson - as well as Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky - met over several days earlier this week, where Greene outlined her concerns with Johnson's leadership and her priorities. The House was on the verge of recessing for the week when Greene pulled up her motion to vacate the chair, which started a two-legislative-day clock for GOP leaders to hold a vote on her measure.\n\nHouse Republicans were completely caught off guard by Greene's decision to trigger her motion, multiple Republican sources told CNN. GOP leadership did not see this coming and thought after the two productive meetings between Johnson and Greene that there was at least more time before any next steps were taken, the sources added.\n\n\"I was shocked,\" GOP Rep. Austin Scott of Georgia told CNN.\n\nCNN's Haley Talbot contributed to this report.\n\nThis story is breaking and has been updated.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia was booed on the House floor Wednesday afternoon after she tried to force a vote to oust Speaker Mike Johnson.\n\nGreene first vowed to force a motion to force Johnson from power in March, citing deals the speaker had cut with Democrats to fund foreign wars and governments.\n\nEach of those deals ignored the ongoing crisis at the country's border with Mexico, irking Greene and eventually a number of other House Republicans who supported her plan to oust Johnson.\n\nThe Hill reported Greene moved to force a vote on the matter Wednesday. A C-SPAN camera caught the moment Greene introduced her resolution to vacate Johnson.\n\n\"The form of the resolution is as follows,\" Greene said. \"Declaring the office of speaker of the House of Representatives to be vacant.\"\n\nA chorus of boos from across the floor rained down on Greene, who fired back at those jeering her.\n\n\"This is the uniparty, for the American people watching,\" she said.\n\nGreene was met with another round of booing, but order on the floor was eventually restored without a vote.\n\nThe Georgia Republican's motion was shot down 359-43 with help from House Democrats and most Republicans, Mediaite reported.\n\nOn Tuesday, Greene implied while speaking to reporters that a conversation she had in private with Johnson a day earlier had been leaked by his office.\n\nShe said her demands of the speaker were reasonable, and included forcing him to work for the Republican majority and asking him to decline to support any more military aid to Ukraine.\n\nLater Tuesday, Greene unleashed on Johnson in a post on the social media platform X.\n\n\"This is Mike Johnson's decision. Will he be a Democrat Speaker or a Republican one?\" she asked. \"He already delivered Joe Biden and Chuck Schumer's agenda.\"\n\n\"If he's capable of doing that, I think he's extremely capable of meeting the suggestions I've asked of him on behalf of the Republican majority,\" Greene added. \"It takes actions, not words. But he can't drag this out.\"\n\nRepublican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky spoke to CNN's Manu Raju on Tuesday and said he supports Greene's efforts to oust Johnson if he does not meet requests from House Republicans to put Americans first.\n\nMassie indicated he was willing to give the speaker some time to meet the demand but the clock was running.\n\n\"If his plan is to drag this out so that the pressure comes off of this, and to drag it out for weeks or days even without making some movement in our direction, then he would just be far better off to have this vote and get it behind him,\" Massie said.\n\nThe congressman concluded, \"It doesn't serve him or us to drag this out.

The 43 House members who voted against blocking Greene's measure to remove Johnson consisted of 11 Republicans and 32 Democrats.\n\nBoth the GOP and the Democrats said they did not want a repeat of the weeks of chaos that engulfed the lower chamber when Kevin McCarthy was ousted as House Speaker last October. With the GOP having just a one-seat majority in the House, Greene's motion was destined to fail as the Democrats vowed to side with the Republicans in voting to keep Johnson in his role.\n\nThe MAGA congresswoman has been attacked by her GOP colleagues for pushing through with the vote regardless. Greene was reportedly booed by fellow Republicans after introducing her motion to vacate plans on the chamber floor.\n\nGreene's office has been contacted for comment via email.\n\n\"All of us in life get to decide how we handle disappointment: you can be productive or you can be destructive,\" South Dakota Congressman Dusty Johnson said at the Capitol ahead of the resolution vote. \"Ms. Marjorie Taylor Greene is choosing destructive.\n\n\"Most of us by the time we turn 12 years old figured out the tantrums don't actually work, but apparently not everybody in Congress got the memo.\"\n\nNew York GOP Rep. Mike Lawler added: \"Moscow Marjorie has clearly gone off the deep end, maybe the result of a space laser.\n\n\"But this type of tantrum is absolutely unacceptable, and it does nothing to further the cause of the conservative movement.\n\n\"The only people who have stymied our ability to govern are the very people that have pulled these types of stunts throughout the course of this Congress to undermine the House Republican majority,\" Lawler said.\n\nFlorida Rep. Matt Gaetz, who spearheaded the move to vacate McCarthy, said he voted to table Greene's motion as it would damage the GOP in this election year.\n\n\"I voted to table the motion for one principal reason - with a two seat majority in an election year I believe 2-3 Republicans could be susceptible to bribes to resign or even vote for a Democrat,\" Gaetz posted on X, formerly Twitter. \"Democrats would then instantly deem Trump an 'insurrectionist' to bar him from the ballot. House Republicans must do better. We must be led better. We must return Trump to the White House.\"\n\nElsewhere, Trump said that while he does \"love\" Greene, she should not be pushing to remove the Republican House Speaker.\n\n\"With a Majority of One, shortly growing to three or four, we're not in a position of voting on a Motion to Vacate,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\n\"At some point, we may very well be, but this is not the time. We are leading in the Presidential Polls by a lot, both Nationally and in the Swing States. Likewise, we are doing well in the Senate, and I believe will do well in the House. But if we show DISUNITY, which will be portrayed as CHAOS, it will negatively affect everything!\"\n\nAfter the House voted to keep him in his job, Johnson said: \"Hopefully this is the end of the personality politics and the frivolous character assassination that has defined the 118th Congress.\"\n\nGreene herself said she was not surprised that the House voted to quash her attempt against Johnson.\n\n\"I think this is exactly what the American people needed to see,\" she said.\n\n\"I didn't run for Congress to come up here and join the Uniparty, and the Uniparty was on full display today. As a matter of fact, [the Republican Party] proved they're ready to do everything with the Democrats.\"\n\nIn a statement explaining why a majority of Democrats voted to keep Johnson in his role, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said: \"Our decision to stop Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene from plunging the House of Representatives and the country into further chaos is rooted in our commitment to solving problems for everyday Americans in a bipartisan manner.\n\n\"We need more common sense and less chaos in Washington, D.C. Marjorie Taylor Greene and the extreme MAGA Republicans are chaos agents. House Democrats are change agents.

Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort Wednesday to remove Mike Johnson as House speaker.\n\nThe vote to table the Rome Republican's motion to vacate was 359 in favor and 43 opposed. Greene and 10 other Republicans voted against the motion to table. So did 32 Democrats, including U.S. Rep. Nikema Williams of Atlanta.\n\nBut the vast majority of House members decided to kill Greene's effort, a resounding rebuke after she railed for weeks against Johnson's leadership.\n\nBoth Republican and Democratic colleagues booed loudly as Greene laid out her case against Johnson during a speech Wednesday afternoon on the House floor. She was interrupted by jeers several times as she spoke.\n\nAlthough Greene knew that her motion to vacate was likely to fail, she said previously that she wanted the vote to happen anyway so voters would know where their lawmakers stood.\n\nAfter the vote, Greene said that the fact that leaders of the Democratic Party, including former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, voted to save Johnson was proof that he was no longer the conservative standard-bearer he promised to be.\n\n\"It's up to Mike Johnson to prove that he's a Republican,\" she said. \"It's up to Mike Johnson to earn back people's trust.\"\n\nBut as she spoke, many Republicans gathered nearby from Greene to criticize her decision to force the vote, saying she was grandstanding while they were trying to govern.\n\n\"It's getting more publicity; it's about raising more money,\" Rep. Rich McCormick, R-Suwanee said. \"This is the problem with something that's about messaging rather than about legislation.\"\n\nFormer President Donald Trump praised Greene's \"spirit\" in a post on his social media site Truth Social, but he wrote that now is not the time to challenge Johnson, whom he called \"a good man who is trying very hard.\"\n\n...continued", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_to_vacate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Motion to vacate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikema_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nikema Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_McCormick", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rich McCormick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://resources.arcamax.com/newspics/288/28853/2885389.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551299", "eventUri": "eng-9551299", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Here's Why His Job Is Far From Safe.", "body": "In a stunning show of unity in the often divided House, Democrats joined a majority of Republicans on Wednesday to save the GOP speaker from an attempt by fellow Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene to remove him from his post.\n\nBut while Democrats in the minority threw the Louisiana congressman a life raft by voting on his side, they made clear they might not do so again. That means the threat for Johnson still lingers as Greene and other lawmakers can at any time call up another motion to oust him.\n\nThe episode highlights the increasingly precarious situation for Johnson, who faces the same conservative forces that took down his predecessor, Kevin McCarthy, but with an even smaller majority that has forced him to continuously rely on Democratic support to carry out the most basic functions of legislating. Republicans control the House by the barest of margins, 217-213.\n\nHere's what to know about how the House can remove a speaker and what's ahead for Johnson:\n\nWHAT IS A MOTION TO VACATE?\n\nThe current rules of the House allow any lawmaker -- Democrat or Republican -- to put forward a resolution declaring the speaker's chair vacant. If the House approves the resolution, it has the effect of ousting the speaker from office.\n\nThe \"motion to vacate\" has existed for most of congressional history. But it had never been deployed successfully until last October when a rebel band of Republicans joined with Democrats to oust McCarthy as speaker.\n\nMcCarthy's removal came, in part, as the result of the concessions he was forced to make to win the speaker's gavel in the first place. Among the concessions was agreeing that a motion to vacate could be triggered by a single member -- the threshold that historically has been the norm, but that had been abandoned by Democrats in the majority.\n\nProponents of allowing a single lawmaker to file the motion said it promotes accountability, noting its long history in the House.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\nAt any point, a member of the House can introduce a privileged resolution -- a designation that gives it priority over other measures -- to declare the office of the speaker of the House of Representatives vacant.\n\nOnce the motion is introduced, the lawmaker sponsoring it can request a vote on the House floor. Such a request forces House leaders to take action within two legislative days.\n\nBut there are procedural motions that members of either party can make to slow or stop the process -- and that's exactly what happened when Greene called for a vote Wednesday on removing Johnson.\n\nThe No. 2 House Republican, Steve Scalise, immediately made a motion to \"table\" Greene's resolution, which defeats it if successful. The vote to table was fast and overwhelming, with lawmakers voting 359-43 to defeat her effort and keep Johnson in the job.\n\nWHO IS TRYING TO OUST JOHNSON AND WHY?\n\nThe speaker had fought for months to navigate an increasingly fractured Republican conference, which has -- in effect -- been operating in the majority in name only since January 2023.\n\nRepublicans unanimously chose Johnson late last year to replace McCarthy after several candidates for the job failed to gain enough support. His conservative bent was seen as a welcome departure by the most extreme members of his party who had accused McCarthy for years of being too moderate.\n\nBut Greene, who became a McCarthy ally late in his tenure, has been skeptical of Johnson's speakership from the beginning. While she criticized her fellow far-right colleagues for toppling McCarthy, she had warned Johnson for months that she would try to remove him in a similar fashion if he were to push ahead with a package to support Ukraine as it battles Russia's invasion.\n\n\"He should not bring funding for Ukraine,\" Greene had told reporters.\n\nBut Johnson did just that last month when he advanced a foreign aid package for Ukraine to the floor where it was overwhelmingly approved and signed into law.\n\nOther Republicans are also critical of Johnson, including Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who was a co-sponsor of Greene's resolution to oust him.\n\nCOULD THERE BE ENOUGH VOTES TO OUST JOHNSON?\n\nIt remains to be seen, but the vote Wednesday showed Johnson's job is far from safe.\n\nWithout Democratic help, Johnson could have easily been ousted. Eleven Republicans voted to proceed with Greene's effort, more than the number of GOP votes it took to oust McCarthy last fall. Seven Democrats voted present and all but 32 of the others voted with Republicans to block the effort to oust him.\n\n\"Our decision to stop Marjorie Taylor Greene from plunging the country into further chaos is rooted in our commitment to solve problems,\" Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said after the vote.\n\nAsked what they might do if there were another attempt to oust the speaker, Jeffries said, \"Haven't given it a thought.\"\n\nSome Republicans are frustrated by the threats to Johnson and were dismissive of Greene. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., said of those trying to remove the speaker, \"They're pretty good at getting attention, but they have not been recognized for their ability to get things done.\"\n\nHe said if they keep pushing to oust the speaker, \"I think you can expect more of the same: Failure.\"\n\nIF JOHNSON IS OUSTED, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN NEXT?\n\nThe speaker of the House, under the rules of the chamber, is required to keep a list of individuals who can act as speaker pro tempore in the event a chair is vacated. The list, which is oddly written by the sitting speaker at any given time, remains with the House clerk and would be made public if the speakership were vacant.\n\nThe first person on that list would be named speaker pro tempore and their first order of business would be to hold an election for a new speaker. The House then would vote as many times as it took to elect a speaker.\n\nIn the case of McCarthy, the role of speaker pro tem fell to his close confidant Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., the chair of the House Financial Services Committee. He was in the role for three weeks, until Johnson's election.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Lisa Mascaro, Kevin Freking and Stephen Groves contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., said of those trying to remove the speaker, \"They're pretty good at getting attention, but they have not been recognized for their ability to get things done.\"\n\nHe said if they keep pushing to oust the speaker, \"I think you can expect more of the same: Failure.\"\n\nIF JOHNSON IS OUSTED, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN NEXT?\n\nThe speaker of the House, under the rules of the chamber, is required to keep a list of individuals who can act as speaker pro tempore in the event a chair is vacated. The list, which is oddly written by the sitting speaker at any given time, remains with the House clerk and would be made public if the speakership were vacant.\n\nThe first person on that list would be named speaker pro tempore and their first order of business would be to hold an election for a new speaker. The House then would vote as many times as it took to elect a speaker.\n\nIn the case of McCarthy, the role of speaker pro tem fell to his close confidant Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., the chair of the House Financial Services Committee. He was in the role for three weeks, until Johnson's election.\n\nAssociated Press writers Lisa Mascaro, Kevin Freking and Stephen Groves contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri":

Late Wednesday, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) surprised her colleagues by going forward with a threat to file a motion to vacate -- that is, a measure to remove Rep. Mike Johnson (R-LA) as speaker of the House. Johnson and Greene had negotiated for a couple of days, and it appeared that Greene might hold off, at least for a while. And then, on Wednesday, she pulled the trigger.\n\nRemoving Johnson would, of course, set off chaos in the House to rival or perhaps exceed the mess made last October when a few rebellious Republicans successfully plotted to remove then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy. Back then, there was no Plan B, and there is no Plan B today.\n\nAs it turned out, Greene failed, winning only 43 votes to the 359 who voted to keep Johnson in place. The vote was widely interpreted as a smackdown to Greene and her style of politics. That's one way to look at it. But the more important lesson of the vote was just how much the crippled Republican House majority, a majority crippled by its own divisions, now depends on Democrats to govern the House.\n\nSubscribe today to the Washington Examiner magazine that will keep you up to date with what's going on in Washington. SUBSCRIBE NOW: Just $1.00 an issue!\n\nBreaking down the vote by party, 196 Republicans and 163 Democrats voted against the measure to remove Johnson. (They voted to table Greene's motion.) But 32 Democrats and 11 Republicans voted to move the motion forward. Filling out the rest, seven Democrats voted present, while 11 Democrats and 10 Republicans did not vote.\n\nThe number to look at is the 11 Republicans. That is more than enough for a rogue faction to remove Johnson in any future vote if Democrats do not step in to save Johnson.\n\nIn last year's vote to remove McCarthy, just eight Republicans voted to get rid of the speaker. They succeeded because 208 Democrats joined them, for a total of 216 votes to oust the speaker. Back then, as today, the process began with a vote on whether to table the motion to remove McCarthy. Eleven Republicans voted against tabling the motion, precisely the same number as voted against tabling the motion to remove Johnson.\n\nThe lesson is that, given the House GOP's tiny majority, if just a few breakaway Republicans want to oust the speaker -- and 11 is plenty -- they can succeed if Democrats go along with them. Last year, Democrats were happy to get rid of McCarthy and throw the House into chaos. This time, with Johnson, they chose not to blow things up. Next time, there's no way to know.\n\nDemocrats did not vote to remove Johnson today because he had just helped pass a top Biden administration priority, the massive aid bill for Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan. But in the future, when Greene or some other GOP rebel moves against Johnson, the situation could be much different. Johnson will be in a precarious position until the 2024 general election.\n\nThen, if Republicans lose control of the House -- and who can argue that they have earned another term in charge? -- there will be no GOP speaker. In that case, perhaps Republicans could spend their time contemplating their errors and dedicating themselves to doing better in the future. Even if Republicans win, it seems unlikely Johnson would remain speaker. But at least Republicans can hope that if they win, their next speaker will not have to depend on Democrats to stay in his job.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "byron_york@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Byron York", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_McCarthy_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kevin McCarthy (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Examiner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington Examiner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Organization_for_Women", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Organization for Women"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://wex-s3.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AP24128731257975.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551299", "eventUri": "eng-9551299", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

I told her last night before she left the floor, let's move on, Marjorie,\" Johnson said Thursday in an interview with \"FOX and Friends.\"\n\nAsked for how Greene responded, Johnson only suggested the two will \"have the opportunity to do it.\"\n\nThe House on Wednesday voted to block an attempt led by Greene to boot Johnson from the Speakership. The final vote was 359-43-7, with 196 Republicans and 163 Democrats choosing to save Johnson.\n\nDemocrats suggested last week they would provide votes to help Johnson, though that could also bring trouble for the Speaker, who is now in the position of being a GOP Speaker propped up by Democrats.\n\nRepublicans broadly criticized Greene's motion, arguing it was an unnecessary diversion that highlighted their internal squabbling.\n\n\"We have serious work do y'all,\" Johnson said. There are two competing visions for the country. We are fighting to save America and preserve its founding principles to get Donald Trump back at the House White House and to win the majority in the Senate and the House for the Republican Party, so that we can fix all of these extreme challenges. We have no time for nonsense. We have to get the job done.\"\n\nGreene threatened to move forward with the motion to vacate against Johnson for weeks, pointing to his decision to bring various bills to the floor that ended up passing with Democratic support, including a spending package to avoid a shutdown and a foreign aid package for Ukraine.\n\nThe two Republicans met for hours earlier this week, in which Greene laid out a list of demands for the Speaker.\n\nWhen asked if he believes Greene is a \"serious legislator\" following their meetings, Johnson said, \"Look, I'm going to let other people judge Marjorie. I've got to work with all my colleagues here. I'm not mad at anybody.\"\n\nJohnson reiterated his appreciation to his colleagues who helped defeat what he called a \"misguided effort.\"\n\n\"I have to do my job.

Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort to oust Speaker Mike Johnson from his leadership post.\n\nThe resounding vote in Johnson's favor - which came with the help of Democrats - brings to an end the most serious challenge to the speakership the Louisiana Republican has faced, at least for now.\n\nAs he navigates a razor-thin majority, the failed ouster effort gives Johnson the opportunity to argue it is time to move on to other issues, though support from Democrats may open him up to more criticism from his right flank.\n\nJohnson spoke briefly with reporters following the vote, calling Greene's campaign against him \"misguided\" and thanking colleagues for a \"show of confidence\" in his leadership.\n\n\"I want to say that I appreciate the show of confidence for my colleagues to defeat this misguided effort,\" he said. \"I've made clear here every day, I intend to do my job, I intend to do what I believe to be the right thing, which I was elected to do. And I'll let the chips fall where they may.\"\n\nGreene had dangled the threat of triggering a vote against the speaker for weeks, a push that reopened bitter divisions within the House GOP conference as many members opposed ousting Johnson.\n\nJohnson was elected speaker last year after conservative hardliners voted to oust former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a historic and unprecedented vote that sparked a tumultuous period of infighting as Republicans struggled to unify around a new leader before eventually coalescing around the Louisiana Republican.\n\nThe House on Wednesday voted to table - or kill - Greene's push to remove Johnson by a tally of 359 to 43. Eleven Republicans voted against tabling.\n\nIn the wake of Johnson's push to pass a major foreign aid package over the objections of hardline conservatives, House Democratic leadership had announced that Democrats would help Johnson keep his job by voting to table.\n\nGreene and Johnson - as well as Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky - met over several days earlier this week, where Greene outlined her concerns with Johnson's leadership and her priorities. The House was on the verge of recessing for the week when Greene pulled up her motion to vacate the chair, which started a two-legislative-day clock for GOP leaders to hold a vote on her measure.\n\nHouse Republicans were completely caught off guard by Greene's decision to trigger her motion, multiple Republican sources told CNN. GOP leadership did not see this coming and thought after the two productive meetings between Johnson and Greene that there was at least more time before any next steps were taken, the sources added.\n\n\"I was shocked,\" GOP Rep. Austin Scott of Georgia told CNN.\n\nCNN's Haley Talbot contributed to this report.\n\nThis story is breaking and has been updated.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Only 11 Republicans voted in favor of moving forward with a vote on ousting Johnson.\n\nGreene's move came roughly three weeks after Johnson pushed through a long-stalled $95 billion national security spending package to aid Israel, Ukraine, and other US allies over the objections of Greene and other right-wing Republicans who staunchly opposed sending additional aid to Ukraine.\n\nBut as she rose on the House floor to bring up her resolution declaring the speakership vacant, Greene appeared to be engaging in a mostly symbolic move. Only two other Republicans, representatives Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Paul Gosar of Arizona, had publicly said they would support the motion, and Democratic leaders had said their members would join an effort to kill any ouster attempt against Johnson.\n\n\"Given a choice between advancing Republican priorities or allying with Democrats to preserve his own personal power, Johnson regularly chooses to ally himself with Democrats,\" Greene said.\n\nShe concluded with the official call for his removal: \"Now, therefore be it resolved that the office of the speaker of the House of Representatives is hereby declared to be vacant.\"\n\nLawmakers widely booed Greene as she called up the resolution and jeered several times as she read it aloud. As she recited the measure, a grievance-laden screed that lasted more than 10 minutes, Republicans lined up on the House floor to shake Johnson's hand and pat him on the back.\n\nIt marked the second time in less than a year that Republicans have sought to depose their own speaker, coming about seven months after GOP rebels made McCarthy the only person in history to have been removed from the post.\n\nAnd Greene had made clear that even if her attempt to depose Johnson were unsuccessful, she still saw value in publicly undermining him.\n\n\"If he remains speaker with\" Democrats' help, she recently wrote on social media, \"he's fully compromised.\"\n\nHer move came after a two-day stretch of meetings this week with Johnson, in which she tried to negotiate a series of demands in exchange for not calling the ouster vote. Among the demands were cutting off all future US aid to Ukraine, defunding the Justice Department, and imposing a 1 percent across-the-board cut on all spending bills if lawmakers are unable to negotiate a deal to fund the government in September.\n\n\"What I'm demanding is simple,\" Greene said Tuesday on Steve Bannon's podcast, War Room. \"We need to act like Republicans. We need to demand control and we need to stop the government from being used for politics.\"\n\nJohnson, for his part, told reporters that he was not negotiating with Greene and Massie. \"Part of the job is taking suggestions and ideas from members, and that's what we're doing,\" he said.\n\nGreene initially filed the motion against Johnson in late March, just as lawmakers were voting on a $1.2 trillion spending bill he pushed through the House over the opposition of the majority of Republicans. She called the move a \"betrayal\" and said she wanted to send the speaker a \"warning,\" then left the threat dangling for weeks.\n\nJohnson plowed ahead anyway, putting together an aid package for Ukraine -- a move Greene previously said was a red line that would prompt her to seek his ouster, but which did not lead her to immediately make good on her threat.\n\n\"I'm actually going to let my colleagues go home and hear from their constituents,\" Greene said following the vote, predicting that Republicans would join her bid to get rid of Johnson after getting an earful from voters irate about the foreign aid bill. Instead, many of them heard just the opposite and returned to Washington voicing skepticism about removing Johnson.\n\nHer move Wednesday paved the way for only the second vote on the House floor in more than 100 years on whether to oust the speaker. When Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida instigated McCarthy's removal in October, such a spectacle had not been seen in the chamber since 1910.\n\nThis time, Greene drew little support for removing Johnson. House Republicans were wary of throwing the chamber into another period of chaos like the one that paralyzed the House for weeks after McCarthy's ouster. Even ultraconservatives like Gaetz expressed uneasiness with firing another speaker, suggesting that the move would risk handing over control of the House to Democrats given Republicans' rapidly narrowing margin of control.\n\nRepresentaive Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the minority leader, who initially hinted in February that Democrats would be inclined to rescue Johnson if he faced a mutiny after moving to send aid to Ukraine, made it official last week in a joint statement with the party's two other top leaders in the House. That was a sharp contrast to October, when Democrats unanimously joined eight hard-right Republicans in voting to oust McCarthy.\n\nJohnson had called Greene's resolution a \"distraction\" at a time when Republicans hold the smallest House majority in US history.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort to remove Speaker Mike Johnson from office", "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hardline Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene tried and failed in sudden action Wednesday to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson, her long-shot effort swiftly and resoundingly rejected by Democrats and Republicans tired of the political chaos.\n\nOne of Donald Trump's biggest supporters in Congress, Greene stood on the House floor and read a long list of \"transgressions\" she said Johnson had committed as speaker. Colleagues booed in protest.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nGreene criticized Johnson's leadership as \"pathetic, weak and unacceptable.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAfter Greene triggered the vote on her motion to vacate the speaker from his office, Republican Majority Leader Steve Scalise quickly countered by calling first for a vote to table it.\n\nAn overwhelming majority, 359-43, kept Johnson in his job, for now.\n\n\"As I've said from the beginning, and I've made clear here every day, I intend to do my job,\" Johnson said afterward. \"And I'll let the chips fall where they may. In my view, that is leadership.\"\n\nIt's the second time in a matter of months that Republicans have worked to oust their own speaker, an unheard of level of party turmoil with a move rarely seen in U.S. history.\n\nThe tally shows the strengths but also the stark limits of Johnson's hold on the gavel, and the risks ahead for any Republican trying to lead the GOP in the Trump era. Without Democratic help, Johnson would have certainly faced a more dismal outcome.\n\nAll told, 11 Republicans voted to proceed with Greene's effort, more than it took to oust then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy last fall, a first in U.S. history. And the threat still lingers -- any single lawmaker can call up the motion to vacate the speaker.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nJohnson said he hoped it \"is the end of the personality politics.\"\n\nAs Greene pressed ahead with the snap vote despite pushback from Republicans at the highest levels, including Trump, GOP lawmakers filtered towards Johnson, giving him pats on the back and grasping his shoulder to assure him of their support.\n\nThe Georgia Republican had vowed weeks ago she would force a vote on the motion to vacate the Republican speaker if he dared to advance a foreign aid package for Ukraine, which was overwhelmingly approved late last month and signed into law.\n\nBut in recent days it seemed her effort had cooled, as she and Johnson met repeatedly for a potential resolution.\n\nJohnson of Louisiana marched on, saying he had been willing to take the risk to approve the foreign aid, believing it was important for the U.S. to back Ukraine against Russia's invasion and explaining he wanted to be on the \"right side of history.\"\n\nIn a highly unusual move, the speaker received a boost from Democrats led by Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, whose leadership team had said it was time to \"turn the page\" on the GOP turmoil and vote to table Greene's resolution -- almost ensuring Johnson's job is saved, for now.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"Our decision to stop Marjorie Taylor Greene from plunging the country into further chaos is rooted in our commitment to solve problems,\" Jeffries said after the vote.\n\nTrump had also weighed in after Johnson trekked to Mar-a-Lago last month for support, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee giving the speaker his nod of approval. And Trump's hand-picked leader at the Republican National Committee urged House Republicans off the move.\n\nAhead of House voting, Trump said on social media, \"I absolutely love Marjorie Taylor Greene,\" but he said Republicans need to be fighting now to defeat Democrats in the November election. He urged Republicans to table Greene's motion.\n\n\"At some point, we may very well be, but this is not the time,\" Trump said, to oust the speaker.\n\nThe move now poses its own political risks for Greene, a high-profile provocateur who has moved to the forefront of the party with her own massive following and proximity to Trump.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nGreene was determined to force her colleagues to be on the record with their vote - putting them in the politically uncomfortable position of backing the speaker and seen as joining forces with Democrats to save him.\n\n\"I'm proud of what I did today,\" Greene said afterward on the Capitol steps.\n\nWhile reporters and camera crews crowded around Greene and ally Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., a group of other Republicans gathered on the steps trying to shift the attention away from her and make their own views known.\n\nRep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., said of those trying to remove the speaker, \"They're pretty good at getting attention, but they have not been recognized for their ability to get things done.\"\n\nHe said if they keep pushing to oust the speaker, \"I think you can expect more of the same: Failure.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nReps. Carlos Gim\u00e9nez, a Florida Republican, said of Greene: \"She doesn't represent the Republican Party. I'm tired of of this being the face or the voice of the party and getting attention. That's all she wants, is the attention.\"\n\nRep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., called for Greene and Massie to be punished for their actions.\n\nHad Democrats not taken the unusual move to help, the vote would most likely have ended differently for Johnson who holds one of the slimmest majorities in the House in modern times, with no votes to spare.\n\nLast year, the House chamber was hurled into chaos when eight Republicans voted to remove McCarthy from the speaker's office and Democrats declined to help save him.\n\nOusting McCarthy resulted in a nearly monthlong search for a new GOP leader, bringing the chamber to a standstill with an episode Republicans wanted to avoid ahead of the November election.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n__\n\nAssociated Press writers Stephen Groves, Mary Clare Jalonick, Michelle Price and Farnoush Amiri contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lisa_mascaro@thestar.com", "name": "Lisa Mascaro", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_to_vacate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Motion to vacate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Scalise", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Scalise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Lawler", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Lawler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusty_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dusty Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Massie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Massie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_A._Gim\u00e9nez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos A.

Here's why his job is far from safe.", "body": "In a stunning show of unity in the often divided House, Democrats joined a majority of Republicans on Wednesday to save the GOP speaker from an attempt by fellow Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene to remove him from his post.\n\nBut while Democrats in the minority threw the Louisiana congressman a life raft by voting on his side, they made clear they might not do so again. That means the threat for Johnson still lingers as Greene and other lawmakers can at any time call up another motion to oust him.\n\nThe episode highlights the increasingly precarious situation for Johnson, who faces the same conservative forces that took down his predecessor, Kevin McCarthy, but with an even smaller majority that has forced him to continuously rely on Democratic support to carry out the most basic functions of legislating. Republicans control the House by the barest of margins, 217-213.\n\nHere's what to know about how the House can remove a speaker and what's ahead for Johnson:\n\nWHAT IS A MOTION TO VACATE?\n\nThe current rules of the House allow any lawmaker -- Democrat or Republican -- to put forward a resolution declaring the speaker's chair vacant. If the House approves the resolution, it has the effect of ousting the speaker from office.\n\nThe \"motion to vacate\" has existed for most of congressional history. But it had never been deployed successfully until last October when a rebel band of Republicans joined with Democrats to oust McCarthy as speaker.\n\nMcCarthy's removal came, in part, as the result of the concessions he was forced to make to win the speaker's gavel in the first place. Among the concessions was agreeing that a motion to vacate could be triggered by a single member -- the threshold that historically has been the norm, but that had been abandoned by Democrats in the majority.\n\nProponents of allowing a single lawmaker to file the motion said it promotes accountability, noting its long history in the House.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\nAt any point, a member of the House can introduce a privileged resolution -- a designation that gives it priority over other measures -- to declare the office of the speaker of the House of Representatives vacant.\n\nOnce the motion is introduced, the lawmaker sponsoring it can request a vote on the House floor. Such a request forces House leaders to take action within two legislative days.\n\nBut there are procedural motions that members of either party can make to slow or stop the process -- and that's exactly what happened when Greene called for a vote Wednesday on removing Johnson.\n\nThe No. 2 House Republican, Steve Scalise, immediately made a motion to \"table\" Greene's resolution, which defeats it if successful. The vote to table was fast and overwhelming, with lawmakers voting 359-43 to defeat her effort and keep Johnson in the job.\n\nWHO IS TRYING TO OUST JOHNSON AND WHY?\n\nThe speaker had fought for months to navigate an increasingly fractured Republican conference, which has -- in effect -- been operating in the majority in name only since January 2023.\n\nRepublicans unanimously chose Johnson late last year to replace McCarthy after several candidates for the job failed to gain enough support. His conservative bent was seen as a welcome departure by the most extreme members of his party who had accused McCarthy for years of being too moderate.\n\nBut Greene, who became a McCarthy ally late in his tenure, has been skeptical of Johnson's speakership from the beginning. While she criticized her fellow far-right colleagues for toppling McCarthy, she had warned Johnson for months that she would try to remove him in a similar fashion if he were to push ahead with a package to support Ukraine as it battles Russia's invasion.\n\n\"He should not bring funding for Ukraine,\" Greene had told reporters.\n\nBut Johnson did just that last month when he advanced a foreign aid package for Ukraine to the floor where it was overwhelmingly approved and signed into law.\n\nOther Republicans are also critical of Johnson, including Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who was a co-sponsor of Greene's resolution to oust him.\n\nCOULD THERE BE ENOUGH VOTES TO OUST JOHNSON?\n\nIt remains to be seen, but the vote Wednesday showed Johnson's job is far from safe.\n\nWithout Democratic help, Johnson could have easily been ousted. Eleven Republicans voted to proceed with Greene's effort, more than the number of GOP votes it took to oust McCarthy last fall. Seven Democrats voted present and all but 32 of the others voted with Republicans to block the effort to oust him.\n\n\"Our decision to stop Marjorie Taylor Greene from plunging the country into further chaos is rooted in our commitment to solve problems,\" Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said after the vote.\n\nAsked what they might do if there were another attempt to oust the speaker, Jeffries said, \"Haven't given it a thought.\"\n\nSome Republicans are frustrated by the threats to Johnson and were dismissive of Greene. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., said of those trying to remove the speaker, \"They're pretty good at getting attention, but they have not been recognized for their ability to get things done.\"\n\nHe said if they keep pushing to oust the speaker, \"I think you can expect more of the same: Failure.\"\n\nIF JOHNSON IS OUSTED, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN NEXT?\n\nThe speaker of the House, under the rules of the chamber, is required to keep a list of individuals who can act as speaker pro tempore in the event a chair is vacated. The list, which is oddly written by the sitting speaker at any given time, remains with the House clerk and would be made public if the speakership were vacant.\n\nThe first person on that list would be named speaker pro tempore and their first order of business would be to hold an election for a new speaker. The House then would vote as many times as it took to elect a speaker.\n\nIn the case of McCarthy, the role of speaker pro tem fell to his close confidant Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., the chair of the House Financial Services Committee. He was in the role for three weeks, until Johnson's election.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Lisa Mascaro, Kevin Freking and Stephen Groves contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort to oust Speaker Mike Johnson, but chaos lingers", "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hardline Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene tried and failed in a brazen push to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson, but the resounding rejection by Republicans and Democrats tired of the turmoil does not guarantee an end to the GOP chaos.\n\nOne of Donald Trump's biggest supporters in Congress, Greene stood on the House floor late Wednesday and read a long list of \"transgressions\" she said Johnson had committed as speaker, from his passage of a $95 billion national security package with aid for Ukraine to his reliance on Democrats wield power.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nColleagues booed in protest. But Greene soldiered on, criticizing Johnson's leadership as \"pathetic, weak and unacceptable.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAfter Greene triggered the vote on her motion to vacate the Republican speaker from his office, Republican Majority Leader Steve Scalise quickly countered by calling first for a vote to table it.\n\nAn overwhelming majority, 359-43, kept Johnson in his job, for now.\n\n\"As I've said from the beginning, and I've made clear here every day, I intend to do my job,\" Johnson said afterward. \"And I'll let the chips fall where they may. In my view, that is leadership.\"\n\nIt's the second time in a matter of months that Republicans have worked to oust their own speaker, an unheard of level of party upheaval with a move rarely seen in U.S. history.\n\nWhile the outcome temporarily calms the latest source of House disruption, the vote tally shows the strengths but also the stark limits of Johnson's hold on the gavel, and the risks ahead for any Republican trying to lead the GOP.\n\nWithout Democratic help, Johnson would have certainly faced a more dismal outcome. All told, 11 Republicans voted to proceed with Greene's effort, more than it took to oust then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy last fall, a first in U.S. history.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBut by relying on Democratic backing, Johnson risks inciting more criticism that he is insufficiently loyal to the party.\n\nAnd the threat still lingers -- any single lawmaker can call up the motion to vacate the speaker.\n\nEven though Trump provided a needed nod of support for Johnson at crucial moments, it's not bankable going forward. The former president posed an idle warning about potentially ousting the speaker as voting was getting underway.\n\n\"At some point, we may very well be, but this is not the time,\" Trump said on social media.\n\nTrump also made clear he still valued Greene, perhaps his biggest ally in the House, even as he rejected her proposal. \"I absolutely love Marjorie Taylor Greene,\" he said as he urged Republicans to table her motion.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAs Greene pressed ahead with the snap vote, GOP lawmakers filtered towards Johnson, giving him pats on the back and grasping his shoulder to assure him of their support.\n\nThe Georgia Republican had vowed weeks ago she would force a vote on the motion to vacate the Republican speaker if he dared to advance the foreign aid package for Ukraine, which was overwhelmingly approved late last month and signed into law.\n\nBut in recent days it seemed her effort had cooled, as she and Johnson met repeatedly for a potential resolution.\n\nJohnson of Louisiana marched on, saying he had been willing to take the risk to approve the foreign aid, believing it was important for the U.S. to back Ukraine against Russia's invasion and explaining he wanted to be on the \"right side of history.\"\n\nHighly unusual, the boost from Democrats led by Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, showed the exhaustion in Congress over the far-right antics. Jeffries and his leadership team had said it was time to \"turn the page\" on the GOP turmoil and vote to table Greene's resolution -- ensuring Johnson's job is saved, for now.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"Our decision to stop Marjorie Taylor Greene from plunging the country into further chaos is rooted in our commitment to solve problems,\" Jeffries said after the vote.\n\nBut Democrats have also made clear their help was for this moment alone, and not a promise of an enduring partnership for Johnson's survival.\n\nAsked about a future motion to vacate the speaker, Jeffries said, \"Haven't given it a thought.\"\n\nThe move now poses its own political risks for Greene, a high-profile provocateur who has moved to the forefront of the party with her own massive following and proximity to Trump.\n\nGreene was determined to force her colleagues to be on the record with their vote - putting them in the politically uncomfortable position of backing the speaker and seen as joining forces with Democrats to save him.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"I'm proud of what I did today,\" Greene said afterward on the Capitol steps.\n\nWhile reporters and camera crews crowded around Greene and ally Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., a group of other Republicans gathered on the steps trying to shift the attention away from her and make their own views known.\n\nRep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., said of those trying to remove the speaker, \"They're pretty good at getting attention, but they have not been recognized for their ability to get things done.\"\n\nHe said if they keep pushing to oust the speaker, \"I think you can expect more of the same: Failure.\"\n\nReps. Carlos Gim\u00e9nez, a Florida Republican, said of Greene: \"She doesn't represent the Republican Party. I'm tired of of this being the face or the voice of the party and getting attention. That's all she wants, is the attention.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nRep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., called for Greene and Massie to be punished for their actions.\n\nHad Democrats not taken the unusual move to help, the vote would most likely have ended differently for Johnson who holds one of the slimmest majorities in the House in modern times, with no votes to spare.\n\nLast year, the House chamber was hurled into chaos when eight Republicans voted to remove McCarthy from the speaker's office and Democrats declined to help save him.\n\nOusting McCarthy resulted in a nearly monthlong search for a new GOP leader, bringing the chamber to a standstill with an episode Republicans wanted to avoid ahead of the November election.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Stephen Groves, Mary Clare Jalonick, Michelle Price and Farnoush Amiri contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lisa_mascaro@thestar.com", "name": "Lisa Mascaro", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_to_vacate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Motion to vacate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Scalise", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Scalise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Lawler", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Lawler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusty_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dusty Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Massie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Massie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_A._Gim\u00e9nez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos A.

Marjorie Taylor Greene suffered a humiliating defeat in Congress yesterday. She seems not to have realized this fact, but thankfully fellow Rep. Jared Moskowitz (FL) was at hand to point it out to her with a handy Wizard of Oz meme.\n\nGreene has been threatening for weeks to force Congress to vote to oust Speaker Mike Johnson. Yesterday, she finally made good on that threat and introduced her motion to vacate the speaker's chair.\n\nHowever, her announcement met with instant boos from across the chamber. The Hill says both Democrats and Republicans jeered Greene.\n\nStay woke with our briefing while staying informed on all things LGBTQ+ entertainment, life, and more!\n\nAs expected, Greene's resolution was quickly tabled. Many Democrats had already indicated that they intended to vote alongside the bulk of Republicans to save Johnson. It was a rare show of support from Democrats for a Republican speaker.\n\nIn the end, only 11 of Greene's Republican colleagues voted with Greene. The chamber voted 359-43-7 to dismiss Greene's motion-to-vacate.\n\nCheck out representatives booing her in the chamber. She retaliates by accusing Democrats and Republicans of uniting as the \"Uniparty\".\n\nJohnson later thanked Representatives for their support.\n\n\"I appreciate the show of confidence from my colleagues to defeat this misguided effort,\" he said. \"That is certainly what it was.\"\n\nGreene's attempt to kick Johnson out was also criticized by Donald Trump. Greene typically shows slavish loyalty to the former President, but on this, they disagreed.\n\n\"I absolutely love Marjorie Taylor Greene. She's got Spirit, she's got Fight, and I believe she'll be around, and on our side, for a long time to come,\" Trump said on Truth Social. \"However, right now Republicans have to be fighting the Radical Left Democrats.\n\nHe added that Republicans were \"not in a position\" to oust Johnson.\n\n\"At some point, we may very well be, but this is not the time.\"\n\nTrump went on to claim that he was ahead in the polls, \"But if we show DISUNITY, which will be portrayed as CHAOS, it will negatively affect everything! Mike Johnson is a good man who is trying very hard.\"\n\nGreene, undeterred, shared footage of colleagues booing her. She said, \"Nancy Pelosi, Hakeem Jeffries, and the rest of the Democrats saved Mike Johnson.\"\n\nMany responded to point out how she had failed and her theatrics had made her irrelevant.\n\nFlorida Democrat Jared Moskowitz went viral with a Wizard of Oz meme comparing Greene to the Wicked Witch of the East, crushed by Dorothy's House. However, in his image, the witch is wearing Donald Trump's tacky gold sneakers, not ruby slippers.\n\nMoskowitz also went viral with another tweet on the surreality of the whole situation. He said he was last night asked to vote to save a speaker he'd never even heard of just a couple of years ago.\n\nGreene filed her motion to vacate against Johnson more than a month ago. Yesterday, she called it to the floor as privileged. This forces the house to debate and vote upon it within two legislative days. However, it didn't even get that far as lawmakers united to table it.\n\nGreene has expressed growing frustration with Johnson in recent months. This largely boils down to his decision to package a government funding bill and his support for a foreign aid package that includes billions of dollars of support to Ukraine.\n\nGreene held hours of meetings with Johnson on Monday and Tuesday to try to come to an agreement to avoid her ousting attempt. On Tuesday, Democrats issued a statement supporting Johnson. Many Dems expressed relief over Johnson supporting the foreign aid package. They also want to avoid the chaos and political paralysis that ensued following Kevin McCarthy's departure as speaker last year.\n\nThe statement from the Democrats enraged Greene. Realizing her plan would likely not succeed, she accused Johnson of cutting a \"slimy backroom deal\" with Democrats to remain in power.\n\nIt wasn't just Democratic representatives such as Moskowitz mocking Greene. Here's GOP Rep. Mike Lawler criticizing \"Moscow Marjorie\" for throwing a \"tantrum.\"", "source": {"uri": "queerty.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Queerty"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_hudson@queerty.com",

She seemed ready to do so yesterday, but went ahead and forced the vote on Wednesday. She was immediately greeted with an audible wave of booing.\n\n\"This is the 'uni-party' for the American people watching,\" Greene said over the groan of boos from the chamber.\n\nTrump responded shortly after Greene brought the motion. \"I absolutely love Marjorie Taylor Greene,\" he wrote on Truth Social before noting that \"right now, Republicans have to be fighting the Radical Left Democrats, and all the Damage they have done to our Country.\"\n\n\"We're not in a position of voting on a Motion to Vacate,\" he added.\n\nGreene had previously filed a motion to vacate in March ahead of a vote for a spending omnibus spending bill, which aimed to prevent a government shutdown. Greene had criticized Johnson as unfit for the role given his willingness to compromise with Democrats to push through legislation.\n\nGreene's desire to oust Johnson as House Speaker intensified after the House passed long-delayed foreign aid for Ukraine and Israel last month, threatening to vacate him from the position if he refused to resign.\n\nGreene has been joined by a few far-right members of the House Freedom Caucus, including Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) who co-sponsored the motion to vacate, but her efforts seemed widely unpopular among Republicans, who spent weeks last year struggling to find a replacement after the previous House Speaker, Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), was ousted by a small group of Republicans.\n\n\"If we vacated this Speaker, we'd end up with a Democrat,\" Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) had previously said. \"When I vacated the last one, I made a promise to the country that we would not end up with the Democrat Speaker. And I was right. I couldn't make that promise again.\"\n\nGreene was interrupted multiple times as she read her motion on Wednesday, either by hecklers who disagreed with the proposal or by cheers from House Democrats when she discussed Johnson's work across the aisle.\n\n\"In a recent interview, [House] Minority leader Hakeem Jeffries said 'even though we're in the minority, we effectively have been governing as if we were in the majority,'\" Greene said, to the cheers of Democrats.", "source": {"uri": "rollingstone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rolling Stone"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeremy_childs@rollingstone.com", "name": "Jeremy Childs", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_Republicans", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Radical Republicans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_to_vacate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Motion to vacate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_shutdowns_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government shutdowns in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnibus_spending_bill", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Omnibus spending bill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Gaetz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matt Gaetz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Caucus", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedom Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Massie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Massie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_leader", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minority leader"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/marjorie-taylor-greene-forcing-vote.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551299", "eventUri": "eng-9551299", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

Marjorie Taylor Greene called Wednesday for a vote to oust Speaker Mike Johnson, pressing ahead with her long-shot effort despite pushback from Republicans at the highest levels tired of the political chaos.\n\nGreene, who is one of Donald Trump's biggest supporters in Congress, stood on the House floor and read a long list of \"transgressions\" she said Johnson had committed as speaker. Colleagues booed in protest.\n\nAlso Read | India Will Offer Alternative To China for Investors With PM Narendra Modi, Mukesh Ambani, Gautam Adani Reshaping Nation to Become Economic Superpower, Reports CNN.\n\nThe vote, which under House rules is required within two days, could happen imminently.\n\nThe Georgia Republican had vowed she would force a vote on the motion to vacate the Republican speaker if he dared to advance a foreign aid package with funds for Ukraine, which was overwhelmingly approved late last month and signed into law.\n\nAlso Read | Israel-Gaza Conflict: Israel Reopens Kerem Shalom Border Crossing for Delivery of Aid to War-Torn Nation.\n\nBut in recent days it seemed her effort had cooled, as she and Johnson met repeatedly for a potential resolution.\n\nJohnson of Louisiana marched on, saying he had been willing to take the risk, believing it was important for the U.S. to back Ukraine against Russia's invasion and explaining he wanted to be on the \"right side of history.\"\n\n\"I just have to do my job every day,\" Johnson said Monday.\n\nIn a highly unusual move, the speaker received a boost from Democrats led by Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, whose leadership team has said it was time to \"turn the page\" on the GOP turmoil and vote to table Greene's resolution -- almost ensuring Johnson's job is saved, for now.\n\nTrump also weighed in after Johnson trekked to Mar-a-Lago for a visit, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee giving the speaker his nod of approval. And Trump's hand-picked leader at the Republican National Committee urged House Republicans off the move.\n\nThe move now poses its own political risks for Greene, R-Ga., a high-profile provocateur.\n\nForcing the vote could bring the House chamber to a standstill, as happened last year when eight Republicans voted to ousted Kevin McCarthy from the speaker's office, and Democrats declined to help save him.\n\nOr it could be over in a matter of minutes, as Democrats join Republicans to table the effort.\n\nOusting McCarthy resulted in a nearly monthlong search for a new GOP leader, and there is no immediate successor if Johnson is removed.

And she certainly doesn't seem to have any concern for the stability of the Congress or the people we represent.\"\n\nGreene stood flanked by fellow Republican Thomas Massie when she made her move against Johnson, criticizing him for a string of compromises with Democrats, who hold a majority in the Senate.\n\n\"Excuses like 'this is just how you have to govern in divided government' are pathetic, weak and unacceptable,\" Greene said of Johnson. \"Even with our razor-thin Republican majority we could have at least secured the border.\"\n\nTaunts and jeers\n\nThe chamber erupted in taunts and cheers at points as Greene read her resolution, with Democrats at times chanting \"Hakeem, Hakeem,\" a reference to their party leader, Hakeem Jeffries, in an echo of the many times they voted for him as speaker during Republicans' multiple rounds of voting for speaker since the current House was seated in January 2021.\n\nJohnson has angered many hardliners by enacting bipartisan spending measures to avoid government shutdowns and aid U.S. allies including Ukraine, without insisting on strict security measures for the U.S.-Mexico border that Democrats reject.\n\nThe House Republicans' border security bill had no chance of passing the Democratic-controlled Senate.\n\nA bipartisan compromise bill negotiated late last year and early this year in the Senate, with the Biden administration's approval, was killed by House and Senate Republicans at Trump's behest.\n\nJohnson could be seen walking around the House floor after Greene began her call on Wednesday for his ouster, with Republican supporters shaking his hand and patting him on the back.\n\n\"Republicans have to be fighting the Radical Left Democrats, and all the Damage they have done to our Country,\" Trump said in his Wednesday post. \"We're not in a position of voting on a Motion to Vacate. At some point, we may very well be, but this is not the time.\"\n\nThe situation has bolstered Jeffries, who agreed to save Johnson from ouster after freeing Congress from the road block of Republican infighting by delivering crucial Democratic support for must-pass bills.\n\nGreene in remarks to reporters after the vote did not rule out trying to oust Johnson again.\n\nFor his part, Jeffries said he hoped to see House Republicans turn against party hardliners, saying, \"The only thing we ask of our House Republican colleagues is for traditional Republicans to further isolate the extreme MAGA Republican wing of the GOP, which has visited nothing but chaos and dysfunction on the American people.\"", "source": {"uri": "westhawaiitoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "West Hawaii Today"},

It's regrettable. It's not who we are as Americans, and we're better than this. We need to get beyond it,\" he added.\n\nPer NBC News:\n\nGreene, who had threatened for weeks to force the issue, dragged her feet as it became clear she didn't have enough support to remove Johnson. Unlike in last year's successful vote to remove former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., many Democrats had made it clear they would vote to save Johnson, especially after he helped stave off a government shutdown, pushed through the renewal of a critical intelligence surveillance spy tool and passed billions of dollars in foreign aid for Ukraine after months of delays.\n\nDuring the last vote series of the week, Greene stood on the floor and announced she was filing a privileged motion to vacate the speaker's chair. Colleagues promptly booed her.\n\n\"It's a new paradigm in Congress. Nancy Pelosi, and most republicans voted to keep Uniparty Speaker Mike Johnson. These are the eleven, including myself, who voted NOT to save him,\" Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) said.\n\n\"Vacating Kevin McCarthy was a huge mistake. Every Democrat voted to vacate him because he fought them tooth and nail. Keeping Mike Johnson is an even bigger mistake. An overwhelming majority of democrats voted to keep him because he's given them everything they want,\" Massie added.\n\nUSA TODAY reports:\n\nThe attempt to oust the speaker lacked support from face of the Republican party and its presumptive 2024 presidential candidate Donald Trump.\" If we show DISUNITY, which will be portrayed as CHAOS, it will negatively affect everything! Mike Johnson is a good man who is trying very hard,\" Trump said on Truth Social.\n\nThe final tally showed 32 Democrats and 11 Republicans voted against tabling the motion; seven members, all Democrats, voted present and 21 members did not vote.\n\nDemocrats who moved to advance Greene's motion, cited reservations about saving the speaker over his key role in efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Democratic lawmakers also took aim at Johnson's conservative credentials such as his anti-abortion views.\n\nRead President Trump's full statement:", "source": {"uri": "en-volve.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "enVolve"}, "authors": [{"uri": "a_m_smith@en-volve.com", "name": "A.M.

Here's why his job is far from safe.", "body": "I agree to the Terms and Conditions, Cookie and Privacy Policies, and CASL agreement.\n\nIn a stunning show of unity in the often divided House, Democrats joined a majority of Republicans on Wednesday to save the GOP speaker from an attempt by fellow Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene to remove him from his post.\n\nBut while Democrats in the minority threw the Louisiana congressman a life raft by voting on his side, they made clear they might not do so again. That means the threat for Johnson still lingers as Greene and other lawmakers can at any time call up another motion to oust him.\n\nThe episode highlights the increasingly precarious situation for Johnson, who faces the same conservative forces that took down his predecessor, Kevin McCarthy, but with an even smaller majority that has forced him to continuously rely on Democratic support to carry out the most basic functions of legislating. Republicans control the House by the barest of margins, 217-213.\n\nHere's what to know about how the House can remove a speaker and what's ahead for Johnson:\n\nWHAT IS A MOTION TO VACATE?\n\nThe current rules of the House allow any lawmaker -- Democrat or Republican -- to put forward a resolution declaring the speaker's chair vacant. If the House approves the resolution, it has the effect of ousting the speaker from office.\n\nThe \"motion to vacate\" has existed for most of congressional history. But it had never been deployed successfully until last October when a rebel band of Republicans joined with Democrats to oust McCarthy as speaker.\n\nMcCarthy's removal came, in part, as the result of the concessions he was forced to make to win the speaker's gavel in the first place. Among the concessions was agreeing that a motion to vacate could be triggered by a single member -- the threshold that historically has been the norm, but that had been abandoned by Democrats in the majority.\n\nProponents of allowing a single lawmaker to file the motion said it promotes accountability, noting its long history in the House.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\nAt any point, a member of the House can introduce a privileged resolution -- a designation that gives it priority over other measures -- to declare the office of the speaker of the House of Representatives vacant.\n\nOnce the motion is introduced, the lawmaker sponsoring it can request a vote on the House floor. Such a request forces House leaders to take action within two legislative days.\n\nBut there are procedural motions that members of either party can make to slow or stop the process -- and that's exactly what happened when Greene called for a vote Wednesday on removing Johnson.\n\nThe No. 2 House Republican, Steve Scalise, immediately made a motion to \"table\" Greene's resolution, which defeats it if successful. The vote to table was fast and overwhelming, with lawmakers voting 359-43 to defeat her effort and keep Johnson in the job.\n\nWHO IS TRYING TO OUST JOHNSON AND WHY?\n\nThe speaker had fought for months to navigate an increasingly fractured Republican conference, which has -- in effect -- been operating in the majority in name only since January 2023.\n\nRepublicans unanimously chose Johnson late last year to replace McCarthy after several candidates for the job failed to gain enough support. His conservative bent was seen as a welcome departure by the most extreme members of his party who had accused McCarthy for years of being too moderate.\n\nBut Greene, who became a McCarthy ally late in his tenure, has been skeptical of Johnson's speakership from the beginning. While she criticized her fellow far-right colleagues for toppling McCarthy, she had warned Johnson for months that she would try to remove him in a similar fashion if he were to push ahead with a package to support Ukraine as it battles Russia's invasion.\n\n\"He should not bring funding for Ukraine,\" Greene had told reporters.\n\nBut Johnson did just that last month when he advanced a foreign aid package for Ukraine to the floor where it was overwhelmingly approved and signed into law.\n\nOther Republicans are also critical of Johnson, including Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who was a co-sponsor of Greene's resolution to oust him.\n\nCOULD THERE BE ENOUGH VOTES TO OUST JOHNSON?\n\nIt remains to be seen, but the vote Wednesday showed Johnson's job is far from safe.\n\nWithout Democratic help, Johnson could have easily been ousted. Eleven Republicans voted to proceed with Greene's effort, more than the number of GOP votes it took to oust McCarthy last fall. Seven Democrats voted present and all but 32 of the others voted with Republicans to block the effort to oust him.\n\n\"Our decision to stop Marjorie Taylor Greene from plunging the country into further chaos is rooted in our commitment to solve problems,\" Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said after the vote.\n\nAsked what they might do if there were another attempt to oust the speaker, Jeffries said, \"Haven't given it a thought.\"\n\nSome Republicans are frustrated by the threats to Johnson and were dismissive of Greene. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., said of those trying to remove the speaker, \"They're pretty good at getting attention, but they have not been recognized for their ability to get things done.\"\n\nHe said if they keep pushing to oust the speaker, \"I think you can expect more of the same: Failure.\"\n\nIF JOHNSON IS OUSTED, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN NEXT?\n\nThe speaker of the House, under the rules of the chamber, is required to keep a list of individuals who can act as speaker pro tempore in the event a chair is vacated. The list, which is oddly written by the sitting speaker at any given time, remains with the House clerk and would be made public if the speakership were vacant.\n\nThe first person on that list would be named speaker pro tempore and their first order of business would be to hold an election for a new speaker. The House then would vote as many times as it took to elect a speaker.\n\nIn the case of McCarthy, the role of speaker pro tem fell to his close confidant Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., the chair of the House Financial Services Committee. He was in the role for three weeks, until Johnson's election.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Lisa Mascaro, Kevin Freking and Stephen Groves contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "winnipegfreepress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Winnipeg Free Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_to_vacate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Motion to vacate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Scalise", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steve Scalise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First-past-the-post voting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliamentary procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusty_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dusty Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_pro_tempore", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President pro tempore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Massie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Massie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Financial_Services", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on Financial Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_tempore", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro tempore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_McHenry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick McHenry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speaker (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Subcultures", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Subcultures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/20240509130532-663d08c86013bbf0db338fb5jpeg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551299", "eventUri": "eng-9551299", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

But why did Democrats as well?", "body": "Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Thomas Massie announced plans to oust Republican speaker.\n\nMike Johnson's path to retain the House speaker's gavel cut through Florida on Wednesday.\n\nJohnson easily thwarted an attempt to oust him filed by far-right Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who convinced just 10 Republicans to support removing the Louisiana Republican. Meanwhile, 163 Democrats joined the 196 Republicans in backing Johnson as he cruised to a 359-43 trouncing of Greene's motion to vacate.\n\nJohnson's W on Capitol Hill enjoyed the support of the Republican who matters most, Florida's Donald Trump.\n\nThe former president and presumptive 2024 Republican presidential nominee, an ideological and political ally of Greene, nonetheless gave Johnson the thumbs-up in two recent visits to Mar-a-Lago, one this past weekend and another last month.\n\n'Moscow' Florida? MTG trolled for opposing foreign aid package. But Florida Republicans also mostly voted no.\n\nWhen Johnson first came under fire from the right-wing of the House GOP caucus earlier this spring, Trump dampened the fire by hosting the Louisiana congressman at Mar-a-Lago.\n\n\"I stand with the speaker, we've had a very good relationship,\" Trump said clearly, if not effusively, during a press conference the two men held at the Palm Beach private club.\n\nHis siding with Johnson, reportedly to stymie more internal GOP friction, was a setback of sorts for Greene, who has been courting MAGA loyalists at political events at Trump's private club.\n\nAll but one member of Florida's House delegation backed Speaker Johnson\n\nJohnson also got the unanimous backing of Florida's House Republican delegation.\n\nThey backed the speaker despite having broken ranks with him in April when two-thirds of the Sunshine State's GOP representatives, 14 in total, voted no on a critical foreign assistance measure for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. That appeared to be a breakwater moment as Greene helped lead the GOP opposition to the legislation, and it was that bill that served as a last straw moment between the speaker and the Georgia Republican.\n\nStill even those who voted against the foreign aid measure backed Johnson.\n\nThat included U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz of Pensacola, who led the campaign to remove the previous speaker, California's Kevin McCarthy. And St. Petersburg's Anna Paulina Luna, a first-term member who has clearly identified with the MAGA faction in the House. And also Laurel Lee of Tampa, who Trump is targeting for defeat in the August primary.\n\nEarly Wednesday evening, South Florida GOP U.S. Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart hailed Johnson's win -- and fired a salvo at Greene, though not by name.\n\n\"This Motion to Vacate vote is nothing more than a patently obvious attempt to seek attention, it will not help achieve any tangible results except media interviews for the proponents,\" the Miami Republican said in a statement. \"Since Speaker Johnson was elected, he has proven remarkably adept at achieving conservative policy wins with the smallest majority in modern times. Time and time again he has earned my respect and deserves the support of every House Republican.\"\n\nAlso backing Johnson were the bulk of Florida's congressional Democrats. Seven of them supported Johnson, with the lone vote against being cast by progressive U.S. Rep. Maxwell Frost of Orlando.\n\nThe votes by the state's Democratic House members to sustain Johnson were not a show of support for him, but a slap at Taylor Greene.\n\n\"I've been clear on a motion to vacate that if Marjorie Taylor Greene, who is someone who wants states to secede from the Union, brings up a motion to vacate I will not support her doing that under any circumstances,\" said

It was easily batted down with a large majority of Democrats voting to dismiss the effort with a final tally of 359-to-43.\n\nWednesday's vote came after weeks of threats from Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who also tried to push Johnson into agreeing to policy demands to stave off the ouster effort. Greene has been incensed over Johnson's reliance on Democratic votes to get must-pass legislation through the chamber instead of relying on what has become a one-vote majority that has been unable to come to agreements to pass critical legislation with a chance of becoming law.\n\nAfter the vote, Johnson said he hoped it was the end of \"personality politics.\"\n\n\"I appreciate the show of confidence from my colleagues to defeat this misguided effort,\" Johnson said after Wednesday's vote. \"As I've said from the beginning and I've made clear here every day, I intend to do my job. I intend to do what I believe to be the right thing, which is what I was elected to do, and I'll let the chips fall where they may. In my view, that is leadership.\"\n\nOnly 11 Republicans voted to allow the motion to move forward toward a vote, with Greene being greeted by boos on the House floor as most lawmakers wanted to avoid a messy process to pick another speaker in an election year. After McCarthy was vacated from the speakership, it took Republicans nearly a month to find a new speaker after multiple candidates were nominated and saw their speakership hopes fizzle out on the House floor.\n\nThere are no clear viable alternatives to Johnson at this point and lawmakers will soon be homed in on the 2024 election that will determine which party holds a majority in the next Congress. They also need to pass a handful of key bills and another budget in the coming months.\n\n\"The bulk of the Republicans or the Democrats aren't really interested in another speaker fight over the next eight months. They've got some big issues they've got to deal with, but more and more the focus of Congress is going to be on the elections in November,\" said David McLennan, a professor of political science and director of the Meredith Poll.\n\nWhile Johnson survived the ouster effort, he is not in an easy situation to navigate moving forward. Democrats were willing to save him during this attempt, but that support may not continue if another motion to vacate, which only takes a single lawmaker to trigger, is offered closer to Election Day.\n\n\"Our decision to stop Marjorie Taylor Greene from plunging the House of Representatives and the country into further chaos is rooted in our commitment to solve problems for everyday Americans in a bipartisan manner,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Wednesday.\n\nWhen asked about a future motion to vacate, Jeffries said he hadn't thought about it.\n\nDemocrats have been able to avoid some GOP policies they oppose from becoming law or being added to must-pass legislation as their votes have been required to pass bills to keep the government open and avoid a shutdown. They also got to vote on a bill providing military aid to Ukraine, long a Democratic priority that was frozen in the House due to Republican opposition.\n\n\"What I think they're counting on is the Republican caucus is so chaotic that they can't put forward a conservative legislative agenda, so Democrats can play their cards, keep Johnson in power, get a few things that they like passed,\" McLennan said. \"They're in almost a no-lose situation with Johnson staying in power and constant infighting among Republicans.\"\n\nAnother dynamic at play is whether former President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee that holds tremendous sway over House politics, will continue to back Johnson as he did with Greene's effort. He encouraged Republican lawmakers to vote against Greene's motion, but also left the door open to installing a new person atop the conference in the future.\n\n\"If we show DISUNITY, which will be portrayed as CHAOS, it will negatively affect everything!\" he wrote on his social media platform, adding that the party is \"not in a position\" to remove the speaker. \"At some point, we may very well be, but this is not the time.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbs6albany.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WRGB"}, "authors": [{"uri": "austin_denean@cbs6albany.com", "name": "Austin Denean", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Speaker (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_to_vacate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Motion to vacate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLennan_County,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "McLennan County, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "McLennan County, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Election Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://cbs6albany.com/resources/media/b0b4c699-85c6-4687-a4b6-372b97941072-large16x9_AP24128731268548.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551299", "eventUri": "eng-9551299", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Thirty-two Democrats voted against the motion to table. Another 196 Republicans backed keeping Johnson as speaker.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Georgia, officially entered a \"motion to vacate\" that she had filed a month ago after Johnson relied on Democratic votes to pass funding measures that kept the federal government from shutting down when not enough Republicans would vote for the measure.\n\nAs Greene read her motion to vacate, the chamber erupted in boos. \"This is the uniparty for the American people watching,\" Greene responded.\n\nShe was repeatedly interrupted.\n\nGreene and her supporters faulted Johnson for using Democrats to pass the appropriations bills, to approve funding for Ukraine's two-year effort to fend off the Russian invasion, and appropriating money to build a new headquarters building for the FBI as well as a long list of other deeds.\n\n\"Speaker Johnson has not lived up to one of his self-imposed tenets,\" Greene said.\n\nJohnson said because of the Republicans narrow majority, which today meant he could only lose single vote to pass legislation with only GOP support, he had no alternative but to negotiate with Democrats. Greene said it was an excuse that is \"pathetic weak and unacceptable.\"\n\nJohnson stood to the side of the chamber with members of his staff during the official reading of Greene's removal resolution. After the vote he shook hands with representatives.\n\nCheck back for more details", "source": {"uri": "nola.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NOLA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_ballard@nola.com", "name": "Mark Ballard", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_to_vacate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motion to vacate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Scalise", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Scalise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Squash", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Squash", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/2b/62b186ba-0cd0-11ef-ae39-f732df77b6e6/663ab112becc2.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551299", "eventUri": "eng-9551299", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Marjorie Taylor Greene made her motion to oust Speaker Mike Johnson privileged on Wednesday evening, prompting a frenzied vote on whether or not to fire him within two legislative days.\n\nThe movement came after four plus hours of meetings this week between Greene and Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and the speaker where they laid out a list of demands for Speaker Mike Johnson.\n\n'Speaker Johnson has not lived up to a single one of his self-imposed tenets,' Greene said.\n\n'I am so done with words,' said Greene on Wednesday, who last week said she would 'absolutely' call up a motion to oust Johnson this week after huddling behind closed doors for hours. 'For me, it's all about action.'\n\nGreene, R-Ga., along with Massie, R-Ky., are insisting the speaker commit to no more funding for Ukraine, among other demands.\n\nJohnson spearheaded a $95 billion foreign policy bill that passed last month with Democrat support authorizing nearly $61 billion to Ukraine, along with billions to Israel and Taiwan.\n\nHe was forced to rely on support from Democrats as he presides over a tiny one-vote majority in the House, and it's challenging to get the unruly GOP conference in line.\n\n'Not another red cent this year,' Massie demanded. 'Which is probably as long as he's going to be speaker if he survives using Democrat votes and motion to vacate assuming that he doesn't come through on some of these suggestions.'\n\nReps. Marjorie Taylor Greene,left, and Thomas Massie, second from right, have laid out a list of demands for Speaker Mike Johnson - and are now holding off on their movement to oust him\n\nOther demands included adhering to the so-called 'Hastert Rule' which means not bringing legislation to the floor that does not have the support of a majority of Republicans.\n\nAnd another is to defund Special Counsel Jack Smith's investigation into former President Donald Trump for 'inciting' the January 6 riot and for his alleged mishandling of classified documents - which the Democratic-led Senate and White House would never agree to.\n\n'You can't make things happen instantly. And we all are aware and understanding of that. So now the ball is in his court, and he's supposed to be reaching out to us, hopefully soon,' Greene said.\n\nIf Congress can't pass all 12 spending bills to fund the government in fiscal year 2025 by September 30, Greene and Massie want a continuing resolution to punt the deadline through the November elections with an automatic one percent cut.\n\nHe 'shacked up with Democrats to get FISA without warrants, to get the minibus passed, and to get the funding for Ukraine,' said Massie. 'It's time for him to come home now.'\n\nGreene, Massie and Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., have signed on to a motion to vacate - but have not made the motion 'privileged' which would force a vote within two legislative days.\n\nDemocrats have already said they would vote to table - or kill - the motion, essentially taking air out of the Republican trio's threat.\n\nStill, Johnson spent close to two hours on Monday and again on Tuesday in his office with his biggest GOP antagonist, Greene.\n\nSome Republicans have questioned why he would negotiate with Greene.\n\n'It's not a negotiation,' he insisted. 'Everybody knows I have lengthy discussions, detailed discussions, on a daily basis with members across the conference.\n\nGreene has increasingly found herself at odds with former President Donald Trump in her crusade against Johnson. Trump has publicly supported the speaker and noted the difficulties of operating under a one-vote majority.\n\nRecent reports came to light of a phone call where Trump told Greene to back off of the ouster. Greene declined to share details on whether the former president is supportive of her motion.\n\nReporters swarm MTG and Massie to see if they will try to kick out Speaker Johnson\n\nGreene, R-Ga., along with Massie, R-Ky., are insisting the speaker commit to no more funding for Ukraine\n\n'I have to tell you, I love President Trump. My conversations with him are fantastic. And again, I'm not going to go into details. You want to know why I'm not insecure about that. And I don't have to go into the details here with you guys.\n\nJust days ago she was dead-set on making her motion to vacate 'privileged' this week - a move that would force a House vote on whether or not to keep Johnson as speaker within two legislative days.\n\nAsked if she would still trigger the motion, Greene said: 'That's up to Mike Johnson.'\n\nMassie said they did not give Johnson a 'timeline' to agree to their demands, but it's pretty short.'\n\n'Next week I am going to be calling this motion to vacate,' Greene declared just last week.\n\n'Absolutely calling it. I can't wait to see Democrats go out and support a Republican speaker and have to go home to their primaries,' she taunted one day after Democrats said they would vote down Green's motion to oust the speaker, deflating her attempt.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Massie", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Massie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_to_vacate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motion to vacate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Smith_(lawyer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jack Smith (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mueller_special_counsel_investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mueller special counsel investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "January 6 United States Capitol attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hastert_Rule", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hastert Rule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Gosar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul Gosar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuing_resolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Continuing resolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Primary election"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/05/07/21/84582079-0-image-a-5_1715114163511.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551299", "eventUri": "eng-9551299", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-06", "textStart": 1967, "textEnd": 1976}, {"amb": false, "date": "-09-30", "textStart": 2399, "textEnd": 2411}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) to oust the GOP leader from the top job.\n\nThe chamber voted 359-43-7 on a motion to table Greene's motion to vacate, preventing the removal resolution from hitting the floor for a vote.\n\nThe final vote -- which was widely expected amid bipartisan opposition to the ouster gambit -- dealt a major blow to Greene, who filed her measure more than a month ago and had threatened to trigger it ever since, all while heaping sharp criticism on the Speaker.\n\nIt means Johnson, who won the gavel in October following the ouster of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), will remain in the top job. But the vote puts him in the precarious position of being a GOP Speaker propped up by Democrats, which could earn him the ire of conservatives.\n\nIn brief remarks delivered shortly after Wednesday's vote, Johnson thanked his colleagues for their support.\n\n\"I appreciate the show of confidence from my colleagues to defeat this misguided effort,\" he said. \"That is certainly what it was.\"\n\n\"As I've said from the beginning and I've made clear every day, I intend to do my job. I intend to do what I believe to be the right thing, which is what I was elected to do, and I'll let the chips fall where they may,\" he continued. \"In my view, that is leadership.\"\n\nGreene filed her motion to vacate Wednesday afternoon, a surprise to some after it appeared that the Georgia Republican was backing off her threat. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.) immediately motioned to table the measure.\n\nThe final vote marked the end -- for now -- of Greene's weeks-long threat to oust Johnson, which began in March and has grown more pronounced since. Greene left open the option of bringing another ouster vote in the future.\n\nThe Georgia Republican filed her motion to vacate more than a month ago when the House was voting on a bill to avert a government shutdown, a move that she described as a warning shot for the Speaker. Her frustrations with Johnson, however, swelled in the weeks after, particularly when he backed a bill to reauthorize the U.S.'s warrantless surveillance authority and spearheaded a foreign aid package that included billions of dollars for Ukraine.\n\nThat anger came to a head last week, when the firebrand announced that she would force a vote on Johnson's ouster this week. Questions, however, swirled regarding whether or not she would follow through after she met with Johnson on Monday and Tuesday and issued a set of demands for the Speaker to stand down on her threat.\n\nBut on Wednesday, she decided to move forward with her maneuver.\n\n\"Weeks ago, when I filed that motion, I filed it and I said this was like a pink slip, and in my mind I was hoping it would serve to be a warning to Mike Johnson and wake him up that this can't be allowed to continue,\" Greene said Wednesday. \"And apparently it didn't' serve to be a wake-up call at all.\"\n\nIn the end, just 10 Republicans joined Greene in opposing the motion to table -- including her two co-sponsors, Reps. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.).\n\nShortly after the vote closed, former President Trump -- who had expressed support for Johnson in recent weeks -- issued a statement that encouraged Republicans to vote in favor of the motion to table, warning that \"disunity\" would hurt the GOP's chances in November, while also expressing support for Greene.\n\n\"[I]f we show DISUNITY, which will be portrayed as CHAOS, it will negatively affect everything!\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"Mike Johnson is a good man who is trying very hard. I also wish certain things were done over the last period of two months, but we will get them done, together. It is my request that Republicans vote for 'THE MOTION TO TABLE.'

We can't get 100% of what we want. And sometimes a handful of my colleagues demand that, and it's just not possible right now. But we're fighting. We're going to get this job done.

She noticed her resolution as \"privileged,\" meaning House leaders had two legislative days to take it up.\n\nMARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE FILES MOTION TO OUST SPEAKER JOHNSON\n\nBut her bluff was called immediately Wednesday when House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., rose to call for a vote on tabling Greene's motion -- which effectively kills it before the vote on Johnson's ouster itself.\n\nGreene's push got two more backers in Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., after Johnson ushered a foreign aid bill along bipartisan lines that includes $61 billion for Ukraine.\n\nJohnson said it was \"unfortunate\" that the vote happened, adding, \"I appreciate the overwhelming show of confidence by my colleagues to defeat that misguided effort.\"\n\nJohnson further emphasized the need for Congress to be functioning in the middle of conflicts.\n\n\"The country desperately needs a functioning Congress. We can't afford the risk of shutting the House down, which is literally what happened last time. Imagine if we closed the House in the middle of hot wars around the globe, when China could move on Taiwan. Iran could fire a nuke at Israel. I mean, anything could happen right now.\"\n\n\"The chaos and confusion do nothing but diminish our chances to save this country and hurt our cause,\" he continued.\n\nJohnson added that Republicans need to stick together, \"moving as a team,\" and said he is confident in Republican victories in November.\n\n\"We're going to grow the majority in November. We're going to take back the Senate, and Donald Trump is going to return to the White House. And when that happens, we will be able to turn this thing 180 degrees.\"\n\nJohnson got overwhelming Democratic and Republican support for the table vote, which passed 359 to 43, averting a vote on Taylor Greene's motion. Just 11 Republicans voted against tabling the measure, along with 32 Democrats.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTaylor Greene declined to say if she planned to force another vote, but accused Johnson of being aligned with Democrats after they helped save his job.\n\n\"That's not something that I've said,\" she said, when asked if she would try a repeat. \"I think today it has proven the uniparty is alive as well.

Marjorie Taylor Greene initiated her motion to vacate House Speaker Mike Johnson Wednesday evening, which the House of Representatives overwhelming struck down.\n\nThe chamber voted to strike down Greene's motion in a 359-43 vote, with just 10 Republicans backing the Georgia representative, NBC News reported. Along with the majority of Republicans, 163 Democrats voted to save Johnson, with seven voting \"present.\"\n\nGreene's motion alleged how Johnson failed to live up to promises to advance the Republican Conference's agenda by instead choosing to \"ally himself with Democrats.\"\n\n\"Whereas, actions are the only thing that matter, and words are meaningless without following through on them. By passing the Democrats' agenda and handcuffing Republicans' ability to influence legislation, our elected Republican Speaker Mike Johnson has aided and abetted the Democrats and the Biden administration in destroying our country,\" the motion stated.\n\n\"Whereas, removing this Uniparty Speaker will not give the Speaker's gavel to the Democrats, which would only happen if Republicans actually vote for Hakeem Jeffries,\" the motion continued. \"In fact, Minority Leader Jeffries, Nancy Pelosi, and other high-ranking Democrats have publicly stated they will save Mike Johnson from a vote to vacate him. In a recent interview, Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said, 'Even though we're in the minority ... We effectively have been governing as if we were in the majority.'\"\n\nGreene initially filed a motion in late March after Johnson brought a $1.2 trillion spending bill to the floor, which the chamber did not take up for a vote. The Georgia representative announced she would file a motion in the coming week during a May 1 press conference.\n\nRepublicans and congressional Democrats have largely disapproved of Greene's motion, indicating they would stand by Johnson. Members of the chamber booed Greene as she made her announcement.\n\nRepublican South Carolina Rep. Nancy Mace responded to the news with a thumbs-down emoji, after previously expressing opposition to Greene's proposed motion.\n\n\"Moscow Marjorie has lost her mind -- clearly the result of a space laser,\" Republican New York Rep. Mike Lawler said. \"This temper tantrum will do nothing to advance the conservative movement and in fact will continue to undermine our House Republican Majority. I will continue to push back against this lunacy and be a voice of sanity in a sea of chaos.\"\n\nGreene accused Johnson, who she referred to as a \"Uniparty Speaker,\" of supporting the funding of liberal policies rather than focusing on the American people.\n\n\"Whereas Speaker Johnson supported fully funding abortion, the trans agenda, the climate agenda, foreign wars, and Biden's border crisis, rather than 'ensuring liberty, opportunity, and security for all Americans,'\" the resolution states.\n\nThe Georgia representative further criticized Johnson for allegedly failing to \"protect the Republican majority\" following the ousting of embattled former New York Rep. George Santos, who Congress voted to expel over a damning House ethics report and criminal charges.\n\nJohnson released a statement last week stating the future motion was \"wrong for the Republican Conference, wrong for the institution, and wrong for the country.\" Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley reportedly attempted to dissuade Greene from filing the motion, according to Politico.\n\nHouse Democratic leadership vowed to help save Johnson in return for helping advance a $95.3 billion foreign aid package, which consisted of $60.8 billion in aid for Ukraine, $15 billion in military aid to Israel with an additional $9 billion for humanitarian aid, and $8 billion for Taiwan.\n\nWhile members of his party criticized the package's lack of border funding, Johnson defended his push to pass the foreign aid package, saying he fulfilled his job by working across the aisle.\n\n\"I have to do my job. We have to do what we believe to be the right thing. What the country needs right now is a functioning Congress. They need a Congress that works well, works together, and does not hamper its own ability to solve these problems,\" said Johnson. \"We saw what happened with the motion to vacate the last time -- Congress was closed for three weeks. No one can afford for that to happen.\"\n\n\"We need people who are [sic] serious about the job here, to continue to do that job and get it done. So, you know, I have to [sic] do what I believe is right every day and let the chips fall where they may. You've heard me say that many times, and will continue to,\" Johnson added.", "source": {"uri": "dailysignal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Signal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

But her effort failed because Democrats decided to reward Johnson for allowing a vote on one of President Joe Biden's top legislative priorities with the Ukraine vote, whereas they had voted to remove McCarthy in October.\n\nIn addition, Greene was unable to create a groundswell of opposition to Johnson among Republicans, who are now hoping to focus on November's election to try to preserve their slim majority.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_house", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lower house"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/118th_United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "118th United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_McCarthy_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin McCarthy (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2F__origami%2Fservice%2Fimage%2Fv2%2Fimages%2Fraw%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%252Fproduction%252Fa20db06d-9646-49f3-8aa7-c187c2691778.jpg%3Fsource%3Dnext-article%26fit%3Dscale-down%26quality%3Dhighest%26width%3D700%26dpr%3D1?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900&overlay=https://www.ft.com/__assets/creatives/x/ft-overlay.png&overlay_height=0.15&overlay_y=30&overlay_gravity=south_east", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551299", "eventUri": "eng-9551299", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

The final vote was 359-43; seven voted present and 21 others didn't cast a vote. (See how your representative voted.)\n\n\"Hopefully, this is the end of the personality politics and the frivolous character assassination that has defined the 118th Congress,\" Johnson said after Wednesday's vote. \"It's regrettable. It's not who we are as Americans and we're better than this. We need to get beyond it.\"\n\nDon't count on it.\n\nJohnson may have survived the vote, but the anger toward him among some Republicans likely won't subside anytime soon.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who offered the motion to vacate, bemoaned the \"uniparty\" that saved the speaker.\n\nPetty squabbles and personal recriminations are nothing new for the House of Representatives. History offers many lessons. But today's divisions -- among the majority party, nonetheless -- seem irreparable.\n\nThe GOP's narrow House majority after the November 2022 election emboldened rank-and-file conservatives to demand much-needed changes. After multiple rounds of voting in January 2023, then-Rep. Kevin McCarthy acquiesced to their requests and secured the votes needed to be speaker.\n\n>>> 20 Lawmakers Stood Up to the Washington Establishment. This is Their Story.\n\nWith any member of the narrowly divided House able to initiate the process of removing the speaker, it was perhaps inventible that Johnson would eventually face the same scenario as McCarthy. And when Johnson opted to rely on Democrats to pass bills, that's precisely what happened.\n\nTo avoid a showdown, Johnson reportedly spent hours meeting with Greene this week, only to have her deliver a fiery floor speech that was met by a chorus of boos and jeers. When she wasn't being interrupted, Greene accused the speaker of selling out his party and turning over House control to Democrats.\n\nSitting by her side, Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., repeatedly came to Greene's aid.\n\nTheir grievances against Johnson include his decision to pass government spending bills with Democrat support, expel embattled New York Republican George Santos from the House, and advance a $95 billion foreign aid bill over the objections of conservatives.\n\nGreene even managed to work in a defense of ousted Speaker McCarthy, whom both she and Massie considered an ally. Hours later, Massie doubled down on their defense of McCarthy by contrasting him as a favorable option to Johnson.\n\nSorry, Mr. Speaker, personality politics reign supreme.\n\nIn reality, Johnson will never know just how many Republicans want to see him gone beyond Greene, Massie, and Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz. That's because before Greene's motion to vacate came to vote, the House opted to table it.\n\nOf the 11 Republicans against motion to table, only a few explained their vote. But it's safe to say not all were aligned with Greene, despite what Massie suggested.\n\nAt least three said not to interpret their opposition as an indication of their feelings toward Johnson.\n\nRep. Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, opposed Greene's motion to vacate even though he joined her on the procedural vote. \"One should not be viewed as a proxy for the other,\" he said.\n\nRep. Victoria Spartz, R-Ind., declared her opposition to Green's motion to vacate but opposed the effort to table it. \"I fought a lot to change Pelosi rules and have more accountability on the speaker in Congress,\" she explained.\n\nAnd finally, Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo., put it bluntly when he said that \"joining Democrats in a motion to table was more than I could stomach.\"\n\nWhile Johnson's critics will continue to complain that Democrats helped save him, more Republicans had his back Wednesday.\n\nSo where does Johnson go from here?\n\nHe most certainly shouldn't let Democrat Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., dictate the chamber's agenda for the next six month. Across the halls of the Capitol, Senate Democrats are already plotting to change the narrative on border security, one of President Joe Biden's greatest vulnerabilities.\n\nA sustained effort by the House to elevate the issue of illegal immigration is needed now more than ever. Republicans took an important step Wednesday to pass the Equal Representation Act, which prevents illegal aliens from influencing congressional representation and the Electoral College.\n\n>>> House Passes Bill to Restore Citizenship Question to Census\n\nThose same lawmakers must redouble their efforts on other fronts, including the strong measures already adopted in the Secure the Border Act (HR 2).\n\nWith only a few must-pass pieces of legislation remaining this Congress, there's precious little time to squander the opportunity.", "source": {"uri": "dailysignal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Signal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rob_bluey@dailysignal.com", "name": "Rob Bluey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_to_vacate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Motion to vacate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_McCarthy_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin McCarthy (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Massie", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Massie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Speaker (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/118th_United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "118th United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Greene's bid to seek retribution by unseating the speaker with a \"motion to vacate\" won support from only two other members of her party: Massie and Representative Paul Gosar.\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday quickly defeated an effort by firebrand Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene to remove fellow Republican Speaker Mike Johnson from his leadership role. Democrats joined Republicans in a 359-43 vote to protect Johnson's speakership, in a bid to avoid a replay of the chaos that followed in October when Republicans ousted his predecessor, Kevin McCarthy.\n\nGreene's move represented a rare Republican defiance of presidential candidate Donald Trump, who had voiced support for Johnson and called the drive to oust him \"unfortunate.\" Standing flanked by fellow Republican Thomas Massie, Greene criticized Johnson for a string of compromises with Democrats, who hold a majority in the Senate.\n\n\"Excuses like 'this is just how you have to govern in divided government' are pathetic, weak and unacceptable,\" Greene said of Johnson. \"Even with our razor-thin Republican majority we could have at least secured the border.\" But the chamber erupted in taunts and cheers at points as Greene read her resolution, with Democrats at times chanting \"Hakeem, Hakeem,\" a reference to their party leader Hakeem Jeffries, in an echo of the many times they voted for him as speaker during Republicans' multiple rounds of voting for speaker since the current House was seated in January 2021.\n\nJohnson has angered many hardliners within his razor-thin 217-213 Republican majority this year, by enacting bipartisan spending measures to avoid government shutdowns and aid U.S. allies including Ukraine, without insisting on strict security measures for the U.S.-Mexico border that Democrats reject. Johnson could be seen walking around the House floor after Greene began her call on Wednesday for his ouster, with Republican supporters shaking his hand and patting him on the back.\n\nThe situation has bolstered Jeffries, who agreed to save Johnson from ouster after freeing Congress from the roadblock of Republican infighting by delivering crucial Democratic support for must-pass bills. Greene's bid to seek retribution by unseating the speaker with a \"motion to vacate\" won support from only two other members of her party: Massie and Representative Paul Gosar.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Massie", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Massie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Gosar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul Gosar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_shutdowns_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government shutdowns in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico\u2013United_States_border", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mexico\u2013United States border"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/19_01_2024_16_34_18_3178457.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551299", "eventUri": "eng-9551299", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga. to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson on Wednesday evening, with Democrats and Republicans banding together to extend a lifeline to the embattled speaker.\n\nThe vote to table the motion was 359-43. Greene, who began threatening the motion to vacate last month, had been negotiating with Johnson for days and as of Tuesday appeared to back away from the threat. But that changed Wednesday afternoon, as she announced plans to move forward with the vote. It was short-lived.\n\nThe effort was widely expected to fail. House Democrats, happy with Johnson's decision to move aid to Ukraine, vowed to protect him from a motion to vacate last week.\n\nGreene's antics had frustrated rank-and-file House Republicans, some of whom worried about the political impact of a GOP embroiled in divisions. Those concerns were shared by former President Donald Trump, who has offered support for Johnson and reportedly pressed Greene to back off on a phone call last week.\n\n\"I will give her this credit. We basically said 'put up or shut up' she put up, and now it's time to shut up,\" Rep. Marc Molinaro, R-N.Y. said Wednesday afternoon.\n\nRep. Austin Scott, R-Ga. was among the scores of Republicans caught off-guard by Greene forcing a snap vote on Johnson. He called Greene's effort \"absolutely counterproductive\" and damaging to Republicans.\n\n\"The place can't function if you're changing the Speaker of the House every six months,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "semafor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "semafor.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Molinaro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marc Molinaro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Scott_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austin Scott (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://img.semafor.com/39eae45716fab81d937bb039d53241922c9351d2-6000x4000.jpg?rect=0,425,6000,3150&w=1200&h=630&q=75&auto=format", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551299", "eventUri": "eng-9551299", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Greene's move represented a rare Republican defiance of presidential candidate Donald Trump, who in a social media post following the House vote on Wednesday, said it was \"not the time\" for Republicans to try to push out their own speaker.\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday swiftly and overwhelmingly defeated an effort by firebrand Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene to remove Speaker Mike Johnson, a fellow Republican, from his leadership role. Democrats joined Republicans in a 359-43 vote to protect Johnson's speakership, in a bid to avoid a replay of the chaos that occurred in October when Republicans ousted his predecessor, Kevin McCarthy.\n\nGreene's move represented a rare Republican defiance of presidential candidate Donald Trump, who in a social media post following the House vote on Wednesday, said it was \"not the time\" for Republicans to try to push out their own speaker. Greene's measure, known as a motion to vacate, showcased the disorder that has marked Republicans' slim 217-213 House majority, particularly since it had been clear that the effort would fail given Democrats' opposition.\n\n\"I appreciate the show of confidence from my colleagues to defeat this misguided effort,\" Johnson, 52, said following the vote. \"Hopefully this is the end of the character assassination that has characterized the current Congress.\" Multiple Republicans criticized Greene's move, including centrist Representative Marc Molinaro.\n\n\"This is not an individual who knows how to lead,\" Molinaro said of Greene. \"She's not an individual who knows how to negotiate. And she certainly doesn't seem to have any concern for the stability of the Congress or the people we represent.\" Greene stood flanked by fellow Republican Thomas Massie when she made her move against Johnson, criticizing him for a string of compromises with Democrats, who hold a majority in the Senate.\n\n\"Excuses like 'this is just how you have to govern in divided government' are pathetic, weak and unacceptable,\" Greene said of Johnson. \"Even with our razor-thin Republican majority we could have at least secured the border.\" TAUNTS AND JEERS\n\nThe chamber erupted in taunts and cheers at points as Greene read her resolution, with Democrats at times chanting \"Hakeem, Hakeem,\" a reference to their party leader, Hakeem Jeffries, in an echo of the many times they voted for him as speaker during Republicans' multiple rounds of voting for speaker since the current House was seated in January 2021. Johnson has angered many hardliners by enacting bipartisan spending measures to avoid government shutdowns and aid U.S. allies including Ukraine, without insisting on strict security measures for the U.S.-Mexico border that Democrats reject.\n\nThe House Republicans' border security bill had no chance of passing the Democratic-controlled Senate. A bipartisan compromise bill negotiated late last year and early this year in the Senate, with the Biden administration's approval, was killed by House and Senate Republicans at Trump's behest.\n\nJohnson could be seen walking around the House floor after Greene began her call on Wednesday for his ouster, with Republican supporters shaking his hand and patting him on the back. \"Republicans have to be fighting the Radical Left Democrats, and all the Damage they have done to our Country,\" Trump said in his Wednesday post. \"We're not in a position of voting on a Motion to Vacate. At some point, we may very well be, but this is not the time.\"\n\nThe situation has bolstered Jeffries, who agreed to save Johnson from ouster after freeing Congress from the road block of Republican infighting by delivering crucial Democratic support for must-pass bills. Greene in remarks to reporters after the vote did not rule out trying to oust Johnson again.\n\nFor his part, Jeffries said he hoped to see House Republicans turn against party hardliners, saying, \"The only thing we ask of our House Republican colleagues is for traditional Republicans to further isolate the extreme MAGA Republican wing of the GOP, which has visited nothing but chaos and dysfunction on the American people.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_McCarthy_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin McCarthy (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Speaker (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Molinaro", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marc Molinaro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Massie", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Massie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico\u2013United_States_border", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mexico\u2013United States border"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Centrism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_Republicans", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Radical Republicans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/27_05_2019_12_10_51_4304562.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551299", "eventUri": "eng-9551299", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) filed the motion to vacate after a speech in which she accused Johnson of failing to defund the Department of Justice in order to stop its lawsuits against Trump.\n\nThe former president praised Greene even as he said that Republicans needed to be unified in his post on Truth Social.\n\n\"I absolutely love Marjorie Taylor Greene. She's got Spirit, she's got Fight, and I believe she'll be around, and on our side, for a long time to come,\" wrote Trump.\n\n\"Mike Johnson is a good man who is trying very hard.\"\n\n\"However, right now, Republicans have to be fighting the Radical Left Democrats, and all the Damage they have done to our Country,\" he added. \"With a Majority of One, shortly growing to three or four, we're not in a position of voting on a Motion to Vacate.

I also wish certain things were done over the last period of two months, but we will get them done, together.\"\n\nHe went on to request Republicans vote to table the motion.\n\nGreene had previously said that she was upset that Johnson had not ended funding that went to Ukraine in its war against Russia's invasion.

Republican Rep.

It's going to sow discord and dissent, and by the way, it's going to fail. She is engaged in a failing act of political theater,\" said Johnson to reporters.\n\n\"What you have here is some of the mainstream members who are the adults, and we're gonna do what adults do,\" he added. \"We're going to ignore the tantrums and instead work to actually govern this country.\"\n\nRep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky was an avid supporter of the motion to remove Johnson, and he issued a bitter critique of the political situation after the vote.\n\n\"Vacating Kevin McCarthy was a huge mistake. Every Democrat voted to vacate him because he fought them tooth and nail,\" Massey said on social media.\n\n\"Keeping Mike Johnson is an even bigger mistake,\" he added. \"An overwhelming majority of democrats voted to keep him because he's given them everything they want.\"\n\nJohnson replaced Kevin McCarthy in October after a campaign that accused the former speaker of being weak and not supportive of Trump enough. Greene had praised the ascension of Johnson and took a selfie with him after the vote was successful.\n\n\"I just voted for Mike Johnson to be our next Speaker of the House!

C. - The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday rejected an effort by Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson in a 359 to 43 vote, with all Ohio's GOP members except Miami County Republican Warren Davidson voting to table her resolution.\n\nDavidson has previously expressed displeasure with Johnson's willingness to reach spending deals with Democrats, telling Fox News in January that voting to approve Johnson as speaker after California's Kevin McCarthy was removed from the job was one of the worst votes he'd cast in his congressional career.\n\nHe was the only Ohioan among 11 Republicans who supported Taylor Greene's effort. The vast majority of Republicans - 196 of them - joined with 163 Democrats to kill her motion to remove Johnson. Thirty-two Democrats voted against tabling it, and 7 Democrats voted \"present.\" All Ohio Democrats voted against Taylor Greene's measure except for Cincinnati's Greg Landsman, who missed the vote.\n\nOther Ohio Republicans argued that removing Johnson would paralyze Congress, as happened last year when Republicans spent weeks selecting a new Speaker after McCarthy was removed.\n\n\"I am proud to be a Conservative Republican,\" U.S. Rep. Max Miller, a Rocky River Republican posted on social media after the vote. \"I am proud to stand with @SpeakerJohnson.\"\n\nChampaign County GOP Rep. Jim Jordan, who unsuccessfully sought the speakership after McCarthy's departure, last week told Fox News it would be a mistake to remove Johnson.\n\n\"We need to be focused on Mike Johnson to stay as our speaker, we need to be focused on the election, which is now six months away,\" said Jordan, who chairs the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nAfter threatening for weeks to trigger a vote to remove Johnson, Taylor Greene brought her effort to the House floor after 5 p.m. Wednesday.\n\nTaylor Greene argued that Johnson should be ousted for failing to live up to his promises to pass conservative legislation, working with Democrats on spending bills, and relying on Democrats' votes on several occasions, among other perceived offenses. She maintained he's \"\"ill equipped to handle the rigors of the job of the speaker of the House.\"\n\n\"Our country is nearly $35 trillion in debt, and about $40 billion are added to the debt every day,\" Greene said on the House of Representatives floor. \"Our border is overrun by illegal invaders and terrorists from over 160 countries. Our people are being killed by the hundreds every single day by fentanyl and Mike Johnson refuses to do anything about about it.\"\n\nAfter the vote, Johnson released a statement that said he appreciates \"the show of confidence from my colleagues to defeat this misguided effort, that is certainly what it was.\n\n\"As I've said from the beginning and I've made clear here every day, I intend to do my job, I intend to do what I believe to be the right thing, which is what I was elected to do, and let the chips fall where they may,\" he continued. \"In my view, that is leadership.\"", "source": {"uri": "cleveland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cleveland"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)",

Mike Johnson (R-La.) out of the speaker's office.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) filed the motion to vacate after a speech in which she\n\naccused Johnson of failing to defund the Department of Justice in order to stop its lawsuits against Trump.\n\nThe former president praised Greene even as he said that Republicans needed to be unified in his\n\npost on Truth Social.\n\n\"I absolutely love Marjorie Taylor Greene. She's got Spirit, she's got Fight, and I believe she'll be around, and on our side, for a long time to come,\" wrote Trump.\n\n\"Mike Johnson is a good man who is trying very hard.\"\n\n\"However, right now, Republicans have to be fighting the Radical Left Democrats, and all the Damage they have done to our Country,\" he added. \"With a Majority of One, shortly growing to three or four, we're not in a position of voting on a Motion to Vacate. At some point, we may very well be, but this is not the time.\"\n\nHe wrote that he was leading in presidential polls and predicted that Republicans would win in the Senate as well as the House.\n\n\"But if we show DISUNITY, which will be portrayed as CHAOS, it will negatively affect everything!\" Trump said. \"Mike Johnson is a good man who is trying very hard. I also wish certain things were done over the last period of two months, but we will get them done, together.\"\n\nHe went on to request Republicans vote to table the motion.\n\nGreene had previously said that she was upset that Johnson had not ended funding that went to Ukraine in its war against Russia's invasion. Only\n\n11 Republicans voted to support the motion.\n\nJohnson had defended himself by responding, \"I'm the most conservative member who has ever held the gavel as speaker, but the reality of our numbers is our challenge.\"\n\n\"A failing act of political theater.\"\n\nAngry Republicans excoriated the effort in an impromptu media briefing outside the Capitol Building. Republican Rep. Dusty Johnson of South Dakota especially derided the motion.\n\n\"We know this motion is not going to do one thing to make America stronger, it's not gonna do one thing to deliver a conservative victory. It's going to sow discord and dissent, and by the way, it's going to fail. She is engaged in a failing act of political theater,\" said Johnson to reporters.\n\n\"What you have here is some of the mainstream members who are the adults, and we're gonna do what adults do,\" he added. \"We're going to ignore the tantrums and instead work to actually govern this country.\"\n\nRep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky was an avid supporter of the motion to remove Johnson, and he issued a bitter critique of the political situation after the vote.\n\n\"Vacating Kevin McCarthy was a huge mistake. Every Democrat voted to vacate him because he fought them tooth and nail,\" Massey said on social media.\n\n-- (@)\n\n\"Keeping Mike Johnson is an even bigger mistake,\" he added. \"An overwhelming majority of democrats voted to keep him because he's given them everything they want.\"\n\nJohnson replaced Kevin McCarthy in October after a campaign that accused the former speaker of being weak and not supportive of Trump enough. Greene had praised the ascension of Johnson and took a selfie with him after the vote was successful.\n\n\"I just voted for Mike Johnson to be our next Speaker of the House! Mike has a conservative voting record and has committed to helping me move important legislation forward,\" she posted at the time.\n\nAfter the vote on Wednesday, she accused him of being the leader of the \"uniparty,\" including Democrats.\n\n\"Tonight, you saw the Uniparty in action. Nancy Pelosi, Hakeem Jeffries, and the rest of the Democrats saved Mike Johnson,\" she said in a pair of messages on social media.\n\nTrump finished his post on Wednesday promising that Republicans would win big and soon.", "source": {"uri": "conservativeangle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brigitte Gabriel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusty_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dusty Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Massie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Massie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_McCarthy_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin McCarthy (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Subcultures", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Subcultures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.theblaze.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=52203062&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C72%2C0%2C9", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551299", "eventUri": "eng-9551299", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

However, right now, the Republicans have to fight the Radical Left Democrats, and all the damage that they cause. we have done to our country.\"\n\n\"With a majority of one, which will soon increase to three or four, we are not in a position to vote on a motion to cancel,\" he added. \"We are well ahead in the presidential polls, both nationally and in the Swing States... If we show DISUNITY, which will be portrayed as CHAOS, it will affect everything negatively!\"\n\nTrump then called Johnson \"a good man who is doing his best,\" before saying he also \"wishes[es] some things have been done in the last two months\" and asking to \"vote for the 'table motion'\" if they want to \"win big\".\n\nNewsweek contacted Greene's office by email Wednesday evening for comment.\n\nAlthough a significant number of Republican lawmakers oppose new aid to Ukraine and other measures Johnson has allowed to pass through Congress, Trump is far from the only Republican to criticize the motion to leave Greene, with many of the congresswoman's colleagues booing her when she made the motion. Wednesday.\n\nRepublican Rep. Kelly Armstrong told CNN's Manu Raju on Wednesday that the motion was \"Congress's version of a tantrum,\" while Republican Congressman Dusty Johnson called it a \"dumpster fire.\" who \"would do nothing to bring about a conservative victory.\" \".\n\nRep. Bob Good, chairman of the right-wing House Freedom Caucus, said Sunday during an appearance on NewsNation's The Hill that Greene was \"not acting in the best interest of [former] President Trump\" by moving forward with the \"six months before the election\" motion.\n\nJohnson has largely been dismissive of Greene's efforts to impeach him, repeatedly insisting that he doesn't spend much time \"thinking\" about the congresswoman and her plans.\n\nUncommon knowledge\n\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common

Marjorie Taylor Greene's push to vacate Mr. Johnson in a 359-43 vote.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) suggested that he's willing to move on from his disagreements with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) after the Georgia Republican failed in her motion to vacate the speaker's chair.\n\nBut even though the measure was defeated, it raises alarm bells for Mr. Johnson's future leadership. Eleven Republicans voted to move forward on the motion -- three more than the number who voted to oust House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) in October.\n\nNevertheless, Mr. Johnson said he's ready to move on from the issue, and hopes he can work with Ms. Greene in the future.\n\n\"I told her last night before we left the floor, 'Let's move on Marjorie. I'm okay with this. Let's move on.\"\n\nAsked how Ms. Greene replied, Mr. Johnson said only, \"I think we'll have an opportunity to do that. We'll see.\"\n\nMs. Greene, for her part, declined to answer a question after the vote on if she would bring the measure up to the floor again later in the Congress.\n\nBut former President Donald Trump, a close ally of Ms. Greene, indicated ahead of the vote on May 8 that he thinks now is \"not the time\" to pursue a motion to vacate against Mr. Johnson.\n\nSpeaking on the broader issue of the motion to vacate, Mr. Johnson called it \"unfortunate\" that the measure was brought to the floor in the first place.\n\n\"I appreciate the overwhelming show of confidence by my colleagues to defeat that misguided effort,\" Mr. Johnson said.\n\nHe also defended himself against allegations made by Ms. Greene about his conduct on a series of recent issues, citing Republicans' slim majority as the reason that conservatives couldn't get as many wins as they'd like.\n\n\"We advance our conservative policies and principles as far as we can here every single day ... in spite of the fact that we have the smallest majority in U.S. history,\" Mr. Johnson said. \"We can't get 100 percent of what we want. And sometimes a handful of my colleagues demand that.\n\n\"It's just not possible right now, but we're fighting.\"\n\nMr. Johnson was also asked about Democrats' help in bailing him out.\n\nThirty-two of the 43 votes in favor of moving forward on the motion came from Democrats, but this represents a small fraction of the Democratic caucus. The overwhelming majority of Democrats voted to prop up Mr. Johnson's speakership -- a fact that distinguishes him from Mr. McCarthy, who received no Democratic support.\n\nAsked why Democrats helped save him, Mr. Johnson replied, \"I think the Democrats believe in the institution and they see exactly what we see, and the American people see: these are dangerous times.\"\n\nHe added, \"The country desperately needs a functioning Congress. We can't afford the risk of shutting the House down.\"\n\nMr. Johnson warned of the disastrous consequences that could result from such a move if China decided to invade Taiwan or Iran fired a nuclear weapon at Israel.\n\n\"We need to be working here everyday,\" he said. \"The chaos and confusion do nothing but diminish our chances to save this country and hurt our cause.\"", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_to_vacate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Motion to vacate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speaker (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Subcultures", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Subcultures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Squash", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Squash", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/03/22/id5612978-FotoJet-OP-1080x720.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551299", "eventUri": "eng-9551299", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 13, "textEnd": 18, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) finally filed her motion to kick out House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) on Wednesday evening. A majority of her House Republican colleagues united with 163 Democrats to help defeat her motion immediately in a 359-43 vote, but not before booing her as she introduced the vote.\n\nBoos erupted on both sides of the House chamber as Greene read her resolution, The Hill reported. After defeating her motion, the chamber's members cheered. Even former President Donald Trump, who Greene deeply admires, said that now is \"not the time\" to kick out the speaker because it \"will be portrayed as chaos\" and negatively affect\" Republicans's chances during an election year.\n\n\"I appreciate the show of confidence from my colleagues to defeat this misguided effort,\" Johnson said after surviving the vote. \"That is certainly what it was.\"\n\nSubscribe to our briefing for insights into how politics impacts the LGBTQ+ community and more.\n\nGreene filed her initial motion to oust the speaker over a month ago. But as soon as she formally introduced it on Wednesday evening, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA) immediately motioned to table her measure, setting up the vote that killed it.\n\nAfter the vote, Democrats noted that their votes weren't an endorsement of Johnson -- an anti-LGBTQ+ Christian nationalist who helped devise Trump's plan to overturn the 2020 election -- but rather a recognition of his successful compromises and willingness to allow votes on must-pass appropriations bills.\n\n\"Our decision to stop Marjorie Taylor Greene from plunging the House of Representatives and the country into further chaos is rooted in our commitment to solve problems for everyday Americans in a bipartisan manner,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) said after the vote. \"We need more commonsense and less chaos in Washington, D.C.\"\n\nGreene filed a surprise motion to oust Johnson because he allowed the House to vote on a $1.2 trillion government funding bill today that included funding for \"trans ideology,\" as she put it. The bill, which largely excluded her and other far-right Republicans' desired anti-LGBTQ+ provisions, cleared the House on March 22 in a 286 -134 vote.\n\nFar-right Reps. Thomas Massie (R-KY) and Paul Gosar (R-AZ) both pledged to support Greene's effort to kick out Johnson, but they were the only Republicans to do so.\n\nEarlier in the week, Greene met with Johnson in an attempt to get him to agree to four conditions to avoid her ouster vote: only bringing bills to a floor vote if they have support from a majority of the GOP conference (something known as the Hastert rule), not passing any additional aid for Ukraine, defunding special counsel investigations against Trump, and cutting national spending by 1%. Johnson didn't agree to any of her conditions.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he was happy to hear that Democrats and Republicans were uniting to defeat Greene. \"I'm relieved as I think all of America is that the chaos in the House will be discontinued,\" he said. \"I think it's a benefit to our country, a benefit to the House, a benefit to the reputation of Congress.\"\n\nRep. Clay Higgins (R-LA) called her move a \"mistake,\" adding, \"To think that one of our Republican colleagues would call for his ouster right now -- it's really, it's abhorrent to me, and I oppose it.\"\n\nRep. Mike Lawler (R-NY) said, \"It's not only idiotic, but it actually does not do anything to advance the conservative movement. And in fact, it undermines the country and our majority.\"", "source": {"uri": "lgbtqnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LGBTQ Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniel_villarreal@lgbtqnation.com",

Marjorie Taylor Greene and Thomas Massie announced plans to oust Republican speaker.\n\nWASHINGTON - Wisconsin's House Republicans say they are tired with interparty fighting and threats from some on the far-right to remove Speaker Mike Johnson.\n\nRep. Scott Fitzgerald told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that the Republican conference is still feeling the effects of former Rep. Kevin McCarthy's ouster from the speakership last October. Rep. Derrick Van Orden has confronted critics of Johnson on the House floor. And Glenn Grothman indicated that removing another House speaker would be \"damaging\" to the party.\n\nAsked this week about Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's threats to force a vote to oust Johnson, Janesville Republican Rep. Bryan Steil said only: \"The whole thing is unproductive.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, all five Wisconsin Republicans voted to kill Greene's motion to remove the speaker after she forced a vote on the floor. Just 11 Republicans and 32 Democrats voted to move forward with a vote to oust Johnson, and the motion was ultimately killed on a 359-43 vote.\n\nThe vote put an end to weeks of public threats from Greene and Republican Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Paul Gosar of Arizona to force a vote to oust Johnson after the speaker helped pass bills funding the government. It also came nearly three weeks after the House passed a $95 billion foreign aid package that included support for Ukraine -- something Greene and others on the GOP's right flank oppose.\n\nJohnson on Wednesday relied on Democrats to save his job as Republicans hold just a one-vote majority in the House. One hundred sixty-three Democrats moved to kill the measure along with 196 Republicans, though Wisconsin's two House Democrats were wary of aiding the rescue.\n\n\"It's their problem,\" Rep. Mark Pocan, who voted \"present\" on the motion to kill the ouster attempt, told the Journal Sentinel this week before the vote. \"They keep having this internal problem because they made the rules. So either I say something is credible about Marjorie Taylor Greene, or I say something is credible about the most homophobic speaker we've ever elected.\"\n\n\"This is just their internal dysfunction,\" he added. \"I'm not part of that caucus, so I shouldn't have to deal with it.\"\n\nRep. Gwen Moore, a Milwaukee Democrat, voted with the majority of the chamber to table the motion. But she suggested earlier in the week that she was not eager to do so.\n\n\"There's no reason, other than to stop the chaos, to vote for Mike Johnson,\" she told the Journal Sentinel. \"He doesn't share the values that I share. There's no logical reason for me to vote for him for speaker. But at the same time, I want this place to run.\"\n\nGreene's attempt to oust Johnson came after she and Massie held several hours-long meetings with the speaker in the Capitol this week. The Georgia Republican gave Johnson a list of demands she wanted met to back off her threats, including that Congress provide no additional funding to Ukraine, move to defund any Justice Department investigations into former President Donald Trump and only put bills on the floor that a majority of Republicans support.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, she called the House to act on her motion to loud boos from her colleagues. \"This is the uni-party for the American people watching,\" she said to jeers in the chamber.\n\nWisconsin's Republicans, meanwhile, have been behind Johnson since he was elected the chamber's leader last year after three weeks of gridlock as Republicans struggled to replace McCarthy, who himself was ousted by a group of far-right Republicans under similar circumstances.\n\n\"I think among the Republican base, Mike is popular and you don't get points in your district for saying I want to kick out Mike,\" Grothman, a Republican from Glenbeulah, told the Journal Sentinel this week. \"Which is why so many of the people you would expect to pile on... they're not piling on, which tells you something.\"\n\nRep. Tom Tiffany said he didn't think it was a \"good approach\" to try to remove Johnson, noting he didn't support ousting McCarthy last October.\n\nOther members have suggested the frequent Republican infighting has hampered the chamber's abilities to get things done.\n\n\"That was three weeks of turmoil that we didn't need,\" Fitzgerald, a Juneau Republican, told the Journal Sentinel last month, referencing McCarthy's ouster. \"It set us back, I think, and we're still recovering from it.\"", "source": {"uri": "jsonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Journal Sentinel"}, "authors": [],

But support from Democrats will open Johnson up to even more criticism from his right flank.\n\nIt's not yet clear how many Republicans will vote against Johnson - the higher the number, the more of a blow it could prove to be to the speaker's standing within the House GOP conference.\n\nGreene has said she will force a vote in the coming days, escalating pressure on Johnson and setting up a major showdown on the House floor. Even if the vote fails, as expected, it still threatens to intensify divisions among House Republicans, who control a razor-thin majority.\n\nMany Republicans oppose the push to oust Johnson and do not want to see the conference devolve into bitter infighting like it did after former Speaker Kevin McCarthy was ousted in a historic and unprecedented vote last year.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "elise_hammond@cnn.com", "name": "Elise Hammond", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Residential", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Residential", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/240410081013-mtg-johnson-split-super-tease.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551299", "eventUri": "eng-9551299", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

The final vote was 359 in favor (196 Republicans and 163 Democrats) to 43 opposed, saving Johnson's speakership.\n\nOnly 11 Republicans and 32 Democrats voted to support Greene's resolution, indirectly proving Greene's point that the speaker is aligned with the \"uniparty\" in Washington.\n\nAmong the things Greene and Massie - who backed her proposal - blamed Johnson for was the expulsion of Congressman George Santos in December. His seat was taken over by a Democrat in a special election. Johnson counted on Democrats to pass the omnibus government funding bill in March and the $61 billion funding package for Ukraine in April; on both occasions, the majority of House Republicans voted against.\n\n\"By passing the Democrats' agenda and handcuffing Republicans' ability to influence legislation, our elected Republican Speaker Mike Johnson has aided and abetted the Democrats and the Biden administration in destroying our country,\" Greene added.\n\nBills that Johnson worked to pass funded all of President Joe Biden and the Democrats' agenda, Greene argued, including the \"deadly border invasion,\" the \"energy-killing Green New Deal climate agenda,\" the \"weaponized\" FBI and the Department of Justice, the \"trans agenda on kids,\" continued full term abortions, and the \"fueling of foreign forever wars.\"\n\nGreene's resolution called Johnson's excuses for these actions \"pathetic, weak, and unacceptable,\" noting that even with a razor-thin majority in the House, the GOP still has the power of the purse.\n\nJohnson also trampled his previous record as a defender of civil liberties to vote against requiring a warrant for FISA spying on Americans, Greene said,

We need to get beyond it,\" he added.\n\nPer NBC News:\n\nGreene, who had threatened for weeks to force the issue, dragged her feet as it became clear she didn't have enough support to remove Johnson. Unlike in last year's successful vote to remove former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., many Democrats had made it clear they would vote to save Johnson, especially after he helped stave off a government shutdown, pushed through the renewal of a critical intelligence surveillance spy tool and passed billions of dollars in foreign aid for Ukraine after months of delays.\n\nDuring the last vote series of the week, Greene stood on the floor and announced she was filing a privileged motion to vacate the speaker's chair. Colleagues promptly booed her.\n\n\"It's a new paradigm in Congress. Nancy Pelosi, and most republicans voted to keep Uniparty Speaker Mike Johnson.

House rules require a vote within 48 hours, although the leadership could move to dismiss the resolution within hours.\n\nGreene, a Trump ally, has two public supporters but none of the broader backing on the right that prompted the removal last year of Johnson's predecessor, Kevin McCarthy.\n\nShe is vowing to plow ahead anyway, as she seeks to make Republicans go on the record about whether they support Johnson.\n\nMany right-wing lawmakers are upset with the speaker for relying on Democratic votes to pursue an agenda they see as a betrayal of their conservative outlook on issues from Ukraine aid to government funding.\n\n\"No Republican speaker should ever share power with the Democrats. American voters gave Republicans in the House the majority for a reason... Mike Johnson must resign or be removed,\" Greene posted on X on Friday.\n\nBut rank-and-file lawmakers are wary of repeating the chaos of McCarthy's removal in a right-wing rebellion that left the House paralyzed for three weeks as they struggled to find a replacement, before finally settling on Johnson.\n\nAnd with the presidential and congressional elections less than six months away, Republicans see threatening Johnson's gavel as divisive and damaging to their prospects of unified control in Washington.\n\nThe voting tally is sure to be scrutinized for what it suggests about Johnson's viability as a Republican leader after November.\n\nSome allies of the speaker fear that his rescue by Democrats could make his position untenable in the long term, although the scale of the pushback against Greene may have stilled their nerves.\n\n\"She's pretty much operating on her own, with one or two others who have expressed support for what she's doing,\" Bob Good, chairman of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, told cable network NewsNation on Sunday.\n\nJohnson condemned the move in an interview on SiriusXM's \"The Laura Coates Show\" on Friday.\n\n\"I think it's wrong for

role.\n\nDemocrats joined Republicans in a 359-43 vote on Wednesday to protect Johnson's speakership, in a bid to avoid a replay of the chaos that followed in October when Republicans ousted his predecessor, Kevin McCarthy.\n\nGreene's move represented a rare Republican defiance of presidential candidate Donald Trump, who had voiced support for Johnson and called the drive to oust him \"unfortunate\".\n\nStanding flanked by fellow Republican Thomas Massie, Greene criticised Johnson for a string of compromises with Democrats, who hold a majority in the Senate.\n\n\"Excuses like 'this is just how you have to govern in divided government' are pathetic, weak and unacceptable,\" Greene said of Johnson. \"Even with our razor-thin Republican majority we could have at least secured the border.\"\n\nBut the chamber erupted in taunts and cheers at points as Greene read her resolution, with Democrats at times chanting \"Hakeem, Hakeem\", a reference to their party leader Hakeem Jeffries, in an echo of the many times they voted for him as Speaker during Republicans' multiple rounds of voting for Speaker since the current House was seated in January 2021.\n\nJohnson has angered many hardliners within his razor-thin 217-213 Republican majority in 2024, by enacting bipartisan spending measures to avoid government shutdowns and aid US allies including Ukraine, without insisting on strict security measures for the US-Mexico border that Democrats reject.\n\nJohnson could be seen walking around the House floor after Greene began her call on Wednesday for his ouster, with Republican supporters shaking his hand and patting him on the back.\n\nThe situation has bolstered Jeffries, who agreed to save Johnson from ouster after freeing Congress from the roadblock of Republican infighting by delivering crucial Democratic support for must-pass bills.\n\nGreene's bid to seek retribution by unseating the speaker with a \"motion to vacate\" won support from only two other members of her party: Massie and Representative Paul Gosar.", "source": {"uri": "perthnow.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Perth Now"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Let's move on,'\" Mr. Johnson said on \"Fox & Friends\" Thursday.\n\nMs. Greene, Georgia Republican, shocked many Wednesday when she brought up the motion to vacate after threatening Mr. Johnson, Louisiana Republican, with it for weeks.

She's got Spirit, she's got Fight, and I believe she'll be around, and on our side, for a long time to come,\" he said.\n\nBut he added that Republicans were \"not in a position\" to oust Johnson.\n\n\"At some point, we may very well be, but this is not the time,\" he said.\n\nThe voting tally is sure to be scrutinized for what it suggests about Johnson's viability as a Republican leader after November.\n\nSome allies of the speaker fear that his rescue by Democrats could make his position untenable in the long term, although the scale of the pushback against Greene may have stilled their nerves.\n\nJohnson condemned the move in an interview on SiriusXM's \"The Laura Coates Show\" on Friday.\n\n\"I think it's wrong for the Republican Party, I think it's wrong for the institution, I think it's wrong for the country,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "urdupoint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UrduPoint"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greene_County,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Greene County, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Greene County, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_McCarthy_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin McCarthy (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_liberties", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil liberties"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://photo-cdn.urdupoint.com/images/UrduPoint-English-22.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551299", "eventUri": "eng-9551299", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) has filed a privileged motion to vacate the chair, forcing the House to vote within two legislative days to eject Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA).\n\nJohnson is expected to immediately move to table - and effectively kill - the motion, a vote which requires a simple majority. Yet House rules do not prohibit Greene, or any other lawmaker, from forcing additional votes, and she and her allies have not tipped their hand as to what they'll do should the motion be killed.\n\nFurther, Johnson's immediate future, despite assurances from Johnson-friendly media outlets, is far from certain. Some Republicans, including those who will vote against ejecting Johnson, may vote against the tabling motion out of principle. Rep. Warren Davidson (R-OH) has announced he would do so, although he has not said how he will vote on the motion to vacate itself.\n\nGreene pulled the trigger Wednesday after almost two months of warnings for Johnson to end his coalition government with Democrats during which the endangered Speaker unleashed a torrent of President Joe Biden's priorities into law.\n\nWhile long anticipated, the motion's inevitability seemed to wane this week as Greene and Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) met Monday and Tuesday with Johnson for a combined three hours to discuss a path forward. The pair proposed four accountability measures to ensure the Speaker would not advance an agenda opposed by a majority of Republicans, including preventing further American funding of Ukraine's faraway war.\n\nJohnson had continued to state he was hearing the duo out and considering their proposals while insisting it was \"not a negotiation.\"\n\nBut Tuesday evening, after complaining (yet again) he had not been getting enough sleep, Johnson appeared to let the veil drop, sneering and rolling his eyes when asked if he would give Greene an answer soon.\n\nJohnson bit his lip and fought back a giggle as off-camera laughter - presumably from reporters - echoed throughout the Capitol's Statuary Hall.\n\nBefore Johnson's insulting outburst, the two conservatives insisted they had offered a path for Johnson to \"come home\" to the Republican Party that had elevated him to the speakership.\n\nBut they insisted they were tired of talk and wanted action from the Speaker.\n\nGreene and Massie reportedly pushed this week for Johnson to fight for inclusion of some conservative priorities - namely defunding the special counsel \"lawfare\" plaguing Trump - into the must-pass Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) reauthorization bill. Johnson had surrendered initiative on the FAA bill to the Senate while the House spent the week considering legislation like the Hands Off Our Home Appliances Act.\n\nInstead, Wednesday afternoon, Johnson unexpectedly scheduled a vote on a one-week FAA extension that would give Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) more time to finalize a deal before the Friday night deadline. Johnson then canceled House votes for the remainder of the week, giving his Members a long weekend while Schumer and his Senate continued toiling.\n\nJohnson's message seemed clear - once again, he would not put up a fight.\n\nNow Johnson, a self-proclaimed \"wartime speaker,\" has a fight on his hands, although its Democrats who are rushing to his side.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) pledged in late April to deliver Johnson the votes to table the motion to vacate, further fueling swirling Capitol Hill rumors that Johnson had made secret concessions with Democrats beyond delivering them their greatest priorities for months.\n\nIn that joint statement announcing their pledge, Jeffries and House Democrat leadership praised Johnson for partnering with a \"bipartisan coalition\" that included Biden and \"traditional Republicans\" to \"[push] back against MAGA extremism\" and unleash tens of billions in aid to Ukraine and Gaza.\n\nJeffries' justification for endorsing the Republican speaker became clear when he stated in a Sunday CBS broadcast that Democrats have controlled the House agenda under Johnson.\n\n\"Even though we're in the minority, we effectively have been governing as if we were in the majority because we continue to provide a majority of the votes necessary to get things done,\" he told CBS. \"Those are just the facts.\"\n\nWhile the boldness of Jeffries' boast was shocking, its substance was not in question, as the CBS presenter acknowledged.\n\nJohnson's standing with Republicans further weakened late Tuesday when Trump signaled approval of Greene's fight against Johnson.\n\nJohnson had been insisting to media for weeks that Trump desired for Greene to hold off. The Speaker used routine photo opps and tepid Trump statements that Johnson was doing a \"good job\" - slim praise from the notoriously verbose president - as justification for Trump's support.\n\nThat justification now seem dubious.\n\nJohnson has steadily marched towards today's vote since the earliest days of his reign when he abandoned House Republicans' work passing individual spending bills and instead passed the first of what turned into three continuing resolutions. Massie has spoken often of Johnson's \"three betrayals,\" specifying Johnson funding Biden's spending policies -- at even higher spending levels than the omnibus bill last passed by Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Schumer, forcing through a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) extension without a requirement to require warrants before spying on Americans, and sending tens of billions of American taxpayers dollars in foreign aid despite securing no progress on border security.\n\nJohnson astonished his colleagues when he reversed his long-held position to cast the deciding vote on the warrant requirement amendment. He also reversed his opposition to additional aid to Ukraine after promising on multiple occasions for months never to move a foreign aid bill without first securing the border.\n\nDespite that record, Johnson told the media he is the \"most conservative\" speaker ever to wield the gavel. Yet days later, he reportedly told high-dollar donors at the swanky Four Seasons in Washington that he supported stripping committee assignments from conservatives who blocked his agenda. He also said he would support changing the rules at the end of this Congress to water down the motion to vacate that currently hangs over his head.\n\nDemocrats have only committed to saving Johnson in an initial motion to table vote. If that vote fails, or Greene forces additional votes, Democrat support is expected to fall off.\n\nThis is a developing story.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

on Wednesday quickly defeated an effort by firebrand Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene to remove fellow Republican Speaker Mike Johnson from his leadership role.\n\nDemocrats joined Republicans in a 359-43 vote to protect Johnson\u2019s speakership, in a bid to avoid a replay of the chaos that followed in October when Republicans ousted his predecessor, Kevin McCarthy.\n\nGreene\u2019s move represented a rare Republican defiance of presidential candidate Donald Trump, who had voiced support for Johnson and called the drive to oust him \u201cunfortunate\u201d.\n\nStanding flanked by fellow Republican Thomas Massie, Greene criticised Johnson for a string of compromises with Democrats, who hold a majority in the Senate.\n\n\u201cExcuses like \u2018this is just how you have to govern in divided government\u2019 are pathetic, weak and unacceptable,\u201d Greene said of Johnson. \u201cEven with our razor-thin Republican majority we could have at least secured the

including Ukraine, without insisting on strict security measures for the US-Mexico border that Democrats reject.\n\nJohnson could be seen walking around the House floor after Greene began her call on

George Santos (R-N.Y.) from the lower chamber, marking the first time in U.S. history that a member has been expelled without a prior conviction for a crime.\n\nMs. Greene also cited his move to pass a 1,000-page, $1.2 trillion government funding package after giving lawmakers less than 72 hours to consider it, as required by internal rules.\n\nThe Georgia Republican also noted that Mr. Johnson's move to pass billions in foreign aid for Ukraine came without any demands on border security, effectively yielding any leverage Republicans had over the issue.\n\nShe also noted Mr. Johnson's crucial vote to kill a warrant requirement for the reauthorization of a controversial surveillance power.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_to_vacate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Motion to vacate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America_First_(policy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "America First (policy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Santos", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Santos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Massie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Massie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_house", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lower house"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/05/07/id5645479-Marjorie-Taylor-Greene-GettyImages-2151362953-1080x720.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551299", "eventUri": "eng-9551299", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-03-08", "textStart": 393, "textEnd": 400}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

As moderate Republicans took the steps, her press secretary lit a cigarette watching them criticise the right-wing firebrand. Her boyfriend Brian Glenn, the host of Right Side Broadcasting Network, came the Hill for votes and seemed excited for the fireworks.\n\n\"I love it, I support it,\" Mr Glenn told The Independent.\n\nIn the end, an overwhelming number of Democrats and Republicans pushed back against Ms Greene. The House voted 359-43 against the Republican congresswoman's ouster attempt, allowing Mr Johnson to stay in his position.\n\n\"I'm proud of what I did today,\" Ms Greene told reporters soon after the defeat. \"And I'm thankful that all of this has been exposed for the American people.\"\n\nAt the same time, Florida Republican Representative Carlos Gim\u00e9nez interrupted her saying \"you're not the Republican Party.\"\n\n\"Because she's an idiot,\" Mr Gim\u00e9nez told The Independent. \"That's all she wants is the attention..\"\n\nMs Greene introduced her motion around 5pm after publicly vowing to do so for the past week. She met with the speaker twice this week alongside one of her few allies, GOP Representative Thomas Massie.\n\n\"We need Republicans that are finally going to stand up and stop this bulls***,\" she told reporters.\n\nThe motion was privileged which meant the House would have been forced to vote within 48 hours. But the vote commenced minutes after Ms Greene finished speaking.\n\nMr Johnson spoke to reporters soon after the vote ended and failed.\n\n\"I appreciate the show of confidence from my colleagues to defeat this misguided effort,\" Mr Johnson said.\n\n\"In this moment, the country desperately needs a functioning Congress,\" he continued. \"That's what the overwhelming majority of the members in this body demonstrated today.\"\n\nDemocrats and some GOP members had vowed earlier this week to save Mr Johnson, making Wednesday's outcome unsurprising.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries defended the decision to save the archconservative Mr Johnson, a staunch ally of former president Donald Trump who worked to overturn the 2020 election results.\n\n\"Our decision to stop Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene from plunging the House of Representatives and the country into further chaos is rooted in our commitment to solving problems for everyday Americans in a bipartisan manner,\" Mr Jeffries said in a statement. \"We need more common sense and less chaos in Washington, D.C.\"\n\nEven Mr Trump came out against the motion.\n\n'With a Majority of One, shortly growing to three or four, we're not in a position of voting on a Motion to Vacate,\" he said on Truth Social. \"At some point, we may very well be, but this is not the time.\"\n\nOnly eleven GOP representatives voted against saving Mr Johnson.\n\n\"It doesn't matter what the rest of the conference feels, they just want everything to be easy and simple for them,\" Ms Greene said after the vote. \"And it's not easy and simple...I think the number 'eleven' should scream loudly to people that pay attention.\"\n\nGOP members lambasted Ms Greene's motion moments after she announced it.\n\n\"It's a gimmick, it's a joke, it's laughable,\" Republican Representative Max Miller of Ohio told reporters. \"We have real work to do.\"\n\n\"It's going to sow discord...and by the way, it's going to fail,\" GOP Congressman Dusty Johnson said on the House steps.\n\nMs Greene first filed her motion after Mr Johnson brokered an agreement with Democrats and the Senate to keep the government open until September. She said she would make her motion privileged after Mr Johnson worked with Democrats to pass a series of foreign aid bills that sent assistance to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.\n\nMs Greene had told The Independent on Tuesday that the speaker has been \"working with Democrats the entire time.\"\n\n\"[The Democrats] are ready to deliver the votes to save his speakership, because they support him because of what he's delivered for the Democrats and the Biden agenda,\" she said.\n\nIn their meetings earlier this week, Ms Greene and Mr Massie gave Mr Johnson a list of demands. The pair asked Mr Johnson to block future aid to Ukraine, as well as defund Special Counsel Jack Smith's probes into former president Donald Trump and that only bills that had the support of the majority of the House GOP conference receive a vote.\n\nThese asks were largely symbolic because the Senate and President Joe Biden would most likely have blocked them.\n\nDemocrats were also deeply critical of Ms Greene on Tuesday, before she filed the motion.\n\nThe other side levelled similar criticisms on Tuesday while it was still unclear when Ms Greene would bring her motion.\n\n\"I can just speak for our side -- we're gonna be the side that wants to get s**t done, we'll be united, we'll deliver the votes,\" Democratic Representative Eric Swalwell told The Independent.\n\nMr Johnson, a GOP representative from Louisiana, became speaker in October 2023. He won the leadership position after 22 days of turmoil in the House following the removal of former speaker Kevin McCarthy.\n\nMs Greene has been promising for weeks to bring the motion to vacate against the speaker. At a press conference, she blasted work between Mr Johnson and Mr Jeffries as a culmination of the \"uniparty\" and held up a hat brandished with \"MUGA\".\n\n\"The uniparty is 'Make Ukraine Great Again,'\" Ms Greene said on 1 May. \"The uniparty is about funding every single foreign war. They think this is the business model that needs to be done.\"\n\nBut in a sign of how the divide within the GOP would not subside soon, Mr Gim\u00e9nez and Ms Greene's spokesman Nick Dyer got into an argument about whether Ms Greene filed her motion for attention or for the good of the country.", "source": {"uri": "nz.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_A._Gim\u00e9nez", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carlos A.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, his job secured only after House Democrats turned out in force to put an end to the GOP chaos, for now.\n\nBut the oversized role Trump played in propping up Johnson cannot be understated - or relied upon to save the speaker again.\n\nIn fact, the indicted former president who has been known to flip his friends into foes warned that while Republicans shouldn't be voting to remove Johnson, \"At some point, we may very well be, but this is not the time.\"\n\nThe outcome puts on display the fragility of the unexpected but strategically beneficial alliance that Trump and Johnson have formed ahead of the November election when both hope to be returned to power - the Republican president in the White House and the loyal foot soldier in Congress.\n\n\"Seems like they're on the same page, and I think that's great,\" said lawyer Cleta Mitchell, who was a key figure in Trump's efforts to challenge the 2020 election.\n\nJohnson has worked diligently to align himself with the former president, the conservative Christian setting aside his once critical views of the presidential contender to present himself as a chief implementer of the Trump Republican Party's Make America Great Again agenda on Capitol Hill.\n\nBarely six months on the job, since Johnson replaced the ousted then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy, the new leader has dashed multiple times to Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort, securing crucial support, including at a glitzy Republican National Committee gala this past weekend.\n\nWhen Trump invited Johnson to the stage to say a few words, the speaker praised the former president as the \"strongman\" the country needs in the White House. Trump and Johnson are cordial, according to a person with knowledge of their relationship, and granted anonymity to discuss it.\n\n\"He's doing a great job,\" Trump said alongside Johnson after another visit last month, ahead of the House vote to approve a national security package with Ukraine funding that Greene warned would lead to a vote on Johnson's ouster.\n\nIn return for his seal of approval, Trump is increasingly able to rely on the speaker's high-profile standing to legitimize his relentless attacks on the U.S. election process, the judicial system and the multiple criminal cases against him, including the federal indictment for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election ahead of the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack.\n\n\"All these cases need to be dropped,\" says Johnson, a constitutional lawyer, who as the House speaker is second in the line of presidential succession. \"President Trump has done nothing wrong. ... It has to stop.\"\n\nTrump is already pre-emptively contesting the 2024 election as potentially rigged before the first ballots are cast, and Johnson, who helped lead legal challenges to Joe Biden's 2020 election victory, is in a powerful position to again question the legitimacy of the outcome.\n\nAsked this week if he believed the 2020 election was legitimate and if he would stand by the new state-certified results this fall, Johnson shook his head in frustration, and demurred. \"What we're talking about today is the 2024 election, nobody can go back and relitigate what happened in 2020,\" he said.\n\nThe joint venture between Trump and Johnson was in clear focus Wednesday ahead of the House action when the speaker, flanked on the Capitol steps by a who's who of the former president's advisers, announced new legislation that would require proof of citizenship before Americans are eligible to vote.\n\nJohnson had promised Trump a voting-citizenship bill during one of the Mar-a-Lago visits, and the unveiling of it alongside Stephen Miller, the architect of Trump's hardline immigration policies, and others showed just how embedded the former president's Make America Great Again movement has become in the House speaker's agenda.\n\nElection experts said there is scant evidence that non-citizens vote in U.S. elections, and past reviews including one pursued by the Trump administration have not produced significant cases of wrongdoing.\n\nNevertheless, Johnson and the others argued without proof that immigrants are being brought into the U.S. to illegally vote. The legislation can be seen as groundwork for the challenges Trump may pose in the aftermath of the November election.\n\n\"If this bill does not become law, then Joe Biden and Democrats will have engineered one of the greatest interferences in any democratic nation in the history of the world,\" Miller said outside the Capitol.\n\nStill, the legislative push did not placate Greene, who hours later tried and failed to remove the speaker from office.\n\nColleagues booed in protest. An overwhelming majority, 359-43, kept Johnson in his job, for now.\n\n\"I'm proud of what I did today,\" Greene said afterward on the Capitol steps.\n\nIt's the second time in a matter of months that Republicans have worked to oust their own speaker, an unheard of level of party upheaval with a move rarely seen in U.S. history.\n\nWithout Democratic help, Johnson would have certainly faced a more dismal outcome. All told, 196 and 163 Democrats voted to table Greene's motion. But 11 Republicans voted to proceed with the effort, more than it took to remove McCarthy last fall, a first in U.S. history.\n\nDemocrats have also made clear their help was for this moment alone, and not a promise of an enduring partnership for Johnson's survival.\n\n\"Our decision to stop Marjorie Taylor Greene from plunging the country into further chaos is rooted in our commitment to solve problems,\" said Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., after the vote.\n\n\"The only thing we ask of our House Republican colleagues is for traditional Republicans to further isolate the extreme MAGA Republican wing of the GOP,\" said Jeffries, who is in line to become speaker if Democrats win control of the House in the fall. \"We need more common sense and less chaos.\"\n\nAsked about a future motion to vacate the speaker, Jeffries said, \"Haven't given it a thought.\"\n\nBy relying on Democratic backing, Johnson risks inciting more criticism that he is insufficiently loyal to the party.\n\nAnd the threat still lingers - any single lawmaker can call up the motion to vacate the speaker.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Kevin Freking, Michelle Price, Stephen Groves, Mary Clare

In the end 163 Democrats joined Republicans in a 359-43 vote to dismiss the resolution.\n\nGreene, a fervent Trump ally, had two public supporters but none of the broader backing on the right that prompted the removal last year of Johnson's predecessor, Kevin McCarthy.\n\nShe plowed ahead anyway, seeking to make Republicans go on the record about whether they support Johnson.\n\nMany right-wing lawmakers are upset with the speaker for relying on Democratic votes to pursue an agenda they see as a betrayal of their conservative outlook on issues from Ukraine aid to government funding.\n\nBut rank-and-file lawmakers in both parties were wary of repeating the chaos of McCarthy's removal, which left the House paralyzed for three weeks as they struggled to find a replacement.\n\nAnd with the presidential and congressional elections less than six months away, Republicans see threatening Johnson's gavel as divisive and damaging to their prospects of unified control in Washington.\n\nTrump praised Greene in an effusive statement released on his Truth Social platform after the vote.\n\n\"I love Marjorie Taylor Greene.

Seven people were absent.\n\nRepublican Johnson was hoping to avoid a politically fraught outcome in which he would keep his job, but only after relying on Democrats who have pledged their support to save him, at least this time.\n\nGreene, a top ally of Donald Trump, faces her own potentially embarrassing setback if her motion to vacate the speaker fizzles, as is expected.\n\nGreene outlined four demands -- including no more funding for Ukraine as it fights Russia and an end to the Justice Department special counsel's legal cases against the indicted former president, Trump.\n\nJohnson has tried to portray himself, six months on the job since the ouster of then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy, as in control of the situation, and not beholden to the hard-right forces that have created chaos throughout this session of Congress.", "source": {"uri": "fox5atlanta.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 5 Atlanta"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_to_vacate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motion to vacate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_McCarthy_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin McCarthy (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Sustainability", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Sustainability", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tea", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tea", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox5atlanta.com/www.fox5atlanta.com/content/uploads/2024/05/1280/720/3cb6f74f-snapshot.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551299", "eventUri": "eng-9551299", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Marjorie Taylor Greene says she never promised further votes to oust Speaker Mike Johnson from his leadership post if lawmakers tabled her motion to vacate the chair.\n\nMs. Taylor Greene, Georgia Republican, standing next to Rep. Thomas Massie, Kentucky Republican, told reporters this when asked whether she planned additional motions to vacate the chair until she was successful.\n\n\"That's not something that I've said. I think, today has proven the uni-party is alive and well and the Democrats now control Speaker Johnson,\" she said after the House voted to kill her motion on a 359-43 vote.\n\n\"That was something that everybody's suspected all along,\" she added. Democrats \"just voted to save him. And I think that's the message that is being told.\"\n\nMr. Massie, who supported Ms. Greene's effort, previously told reporters that he did not see a need to try to vacate the chair again if their effort failed.\n\nBut he reserved the option to try again if Mr. Johnson supported other issues he found appalling such as resettling refugees from the Middle East in the U.S. or pushing an omnibus spending package.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump weighed in Wednesday night on the attempt to oust Mr. Johnson, saying that Ms. Greene has \"spirit\" and \"fight\" and that he \"absolutely loves\" her. But he said Republicans must fight the \"Radical Left\" and are \"not in a position of voting on a Motion to Vacate.\"\n\nHe added, \"At some point, we may very well be, but this is not the time.\"\n\nThe former president called Mr. Johnson a good man who is \"trying very hard\" and said Republicans should vote to table Ms. Greene's motion.\n\nMs. Greene said she was thankful for Mr. Trump's support.\n\n\"I support him. But he also said in that statement that we may have to vacate,\" she said.\n\n\"I've talked to him every day about\" the motion to vacate, she said. \"You know something? You know what President Trump needs? He needs Republican members that will fight for him.\"\n\nMs. Greene and Mr. Massie met with Mr. Johnson over the last two days to discuss ways to avoid this vote.\n\nThe first demand being that they wanted bills brought to the floor that are supported by the majority of the majority. The second demand was no more funding for Ukraine in its war with Russia.\n\nThe third demand was Mr. Massie's plan for a 1% budget cut stop to be included in the next stop-gap budget measure to fund the government. The final demand was to defund the prosecutions against Mr. Trump.\n\nMs. Greene said that Mr. Johnson told both of them it would be too much of a heavy lift to meet their demands, and Mr. Massie told reporters that the speaker dragged his feet.\n\n\"He asked for a day and we gave him a day and he asked for another day and we gave him another day. And he didn't come out and endorse those four ideas,\" Mr. Massie said. \"He was always working on it and always had another question. And at some point, we felt that he was just dragging this out.\"\n\nIn the final vote, 163 Democrats voted not to take the speaker's gavel from Mr. Johnson. Ten Republicans voted with Ms. Greene to oust Mr. Johnson.\n\nAfter the vote, Mr. Johnson called the motion \"misguided.\"\n\nHe said he appreciated the show of confidence from the 196 Republicans, the vast majority of the conference, who voted to table the motion.\n\n\"Hopefully, this is the end of the personality politics and the frivolous character assassination that has defined 118th Congress,\" Mr. Johnson said. \"It's regrettable.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., and Thomas Massie, R-Ky., to force a House-wide on Speaker Mike Johnson's ouster.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., appeared to catch most Congressional watchers by surprise when she moved to force a vote on her motion to vacate the chair, the procedural move which would allow for the vote. She noticed her resolution as \"privileged,\" meaning House leaders had two legislative days to take it up.\n\nBut her bluff was called immediately when House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., rose to call for a vote on tabling Greene's motion - which effectively kills it before the vote on Johnson's ouster itself.\n\nJohnson got overwhelming Democratic and Republican support for the table vote, which passed 359 to 43, averting a vote on her motion. Just 11 Republicans voted against tabling the measure, along with 32 Democrats.\n\nOn the Republican side, Johnson won the support of 196 members, while 163 Democrats also voted to shield him.\n\nThe House GOP side of the chamber erupted in cheers when her move was squashed.\n\nMARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE FILES MOTION TO OUST SPEAKER JOHNSON\n\nGreene, R-Ga., has been threatening to force a vote on taking Johnson's gavel since late March in protest of his handling of government funding and foreign aid. .\n\nHer resolution, known as a motion to vacate the chair, will now have to be voted on or tabled after Greene noticed it as \"privileged\" on Wednesday night - meaning House leaders have two legislative days to take it up.\n\nThe Republican side of the House chamber erupted in boos as Greene listed off her gripes against Johnson, prompting Democrat Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tenn., to shout, \"The House is not in order - and is about to fall into chaos,\" prompting some sparse laughs from their side of the chamber.\n\nThe vote is expected to be close but ultimately fail, with both Republicans and Democrats voicing opposition to a move that would effectively paralyze Congress until a new speaker is found.\n\nThe vote is a culmination of six months' worth of frustration from the most right-wing conservatives in Johnson's conference, who have felt sidelined by him on nearly all critical legislation including foreign aid and government funding, during which they demanded he leverage a government shutdown to force the Democrats who controlled the Senate and White House to pass Republican policies.\n\nHOUSE DEMS SAY THEY'LL BLOCK MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE FROM OUSTING SPEAKER JOHNSON\n\nGreene's push got two more backers in Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., after Johnson ushered a foreign aid bill along bipartisan lines that includes $61 billion for Ukraine.\n\nBut it's largely fallen flat among the House GOP, where even Johnson's critics have shown little appetite for going through another three weeks of chaos like what followed the ouster of ex-Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., in October - particularly six months out from an election.\n\nWith just a razor-thin majority of two seats, it would take little dissent for Johnson to lose the top House job if it fell along party lines. Eight House Republicans had voted with all Democrats to oust McCarthy in early October.\n\nUnlike McCarthy's case, however, House Democrats have pledged to come to Johnson's aid by voting to table the resolution if it came up - a vote to table a measure, which essentially kills it, is a procedural hurdle that allows Democrats to block Johnson's ouster without having to actually vote on whether to fire him.\n\nJohnson's critics seized on the left-wing support as evidence that the Louisiana Republican was not representing the interests of his own party.\n\nMARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE CALLS JOHNSON'S FOREIGN AID PACKAGE HIS '3RD BETRAYAL' OF AMERICAN PEOPLE\n\n\"The entire Democrat Party is lining up behind Mike Johnson. First, it was the entire leadership team for the Democrats. Now, Nancy Pelosi, who impeached President Trump TWICE, has given Johnson her seal of approval. What deal has been made??\" Greene wrote on X on Monday along with a video of Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., backing House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries' decision to help Johnson.\n\nThe move could save Johnson's job, but could also cost him some Republican support.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMassie told Fox News Digital last week when asked about how much GOP backing he expected, \"I think it's a kinetic situation. And Hakeem and the entire Democrat leadership team endorsing Mike Johnson is going to cause a lot of people who weren't with us, to be with us.\"\n\nJohnson, for his part, has repeatedly told reporters that he's not afraid of Greene's threats and has insisted his focus is on governing.", "source": {"uri": "foxwilmington.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "foxwilmington.com"}, "authors":

Democrats joined Republicans in a 359-43 vote to protect Johnson's speakership, in a bid to avoid a replay of the chaos that occurred in October when Republicans ousted his predecessor, Kevin McCarthy.\n\nGreene's move represented a rare Republican defiance of presidential candidate Donald Trump, who in a social media post on Wednesday said it was \"not the time\" for Republicans to try to push out their own speaker. \"I appreciate the show of confidence from my colleagues to defeat this misguided effort,\" Johnson said following the vote. \"Hopefully this is the end of the character assassination that has characterized the current Congress.\"\n\nEarlier, standing flanked by fellow Republican Thomas Massie, Greene criticized Johnson for a string of compromises with Democrats, who hold a majority in the Senate. \"Excuses like 'this is just how you have to govern in divided government' are pathetic, weak and unacceptable,\" Greene said of Johnson. \"Even with our razor-thin Republican majority we could have at least secured the border.\"\n\nBut the chamber erupted in taunts and cheers at points as Greene read her resolution, with Democrats at times chanting \"Hakeem, Hakeem,\" a reference to their party leader Hakeem Jeffries, in an echo of the many times they voted for him as speaker during Republicans' multiple rounds of voting for speaker since the current House was seated in January 2021. Johnson has angered many hardliners within his thin 217-213 Republican majority this year, by enacting bipartisan spending measures to avoid government shutdowns and aid U.S. allies including Ukraine, without insisting on strict security measures for the U.S.-Mexico border that Democrats reject.\n\nJohnson could be seen walking around the House floor after Greene began her call on Wednesday for his ouster, with Republican supporters shaking his hand and patting him on the back. \"Republicans have to be fighting the Radical Left Democrats, and all the Damage they have done to our Country,\" Trump said in his Wednesday post. \"We're not in a position of voting on a Motion to Vacate.

Mike Johnson, R-La., when he was elected speaker of the House.\n\nBut almost seven months later, the five Democratic representatives joined majorities in both parties to block the removal of Johnson. If that effort had been successful, it would have again halted all business in the lower chamber of Congress just months away from an election.\n\nFor weeks, U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., threatened a motion to vacate the speaker, which would have been the second attempt by a member to do so in less than a year. She argued Johnson repeatedly gave Democrats what they wanted over GOP priorities \"to preserve his own personal power.\"\n\nOn Wednesday night, Greene followed through on her threat and made it a privileged motion to force lawmakers to act on it in two days. But within the hour, the House voted, 359-43, to kill Greene's effort. Only 11 Republicans and 32 Democrats voted to allow the Georgia Republican's resolution on removal to move forward.\n\nAmong those supporting Johnson were the entire Connecticut delegation: John Larson, D-1st District; Joe Courtney, D-2nd District; Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd District; Jim Himes, D-4th District; and Jahana Hayes, D-5th District.\n\nWith the looming prospect of another motion to vacate, Democrats appeared more willing to help save Johnson's job after they joined a small group of Republicans in removing then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., last October.\n\nDemocratic leadership ultimately decided to support Johnson if a motion to vacate was triggered again, citing his willingness to move forward on a massive foreign aid package that had been stalled for months. Congress passed the bill last month with aid for Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan and humanitarian efforts in Gaza.\n\nConnecticut lawmakers have cited concerns about Johnson's record and continue to point out the ideological differences they have with him on abortion rights, LGBTQ+ rights and efforts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\n[House Speaker Mike Johnson's record is concerning, CT reps say]\n\nBut they were willing to back Johnson after he followed through on allowing a vote on foreign aid that had been hitting more resistance within the Republican Party, particularly over more aid for Ukraine to counter Russia's ongoing invasion.\n\n\"I agree with Speaker Mike Johnson on almost nothing. However, I have much respect for his decision to collaborate with the Democratic caucus to pass a strong bipartisan funding package and critical aid for our Ukrainian allies,\" Himes said in a statement.\n\n\"He should not be removed from his position for standing up to the radical extremists of his party and choosing duty over chaos,\" he added.\n\nBefore the vote in October, Congress last voted on a motion to vacate more than a century ago. No House speaker had previously been removed through such a resolution until McCarthy's ouster.\n\nFor three weeks after McCarthy was pushed out, the House was effectively at an unprecedented standstill. Business and votes in legislation were frozen until lawmakers elected a new speaker.\n\nAfter Republicans failed to coalesce around a few candidates, they ultimately backed Johnson three weeks later.\n\nMembers in both parties said they did not want the House to plunge back into chaos when they have little time left, since Congress is out of session more during an election year.\n\n\"Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene called up her motion to declare the office of the speaker of the House vacant. I have a long list of things I would like to vote on to improve the lives of my constituents but today, once again, I voted on a motion to table,\" Hayes said.\n\n\"Being in the majority is a tremendous responsibility that my Republican colleagues just have not seemed to accept,\" she added.\n\nConnecticut GOP candidate George Logan, who is seeking a rematch against Hayes in November, has also been opposed to GOP efforts to remove the speaker. Republican supporters of Johnson feared it would be another distraction for the party as they fight to keep their slim majority in the House.\n\nAfter the vote, Logan tweeted that he was \"grateful\" the motion was tabled and shared a photo of him with the speaker during Johnson's visit to Connecticut.\n\nIn a sign that Republicans will focus on trying to flip the 5th District, Johnson campaigned and headlined a fundraiser for Logan in March. Logan narrowly lost to Hayes in the 2022 election and is expected to once again become the Republican nominee.\n\n[Fundraising picks up in CT's 5th District with national attention]\n\n\"Efforts to remove Mike Johnson are reckless and irresponsible. These efforts only serve to destroy any chance of delivering the change that Americans so desperately need,\" Logan said.\n\n\"With a failing economy, a border crisis, and chaos in the international stage, now is the time for real leadership. Now is NOT the time for further chaos and division,\" he added. \"I am proud to stand with Speaker Mike Johnson.\"", "source": {"uri": "ctmirror.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "The CT Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lisa_hagen@ctmirror.org", "name": "Lisa Hagen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_to_vacate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Motion to vacate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jahana_Hayes", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jahana Hayes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_congressional_apportionment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States congressional apportionment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Himes", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jim Himes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_B._Larson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John B.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, his job secured only after House Democrats turned out in force to put an end to the GOP chaos, for now.\n\nBut the oversized role Trump played in propping up Johnson cannot be understated -- or relied upon to save the speaker again.\n\nIn fact, the indicted former president who has been known to flip his friends into foes warned that while Republicans shouldn't be voting to remove Johnson, \"At some point, we may very well be, but this is not the time.\"\n\nThe outcome puts on display the fragility of the unexpected but strategically beneficial alliance that Trump and Johnson have formed ahead of the November election when both hope to be returned to power -- the Republican president in the White House and the loyal foot soldier in Congress.\n\n\"Seems like they're on the same page, and I think that's great,\" said lawyer Cleta Mitchell, who was a key figure in Trump's efforts to challenge the 2020 election.\n\nJohnson has worked diligently to align himself with the former president, the conservative Christian setting aside his once critical views of the presidential contender to present himself as a chief implementer of the Trump Republican Party's Make America Great Again agenda on Capitol Hill.\n\nBarely six months on the job, since Johnson replaced the ousted then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy, the new leader has dashed multiple times to Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort, securing crucial support, including at a glitzy Republican National Committee gala this past weekend.\n\nWhen Trump invited Johnson to the stage to say a few words, the speaker praised the former president as the \"strongman\" the country needs in the White House. Trump and Johnson are cordial, according to a person with knowledge of their relationship, and granted anonymity to discuss it.\n\n\"He's doing a great job,\" Trump said alongside Johnson after another visit last month, ahead of the House vote to approve a national security package with Ukraine funding that Greene warned would lead to a vote on Johnson's ouster.\n\nIn return for his seal of approval, Trump is increasingly able to rely on the speaker's high-profile standing to legitimize his relentless attacks on the U.S. election process, the judicial system and the multiple criminal cases against him, including the federal indictment for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election ahead of the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack.\n\n\"All these cases need to be dropped,\" says Johnson, a constitutional lawyer, who as the House speaker is second in the line of presidential succession. \"President Trump has done nothing wrong. ... It has to stop.\"\n\nTrump is already pre-emptively contesting the 2024 election as potentially rigged before the first ballots are cast, and Johnson, who helped lead legal challenges to Joe Biden's 2020 election victory, is in a powerful position to again question the legitimacy of the outcome.\n\nAsked this week if he believed the 2020 election was legitimate and if he would stand by the new state-certified results this fall, Johnson shook his head in frustration, and demurred. \"What we're talking about today is the 2024 election, nobody can go back and relitigate what happened in 2020,\" he said.\n\nThe joint venture between Trump and Johnson was in clear focus Wednesday ahead of the House action when the speaker, flanked on the Capitol steps by a who's who of the former president's advisers, announced new legislation that would require proof of citizenship before Americans are eligible to vote.\n\nJohnson had promised Trump a voting-citizenship bill during one of the Mar-a-Lago visits, and the unveiling of it alongside Stephen Miller, the architect of Trump's hardline immigration policies, and others showed just how embedded the former president's Make America Great Again movement has become in the House speaker's agenda.\n\nElection experts said there is scant evidence that non-citizens vote in U.S. elections, and past reviews including one pursued by the Trump administration have not produced significant cases of wrongdoing.\n\nNevertheless, Johnson and the others argued without proof that immigrants are being brought into the U.S. to illegally vote. The legislation can be seen as groundwork for the challenges Trump may pose in the aftermath of the November election.\n\n\"If this bill does not become law, then Joe Biden and Democrats will have engineered one of the greatest interferences in any democratic nation in the history of the world,\" Miller said outside the Capitol.\n\nStill, the legislative push did not placate Greene, who hours later tried and failed to remove the speaker from office.\n\nColleagues booed in protest. An overwhelming majority, 359-43, kept Johnson in his job, for now.\n\n\"I'm proud of what I did today,\" Greene said afterward on the Capitol steps.\n\nIt's the second time in a matter of months that Republicans have worked to oust their own speaker, an unheard of level of party upheaval with a move rarely seen in U.S. history.\n\nWithout Democratic help, Johnson would have certainly faced a more dismal outcome. All told, 196 and 163 Democrats voted to table Greene's motion. But 11 Republicans voted to proceed with the effort, more than it took to remove McCarthy last fall, a first in U.S. history.\n\nDemocrats have also made clear their help was for this moment alone, and not a promise of an enduring partnership for Johnson's survival.\n\n\"Our decision to stop Marjorie Taylor Greene from plunging the country into further chaos is rooted in our commitment to solve problems,\" said Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., after the vote.\n\n\"The only thing we ask of our House Republican colleagues is for traditional Republicans to further isolate the extreme MAGA Republican wing of the GOP,\" said Jeffries, who is in line to become speaker if Democrats win control of the House in the fall. \"We need more common sense and less chaos.\"\n\nAsked about a future motion to vacate the speaker, Jeffries said, \"Haven't given it a thought.\"\n\nBy relying on Democratic backing, Johnson risks inciting more criticism that he is insufficiently loyal to the

Marjorie Taylor Greene, thanks to support from Democrats.\n\nGreene's Wednesday afternoon motion to vacate Johnson's office failed to gain traction beyond a handful of votes, marking a significant setback for the controversial congresswoman. Despite Greene's efforts to rally support for her resolution, it was swiftly blocked after House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, also of Louisiana, moved to table the motion, garnering overwhelming support from fellow Republicans and Democrats.\n\nThe failed ouster attempt comes after two days of closed-door discussions between Greene and Johnson, during which Greene laid out her demands. While Greene's resolution was framed as a response to Johnson's bipartisan approach, Democrats largely praised the speaker for his recent actions, particularly his role in passing a $95 billion aid package for Ukraine. However, Johnson's critics, including some within his own party, have raised concerns about his ability to effectively lead amidst mounting internal divisions.\n\nGreene ignited controversy with her motion to oust Johnson, alleging \"UniParty\" collusion between establishment Republicans and Democrats. Greene's Wednesday evening maneuver, delivered amidst a charged atmosphere on the House floor, shone a light on deep divisions within the GOP.\n\n\"Mr. Speaker, I seek recognition to give notice of my intent to raise a question of the privileges of the House,\" Greene declared, her voice cutting through the din of boos and heckles from fellow Republicans. \"The form of the resolution is as follows, declaring the office of Speaker of the House of Representatives to be vacant.

In the end 163 Democrats joined Republicans in a 359-43 vote to dismiss the resolution.\n\nGreene, a fervent Trump ally, had two public supporters but none of the broader backing on the right that prompted the removal last year of Johnson's predecessor, Kevin McCarthy.\n\nShe plowed ahead anyway, seeking to make Republicans go on the record about whether they support Johnson.\n\nMany right-wing lawmakers are upset with the speaker for relying on Democratic votes to pursue an agenda they see as a betrayal of their conservative outlook on issues from Ukraine aid to government funding.\n\nBut rank-and-file lawmakers in both parties were wary of repeating the chaos of McCarthy's removal in a right-wing rebellion that left the House paralyzed for three weeks as they struggled to find a replacement.\n\nAnd with the presidential and congressional elections less than six months away, Republicans see threatening Johnson's gavel as divisive and damaging to their prospects of unified control in Washington.\n\nTrump praised Greene in an effusive statement released on his Truth Social platform after the vote.\n\n\"I absolutely love Marjorie Taylor Greene.

Marjorie Taylor Greene triggers legislation to remove Speaker Johnson from office", "body": "WASHINGTON (TND) -- The House of Representatives swiftly voted down far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort to remove Speaker of the House Mike Johnson from the speakership, voting 359-43 to table the ouster motion.\n\nOverwhelming majorities of both Republicans and Democrats voted to permanently delay the motion, with 196 Republicans and 163 Democrats voting to prevent a return to the abject chaos the House saw in October after former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy was removed from the podium, becoming the first House leader in U.S. history to be forcibly removed from the top job.\n\nGreene triggered the vote Wednesday afternoon, attempting to bring about the next step in a parliamentary procedure she began weeks ago.\n\nShe filed a motion to vacate the chair against Johnson, who was elected Speaker in late October following McCarthy's ouster by the same procedure, in late March after the House successfully passed a $1.2 trillion spending package to avert a government shutdown. In echoes of Rep. Matt Gaetz's, R-Fla., professed rationale for ousting McCarthy, Greene said that Johnson had betrayed conservative principles and the House Republican Conference by agreeing to such a large spending bill and relying on Democratic votes to pass the legislation.\n\n\"No Republican in good conscience can vote for the uniparty minibus. This is not a Republican bill,\" she wrote in a post on X, formerly Twitter. \"It is a Chuck Schumer, Democrat-controlled bill coming from the \"Republican-controlled\" House. The Speaker of the House should not bring it to the floor.\"\n\nGreene gained support in the intervening weeks from a pair of fellow far-right House members, Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., after Johnson brought long-delayed foreign aid funding to support Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan to the House floor over the objection of many conservatives in his conference.\n\n\"Our border cannot be an afterthought. We need a Speaker who puts America first rather than bending to the reckless demands of the warmongers, neocons, and the military-industrial complex making billions from a costly and endless war half a world away,\" Gosar said in a statement to The Hill.\n\nGreene threatened to bring her ouster resolution to the floor last Wednesday but had been meeting with Johnson earlier this week in what were believed to be negotiations over her scrapping the motion to vacate. In an explanation of her terms on Steve Bannon's \"War Room\" podcast Tuesday, she claimed she was demanding a rule change that would prevent the speaker from bringing any legislation to the House floor that did not have the support of a majority of his conference -- what is known as the Hastert Rule -- as well as a bevy of far-right political priorities. Those included a guarantee for no further funding for Ukraine and the immediate defunding -- and de facto end -- of Special Counsel Jack Smith's continued investigations and prosecutions of former President Donald Trump.\n\n\"This is what people all over the country are screaming for,\" Greene said on Bannon's podcast. \"They want to see this vote.\"\n\nMany of Greene's colleagues in Congress did not, if not apparent from the bipartisan opposition that emerged in recent weeks to the chorus of boos from around the House chamber that accompanied Greene's triggering of the privileged revolution (meaning the House had to consider it immediately).\n\nWhile some of her fellow Republicans expressed anonymous yet forceful disdain for her plot -- one telling Axios her ouster attempt was \"very disruptive\" -- some of the most vocal opposition came from across the aisle as House Democratic leadership moved last week to offer their full support of the speaker (in this context).\n\n\"We will vote to table Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's Motion to Vacate the Chair. If she invokes the motion, it will not succeed,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., Minority Whip Katherine Clark, D-Mass., and Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., said in a statement.\n\n\"We want to turn the page. We don't want to turn the clock back and allow Marjorie Taylor Greene to control the schedule and the calendar of what's ahead,\" Aguilar said at a news conference last Wednesday.\n\nFor now, both parties in the House have agreed to turn that page.", "source": {"uri": "cbs12.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WPEC"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jackson_sinnenberg@cbs12.com", "name": "Jackson

Marjorie Taylor Greene's attempt to oust him.\n\nThe majority of Democrats and Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday saved far-right Speaker Mike Johnson from Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's attempt to oust him after less than seven months in the leadership position.\n\nJohnson's (R-La.) election to the role in October -- following the ouster of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), who then left Congress early -- was seen as a signal of the MAGA flank's hold on the Republican Party. However, since then he has faced criticism from Greene (R-Ga.) and others for, among other things, not shutting down the government.\n\nGreene delivered on her threatened motion to vacate -- provoking boos from fellow lawmakers -- after meeting with Johnson for hours on Monday and Tuesday. The final vote to table her resolution was 359-43, with 196 Republicans and 163 Democrats backing the far-right speaker. Seven Democrats voted present and 21 lawmakers did not vote.\n\nTen Republicans joined Greene in trying to give Johnson the boot: Reps. Andy Biggs (Ariz.), Eric Burlison (Mo.), Eli Crane (Ariz.), Warren Davidson (Ohio), Paul Gosar (Ariz.), Thomas Massie (Ky.), Alex Mooney (W.Va.), Barry Moore (Ala.), Chip Roy (Texas), and Victoria Spartz (Ind.).\n\nAddressing the position of most Democrats, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.) said in a statement:\n\nOur decision to stop Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene from plunging the House of Representatives and the country into further chaos is rooted in our commitment to solving problems for everyday Americans in a bipartisan manner. We need more common sense and less chaos in Washington, D.C.\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene and the extreme MAGA Republicans are chaos agents. House Democrats are change agents. We will continue to govern in a reasonable, responsible, and results-oriented manner and to put people over politics all day and every day.\n\nSome of the 32 Democrats who supported ousting Johnson framed the vote as proof that -- in the words of Rep. Maxwell Alejandro Frost (Fla.) -- the \"GOP really can't govern\" and the \"chaos caucus is on display.\"\n\nCongresswoman Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) similarly declared on social media that \"the GOP chaos caucus continues to do nothing for the American people and instead waste time infighting.\"\n\n\"Speaker Johnson organized an amicus brief effort to overturn the 2020 election. He opposes abortion rights, trans rights, and voting rights,\" Jayapal also said. \"That's why I did not vote to save his speakership.\"\n\nRep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.) also explained his vote on social media, saying: \"Mike Johnson is the most ideological, right-wing speaker since the 1830s. His views and values are directly antithetical to mine. He stands for everything we, as freedom-loving Democrats, proudly stand against. I will never vote to keep him in that chair.\"\n\nCongressman Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) was one of the members who voted present, which does not count for or against passage.\n\n\"Did I vote with the extremist white Christian nationalist who called a motion to vacate the speakership or did I vote to save the extremist homophobic Christian nationalist speaker to keep him in office?\" Pocan said. \"Neither. I voted 'present' on this sideshow.\"", "source": {"uri": "truthout.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Truthout"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jessica_corbett@truthout.org", "name": "Jessica Corbett",

party by enacting bipartisan spending measures to avoid government shutdowns and aid US allies without insisting on strict security measures for the southern border, which Democrats reject.\n\nThe

like 'this is just how you have to govern in divided government' are pathetic, weak and unacceptable,\" she said of Mr Johnson from the House floor.\n\n\"Even with our razor-thin Republican majority, we could have at least secured the border.\"\n\nBut the chamber erupted in taunts and cheers at points as Ms Greene read her resolution, with Democrats at times chanting \"Hakeem, Hakeem\".\n\nIt was

bills.\n\nAfter Ms Greene began her call for his removal, Mr Johnson walked around the House floor, shaking hands with Republican supporters.\n\nMs Greene's bid to seek retribution by unseating the

Mike Johnson (R-La.) out of the speaker's office.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) filed the motion to vacate after a speech in which she accused Johnson of failing to defund the Department of Justice in order to stop its lawsuits against Trump.\n\nThe former president praised Greene even as he said that Republicans needed to be unified in his post on Truth Social.\n\n\"I absolutely love Marjorie Taylor Greene. She's got Spirit, she's got Fight, and I believe she'll be around, and on our side, for a long time to come,\" wrote Trump.\n\n\"Mike Johnson is a good man who is trying very hard.\"\n\n\"However, right now, Republicans have to be fighting the Radical Left Democrats, and all the Damage they have done to our Country,\" he added. \"With a Majority of One, shortly growing to three or four, we're not in a position of voting on a Motion to Vacate. At some point, we may very well be, but this is not the time.\"\n\nHe wrote that he was leading in presidential polls and predicted that Republicans would win in the Senate as well as the House.\n\n\"But if we show DISUNITY, which will be portrayed as CHAOS, it will negatively affect everything!\" Trump said. \"Mike Johnson is a good man who is trying very hard. I also wish certain things were done over the last period of two months, but we will get them done, together.\"\n\nHe went on to request Republicans vote to table the motion.\n\nGreene had previously said that she was upset that Johnson had not ended funding that went to Ukraine in its war against Russia's invasion. Only 11 Republicans voted to support the motion.\n\nJohnson had defended himself by responding, \"I'm the most conservative member who has ever held the gavel as speaker, but the reality of our numbers is our challenge.\"\n\n\"A failing act of political theater.\"\n\nAngry Republicans excoriated the effort in an impromptu media briefing outside the Capitol Building. Republican Rep. Dusty Johnson of South Dakota especially derided the motion.\n\n\"We know this motion is not going to do one thing to make America stronger, it's not gonna do one thing to deliver a conservative victory. It's going to sow discord and dissent, and by the way, it's going to fail. She is engaged in a failing act of political theater,\" said Johnson to reporters.\n\n\"What you have here is some of the mainstream members who are the adults, and we're gonna do what adults do,\" he added. \"We're going to ignore the tantrums and instead work to actually govern this country.\"\n\nRep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky was an avid supporter of the motion to remove Johnson, and he issued a bitter critique of the political situation after the vote.\n\n\"Vacating Kevin McCarthy was a huge mistake. Every Democrat voted to vacate him because he fought them tooth and nail,\" Massey said on social media.\n\n-- (@)\n\n\"Keeping Mike Johnson is an even bigger mistake,\" he added. \"An overwhelming majority of democrats voted to keep him because he's given them everything they want.\"\n\nJohnson replaced Kevin McCarthy in October after a campaign that accused the former speaker of being weak and not supportive of Trump enough. Greene had praised the ascension of Johnson and took a selfie with him after the vote was successful.\n\n\"I just voted for Mike Johnson to be our next Speaker of the House! Mike has a conservative voting record and has committed to helping me move important legislation forward,\" she posted at the time.\n\nAfter the vote on Wednesday, she accused him of being the leader of the \"uniparty,\" including Democrats.\n\n\"Tonight, you saw the Uniparty in action. Nancy Pelosi, Hakeem Jeffries, and the rest of the Democrats saved Mike Johnson,\" she said in a pair of messages on social media.\n\nTrump finished his post on Wednesday promising that Republicans would win big and soon.", "source": {"uri": "conservativeangle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brigitte Gabriel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusty_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dusty Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Massie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Massie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_McCarthy_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin McCarthy (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Subcultures", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Subcultures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.theblaze.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=52203062&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C72%2C0%2C9", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551299", "eventUri": "eng-9551299", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Marjorie Taylor Greene and other conservative hardliners in his caucus.\n\nCNN --\n\nThe House on Wednesday rejected a motion calling for Republican Speaker Mike Johnson's ouster, rebuffing an effort by one of the GOP leader's most-vocal critics, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia.\n\nThe 359-43 vote on a motion to table Greene's measure required the help of Democrats, given the speaker's narrow majority. The vote could quiet calls for Johnson's removal among conservative hardliners, who have been angry about his support of a $95 billion foreign aid package that passed last month.\n\nJohnson's divided conference was evident on Wednesday as 11 Republicans sided with Greene, while 196 opposed her effort. Additionally, 163 Democrats voted to table Greene's motion, effectively protecting the speaker. Twenty-eight members from both parties either didn't vote or voted present.\n\nThe vote comes after Johnson's predecessor, former Republican Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California, was ousted in October by eight members of his own caucus. Only two Republicans voted against both Johnson and McCarthy: Reps. Andy Biggs and Eli Crane, both of Arizona.\n\nFor a detailed breakdown of how each member voted on Wednesday, filter or sort table below:", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_stiles@cnn.com", "name": "Matt Stiles", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli_Crane", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eli Crane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Biggs", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andy Biggs"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Audio/Do-It-Yourself", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Audio/Do-It-Yourself", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/702a3dd4-8927-4777-9498-1adb9dff37e8.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551299", "eventUri": "eng-9551299", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

However, it was followed by a growth of boos on the House floor.\n\n\"This is the uni party for the American people watching,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "townhall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Townhall"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sarah_arnold@townhall.com", "name": "Sarah Arnold", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_McCarthy_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin McCarthy (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Scalise", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Scalise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(parliamentary_procedure)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Motion (parliamentary procedure)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Residential", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Residential", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Audio/Do-It-Yourself", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Audio/Do-It-Yourself", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/109/d973278b-aee8-4e94-b4ae-0e0fb2754ac3.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551299", "eventUri": "eng-9551299", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Mike Johnson, R-La., when he was elected speaker of the House.\n\nBut almost seven months later, the five Democratic representatives joined majorities in both parties to block the removal of Johnson. If that effort had been successful, it would have again halted all business in the lower chamber of Congress just months away from an election.\n\nFor weeks, U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., threatened a motion to vacate the speaker, which would have been the second attempt by a member to do so in less than a year. She argued Johnson repeatedly gave Democrats what they wanted over GOP priorities \"to preserve his own personal power.\"\n\nOn Wednesday night, Greene followed through on her threat and made it a privileged motion to force lawmakers to act on it in two days. But within the hour, the House voted, 359-43, to kill Greene's effort. Only 11 Republicans and 32 Democrats voted to allow the Georgia Republican's resolution on removal to move forward.\n\nAmong those supporting Johnson were the entire Connecticut delegation: John Larson, D-1st District; Joe Courtney, D-2nd District; Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd District; Jim Himes, D-4th District; and Jahana Hayes, D-5th District.\n\nWith the looming prospect of another motion to vacate, Democrats appeared more willing to help save Johnson's job after they joined a small group of Republicans in removing then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., last October.\n\nDemocratic leadership ultimately decided to support Johnson if a motion to vacate was triggered again, citing his willingness to move forward on a massive foreign aid package that had been stalled for months. Congress passed the bill last month with aid for Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan and humanitarian efforts in Gaza.\n\nConnecticut lawmakers have cited concerns about Johnson's record and continue to point out the ideological differences they have with him on abortion rights, LGBTQ+ rights and efforts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nBut they were willing to back Johnson after he followed through on allowing a vote on foreign aid that had been hitting more resistance within the Republican Party, particularly over more aid for Ukraine to counter Russia's ongoing invasion.\n\n\"I agree with Speaker Mike Johnson on almost nothing. However, I have much respect for his decision to collaborate with the Democratic caucus to pass a strong bipartisan funding package and critical aid for our Ukrainian allies,\" Himes said in a statement.\n\n\"He should not be removed from his position for standing up to the radical extremists of his party and choosing duty over chaos,\" he added.\n\nBefore the vote in October, Congress last voted on a motion to vacate more than a century ago. No House speaker had previously been removed through such a resolution until McCarthy's ouster.\n\nFor three weeks after McCarthy was pushed out, the House was effectively at an unprecedented standstill. Business and votes in legislation were frozen until lawmakers elected a new speaker.\n\nAfter Republicans failed to coalesce around a few candidates, they ultimately backed Johnson three weeks later.\n\nMembers in both parties said they did not want the House to plunge back into chaos when they have little time left, since Congress is out of session more during an election year.\n\n\"Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene called up her motion to declare the office of the speaker of the House vacant. I have a long list of things I would like to vote on to improve the lives of my constituents but today, once again, I voted on a motion to table,\" Hayes said.\n\n\"Being in the majority is a tremendous responsibility that my Republican colleagues just have not seemed to accept,\" she added.\n\nConnecticut GOP candidate George Logan, who is seeking a rematch against Hayes in November, has also been opposed to GOP efforts to remove the speaker. Republican supporters of Johnson feared it would be another distraction for the party as they fight to keep their slim majority in the House.\n\nAfter the vote, Logan tweeted that he was \"grateful\" the motion was tabled and shared a photo of him with the speaker during Johnson's visit to Connecticut.\n\nIn a sign that Republicans will focus on trying to flip the 5th District, Johnson campaigned and headlined a fundraiser for Logan in March. Logan narrowly lost to Hayes in the 2022 election and is expected to once again become the Republican nominee.\n\n\"Efforts to remove Mike Johnson are reckless and irresponsible. These efforts only serve to destroy any chance of delivering the change that Americans so desperately need,\" Logan said.\n\n\"With a failing economy, a border crisis, and chaos in the international stage, now is the time for real leadership. Now is NOT the time for further chaos and division,\" he added. \"I am proud to stand with Speaker Mike Johnson.\"\n\nThe Connecticut Mirror/Connecticut Public Radio federal policy reporter position is made possible, in part, by funding from the Robert and Margaret Patricelli Family Foundation.", "source": {"uri": "ctpublic.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Connecticut Public"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_to_vacate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Motion to vacate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jahana_Hayes", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jahana Hayes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_congressional_apportionment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States congressional apportionment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Himes", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jim Himes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_B._Larson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John B.

And she certainly doesn't seem to have any concern for the stability of the Congress or the people we represent.\"\n\nMrs Greene stood flanked by fellow Republican Thomas Massie when she made her move against Mr Johnson, criticising him for a string of compromises with Democrats, who hold a majority in the Senate.\n\n\"Excuses like 'this is just how you have to govern in divided government' are pathetic, weak and unacceptable,\" Mrs Greene said of Mr Johnson. \"Even with our razor-thin Republican majority we could have at least secured the border.\"\n\nThe chamber erupted in taunts and cheers at points as Mrs Greene read her resolution, with Democrats at times chanting \"Hakeem, Hakeem\", a reference to their party leader, Mr Hakeem Jeffries, in an echo of the many times they voted for him as speaker during Republicans' multiple rounds of voting for speaker since the current House was seated in January 2021.\n\nMr Johnson has angered many hardliners by enacting bipartisan spending measures to avoid government shutdowns and aid US allies including Ukraine, without insisting on strict security measures for the US-Mexico border that Democrats reject.\n\nThe House Republicans' border security Bill had no chance of passing the Democratic-controlled Senate.\n\nA bipartisan compromise Bill negotiated in late 2023 and in early 2024 in the Senate, with the Biden administration's approval, was killed by House and Senate Republicans at Trump's behest.\n\nMr Johnson could be seen walking around the House floor after Mrs Greene began her call on May 8 for his ouster, with Republican supporters shaking his hand and patting him on the back.\n\n\"Republicans have to be fighting the Radical Left Democrats, and all the Damage they have done to our Country,\" Trump said in his May 8 post. \"We're not in a position of voting on a Motion to Vacate. At some point, we may very well be, but this is not the time.\"\n\nThe situation has bolstered Mr Jeffries, who agreed to save Johnson from ouster after freeing Congress from the road block of Republican infighting by delivering crucial Democratic support for must-pass Bills.\n\nMrs Greene in remarks to reporters after the vote did not rule out trying to oust Johnson again.\n\nFor his part, Mr Jeffries said he hoped to see House Republicans turn against party hardliners, saying, \"The only thing we ask of our House Republican colleagues is for traditional Republicans to further isolate the extreme MAGA Republican wing of the GOP, which has visited nothing but chaos and dysfunction on the American people.\" REUTERS", "source": {"uri": "straitstimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Steve Womack (R-Ark.) on Wednesday lambasted Rep.

Americans sent us to Washington to govern,\" Womack wrote in a post on X.\n\n\"The Motion to Vacate attempt was only a headline-grabbing, petty political stunt to distract from our duties and raise money. I'm glad rationality overwhelmingly prevailed, and we can continue the vital work of the American people under @SpeakerJohnson. I like Mike!\" he continued.\n\nThe remark came moments after the House voted to block a conservative attempt to boot Johnson from the Speakership. The effort was led by Greene, who in a surprise Wednesday, moved to force a vote on her motion to vacate against Johnson.\n\nThe lower chamber voted 359-43-7 on a motion to table Greene's resolution, preventing it from hitting the floor for a vote.\n\nGreene's effort was backed by only two other Republicans -- Reps. Thomas Massie (Ky.) and Paul Gosar (Ariz.). Her move Wednesday came after weeks of holding the threat over Johnson, citing his policy decisions.\n\nThe bipartisan vote did not come as a surprise after several Republicans and Democrats indicated they would protect Johnson from losing the Speaker's gavel. The Georgia Republican was met with boos from members of both sides of the aisle when she announced she was moving forward with the effort Wednesday.\n\nGreene and Johnson met for hours earlier this week, during which she listed a series of demands for the Speaker. These included bringing only bills to the floor that have the support from a majority of the GOP conference, pledging against additional aid for Ukraine, defending special counsels, including Jack Smith, who is probing former President Trump, and establishing a 1-percent spending cut across the board.\n\nSpeaking with reporters a day before the vote, Johnson said he was \"working through a lot of ideas and suggestions,\" but shied away from publicly committing to the requests.\n\nJohnson thanked his colleagues for their support following Wednesday's vote.\n\n\"As I've said from the beginning and I've made clear every day, I intend to do my job. I intend to do what I believe to be the right thing, which is what I was elected to do, and I'll let the chips fall where they may,\" Johnson said. \"In my view, that is leadership.\"", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "miranda_nazzaro@thehill.com", "name": "Miranda Nazzaro", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Womack", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steve Womack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Gosar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul Gosar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Massie", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Massie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_house", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lower house"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Smith_(lawyer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jack Smith (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Stunts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Stunts", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/03/womacksteve_032124gn01_w.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551299", "eventUri": "eng-9551299", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Marjorie Taylor Greene's motion to oust Speaker Mike Johnson.\n\nAfter a couple days of discussions with Johnson, Greene moved late Wednesday to force a vote on a motion she had filed in late March seeking Johnson's removal. Her call, which reportedly caught Republican leaders off guard, was met with loud boos and jeers from her colleagues on the House floor.\n\nHouse leaders technically had two days to schedule a vote on Johnson's future, but they didn't wait and instead moved immediately to table, or kill, Greene's motion.\n\nThe 359-43 vote saw 196 Republicans joined by 163 Democrats in saving Johnson's job. Just 11 Republicans and 32 Democrats voted against killing the motion, while seven Democrats voted \"present.\"\n\nAfter the vote, Johnson called Greene's effort a distraction. He emphasized that the speaker \"serves the whole House\" and that the country needs a functioning Congress. \"Hopefully this is the end of the personality politics and the frivolous character assassination that has defined the 118th Congress,\" he said. \"It's regrettable, it's not who we are as Americans and we're better than this.\"\n\nGreene brought her motion after the House had cast what was supposed to be one of its final votes for the week, passing a one-week extension of Federal Aviation Administration programs set to expire on Friday. She also moved ahead even though former President Donald Trump had urged against it, including in a social media post on Wednesday.\n\n\"With a Majority of One, shortly growing to three or four, we're not in a position of voting on a Motion to Vacate. At some point, we may very well be, but this is not the time,\" he wrote, urging party unity while also writing that he loves Greene. Trump added: \"Mike Johnson is a good man who is trying very hard. I also wish certain things were done over the last period of two months, but we will get them done, together. It is my request that Republicans vote for 'THE MOTION TO TABLE.'\"\n\nWhat's next: Earlier in the day, House Republican leaders canceled votes on Thursday, meaning that lawmakers could depart for the week after Wednesday's business was completed. Congress doesn't have all that much pressing legislative business right now. As The Washington Post noted this morning: \"There's not much left to do before the election, anyway. Other than the Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization bill, which is being debated in the Senate, all of the must-pass bills have been completed or are likely to be punted until after the election.\"\n\nBut Greene's motion illustrates just how GOP infighting and political intrigue could continue as election season heats up.

wish[es] certain things were done over the last period of two months\" and requesting to \"vote for 'the motion to table'\" if they want to \"win big.\"\n\nNewsweek reached out for comment to Greene's office via email on Wednesday night.\n\nAlthough a significant number of GOP lawmakers oppose further Ukraine aid and other measures that Johnson has allowed to pass through Congress, Trump is far from the only Republican to criticize Greene's motion to vacate, with many of the congresswoman's colleagues booing her when she introduced the motion on Wednesday.\n\nRepublican Representative Kelly Armstrong told CNN's Manu Raju on Wednesday that the motion was \"the congressional version of a temper tantrum,\" while GOP Congressman Dusty Johnson called it a \"dumpster fire\" that was \"not going to do one thing to deliver a conservative victory.\"\n\nRepresentative Bob Good, chair of the right-wing House Freedom Caucus, said during a Sunday appearance on NewsNation's The Hill that Greene was \"not acting in the best interests of [former] President Trump\" by moving forward with the motion \"six months before an election.\"\n\nJohnson has been largely dismissive of Greene's efforts to remove him, insisting on multiple occasions that he does not spend much time \"thinking about\" the congresswoman and her plans.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news",

The lower chamber voted 359-43 to dismiss the measure, with most Republicans joining Democrats to keep the speaker at his post.\n\nGreene has long slammed Johnson, who assumed the House gavel last fall after the ouster of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, for working alongside Democrats rather than advancing the GOP majority's policy priorities.\n\nReading from her motion on the House floor Wednesday evening, the lawmaker said Speaker Johnson \"has aided and abetted the Democrats and the Biden administration,\" pointing among other things to his work on the recently enacted 2024 federal budget and a roughly $95 billion foreign aid package.\n\n\"Speaker Johnson's tenure is defined by one self-serving characteristic,\" Greene said. \"When given a choice of advancing Republican priorities or aligning with Democrats to preserve his own personal power, Johnson regularly chooses to align himself with Democrats.\"\n\nThe Wednesday evening vote dusting Greene's motion was one of the House's last acts for the week -- chamber leadership canceled votes scheduled for Thursday and lawmakers were expected to leave Washington Wednesday night.\n\nThe Georgia lawmaker struggled through her address to the House floor as she was repeatedly interrupted by jeers and interjections from her colleagues. It's unclear whether Democrats were responsible for derailing her speech or if there were Republicans involved.\n\nAlthough her measure was widely regarded as doomed to fail, Greene enjoyed several days of close media attention after she announced last week that she planned to bring her motion up for a vote. The lawmaker met twice earlier this week with Speaker Johnson, with some speculation that those marathon conversations had softened her stance.\n\nDemocrats said last week that they would reach across the aisle to vote down any bid to remove Johnson from the speakership, a fact that Greene and her colleague Representative Thomas Massie were keen to point out during a news conference last week.\n\n\"[H]'es clinging to power by clinging to Democrats,\" the Kentucky Republican told reporters.\n\nGreene first introduced her motion to vacate Johnson from the speakership last month following the full-year budget vote, but reserved the right to bring it forward, framing the measure as a warning to the Republican leader.\n\nIt's the second time a member of the slim Republican House majority has attempted to remove the caucus's top lawmaker. A coalition of conservatives in September succeeded in removing former Speaker McCarthy, citing similar complaints about bipartisanship. McCarthy has since retired from Congress.\n\nThat time, though, Democrats banded together with the angry Republican cohort to give McCarthy the boot.", "source": {"uri": "courthousenews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Court House News Service"}, "authors": [{"uri": "benjamin_s_weiss@courthousenews.com", "name": "Benjamin S.

Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Paul Gosar of Arizona -- officially cosponsored her resolution.\n\nSeven Democrats voted \"present.\"\n\nGreene's move was somewhat of a surprise, with the congresswoman forcing the vote just one day after seemingly backing off of her threat.\n\nThe far-right congresswoman's effort was long expected to fail, given Democratic leaders' decision to vote to table the motion. Several Democrats voted with Greene or voted \"present,\" citing their opposition to Johnson's politics and their belief that Democrats should have asked for more in exchange for their votes.\n\n\"I'm not going to support MTG's silliness, but I don't want to support the most homophobic speaker in American history,\" Democratic Rep. Mark Pocan previously told BI, referencing Johnson's opposition to LGBTQ+ rights.\n\nIt remains unclear whether Greene will continue to force votes on ousting Johnson.\n\nHere are the 11 House Republicans who voted to advance the effort to oust Johnson:\n\nAndy Biggs of Arizona Eric Burlison of Missouri Eli Crane of Arizona Warren Davidson of Ohio Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia Paul

Marjorie Taylor Greene, his job secured only after House Democrats turned out in force to put an end to the GOP chaos, for now.\n\nBut the oversized role Trump played in propping up Johnson cannot be understated -- or relied upon to save the speaker again.\n\nIn fact, the indicted former president who has been known to flip his friends into foes warned that while Republicans shouldn't be voting to remove Johnson, \"At some point, we may very well be, but this is not the time.\"\n\nRelated Story: 163 House Democrats Voted to Protect Speaker Mike Johnson's Job\n\nThe outcome puts on display the fragility of the unexpected but strategically beneficial alliance that Trump and Johnson have formed ahead of the November election when both hope to be returned to power -- the Republican president in the White House and the loyal foot soldier in Congress.\n\n\"Seems like they're on the same page, and I think that's great,\" said lawyer Cleta Mitchell, who was a key figure in Trump's efforts to challenge the 2020 election.\n\nJohnson has worked diligently to align himself with the former president, the conservative Christian setting aside his once critical views of the presidential contender to present himself as a chief implementer of the Trump Republican Party's Make America Great Again agenda on Capitol Hill.\n\nBarely six months on the job, since Johnson replaced the ousted then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy, the new leader has dashed multiple times to Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort, securing crucial support, including at a glitzy Republican National Committee gala this past weekend.\n\nRelated Story: Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Challenges Donald Trump to Debate at Libertarian ...\n\nWhen Trump invited Johnson to the stage to say a few words, the speaker praised the former president as the \"strongman\" the country needs in the White House. Trump and Johnson are cordial, according to a person with knowledge of their relationship, and granted anonymity to discuss it.\n\n\"He's doing a great job,\" Trump said alongside Johnson after another visit last month, ahead of the House vote to approve a national security package with Ukraine funding that Greene warned would lead to a vote on Johnson's ouster.\n\nIn return for his seal of approval, Trump is increasingly able to rely on the speaker's high-profile standing to legitimize his relentless attacks on the U.S. election process, the judicial system and the multiple criminal cases against him, including the federal indictment for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election ahead of the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack.\n\n\"All these cases need to be dropped,\" says Johnson, a constitutional lawyer, who as the House speaker is second in the line of presidential succession. \"President Trump has done nothing wrong. ... It has to stop.\"\n\nTrump is already pre-emptively contesting the 2024 election as potentially rigged before the first ballots are cast, and Johnson, who helped lead legal challenges to Joe Biden's 2020 election victory, is in a powerful position to again question the legitimacy of the outcome.\n\nAsked this week if he believed the 2020 election was legitimate and if he would stand by the new state-certified results this fall, Johnson shook his head in frustration, and demurred. \"What we're talking about today is the 2024 election, nobody can go back and relitigate what happened in 2020,\" he said.\n\nThe joint venture between Trump and Johnson was in clear focus Wednesday ahead of the House action when the speaker, flanked on the Capitol steps by a who's who of the former president's advisers, announced new legislation that would require proof of citizenship before Americans are eligible to vote.\n\nJohnson had promised Trump a voting-citizenship bill during one of the Mar-a-Lago visits, and the unveiling of it alongside Mitchell, Stephen Miller, the architect of Trump's hardline immigration policies, and others showed just how embedded the former president's Make America Great Again movement has become in the House speaker's agenda.\n\nElection experts said there is scant evidence that non-citizens vote in U.S. elections, and past reviews including one pursued by the Trump administration have not produced significant cases of wrongdoing.\n\nNevertheless, Johnson and the others argued without proof that immigrants are being brought into the U.S. to illegally vote. The legislation can be seen as groundwork for the challenges Trump may pose in the aftermath of the November election.\n\n\"If this bill does not become law, then Joe Biden and Democrats will have engineered one of the greatest interferences in any democratic nation in the history of the world,\" Miller said outside the Capitol.\n\nRelated Story: Trump Surrogates Make a Dangerous Call for China Regime Change: Fareed Zakaria\n\nStill, the legislative push did not placate Greene, who hours later tried and failed to remove the speaker from office.\n\nColleagues booed in protest. An overwhelming majority, 359-43, kept Johnson in his job, for now.\n\n\"I'm proud of what I did today,\" Greene said afterward on the Capitol steps.\n\nIt's the second time in a matter of months that Republicans have worked to oust their own speaker, an unheard of level of party upheaval with a move rarely seen in U.S. history.\n\nWithout Democratic help, Johnson would have certainly faced a more dismal outcome. All told, 196 and 163 Democrats voted to table Greene's motion. But 11 Republicans voted to proceed with the effort, more than it took to remove McCarthy last fall, a first in U.S. history.\n\nDemocrats have also made clear their help was for this moment alone, and not a promise of an enduring partnership for Johnson's survival.\n\n\"Our decision to stop Marjorie Taylor Greene from plunging the country into further chaos is rooted in our commitment to solve problems,\" said Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., after the vote.\n\n\"The only thing we ask of our House Republican colleagues is for traditional Republicans to further isolate the extreme MAGA Republican wing of the GOP,\" said Jeffries, who is in line to become speaker if Democrats win control of the House in the fall. \"We need more common sense and less chaos.\"\n\nAsked about a future motion to vacate the speaker, Jeffries said, \"Haven't given it a thought.\"\n\nBy relying on Democratic backing, Johnson risks inciting more criticism that he is insufficiently loyal to the party.\n\nAnd the threat still lingers -- any single lawmaker can call up the motion to vacate the speaker.", "source": {"uri": "gvwire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GV Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@gvwire.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trumpism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trumpism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_right", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christian right"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempts_to_overturn_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

House rules require a vote within 48 hours, although the leadership could move to dismiss the resolution within hours.\n\nGreene, a Trump ally, has two public supporters but none of the broader backing on the right that prompted the removal last year of Johnson's predecessor, Kevin McCarthy.\n\nShe is vowing to plow ahead anyway, as she seeks to make Republicans go on the record about whether they support Johnson.\n\nMany right-wing lawmakers are upset with the speaker for relying on Democratic votes to pursue an agenda they see as a betrayal of their conservative outlook on issues from Ukraine aid to government funding.\n\n\"No Republican speaker should ever share power with the Democrats. American voters gave Republicans in the House the majority for a reason... Mike Johnson must resign or be removed,\" Greene posted on X on Friday.\n\nBut rank-and-file lawmakers are wary of repeating the chaos of McCarthy's removal in a right-wing rebellion that left the House paralyzed for three weeks as they struggled to find a replacement, before finally settling on Johnson.\n\nAnd with the presidential and congressional elections less than six months away, Republicans see threatening Johnson's gavel as divisive and damaging to their prospects of unified control in Washington.\n\nThe voting tally is sure to be scrutinized for what it suggests about Johnson's viability as a Republican leader after November.\n\nSome allies of the speaker fear that his rescue by Democrats could make his position untenable in the long term, although the scale of the pushback against Greene may have stilled their nerves.\n\n\"She's pretty much operating on her own, with one or two others who have expressed support for what she's doing,\" Bob Good, chairman of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, told cable network NewsNation on Sunday.\n\nJohnson condemned the move in an interview on SiriusXM's \"The Laura Coates Show\" on Friday.\n\n\"I think it's wrong for the Republican Party, I think it's wrong for the institution, I think it's wrong for the country,\" he said.\n\nft/sst/dw", "source": {"uri": "ktbs.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBS"},

In the end 163 Democrats joined Republicans in a 359-43 vote to dismiss the resolution.\n\nGreene, a fervent Trump ally, had two public supporters but none of the broader backing on the right that prompted the removal last year of Johnson's predecessor, Kevin McCarthy.\n\nShe plowed ahead anyway, seeking to make Republicans go on the record about whether they support Johnson.\n\nMany right-wing lawmakers are upset with the speaker for relying on Democratic votes to pursue an agenda they see as a betrayal of their conservative outlook on issues from Ukraine aid to government funding.\n\nBut rank-and-file lawmakers in both parties were wary of repeating the chaos of McCarthy's removal, which left the House paralyzed for three weeks as they struggled to find a replacement.\n\nAnd with the presidential and congressional elections less than six months away, Republicans see threatening Johnson's gavel as divisive and damaging to their prospects of unified control in Washington.\n\nTrump praised Greene in an effusive statement released on his Truth Social platform after the vote.\n\n\"I absolutely love Marjorie Taylor Greene. She's got Spirit, she's got Fight, and I believe she'll be around, and on our side, for a long time to come,\" he said.\n\nBut he added that Republicans were \"not in a position\" to oust Johnson.\n\n\"At some point, we may very well be, but this is not the time,\" he said.\n\nAfter the vote Johnson said: \"I want to say that I appreciate the show of confidence from my colleagues to defeat this misguided effort, that is certainly what it was.\"\n\nft/des/dw\n\nMore from this section\n\nDecline in New Industrial Manufacturing Planned Industrial Projects in April 2024 Top Female Sports Executive, Lisa Pantages of the San Francisco Giants, Named FWSF 2024 Financial Woman of the Year IMG Travel Protection Plans Are Now Available Through TravelInsurance.com", "source": {"uri": "kulr8.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KULR-8 Local News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_McCarthy_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin McCarthy (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_liberties", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil liberties"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_debt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government debt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/kulr8.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/06/20619b84-bf9d-571c-b433-e7d12dc060ec/663bf97e342e5.image.jpg?crop=512%2C269%2C0%2C36&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551299", "eventUri": "eng-9551299", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Marjorie Taylor Greene's attempt to oust Speaker Mike Johnson on Wednesday evening, with nearly all Republicans and most Democrats coming to Johnson's rescue.\n\nThe final tally was 359-43, with 11 Republicans and 32 Democrats voting against the motion to table Greene's resolution. Seven Democrats voted \"present.\"\n\nGreene, R-Ga., made her long-telegraphed move against Johnson after reading a lengthy litany of complaints about his tenure in office, which began in late October, on the floor. She offered her resolution to declare the office of the speaker vacant during a break in other legislative business.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., tried to dispense with the clerk's formal reading of the resolution on the floor, which is typically done by unanimous consent. Is this case, there was an objection and the entire resolution was read out.\n\nThen Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., a onetime speaker contender himself, offered his motion to table Greene's resolution.\n\nGreene has said that Johnson is a \"Democrat speaker\" and is particularly upset that Johnson brought to the floor compromise fiscal 2024 appropriations legislation and a war supplemental package that included aid for Ukraine.\n\nGreene initially introduced the measure after the passage of the second of the two appropriations packages, leading to weeks of speculation of if and when she would make her move.\n\nBut former President Donald Trump intervened and tried to persuade Greene to back down, according to reports, leading to speculation that the situation might be defused.\n\nIt had appeared that Greene and her ally Thomas Massie, R-Ky., had put their effort on pause Tuesday, after meetings with Johnson on Monday and Tuesday in which they delivered four \"requests\" to the speaker. They were joined by Arizona's Paul Gosar, the only other Republican to publicly back the effort.\n\nThe trio is asking that Johnson bring legislation to the floor only that has the support of a majority of the conference; oppose any additional Ukraine aid; defund the Office of Special Counsel Jack Smith; and include a 1% across-the-board spending cut in a continuing resolution that will be needed past Sept. 30 if all fiscal 2025 appropriations bills are not passed in time.\n\n...continued", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unanimous_consent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unanimous consent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Scalise", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steve Scalise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_leader", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Majority leader"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mueller_special_counsel_investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mueller special counsel investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Gosar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Gosar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuing_resolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Continuing resolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Massie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Massie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Squash", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Squash", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tea", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tea", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://resources.arcamax.com/newspics/288/28853/2885314.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551299", "eventUri": "eng-9551299", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-09-30", "textStart": 2234, "textEnd": 2242}], "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Marjorie Taylor Greene's, R-Ga., attempt to oust him.\n\nThe House of Representatives now has two workdays to act on Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's motion to oust Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La.\n\nGreene, R-Ga., has been threatening to force a vote on taking Johnson's gavel since late March in protest of his handling of government funding and foreign aid.\n\nHer resolution, known as a motion to vacate the chair, will now have to be voted on or tabled after Greene noticed it as \"privileged\" on Wednesday night - meaning House leaders have two legislative days to take it up.\n\nThe Republican side of the House chamber erupted in boos as Greene listed off her gripes against Johnson, prompting Democrat Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tenn., to shout, \"The House is not in order - and is about to fall into chaos,\" prompting some sparse laughs from their side of the chamber.\n\nThe vote is expected to be close but ultimately fail, with both Republicans and Democrats voicing opposition to a move that would effectively paralyze Congress until a new speaker is found.\n\nMARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE FILES MOTION TO OUST SPEAKER JOHNSON\n\nThe vote is a culmination of six months' worth of frustration from the most right-wing conservatives in Johnson's conference, who have felt sidelined by him on nearly all critical legislation including foreign aid and government funding, during which they demanded he leverage a government shutdown to force the Democrats who controlled the Senate and White House to pass Republican policies.\n\nGreene's push got two more backers in Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., after Johnson ushered a foreign aid bill along bipartisan lines that includes $61 billion for Ukraine.\n\nBut it's largely fallen flat among the House GOP, where even Johnson's critics have shown little appetite for going through another three weeks of chaos like what followed the ouster of ex-Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., in October - particularly six months out from an election.\n\nHOUSE DEMS SAY THEY'LL BLOCK MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE FROM OUSTING SPEAKER JOHNSON\n\nWith just a razor-thin majority of two seats, it would take little dissent for Johnson to lose the top House job if it fell along party lines. Eight House Republicans had voted with all Democrats to oust McCarthy in early October.\n\nUnlike McCarthy's case, however, House Democrats have pledged to come to Johnson's aid by voting to table the resolution if it came up - a vote to table a measure, which essentially kills it, is a procedural hurdle that allows Democrats to block Johnson's ouster without having to actually vote on whether to fire him.\n\nJohnson's critics seized on the left-wing support as evidence that the Louisiana Republican was not representing the interests of his own party.\n\n\"The entire Democrat Party is lining up behind Mike Johnson. First, it was the entire leadership team for the Democrats. Now, Nancy Pelosi, who impeached President Trump TWICE, has given Johnson her seal of approval. What deal has been made??\" Greene wrote on X on Monday along with a video of Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., backing House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries' decision to help Johnson.\n\nMARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE CALLS JOHNSON'S FOREIGN AID PACKAGE HIS '3RD BETRAYAL' OF AMERICAN PEOPLE\n\nThe move could save Johnson's job, but could also cost him some Republican support.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMassie told Fox News Digital last week when asked about how much GOP backing he expected, \"I think it's a kinetic situation. And Hakeem and the entire Democrat leadership team endorsing Mike Johnson is going to cause a lot of people who weren't with us, to be with us.\"\n\nJohnson, for his part, has repeatedly told reporters that he's not afraid of Greene's threats and has insisted his focus is on governing.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Marjorie Taylor Greene have to show for her failed effort to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson? Less than nothing.\n\nAs 2024 got underway, amidst chatter that there were \"knives out\" for House Speaker Mike Johnson among members of his own party, Republicans such as Rep. Chip Roy of Texas floated the possibility of targeting the Louisianan with a motion to vacate the chair. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene acknowledged the intraparty talk -- but rejected it.\n\n\"I would say that Chip Roy haphazardly throwing in a motion to vacate is probably about the dumbest thing that could happen,\" the Georgian told The Hill exactly four months today, \"because I think the last motion to vacate was pretty stupid, and has thrown our conference into utter chaos.\" The right-wing congresswoman added, \"I'm kind of sick of the chaos.\"\n\nSoon after, Greene changed her mind, went in the opposite direction, and launched a crusade to bring down her own party's House speaker. In hindsight, she probably should've stuck to her original instinct. NBC News reported:\n\nThe last time the House voted on such an effort was in October, when eight Republicans turned against then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy. They were joined by House Democrats, and the result was a narrow 216-210 vote.\n\nGoing into this new showdown, everyone on both sides of the aisle knew that Greene's effort wouldn't be nearly as close, and it wasn't. A total of 11 House Republicans, including Greene, voted to proceed with the effort, while 196 GOP members rejected it. Among Democrats, 163 members of the House minority joined with Republicans to scuttle the scheme; 32 voted to advance it; and 7 Democrats voted \"present.\"\n\nWhat happens now? When it comes to the congressional process, nothing. Greene took her best shot; she failed spectacularly; and lawmakers will now go back to their previously scheduled plans. The Georgian could theoretically try again at some point, but it's unlikely that a second attempt would be any more successful than the first.\n\nBut that's not to say this gambit was inconsequential. On the contrary, when assessing what Greene has to show for her efforts, it's important to realize that she ended up with less than nothing: The radical congresswoman is much worse off than she was before. As The Washington Post reported overnight:\n\nTaking stock, Greene not only picked a dramatic fight without a coherent strategy to succeed, she did so in such a way that alienated her ostensible allies. What's more, the congresswoman settled on a series of rather specific demands she expected GOP leaders to meet, but ended up receiving exactly zero concessions from Johnson and his team.\n\nTo be sure, the Republican extremist wasn't exactly a respected figure on Capitol Hill before, but as the dust settles on the latest example of GOP chaos, Greene appears weaker, more isolated, and more feeble.", "source": {"uri": "msnbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MSNBC.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_to_vacate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Motion to vacate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chip_Roy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chip Roy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hill_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Hill (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_McCarthy_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin McCarthy (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Anomalous_People", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Anomalous People", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-05/240509-marjorie-taylor-greene-mb-1220-fc272a.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551299", "eventUri": "eng-9551299", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

Instead, Democrats voted to save Johnson because they knew it was impossible to take control of the House and they want to keep Johnson because he's given them everything they want.\"\n\nThe House on Wednesday voted to block an attempt led by Greene to boot Johnson from the Speakership. The final vote was 359-43-7, with 196 Republicans and 163 Democrats choosing to save Johnson.\n\nThere was little doubt on the result. Democrats had indicated they would provide the votes to help Johnson last week.\n\nRepublicans were broadly against Greene's motion, arguing it was a doomed and unnecessary distraction that put the spotlight on internal squabbles instead of problems they want to emphasize with the Biden administration ahead of the fall elections.\n\nGreene fired back at critics who argued the lower chamber should be focused on policy-based issues, writing, \"Doing things for the American people and focusing on serious issues didn't happen because the Uniparty reared it's ugly head and voted to protect their Uniparty leader and to keep the status quo which has done nothing to for the American people or solved problems on serious issues.\"\n\nThe \"Uniparty\" is Greene's insult of Democrats and Republicans who vote together on certain issues.\n\nJohnson's decision to bring various bills to the floor that ended up passing with Democratic support, such as measures to prevent a government shutdown and provide aid to Ukraine, spurred her decision on the motion to vacate.\n\nAt the end of her lengthy X post, Greene ripped Congress for what she argued was a lack of border security measures and the continued funding for global conflicts.\n\n\"Congress, which is paid by the American people and sent to represent them, didn't stop the border crisis, didn't stop funding foreign wars, didn't protect America's energy industry, didn't cut spending to reduce inflation, didn't defund the weaponized government, instead Congress protected itself and kept the Uniparty control over the People's House,\" she said.\n\nGreene and Johnson met for hours earlier this week, during which she listed a series of demands for the Speaker. Among these included only bringing bills to the floor that have the support from a majority of the GOP conference, vowing against additional aid for Ukraine, establishing a 1 percent spending cut across the board, and defunding special counsels, including Jack Smith, who is probing former President Trump.\n\nJohnson told reporters on Tuesday he was \"working through a lot of ideas and suggestions,\" but he shied away from publicly committing to the requests.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "miranda_nazzaro@thehill.com", "name": "Miranda Nazzaro", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_to_vacate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motion to vacate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_house", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lower house"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/taylorgeenemarjorie_050624gn02_w.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551299", "eventUri": "eng-9551299", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

The motion, seen as a long-shot by many, was met with overwhelming opposition, marking a significant moment in the ongoing political saga within the United States Congress.\n\nGreene, a staunch supporter of former President Donald Trump, took to the House floor to list what she described as Johnson's failures in leadership. Her criticisms were met with vocal disapproval from her colleagues, highlighting the deep divisions within the party. Despite her efforts, the motion to vacate Johnson was quickly countered by Republican Majority Leader Steve Scalise, who called for a vote to table Greene's proposal. The result was a resounding 359-43 vote in favor of keeping Johnson in his role.\n\nThis incident underscores the current state of turmoil within the Republican Party, marking the second attempt in recent months to oust their own speaker. Such moves are rare in U.S. political history and signal a party at odds with itself. In the face of this challenge, GOP lawmakers rallied around Johnson, offering him visible support on the House floor.\n\nJohnson's leadership has been under scrutiny, particularly regarding his stance on foreign aid. Greene had previously threatened to force a vote on his removal if he proceeded with a package that included funds for Ukraine -- a package that was ultimately passed and signed into law. Despite these tensions, Johnson remained steadfast, emphasizing the importance of supporting Ukraine against Russia's invasion and asserting his commitment to doing what he believes is right.\n\nIn an unexpected twist, Democrats, led by Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, came to Johnson's defense. Jeffries and his team advocated for moving beyond the GOP's internal conflicts to ensure the functionality of Congress. This bipartisan support was crucial in thwarting Greene's attempt to unseat Johnson.\n\nAdding another layer to this complex political drama, Trump expressed his affection for Greene but highlighted the need for Republicans to focus on defeating Democrats in the upcoming November election rather than engaging in internal disputes.\n\nThe vote not only demonstrated the support Johnson enjoys within his party but also exposed the challenges Greene faces as she navigates her role as a provocateur within the GOP. Her insistence on forcing her colleagues to publicly declare their stance put many in a difficult position but ultimately showed a desire within the party to move past internal strife and focus on broader political goals.\n\nLast year's attempt to remove Kevin McCarthy from the speaker's office resulted in a protracted search for new leadership -- a situation Republicans were keen to avoid this time around. This latest episode serves as a reminder of the delicate balance of power within Congress and the ongoing struggles within the Republican Party as it looks ahead to future elections.", "source": {"uri": "oneindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Oneindia"}, "authors": [{"uri": "krishna_kripa@oneindia.com", "name": "Krishna Kripa", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Scalise", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steve Scalise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_leader", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Majority leader"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_McCarthy_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin McCarthy (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.oneindia.com/img/2024/05/house-rejects-greene-effort-remove-speaker-johnson-ft.jpg?09052024041048", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551299", "eventUri": "eng-9551299", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

In the end 163 Democrats joined Republicans in a 359-43 vote to dismiss the resolution.\n\nGreene, a fervent Trump ally, had two public supporters but none of the broader backing on the right that prompted the removal last year of Johnson's predecessor, Kevin McCarthy.\n\nShe plowed ahead anyway, seeking to make Republicans go on the record about whether they support Johnson.\n\nMany right-wing lawmakers are upset with the speaker for relying on Democratic votes to pursue an agenda they see as a betrayal of their conservative outlook on issues from Ukraine aid to government funding.\n\nBut rank-and-file lawmakers in both parties were wary of repeating the chaos of McCarthy's removal in a right-wing rebellion that left the House paralyzed for three weeks as they struggled to find a replacement.\n\nAnd with the presidential and congressional elections less than six months away, Republicans see threatening Johnson's gavel as divisive and damaging to their prospects of unified control in Washington.\n\nTrump praised Greene in an effusive statement released on his Truth Social platform after the vote.\n\n\"I absolutely love Marjorie Taylor Greene. She's got Spirit, she's got Fight, and I believe she'll be around, and on our side, for a long time to come,\" he said.\n\nBut he added that Republicans were \"not in a position\" to oust Johnson.\n\n\"At some point, we may very well be, but this is not the time,\" he said.\n\nThe voting tally is sure to be scrutinized for what it suggests about Johnson's viability as a Republican leader after November.\n\nSome allies of the speaker fear that his rescue by Democrats could make his position untenable in the long term, although the scale of the pushback against Greene may have stilled their nerves.\n\nJohnson condemned the move in an interview on SiriusXM's \"The Laura Coates Show\" on Friday.\n\n\"I think it's wrong for the Republican Party, I think it's wrong for the institution, I think it's wrong for the country,\" he said.\n\nft/dw\n\nMore from this section\n\nDecline in New Industrial Manufacturing Planned Industrial Projects in April 2024 TikTok sues US to

Why Marjorie Taylor Greene's motion to vacate failed and Matt Gaetz's succeeded", "body": "Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene faced boos on the House floor in her efforts to oust Mike Johnson as Speaker of the House.\n\nFor the second time this congress, a far-right Republican attempted to oust the speaker of the United States House of Representatives. The first time was in October, when a Florida representative successfully led the effort to oust Kevin McCarthy from the speakership. He did so with the help of Knoxville's representative, Tim Burchett.\n\nThis time around, Georgia's Marjorie Taylor Greene led the same type of effort but received minimal support. Her attempt to oust current speaker Rep. Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, failed miserably.\n\nGreene threatened to introduce her motion to vacate for weeks. She did so May 8 and 15 minutes later, a ranking member of her own party led the effort to kill the bill. That effort won 359 votes -- only 11 Republicans voted to save it.\n\nWhat's a motion to vacate?\n\nA motion to vacate is the procedural tool used to oust a Speaker of the House.\n\nThough previous speakers controlled how leaders could be removed, a recent rule change McCarthy agreed to upon becoming speaker allows any member of the House to file a motion to vacate and force the speaker out.\n\nThe motion only needs a simple majority of 218 votes to pass.\n\nThere have been five total attempts to remove a speaker in U.S. history, and McCarthy's ouster was the only successful one.\n\nWhy did it pass last time and fail this time?\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz introduced a motion to vacate the speakership due to McCarthy compromising on a stopgap funding bill to avert a shutdown of the federal government.\n\nGaetz and other House conservatives, including Burchett, had opposed the temporary funding measure. The Florida congressman accused McCarthy of lying to Republicans during funding negotiations and working with Democrats on the agreement.\n\nThe McCarthy ouster wouldn't have been successful without the support of Democrats.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., came out swinging when he explained why his caucus shouldn't come to McCarthy's rescue. In a lengthy letter to members, he cited the GOP's \"unwillingness to break from MAGA extremism\" as a chief reason.\n\nJeffries spent a good portion of his political capital on helping topple McCarthy, who failed to reach an agreement with House Democratic leaders on a way to save himself by establishing a bipartisan, coalition government.\n\nThis time around, the motion to vacate didn't have Democratic support.\n\nDemocrats joined the majority of Republicans to defeat Greene's effort after Johnson passed a long-awaited foreign aid package that sent $95 billion to key U.S. allies, including Ukraine. Democrats commended the speaker for not bowing to his hard-right flank, which has grown increasingly hostile toward any continued U.S. assistance to the war-torn nation.\n\n\"We will vote to table Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's Motion to Vacate the Chair. If she invokes the motion, it will not succeed,\" House Democratic leaders said in a statement last week.\n\nThe McCarthy ouster also wouldn't have been successful without the support of the \"Gaetz 8,\" the group of eight Republicans who voted to oust their fellow party member. Of that group, only two supported Greene's effort.\n\nOutside those two, only eight Republicans supported Greene's motion.\n\nHow did Tennessee representatives vote?\n\nTennessee's congressional delegation presented a unified front. Every single representative voted to kill Greene's motion to vacate.\n\nThat's a change from McCarthy's ouster, when Burchett voted to vacate.\n\nHe did so then because he said McCarthy refused to pass a federal budget that addresses overspending. But Burchett was supportive of Johnson after he followed in McCarthy's footsteps, passing a stopgap measure to keep the government open.\n\nBurchett reaffirmed that support by voting to kill Greene's motion to vacate May 8.\n\n\"When I voted to remove the previous speaker, I knew we would get a Republican to replace him,\" Burchett said in a statement. \"That is no longer the case. If we remove Speaker Johnson from his seat, we'll likely get a Democrat to replace him, or a more moderate Republican who is supported by Democrats.\"\n\nHe said he'll keep pushing Johnson, but couldn't vote to remove him knowing his replacement could be \"worse.\"\n\nCould Marjorie Taylor Greene try another motion to vacate?\n\nSure, it's always possible. But Greene didn't comment May 8 on whether she would try again.\n\nAnd the reactions to Greene's effort weren't favorable. It's clear from Republicans' reactions that anyone who brings a motion to vacate forward could face political backlash. Here's what some, have said, according to reporting from the Associated Press.\n\nUSA TODAY reporters Marina Pitofsky, Riley Beggin and Ken Tran contributed to this report.\n\nAllie Feinberg reports on politics for Knox News.

Marjorie Taylor Greene's attempt to oust him after less than seven months in the leadership position.\n\nJohnson's (R-La.) election to the role in October -- following the ouster of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), who then left Congress early -- was seen as a signal of the MAGA flank's hold on the Republican Party. However, since then he has faced criticism from Greene (R-Ga.) and others for, among other things, not shutting down the government.\n\nGreene delivered on her threatened motion to vacate -- provoking boos from fellow lawmakers -- after meeting with Johnson for hours on Monday and Tuesday. The final vote to table her resolution was 359-43, with 196 Republicans and 163 Democrats backing the far-right speaker. Seven Democrats voted present and 21 lawmakers did not vote.\n\nTen Republicans joined Greene in trying to give Johnson the boot: Reps. Andy Biggs (Ariz.), Eric Burlison (Mo.), Eli Crane (Ariz.), Warren Davidson (Ohio), Paul Gosar (Ariz.), Thomas Massie (Ky.), Alex Mooney (W.Va.), Barry Moore (Ala.), Chip Roy (Texas), and Victoria Spartz (Ind.).\n\nAddressing the position of most Democrats, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.) said in a statement:\n\nOur decision to stop Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene from plunging the House of Representatives and the country into further chaos is rooted in our commitment to solving problems for everyday Americans in a bipartisan manner. We need more common sense and less chaos in Washington, D.C.\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene and the extreme MAGA Republicans are chaos agents. House Democrats are change agents. We will continue to govern in a reasonable, responsible, and results-oriented manner and to put people over politics all day and every day.\n\nSome of the 32 Democrats who supported ousting Johnson framed the vote as proof that -- in the words of Rep. Maxwell Alejandro Frost (Fla.) -- the \"GOP really can't govern\" and the \"chaos caucus is on display.\"\n\nCongresswoman Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) similarly declared on social media that \"the GOP chaos caucus continues to do nothing for the American people and instead waste time infighting.\"\n\n\"Speaker Johnson organized an amicus brief effort to overturn the 2020 election. He opposes abortion rights, trans rights, and voting rights,\" Jayapal also said. \"That's why I did not vote to save his speakership.\"\n\nRep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.) also explained his vote on social media, saying: \"Mike Johnson is the most ideological, right-wing speaker since the 1830s. His views and values are directly antithetical to mine. He stands for everything we, as freedom-loving Democrats, proudly stand against. I will never vote to keep him in that chair.\"\n\nCongressman Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) was one of the members who voted present, which does not count for or against passage.\n\n\"Did I vote with the extremist white Christian nationalist who called a motion to vacate the speakership or did I vote to save the extremist homophobic Christian nationalist speaker to keep him in office?\" Pocan said. \"Neither. I voted 'present' on this sideshow.\"", "source": {"uri": "salon.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Salon.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Marjorie Taylor Greene triggers legislation to remove Speaker Johnson from office", "body": "WASHINGTON (TND) -- The House of Representatives swiftly voted down far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort to remove Speaker of the House Mike Johnson from the speakership, voting 359-43 to table the ouster motion.\n\nOverwhelming majorities of both Republicans and Democrats voted to permanently delay the motion, with 196 Republicans and 163 Democrats voting to prevent a return to the abject chaos the House saw in October after former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy was removed from the podium, becoming the first House leader in U.S. history to be forcibly removed from the top job.\n\nGreene triggered the vote Wednesday afternoon, attempting to bring about the next step in a parliamentary procedure she began weeks ago.\n\nShe filed a motion to vacate the chair against Johnson, who was elected Speaker in late October following McCarthy's ouster by the same procedure, in late March after the House successfully passed a $1.2 trillion spending package to avert a government shutdown. In echoes of Rep. Matt Gaetz's, R-Fla., professed rationale for ousting McCarthy, Greene said that Johnson had betrayed conservative principles and the House Republican Conference by agreeing to such a large spending bill and relying on Democratic votes to pass the legislation.\n\n\"No Republican in good conscience can vote for the uniparty minibus. This is not a Republican bill,\" she wrote in a post on X, formerly Twitter. \"It is a Chuck Schumer, Democrat-controlled bill coming from the \"Republican-controlled\" House. The Speaker of the House should not bring it to the floor.\"\n\nGreene gained support in the intervening weeks from a pair of fellow far-right House members, Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., after Johnson brought long-delayed foreign aid funding to support Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan to the House floor over the objection of many conservatives in his conference.\n\n\"Our border cannot be an afterthought. We need a Speaker who puts America first rather than bending to the reckless demands of the warmongers, neocons, and the military-industrial complex making billions from a costly and endless war half a world away,\" Gosar said in a statement to The Hill.\n\nGreene threatened to bring her ouster resolution to the floor last Wednesday but had been meeting with Johnson earlier this week in what were believed to be negotiations over her scrapping the motion to vacate.", "source": {"uri": "cbs6albany.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WRGB"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Hakeem Jeffries of New York, whose leadership team has said it was time to \"turn the page\" on the GOP turmoil and vote to table Greene's resolution -- almost ensuring Johnson's job is saved, for now.\n\nTrump also weighed in after Johnson trekked to Mar-a-Lago for a visit, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee giving the speaker his nod of approval. And Trump's hand-picked leader at the Republican National Committee urged House Republicans off the move.\n\nThe move now poses its own political risks for Greene, R-Ga., a high-profile provocateur.\n\nNational Rep.

Marjorie Taylor Greene to remove Speaker Mike Johnson from his leadership post.\n\nThe motion to table Greene's resolution was overwhelmingly approved with bipartisan support, marking a significant victory for Johnson amidst internal party conflicts.\n\nThe final vote tallied at 359 to 43, with the majority of Democrats joining a substantial number of Republicans to thwart the ousting attempt.\n\nThis vote came as Johnson recently endeavoured to pass a major foreign aid package, which faced staunch opposition from hardline conservative members of his party.\n\nIn response to the potential leadership shake-up, House Democratic leadership had earlier communicated their intention to support Johnson.\n\n\"Democrats will help Johnson keep his job by voting to table,\" announced the Democratic leadership, aligning with Johnson to preserve stability in the House leadership.\n\nThe controversy began when Rep. Greene, after a series of meetings with Speaker Johnson and Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, decided to initiate a motion to vacate the chair.\n\nThis move caught many in the GOP leadership off guard, particularly after what they considered productive discussions that suggested more time before any drastic measures.\n\n\"I was shocked,\" said GOP Rep. Austin Scott of Georgia, reflecting the surprise within Republican ranks following Greene's sudden decision.\n\nThis event underscores the ongoing struggles within the Republican Party and the complex dynamics at play as they navigate leadership challenges and legislative priorities.\n\nThe House was on the brink of a weeklong recess when the motion was introduced, setting a rapid timetable for resolution.\n\nAs the situation continues to unfold, further updates and reactions from both sides of the aisle are expected as lawmakers assess the implications of this vote on future legislative efforts and party unity.", "source": {"uri": "thetrentonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Trent"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ima_matthew@thetrentonline.com", "name": "Ima Matthew", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Scott_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austin Scott (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Massie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Massie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Squash", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Squash", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://www.thetrentonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Mike-Johnson-The-Trent.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551299", "eventUri": "eng-9551299", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia while urging her and other House Republicans to hold off on removing Speaker Mike Johnson for the time being.\n\nOn Wednesday, Greene's motion to oust the speaker failed in a landslide vote of 359-43, with just 11 Republicans supporting the plan.\n\nA whopping 163 Democrats voted to save Johnson, which lends credence to MTG's scathing criticism that he's a puppet of the left. As a reminder, House Democrats vowed last month to block any GOP efforts to remove the Louisiana Republican from the speaker's chair.\n\nHours after the motion failed on Wednesday, Trump urged House Republicans to halt further attempts to boot Johnson, saying the intraparty disunity could weaken the GOP in this fall's elections.\n\nDespite opposing Johnson's ejection, the former president extolled Greene, who led the efforts to boot the incumbent speaker.\n\n\"I absolutely love Marjorie Taylor Greene,\" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. \"She's got Spirit, she's got Fight, and I believe she'll be around, and on our side, for a long time to come.\n\n\"However, right now, Republicans have to be fighting the Radical Left Democrats, and all the Damage they have done to our Country. With a Majority of One, shortly growing to three or four, we're not in a position of voting on a Motion to Vacate. At some point, we may very well be, but this is not the time.\"\n\nThe presumptive GOP presidential nominee said he's doing well in the polls but internal conflicts could hurt him and other Republicans in November.\n\n\"We are leading in the Presidential Polls by a lot, both Nationally and in the Swing States,\" he wrote.\n\n\"Likewise, we are doing well in the Senate, and I believe will do well in the House. But if we show DISUNITY, which will be portrayed as CHAOS, it will negatively affect everything!\"\n\nTrump also complimented the speaker and expressed optimism for the future, as long as Republicans stand together.\n\n\"Mike Johnson is a good man who is trying very hard,\" he wrote. \"I also wish certain things were done over the last period of two months, but we will get them done, together.\n\n\"It is my request that Republicans vote for 'THE MOTION TO TABLE.' We WILL WIN BIG - AND IT WILL BE SOON!\"\n\nThe 10 Republicans who voted with Greene to advance the motion to remove Johnson were:\n\n* Andy Biggs of Arizona\n\n* Eric Burlison of Missouri\n\n* Eli Crane of Arizona\n\n* Warren Davidson of Ohio\n\n* Paul Gosar of Arizona\n\n* Thomas Massie of Kentucky\n\n* Alex Mooney of West Virginia\n\n* Barry Moore of Alabama\n\n* Chip Roy of Texas\n\n* Victoria Spartz of Indiana\n\nGreene and other conservatives have been at odds with Johnson over his support of American taxpayers funding endless foreign wars, especially in Ukraine.\n\nLast month, Johnson spearheaded a $95 billion foreign policy bill that authorizes an additional $61 billion in aid to Ukraine and an additional $26 billion for Israel.\n\nThe bloated foreign aid package passed with Democrats' support.\n\nOn Thursday morning, Massie lamented the United States' self-destructive deficit spending.\n\n\"America is on a path that won't end well,\" he wrote on the social media platform X.\n\n\"We are borrowing money at an unsustainable rate, accumulating enemies through endless war, and eroding rights like free speech & privacy. A Uniparty controls it.\"\n\nWhile Congress is sending billions of U.S. tax dollars to foreign nations, Americans are struggling to pay exorbitant grocery bills as their cities are ravaged by crime

Trump and Johnson are cordial, according to a person with knowledge of their relationship, and granted anonymity to discuss it.\n\n\"He's doing a great job,\" Trump said alongside Johnson after another visit last month, ahead of the House vote to approve a national security package with Ukraine funding that Greene warned would lead to a vote on Johnson's ouster.\n\nIn return for his seal of approval, Trump is increasingly able to rely on the speaker's high-profile standing to legitimize his relentless attacks on the U.S. election process, the judicial system and the multiple criminal cases against him, including the federal indictment for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election ahead of the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack.\n\n\"All these cases need to be dropped,\" says Johnson, a constitutional lawyer, who as the House speaker is second in the line of presidential succession. \"President Trump has done nothing wrong. ... It has to stop.\"\n\nTrump is already pre-emptively contesting the 2024 election as potentially rigged before the first ballots are cast, and Johnson, who helped lead legal challenges to Joe Biden's 2020 election victory, is in a powerful position to again question the legitimacy of the outcome.\n\nAsked this week if he believed the 2020 election was legitimate and if he would stand by the new state-certified results this fall, Johnson shook his head in frustration, and demurred. \"What we're talking about today is the 2024 election, nobody can go back and relitigate what happened in 2020,\" he said.\n\nThe joint venture between Trump and Johnson was in clear focus Wednesday ahead of the House action when the speaker, flanked on the Capitol steps by a who's who of the former president's advisers, announced new legislation that would require proof of citizenship before Americans are eligible to vote.\n\nJohnson had promised Trump a voting-citizenship bill during one of the Mar-a-Lago visits, and the unveiling of it alongside Stephen Miller, the architect of Trump's hardline immigration policies, and others showed just how embedded the former president's Make America Great Again movement has become in the House speaker's agenda.\n\nElection experts said there is scant evidence that non-citizens vote in U.S. elections, and past reviews including one pursued by the Trump administration have not produced significant cases of wrongdoing.\n\nNevertheless, Johnson and the others argued without proof that immigrants are being brought into the U.S. to illegally vote. The legislation can be seen as groundwork for the challenges Trump may pose in the aftermath of the November election.\n\n\"If this bill does not become law, then Joe Biden and Democrats will have engineered one of the greatest interferences in any democratic nation in the history of the world,\" Miller said outside the Capitol.\n\nStill, the legislative push did not placate Greene, who hours later tried and failed to remove the speaker from office.\n\nColleagues booed in protest. An overwhelming majority, 359-43, kept Johnson in his job, for now.\n\n\"I'm proud of what I did today,\" Greene said afterward on the Capitol steps.\n\nIt's the second time in a matter of months that Republicans have worked to oust their own speaker, an unheard of level of party upheaval with a move rarely seen in U.S. history.\n\nWithout Democratic help, Johnson would have certainly faced a more dismal outcome. All told, 196 and 163 Democrats voted to table Greene's motion. But 11 Republicans voted to proceed with the effort, more than it took to remove McCarthy last fall, a first in U.S. history.\n\nDemocrats have also made clear their help was for this moment alone, and not a promise of an enduring partnership for Johnson's survival.\n\n\"Our decision to stop Marjorie Taylor Greene from plunging the country into further chaos is rooted in our commitment to solve problems,\" said Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., after the vote.\n\n\"The only thing we ask of our House Republican colleagues is for traditional Republicans to further isolate the extreme MAGA Republican wing of the GOP,\" said Jeffries, who is in line to become speaker if Democrats win control of the House in the fall. \"We need more common sense and less chaos.\"\n\nAsked about a future motion to vacate the speaker, Jeffries said, \"Haven't given it a thought.\"\n\nBy relying on Democratic backing, Johnson risks inciting more criticism that he is insufficiently loyal to the party.\n\nAnd the threat still lingers -- any single lawmaker can call up the motion to vacate the speaker.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Kevin Freking, Michelle Price, Stephen Groves, Mary Clare

Marjorie Taylor Greene had pledged to hold a snap vote on Speaker Mike Johnson's leadership, the culmination of a threat months in the making. She wouldn't have succeeded in ousting him, after Democrats had announced they'd provide the votes to save Johnson. But, at least in her head, she would have made some sort of point.\n\nBut Greene and her army of two other people have backed off for now, having secured a few hours of chit-chat time with Johnson as an acceptable alternative to a botched execution. Following her second meeting with Johnson in as many days on Tuesday, Greene told reporters that \"the ball is in Mike Johnson's court\" to act on her several \"suggestions\" she proposed to him. She offered no timeline on when she expected a response.\n\n\"That's up to Mike Johnson, and it can't drag out,\" she said. \"These are things that need to be done.\"\n\nThese meetings were called at Greene's request, and if Johnson is feeling any distress, he's not displaying it publicly. He called their conversations \"productive,\" downplaying them as run-of-the-mill talks he'd have with members at any time. \"I heard Marjorie and Thomas [Massie]'s ideas, just like I have every day for the last six months heard others.\" To the extent he was firm with them, though, he said this: \"It's not a negotiation.\"\n\nIndeed, the only one really dragging things out is Greene, not Johnson.\n\nAfter Johnson passed a government-funding bill disliked by Greene (and plenty of other conservatives, albeit those with more limited delusions of grandeur) in March, she warned him that his speakership was on the line. This was effectively a warning to not put Ukraine funding up for a vote next. Johnson did it anyway.\n\nBut the cavalry never arrived for Greene when Congress returned from recess last week. While plenty of conservatives were irate at Johnson for passing bipartisan bills on government funding, surveillance, and Ukraine, their prevailing impulse -- with most meaningful legislative work done for the year -- was just to get through November and hash out their leadership drama afterward. The party's presidential nominee, meanwhile, had no appetite for another House Republican meltdown to embarrass the party while his name is on the ballot. Greene misunderstood both how exhausted her fellow Republicans were with these shenanigans, and how quickly \"governing\" season had pivoted to campaign season following the Ukraine vote. The previous 18 months were for beating up on one another. The next six months are for beating up on leftist extravagances.\n\nSince Greene announced that she would force the vote on Johnson's speakership this week, she has spent most of her time looking for a way to back out, and to stay in Trump's good graces, while saving face. And so she brought to her meeting with Johnson a quartet of demands for the speaker: no more money for Ukraine; defunding special counsel Jack Smith's investigation into Donald Trump; only putting bills up for a vote if they have support of a majority of the majority (the unfortunately named \"Hastert rule\"); and a promise to enact \"a 1 percent across-the-board spending cut as part of stopgap funding legislation if the 12 annual appropriations bills aren't enacted by the Sept. 30 deadline .\"\n\nTo just get through 2024, Johnson could agree to the Ukraine and \"Hastert rule\" provisions without any real consequences. Ukraine assistance is done for the year, and there aren't significant, must-pass bills with limited Republican support on the horizon. The other two provisions -- on \"defunding\" Jack Smith and enacting a blanket spending cut -- have zero Democratic support and, if insisted upon at the next government funding deadline, could cause government shutdowns, for which Republicans would be blamed, a month before the election.\n\nThat said, rather than giving an inch, there's good reason for Johnson to just stand firm here and dare Greene to do something about it. Even if he were able to give her some things here, some things there, giving her anything would reinforce an awful, recurring trend of the 118 Congress that needs to end: that any couple of members can blackmail the speaker into sending the party down a new, risky, and ultimately self-defeating strategic course. And there's no better time for Johnson to end it than during this brief window when Democrats are willing to bail him out.\n\nThe only question for Greene now is how she chooses to claim victory in defeat. She could take some words that Johnson says in a press conference and insist that those words were a hard-fought concession.

Marjorie Taylor Greene called Wednesday for a vote to oust Speaker Mike Johnson, pressing ahead with her long-shot effort despite pushback from Republicans at the highest levels tired of the political chaos.\n\nGreene, who is one of Donald Trump's biggest supporters in Congress, stood on the House floor and read a long list of \"transgressions\" she said Johnson had committed as speaker. Colleagues booed in protest.\n\nThe vote, which under House rules is required within two days, could happen imminently.\n\nThe Georgia Republican had vowed she would force a vote on the motion to vacate the Republican speaker if he dared to advance a foreign aid package with funds for Ukraine, which was overwhelmingly approved late last month and signed into law.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Hakeem Jeffries of New York, whose leadership team has said it was time to \"turn the page\" on the GOP turmoil and vote to table Greene's resolution -- almost ensuring Johnson's job is saved, for now.\n\nTrump also weighed in after Johnson trekked to Mar-a-Lago for a visit, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee giving the speaker his nod of approval.

Marjorie Taylor Greene in her motion to vacate House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) from leadership.\n\nThe House voted 359-43, with 11 Republicans voting against, and seven Democrats choosing to vote present. This came after Monday and Tuesday meetings between Greene and Speaker Johnson to have a meeting of the minds on the issues Greene was having with the Speaker. The fact that this vacate vote was brought on Wednesday could well be a result of those meetings.\n\nGreene is not well-liked amongst her colleagues, and beyond Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar and her partner in this quixotic quest, Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie, Greene was not moving the needle in rallying more Republicans to her cause.\n\nRather than having the motion withdrawn, it might have looked better for Greene to appear resolute, knowing full well that the vote would fail. The normally loquacious and camera-loving Greene has been radio silent since the vote was done. And \"Sassy with Massie\" also didn't go very far.\n\nMassie took to X to lament the power of the Uniparty in keeping Speaker Johnson firmly in place.\n\nIt's not a new paradigm.\n\nSay what you will about Pelosi and the Democrat faction, they aren't stupid -- they know how to play the long game. They also understand that a speakership food fight would destroy any electoral goodwill they might have (which is smaller than they think), and distract from their agendas of abortion, mutilation, destroying norms, and destroying Trump, and not necessarily in that order.\n\nAs reported in April, California Rep. Ro Khanna had already stated he would vote to table any motion to vacate, and both South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn and New York Rep. and Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries alluded to the fact that they would be inclined to do the same. So, why Massie is surprised at this shows that he either had his own agenda, or he simply does not have a clue about the pulse of his own chamber.\n\nPerhaps a bit of both.\n\nJohnson's favorability has also been on the rise over the past few weeks. Soon after the egregious Ukraine aid vote that had Greene's and Massie's hackles up, Johnson exhibited real leadership in addressing the college campus protests erupting across the country and calling for the president of Columbia University to quell the unrest or resign.\n\nIn terms of Republicans and their inclinations, my colleague Duke wrote:\n\nWe only have 182 days until the November election.\n\nThe GOP majority in the House of Representatives is razor-thin.\n\nDuke echoes the sentiments of many Americans, who simply want the House to get down to the business in front of their faces, and the majority of the House agreed. There are much bigger fish to fry, and tabling this motion to vacate vote has at least quelled this distraction so that Congress can get back to business.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com",

Just 10 Republicans sided with Greene to vote against it.\n\n\"I appreciate the show of confidence from my colleagues to defeat this misguided effort,\" Johnson said after the vote. \"Hopefully this is the end of the personality politics and the frivolous character assassination that has defined the 118th Congress.\"\n\nAll seven South Carolina delegation members voted to block Greene's effort.\n\nShortly after the vote, Rep. Russell Fry (R-S.C.) called Greene's effort \"the wrong move at the wrong time.\"\n\n\"Today I voted to table the resolution to declare of [sic] of the Speaker vacant,\" Fry wrote on X, formerly Twitter. \"You don't kick a coach out in the middle of a game.

Nancy Mace (R-S.C.), one of eight GOP members who voted to oust former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) last year, posted a simple \"thumbs up\" emoji after the vote.

Majorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., made good on her threat Wednesday and filed a motion to oust Republican Speaker Mike Johnson from power over his decision to pass billions of dollars in military aid for Ukraine.\n\nShe was booed by colleagues as she formally announced the effort on the House floor.\n\nJohnson's GOP allies are in a strong position to beat back Greene's efforts given that Democratic leaders said on April 30 that their rank-and-file members will step in and vote to \"table\" or dismiss Greene's motion to vacate the speaker's chair.\n\nThis is a developing story.

She met with the speaker twice this week alongside one of her few allies, GOP Representative Thomas Massie.\n\nThe motion was privileged which meant the House would have been forced to vote within 48 hours. However, the vote commenced minutes after Ms Greene finished speaking.\n\nDemocrats and some GOP members had vowed earlier this week to save Mr Johnson, making Wednesday's outcome unsurprising. In the end, 11 GOP lawmakers joined Democrats in doing so.\n\nGOP members lambasted Ms Greene's motion moments after she announced it.\n\n\"It's a gimmick, it's a joke, it's laughable,\" Republican Representative Max Miller told reporters. \"We have real work to do.\"\n\n\"It's going to sow discord...and by the way, it's going to fail,\" GOP Congressman Dusty Johnson said outside the House chambers.\n\nMs Greene criticised Mr Johnson for working with Democrats to pass a series of foreign aid bills which allocated funds to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.\n\nMs Greene had told The Independent on Tuesday that the speaker has been \"working with Democrats the entire time.\"\n\n\"[The Democrats] are ready to deliver the votes to save his speakership, because they support him because of what he's delivered for the Democrats and the Biden agenda,\" she said.\n\nIn their meetings earlier this week, Ms Greene and Mr Massie gave Mr Johnson a list of demands. The pair asked Mr Johnson to block future aid to Ukraine, as well as defund Special Counsel Jack Smith's probes into former president Donald Trump. Mr Smith is investigating the classified documents case and the 6 January riots.\n\nThese asks were largely symbolic because the Senate and President Joe Biden would likely have blocked them.\n\nThe other side levelled similar criticisms on Tuesday while it was still unclear when Ms Greene would bring her motion. Democratic Representative Eric Swalwell of California criticised Greene for seeming wobbly on pushing Mr Johnson out.\n\n\"I can just speak for our side -- we're gonna be the side that wants to get s**t done, we'll be united, we'll deliver the votes,\" he told The Independent. \"And as I said, it looks more like a motion to vacillate than a motion to vacate because she can't decide what she wants to do other than try and be famous.\"\n\nMr Johnson, a GOP representative from Louisiana, became speaker in October 2023. He won the leadership position after 22 days of turmoil in the House of Representatives following the removal of former speaker Kevin McCarthy.\n\nLast week, Ms Greene vowed to bring the motion to vacate against the speaker. At a press conference, Ms Greene and Mr Massie blasted work between Mr Johnson and Mr Jeffries as a culmination of the \"uniparty.\"\n\n\"The uniparty is 'Make Ukraine Great Again,'\" Ms Greene said on 1 May. \"The uniparty is about funding every single foreign war. They think this is the business model that needs to be done.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Massie", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Massie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Miller_(politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Max Miller (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Smith_(lawyer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jack Smith (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mueller_special_counsel_investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mueller special counsel investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusty_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dusty Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speaker (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Swalwell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eric Swalwell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_McCarthy_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin McCarthy (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Subcultures", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Subcultures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/4bdec55efe42530a94a900a03d440fe0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551299", "eventUri": "eng-9551299", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-06", "textStart": 1753, "textEnd": 1762}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-01", "textStart": 2933, "textEnd": 2938}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

House rules require a vote within 48 hours, although the leadership could move to dismiss the resolution within hours.\n\nGreene, a Trump ally, has two public supporters but none of the broader backing on the right that prompted the removal last year of Johnson's predecessor, Kevin McCarthy.\n\nShe is vowing to plow ahead anyway, as she seeks to make Republicans go on the record about whether they support Johnson.\n\nMany right-wing lawmakers are upset with the speaker for relying on Democratic votes to pursue an agenda they see as a betrayal of their conservative outlook on issues from Ukraine aid to government funding.\n\n\"No Republican speaker should ever share power with the Democrats. American voters gave Republicans in the House the majority for a reason... Mike Johnson must resign or be removed,\" Greene posted on X on Friday.\n\nMore from this section NY: ACE Awards 2024 - Arrivals - 53059652 Trump's Courtroom Antics Lead to Judicial Caution 'We've

the House paralyzed for three weeks as they struggled to find a replacement, before finally settling on Johnson.\n\nAnd with the presidential and congressional elections less than six months away, Republicans see threatening Johnson's gavel as divisive and damaging to their prospects of unified control in Washington.\n\nThe voting tally is sure to be scrutinized for what it suggests about Johnson's viability as a Republican leader after November.\n\nSome allies of the speaker fear that his rescue by Democrats could make his position untenable in the long term, although the scale of the pushback against Greene may have stilled their nerves.\n\n\"She's pretty much operating on her own, with one or two others who have expressed support for what she's doing,\" Bob Good, chairman of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, told cable network NewsNation on Sunday.\n\nJohnson condemned the move in an interview on SiriusXM's \"The Laura Coates Show\" on Friday.\n\n\"I think it's wrong for the Republican Party, I think it's wrong for the institution, I think it's wrong for the country,\" he said.\n\nft/sst/dw", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro

House Democrats don't seem much interested in ousting Mike Johnson either, unless it's a scenario in which they can replace him with Hakeem Jeffries.\n\nThen there's Marjorie Taylor Greene, who only cares about causing trouble so she can show off for the rural anti-government types in her district. Greene finally made her long-threatened motion to vacate the chair this afternoon, and she promptly got booed for it:\n\n.\n\n.\n\nSo what happens now? Because Republicans only have a super narrow majority, they do not have the votes to keep Johnson in the Speaker chair. However, some House Democrats have indicated that they will likely protect Johnson from being removed by Greene. It's entirely possible that this is the deal Democrats worked out with Johnson in order to get Ukraine funding passed.\n\nKeep in mind that even if Democrats protect Mike Johnson at this time, House Republicans will still lose the majority if one or two more of their members resign between now and November. So it's possible that Democrats will have gotten Ukraine funding out of Mike Johnson, and will end up being rid of him soon anyway.\n\nIn any case, if we put in the work in the most competitive House races between now and November, the Democrats will win the House majority outright, and Hakeem Jeffries will definitely become Speaker.", "source": {"uri": "palmerreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Palmer Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bill_palmer@palmerreport.com", "name": "Bill Palmer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Subcultures", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Subcultures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 72}], "image": "http://www.palmerreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/marjorie-taylor-greene.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551299", "eventUri": "eng-9551299", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Georgia, who previously had threatened to make the move after Johnson worked with Democrats to pass an aid package to Ukraine and to avoid a government shutdown.\n\n\"The form of the resolution is as follows: Declaring the office of the Speaker of the House of Representatives to be vacant,\" Taylor Greene said Wednesday on the House floor.\n\nThe effort was met by a round of boos from the chamber. It was tabled, 359-43.\n\nRep. Kelly Armstrong, R-North Dakota, and Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-South Dakota, both likened the episode to a \"tantrum.\"\n\nThey voted to table the proposal. Minnesota's delegates also voted to table Taylor Greene's plan, although Rep. Ilhan Omar is only listed as \"present\" on the roll call.\n\n\"The reality of this is this is like the congressional version of a temper tantrum,\" Armstrong said during a visit with reporters that was broadcast by national media outlets.\n\nDusty Johnson was next to Armstrong, adding that \"most of us, by the time we turn 12 years old, figure out that tantrums don't actually work. Apparently, not everybody in Congress has gotten the memo.\"\n\nTaylor Greene had hinted she might attempt the overthrow of Mike Johnson after he worked with Democrats in March on the efforts that sent money to Ukraine and helped avoid a partial shutdown of government services.\n\nMike Johnson took over as speaker in October after Republicans pushed out previous Speaker Kevin McCarthy.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, former President Donald Trump said via social media that he didn't think it was a good time to try to oust Mike Johnson. Only 11 Republicans voted to move forward with the effort to remove the speaker.\n\n\"I appreciate the show of confidence from my colleagues to defeat this misguided effort,\" Mike Johnson said, quoted by the Reuters news agency. \"Hopefully, this is the end of the character assassination that has characterized the current Congress.\"\n\nDusty Johnson didn't hold back during his visit with national reporters outside the Capitol.\n\n\"She is engaged in a failing act of political theater,\" he said of Taylor Greene.", "source": {"uri": "inforum.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "INFORUM"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusty_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dusty Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Armstrong", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kelly Armstrong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilhan_Omar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ilhan Omar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_McCarthy_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin McCarthy (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Some picks pose a conflict of interest\n\nThe motion to vacate rule was approved at the start of this Congress, with then-Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) agreeing to it as a condition for the far-right Freedom Caucus ending their blockade on the vote to elect him speaker. However, he only lasted in that role a few months before Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) and a band of renegades used the rule to throw him out of office, resulting in weeks of chaos that finally resolved with Mike Johnson being elected in his place.\n\nGaetz has claimed he ousted McCarthy for breaking deals with the Freedom Caucus, but he has reportedly admitted in private he really did it as revenge for an Ethics Committee investigation into him.\n\nGreene, a far-right lawmaker known for her embrace of conspiracy theories, was a close ally of McCarthy and opposed that motion to vacate. However, she has become increasingly angered with Johnson as he passed short-term bills to keep the government open, and in particular allowed military defense spending for Ukraine, Taiwan, and Israel to clear the House. She has moved ahead even as former President Donald Trump himself voices support for the current speaker, and House Democrats signal they will intervene to prevent Johnson from being ejected.\n\nWatch the video below or click here.", "source": {"uri": "rawstory.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Raw Story"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_to_vacate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Motion to vacate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusty_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dusty Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Gaetz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matt Gaetz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Caucus", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freedom Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_of_interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conflict of interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Subcultures", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Subcultures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://www.rawstory.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=52202887&width=980", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551299", "eventUri": "eng-9551299", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

House rules require a vote within 48 hours, although the leadership could move to dismiss the resolution within hours.\n\nGreene, a Trump ally, has two public supporters but none of the broader backing on the right that prompted the removal last year of Johnson's predecessor, Kevin McCarthy.\n\nShe is vowing to plow ahead anyway, as she seeks to make Republicans go on the record about whether they support Johnson.\n\nMany right-wing lawmakers are upset with the speaker for relying on Democratic votes to pursue an agenda they see as a betrayal of their conservative outlook on issues from Ukraine aid to government funding.\n\n\"No Republican speaker should ever share power with the Democrats. American voters gave Republicans in the House the majority for a reason... Mike Johnson must resign or be removed,\" Greene posted on X on Friday.\n\nBut rank-and-file lawmakers are wary of repeating the chaos of McCarthy's removal in a right-wing rebellion that left the House paralyzed for three weeks as they struggled to find a replacement, before finally settling on Johnson.\n\nAnd with the presidential and congressional elections less than six months away, Republicans see threatening Johnson's gavel as divisive and damaging to their prospects of unified control in Washington.\n\nThe voting tally is sure to be scrutinized for what it suggests about Johnson's viability as a Republican leader after November.\n\nSome allies of the speaker fear that his rescue by Democrats could make his position untenable in the long term, although the scale of the pushback against Greene may have stilled their nerves.\n\n\"She's pretty much operating on her own, with one or two others who have expressed support for what she's doing,\" Bob Good, chairman of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, told cable network NewsNation on Sunday.\n\nJohnson condemned the move in an interview on SiriusXM's \"The Laura Coates Show\" on Friday.\n\n\"I think it's wrong for the Republican Party, I think it's wrong for the institution, I think it's wrong for the country,\" he said.\n\nft/sst/dw\n\nMore from this section\n\nInnovating Customer Interactions: VOC AI to

Marjorie Taylor Greene called Wednesday for a vote to oust Speaker Mike Johnson, pressing ahead with her long-shot effort despite pushback from Republicans at the highest levels tired of the political chaos.\n\nGreene, who is one of Donald Trump's biggest supporters in Congress, stood on the House floor and read a long list of \"transgressions\" she said Johnson had committed as speaker. Colleagues booed in protest.\n\nThe vote, which under House rules is required within two days, could happen imminently.\n\nThe Georgia Republican had vowed she would force a vote on the motion to vacate the Republican speaker if he dared to advance a foreign aid package with funds for Ukraine, which was overwhelmingly approved late last month and signed into law.\n\nPeople are also reading...

This came after months of warnings from Greene for Johnson to stop working with the Democrats.\n\nIn April, Johnson proposed a $95 billion foreign aid package. The foreign aid package consists of $61 billion for Ukraine, roughly $26 billion for Israel, $9 billion for humanitarian efforts in Gaza, and $8 billion in foreign aid to Taiwan and efforts to counter China's threat in the Indo-Pacific.\n\nDuring a press conference on May 1, Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) revealed \"three betrayals\" Johnson had committed that led Greene and Massie to lead a vote to remove him from the speakership.\n\nThe three betrayals consisted of the passing of the $1.7 billion, 4,155-page omnibus spending bill, the passing of H.R. 7888, the Reforming Intelligence and Securing America Act (RISAA), which reauthorized Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), and Johnson's scheme of passing aid the $95 billion foreign aid package, which was disguised as being four separate bills rolled into one.\n\nTrump continued to add that Johnson was a \"good man who is trying very hard.\"\n\n\"I also wish certain things were done over the last period of two months, but we will get them done, together,\" Trump added. \"It is my request that Republicans vote for 'THE MOTION TO TABLE.'

Pramila Jayapal, who did not support saving the far-right leader.\n\nThe majority of Democrats and Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday saved far-right Speaker Mike Johnson from Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's attempt to oust him after less than seven months in the leadership position.\n\nJohnson's (R-La.) election to the role in October -- following the ouster of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), who then left Congress early -- was seen as a signal of the MAGA flank's hold on the Republican Party. However, since then he has faced criticism from Greene (R-Ga.) and others for, among other things, not shutting down the government.\n\nGreene delivered on her threatened motion to vacate -- provoking boos from fellow lawmakers -- after meeting with Johnson for hours on Monday and Tuesday. The final vote to table her resolution was 359-43, with 196 Republicans and 163 Democrats backing the far-right speaker. Seven Democrats voted present and 21 lawmakers did not vote.\n\nTen Republicans joined Greene in trying to give Johnson the boot: Reps. Andy Biggs (Ariz.), Eric Burlison (Mo.), Eli Crane (Ariz.), Warren Davidson (Ohio), Paul Gosar (Ariz.), Thomas Massie (Ky.), Alex Mooney (W.Va.), Barry Moore (Ala.), Chip Roy (Texas), and Victoria Spartz (Ind.).\n\nAddressing the position of most Democrats, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.) said in a statement:\n\nOur decision to stop Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene from plunging the House of Representatives and the country into further chaos is rooted in our commitment to solving problems for everyday Americans in a bipartisan manner. We need more common sense and less chaos in Washington, D.C.\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene and the extreme MAGA Republicans are chaos agents. House Democrats are change agents. We will continue to govern in a reasonable, responsible, and results-oriented manner and to put people over politics all day and every day.\n\nSome of the 32 Democrats who supported ousting Johnson framed the vote as proof that -- in the words of Rep. Maxwell Alejandro Frost (Fla.) -- the \"GOP really can't govern\" and the \"chaos caucus is on display.\"\n\nCongresswoman Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) similarly declared on social media that \"the GOP chaos caucus continues to do nothing for the American people and instead waste time infighting.\"\n\n\"Speaker Johnson organized an amicus brief effort to overturn the 2020 election. He opposes abortion rights, trans rights, and voting rights,\" Jayapal also said. \"That's why I did not vote to save his speakership.\"\n\nRep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.) also explained his vote on social media, saying: \"Mike Johnson is the most ideological, right-wing speaker since the 1830s. His views and values are directly antithetical to mine. He stands for everything we, as freedom-loving Democrats, proudly stand against. I will never vote to keep him in that chair.\"\n\nCongressman Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) was one of the members who voted present, which does not count for or against passage.\n\n\"Did I vote with the extremist white Christian nationalist who called a motion to vacate the speakership or did I vote to save the extremist homophobic Christian nationalist speaker to keep him in office?\" Pocan said. \"Neither. I voted 'present' on this sideshow.\"", "source": {"uri": "commondreams.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Common Dreams"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

For its part, the motion of no confidence introduced in October against McCarthy occurred after the budget agreement reached with President Joe Biden to avoid a government shutdown.\n\nAs evening fell on the Capitol, Greene heard an orchestra of laughter and boos in the background as she read her list of grievances against Johnson, whom she has accused of being a \"false Republican\" for prioritizing foreign aid over America First, the flagship motto of her ally. Donald Trump. \"When he has to choose between Republican priorities or allying with the Democrats to preserve his own power, Johnson regularly chooses the Democrats,\" he denounced, and continued with his formal announcement: \"I call for you to consider that the position of president of the House of Representatives is declared vacant.\"\n\nThe vote began immediately and soon confirmed that Greene did not have the support of her colleagues even to bring the proposal to consideration. In this election year, Republicans have wanted to show unity around Johnson's leadership. Matt Gaetz's historic motion in October had better luck, which resulted in 216 votes in favor and 210 against, and which, unlike this one, received explicit support from Trump.\n\nThe Republican candidate has spent the weekend trying to mediate between two politicians loyal to his parish, Johnson and Greene, but he has not prevented the congresswoman's attempted rebellion. The speaker, a career lawyer, led the attempt in 2020 to reverse Biden's victory in the elections through legal means, and has repeatedly defended that they were rigged. Despite this, and his profile as an anti-abortion ultraconservative, the Democrats have saved him his position as a reward for allowing the vote on aid to Ukraine, which was approved with a majority of Republicans against.", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_impeachment_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal impeachment in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trumpism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trumpism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America_First_(policy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "America First (policy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Motion of no confidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.usanews.net/images/haberler/2024/05/_3cc0f.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551299", "eventUri": "eng-9551299", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

The whole House of Representative booed her because they hate her and want her to get lost in traffic. Nobody took her seriously. She sneered at the Democrats.\n\nThere was a motion to table her resolution, i.e. make it fuck off and die. It won resoundingly, which means she lost. the vote was 359 to 43, which broke down to 196 Republicans and 163 Democrats voting yes, 11 Republicans and 32 Democrats voting no.\n\nIt happened faster than Donald Trump making coitus grunts with a woman who isn't his wife.\n\nAt one point, Greene quoted Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, who said, \"Even though we're in the minority, we effectively have been governing as if we were in the majority.\" Democrats hooted and hollered. This made Thomas Massie (who looks like if a fart was a person) soooooo angry, and he shouted, \"SPEAKER, THE HOUSE IS NOT IN ORDER!\"\n\nNobody respects him either, which is fine, because he doesn't deserve it.\n\nThat video is worth your time:\n\nDemocratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz made fun of the videos on Twitter, saying this was Greene's \"I Have A Dream\" speech.\n\nMany long minutes after Greene's swift failure, Donald Trump chimed in on Truth Social to impotently make it look like he had ordered the result of the vote. Note how he leaves open the possibility that maybe Republicans can shiv Mike Johnson later, just not right now when they only have a majority of one. (Unspoken: Marjorie Taylor Greene, you uneducated moron.)\n\nSo that's how that went.\n\n\"I want to say that I appreciate the show of confidence from my colleagues to defeat this misguided effort, that is certainly what it was,\" Johnson said afterward. \"Hopefully, this is the end of the personality politics and the frivolous character assassination that has defined the 118th Congress.\"\n\nMike Johnson wins!\n\nYou know, until Greene or some other mouthbreather does this again, perhaps at a time more to Donald Trump's liking. And Democrats might not save him next time, per Axios. Jamie Raskin called it a \"one-shot deal.\"\n\nSo Mike Johnson shouldn't be under the impression he won. He's a fucking loser, just like Greene and Massie. Just in a different way.\n\nI have profiles those other places but I think I forgot how to log on.", "source": {"uri": "wonkette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Wonkette"}, "authors": [{"uri": "evan_hurst@wonkette.com", "name": "Evan Hurst", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Massie", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Massie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Tecumseh_Sherman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William Tecumseh Sherman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/118th_United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "118th United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Moskowitz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jared Moskowitz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Raskin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Raskin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axios_(website)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Axios (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Sustainability", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Sustainability", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:best,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fwonkette.substack.com%2Fapi%2Fv1%2Fpost_preview%2F144473895%2Ftwitter.jpg%3Fversion%3D4", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551299", "eventUri": "eng-9551299", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

Colleagues booed in protest.\n\nThe vote, which under House rules is required within two days, could happen imminently.\n\nThe Georgia Republican had vowed she would force a vote on the motion to vacate the Republican speaker if he dared to advance a foreign aid package with funds for Ukraine, which was overwhelmingly approved late last month and signed into law.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia officially called for Mike Johnson's removal from his position as Speaker of the House of Representatives Wednesday evening, triggering the next step in a parliamentary procedure she began weeks ago.\n\nGreene filed a motion to vacate the chair against Johnson, who was elected Speaker in late October following Kevin McCarthy's ouster from office by the same procedure, in late March after the House successfully passed a $1.2 trillion spending package to avert a government shutdown. In echoes of Rep. Matt Gaetz's, R-Fla., professed rationale for ousting McCarthy, Greene said that Johnson had betrayed conservative principles and the House Republican Conference by agreeing to such a large spending bill and relying on Democratic votes to pass the legislation.\n\n\"No Republican in good conscience can vote for the uniparty minibus. This is not a Republican bill,\" she wrote in a post on X, formerly Twitter. \"It is a Chuck Schumer, Democrat-controlled bill coming from the \"Republican-controlled\" House. The Speaker of the House should not bring it to the floor.\"\n\nGreene gained support in the intervening weeks from a pair of fellow far-right House members, Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., after Johnson brought long-delayed foreign aid funding to support Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan to the House floor over the objection of many conservatives in his conference.\n\n\"Our border cannot be an afterthought. We need a Speaker who puts America first rather than bending to the reckless demands of the warmongers, neocons, and the military-industrial complex making billions from a costly and endless war half a world away,\" Gosar said in a statement to The Hill.\n\nGreene threatened to bring her ouster resolution to the floor last Wednesday, but had been meeting with Johnson earlier this week in what were believed to be negotiations over her scrapping the motion to vacate.", "source": {"uri": "fox11online.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WLUK"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Before joining Raw Story, he wrote for Shareblue and AlterNet, specializing in election and policy coverage.\n\nWhile Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) took to the House floor on Wednesday to introduce her motion to vacate House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) from office, a group of her fellow Republican lawmakers gathered on the Capitol steps to rail against what she was doing -- and one lawmaker in particular didn't seem to rule out supporting some form of punishment for Greene.\n\n\"Do you think Marjorie Taylor Greene should be punished?\" one reporter asked Rep.

However, he only lasted in that role a few months before Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) and a band of renegades used the rule to throw him out of office, resulting in weeks of chaos that finally resolved with Mike Johnson being elected in his place.\n\nGaetz has claimed he ousted McCarthy for breaking deals with the Freedom Caucus, but he has reportedly admitted in private he really did it as revenge for an Ethics Committee investigation into him.\n\nGreene, a far-right lawmaker known for her embrace of conspiracy theories, was a close ally of McCarthy and opposed that motion to vacate. However, she has become increasingly angered with Johnson as he passed short-term bills to keep the government open, and in particular allowed military defense spending for Ukraine, Taiwan, and Israel to clear the House. She has moved ahead even as former President Donald Trump himself voices support for the current speaker, and House Democrats signal they will intervene to prevent Johnson from being ejected.\n\nWatch the video below or click here.", "source": {"uri": "rawstory.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Raw Story"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_to_vacate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Motion to vacate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_McCarthy_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin McCarthy (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlterNet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AlterNet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rensselaer_Polytechnic_Institute", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Marcos,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Marcos, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Marcos, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusty_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dusty Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Gaetz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matt Gaetz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Caucus", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freedom Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_of_interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conflict of interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_budget_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military budget of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Subcultures", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Subcultures", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.rawstory.com/media-library/rep-marjorie-taylor-green-r-ga-blurted-out-in-the-middle-of-president-joe-biden-s-state-of-the-union-speech-say-her-name.png?id=51683096&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C19%2C0%2C19", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551299", "eventUri": "eng-9551299", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

One unnamed member of Congress speaking anonymously to Politico dismissed Greene's motion as \"fundraising.\"\n\n\"She's pissed off because she was friends with [former Speaker Kevin] McCarthy and she missed the first vacancy, so she called the second vacancy,\" the member said.\n\nREAD MORE: House Democratic leaders confirm they'll back Johnson if 'pro-Putin' MTG tries to remove him\n\nRep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Georgia), whose congressional district (the 11th) borders Greene's (the 14th), said the far-right lawmaker has reason to worry about losing the support of her constituents after trying to boot a sitting Republican speaker. He added that she even defied former President Donald Trump in pursuing her doomed motion.\n\n\"People are calling me saying: 'Please, tell her to not do this.' Mike is a good man. He's doing the best he can. Trump's calling her and telling her not to,\" Loudermilk said. \"I think she's lost a whole lot of respect in her district.\"\n\nOther Republicans -- particularly from swing districts -- have been loudly expressing their distaste with the firebrand congresswoman. Politico reported that Rep. Mike Lawler (R-New York) said that \"Moscow Marjorie has clearly gone off the deep end -- maybe the result of a space laser.\" That comment is likely a reference to a 2018 social media post Greene made alleging that California wildfires were the fault of \"lasers or blue beams of light\" caused by a family of Jewish bankers.\n\n\"Why do those losers get all of the attention?\" wondered Rep. Brandon Williams (R-New York), when seeing Greene surrounded by a slew of journalists and photographers.\n\nREAD MORE: 'We'll protect him': Dems say they'll side with Johnson after MTG files motion to vacate\n\nGreene spent hours in Johnson's office earlier this week, in which the speaker presumably attempted to convince her to abandon her effort. However, the Georgia Republican held fast to her position that Johnson wasn't doing enough to pass conservative policy victories, and was being overly accommodating to House Democrats in his bipartisan work to keep government agencies funded and send more funding overseas to help Ukraine fight its war with Russia.\n\n\"I'm proud of myself, because this is the whole reason why I ran for Congress,\" Greene told a gaggle of reporters on Capitol Hill. \"I'm sick and tired of the Republican Party that never does what they say they're going to do. I'm tired of them making promises on television.\"\n\n\"I'm doing everything I promised my district when I ran for Congress,\" she added.\n\nAfter winning her primary unopposed earlier this year, Greene will face off against Democrat Shawn Harris.

Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.) ripped into Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's attempts to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), accusing her of going \"off the deep end.\"\n\n\"Moscow Marjorie has clearly gone off the deep end, maybe the result of a space laser,\" Lawler told reporters Wednesday. \"But this type of tantrum is absolutely unacceptable. And it does nothing to further the cause of the conservative movement.\"\n\nLawler's remark about a \"space laser,\" refers to a controversial post from Greene (R-Ga.) in 2018, when she suggested that a \"laser beam or light beam\" from \"space solar generators,\" controlled by a wealthy Jewish family, might be to blame for devastating wildfires in California.\n\n\"The only people who have stymied our ability to govern are the very people that have pulled these types of stunts throughout the course of this Congress to undermine the House Republican majority,\" Lawler continued.\n\nLawler's remarks followed the House's vote Wednesday to block a conservative attempt to boot Johnson from the Speakership. The effort was spearheaded by Greene, who in a surprise Wednesday, moved to force a vote on her motion to vacate against Johnson.\n\nIn a 359-43-7 vote, the lower chamber passed a motion to table Greene's resolution, preventing it from hitting the floor for a vote. This came as little surprise after several Republicans and Democrats suggested they would protect Johnson as Greene held the threat over him for weeks.\n\nGreene's motion to vacate was publicly backed by only two other Republicans -- Reps. Thomas Massie (Ky.) and Paul Gosar (Ariz.) -- who cited Johnson's policy decisions in recent weeks.\n\nLawler argued the lack of congressional action on several conservative priorities can be at least partly blamed on Greene and others who hamper the Speaker's ability to negotiate.\n\n\"Members in our conference who have continually undermined the Speaker's ability to negotiate ... that is why if they're so upset about the things that haven't happened, they should take a look in the mirror, starting with Marjorie Taylor Greene,\" he said.\n\nThe New York Republican was one of several GOP members to criticize Greene's efforts. Rep. Steve Womack (R-Ark.) on Wednesday called the attempt a \"petty political stunt.\"\n\n\"Some members would rather upend Republicans' work instead of advancing the conservative agenda. Americans sent us to Washington to govern,\" Womack wrote in a post on social platform X.\n\nJohnson on Wednesday thanked his colleagues for their support following the failed vote.\n\n\"As I've said from the beginning, and I've made clear every day, I intend to do my job. I intend to do what I believe to be the right thing, which is what I was elected to do, and I'll let the chips fall where they may,\" Johnson said. \"In my view, that is leadership.\"\n\nThe Hill reached out to Greene's office for comment.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "miranda_nazzaro@thehill.com", "name": "Miranda Nazzaro", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greene_County,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Greene County, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Greene County, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Lawler", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Lawler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_to_vacate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motion to vacate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Massie", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Massie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_house", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lower house"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Gosar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Gosar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Womack", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Womack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hill_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Hill (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/lawlermichael_101123gn01_w.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551299", "eventUri": "eng-9551299", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

In hindsight, she probably should've stuck to her original instinct. NBC News reported:\n\nThe last time the House voted on such an effort was in October, when eight Republicans turned against then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy. They were joined by House Democrats, and the result was a narrow 216-210 vote.\n\nGoing into this new showdown, everyone on both sides of the aisle knew that Greene's effort wouldn't be nearly as close, and it wasn't. A total of 11 House Republicans, including Greene, voted to proceed with the effort, while 196 GOP members rejected it. Among Democrats, 163 members of the House minority joined with Republicans to scuttle the scheme; 32 voted to advance it; and 7 Democrats voted \"present.\"\n\nWhat happens now? When it comes to the congressional process, nothing. Greene took her best shot; she failed spectacularly; and lawmakers will now go back to their previously scheduled plans. The Georgian could theoretically try again at some point, but it's unlikely that a second attempt would be any more successful than the first.\n\nBut that's not to say this gambit was inconsequential. On the contrary, when assessing what Greene has to show for her efforts, it's important to realize that she ended up with less than nothing: The radical congresswoman is much worse off than she was before. As The Washington Post reported overnight:\n\nTaking stock, Greene not only picked a dramatic fight without a coherent strategy to succeed, she did so in such a way that alienated her ostensible allies. What's more, the congresswoman settled on a series of rather specific demands she expected GOP leaders to meet, but ended up receiving exactly zero concessions from Johnson and his team.\n\nTo be sure, the Republican extremist wasn't exactly a respected figure on Capitol Hill before, but as the dust settles on the latest example of GOP chaos, Greene appears weaker, more isolated, and more feeble.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chip_Roy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chip Roy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_to_vacate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Motion to vacate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hill_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Hill (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_McCarthy_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin McCarthy (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ZqkrH1KBQxuXM1amiFVM6A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/msnbc_articles_593/836db61426dbab3a7dd519975e58043f", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551299", "eventUri": "eng-9551299", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

He survived an attempt by hardline Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene on Wednesday to remove him as speaker, with the support of most of his party's 217-213 House majority and from Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Many Democrats also voted for Johnson to avoid a replay of October's chaos.\n\nSince winning the speaker's gavel, Johnson has dropped the narrow views of a relatively untried congressman from northwest Louisiana, serving his fourth term in the House, and embraced the political realities of national leadership. That evolution has angered enough party hardliners to seriously diminish his chances of remaining Republican House leader next year, regardless of whether the party holds its majority in the Nov. 5 election. \"I'm proud to serve in this position. It's not one that I aspired to. It's not one that I ever expected to have or planned for,\" Johnson said after Wednesday's vote. \"But it is the honor of my life and career to do this, and I will do it so long as this body will have me do that.\"\n\nWhen he won the speaker's gavel last October, the 52-year-old was viewed as a likeable but inexperienced candidate with no political enemies, who opposed U.S. aid to Ukraine, favored strict border restrictions and brought a strong Christian conservative record to culture war issues such as abortion. He had also played a leading role in House Republican objections to 2020 presidential election results following Trump's false claims that he lost to Democratic President Joe Biden because of voter fraud. Those claims, and the support they drew from Republicans in Congress, led to the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\n'THAT'S WHAT LEADERS DO' As speaker, Johnson has come to rely on Democrats to help him avoid government shutdowns, safeguard U.S. efforts against terrorism, aid Ukraine's struggle against Russian invasion - and now, save his job.\n\n\"He learned there was another side of the story. That's what leaders do. They're not dug in on their positions,\" said Representative Brian Fitzpatrick, a Republican centrist from Pennsylvania. Johnson spent hours in closed-door meetings this week listening to demands from Greene and her hardline ally Representative Thomas Massie, and later told reporters that the meetings were part of his open-door strategy to keep the Republican conference together by spending \"endless hours\" talking to members.\n\n\"It takes a lot of time. This is why I don't get enough sleep these days,\" Johnson said. \"You have to quite literally get everyone to work together,\" he added. \"I take Marjorie's ideas and Thomas' and everybody else's, and we assess them on their own value.\"\n\nJohnson's performance on spending bills and aid to U.S. allies has won him positive reviews from Republicans as well as some Democrats, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Some Republicans say his stature as a party leader has been undercut by support from Democrats, who relished the chance last year to eject former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who was known for his fundraising prowess and political acumen.\n\n\"He's a better speaker for them than some of the other options, not because he's willing to work with them, but because you can outflank him,\" said one House Republican who spoke on condition of anonymity. This Republican lawmaker, who voted to protect Johnson's job this week, said Democrats view Johnson's underlying conservative credentials as a plus for November - a point underscored by progressive Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\n\"Mike Johnson is still a dangerous leader who seeks to strip abortion rights and who also supported overturning the election and setting the stage for Jan. 6,\" she told reporters.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType":

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nJohnson survived an ouster vote this week by one of Trump's biggest supporters in Congress, far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, his job secured only after House Democrats turned out in force to put an end to the GOP chaos, for now.\n\nBut the oversized role Trump played in propping up Johnson cannot be understated -- or relied upon to save the speaker again.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIn fact, the indicted former president who has been known to flip his friends into foes warned that while Republicans shouldn't be voting to remove Johnson, \"At some point, we may very well be, but this is not the time.\"\n\nThe outcome puts on display the fragility of the unexpected but strategically beneficial alliance that Trump and Johnson have formed ahead of the November election when both hope to be returned to power -- the Republican president in the White House and the loyal foot soldier in Congress.\n\n\"Seems like they're on the same page, and I think that's great,\" said lawyer Cleta Mitchell, who was a key figure in Trump's efforts to challenge the 2020 election.\n\nJohnson has worked diligently to align himself with the former president, the conservative Christian setting aside his once critical views of the presidential contender to present himself as a chief implementer of the Trump Republican Party's Make America Great Again agenda on Capitol Hill.\n\nBarely six months on the job, since Johnson replaced the ousted then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy, the new leader has dashed multiple times to Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort, securing crucial support, including at a glitzy Republican National Committee gala this past weekend.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nWhen Trump invited Johnson to the stage to say a few words, the speaker praised the former president as the \"strongman\" the country needs in the White House. Trump and Johnson are cordial, according to a person with knowledge of their relationship, and granted anonymity to discuss it.\n\n\"He's doing a great job,\" Trump said alongside Johnson after another visit last month, ahead of the House vote to approve a national security package with Ukraine funding that Greene warned would lead to a vote on Johnson's ouster.\n\nIn return for his seal of approval, Trump is increasingly able to rely on the speaker's high-profile standing to legitimize his relentless attacks on the U.S. election process, the judicial system and the multiple criminal cases against him, including the federal indictment for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election ahead of the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack.\n\n\"All these cases need to be dropped,\" says Johnson, a constitutional lawyer, who as the House speaker is second in the line of presidential succession. \"President Trump has done nothing wrong. ... It has to stop.\"\n\nTrump is already pre-emptively contesting the 2024 election as potentially rigged before the first ballots are cast, and Johnson, who helped lead legal challenges to Joe Biden's 2020 election victory, is in a powerful position to again question the legitimacy of the outcome.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAsked this week if he believed the 2020 election was legitimate and if he would stand by the new state-certified results this fall, Johnson shook his head in frustration, and demurred. \"What we're talking about today is the 2024 election, nobody can go back and relitigate what happened in 2020,\" he said.\n\nThe joint venture between Trump and Johnson was in clear focus Wednesday ahead of the House action when the speaker, flanked on the Capitol steps by a who's who of the former president's advisers, announced new legislation that would require proof of citizenship before Americans are eligible to vote.\n\nJohnson had promised Trump a voting-citizenship bill during one of the Mar-a-Lago visits, and the unveiling of it alongside Stephen Miller, the architect of Trump's hardline immigration policies, and others showed just how embedded the former president's Make America Great Again movement has become in the House speaker's agenda.\n\nElection experts said there is scant evidence that non-citizens vote in U.S. elections, and past reviews including one pursued by the Trump administration have not produced significant cases of wrongdoing.\n\nNevertheless, Johnson and the others argued without proof that immigrants are being brought into the U.S. to illegally vote. The legislation can be seen as groundwork for the challenges Trump may pose in the aftermath of the November election.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"If this bill does not become law, then Joe Biden and Democrats will have engineered one of the greatest interferences in any democratic nation in the history of the world,\" Miller said outside the Capitol.\n\nStill, the legislative push did not placate Greene, who hours later tried and failed to remove the speaker from office.\n\nColleagues booed in protest. An overwhelming majority, 359-43, kept Johnson in his job, for now.\n\n\"I'm proud of what I did today,\" Greene said afterward on the Capitol steps.\n\nIt's the second time in a matter of months that Republicans have worked to oust their own speaker, an unheard of level of party upheaval with a move rarely seen in U.S. history.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nWithout Democratic help, Johnson would have certainly faced a more dismal outcome. All told, 196 and 163 Democrats voted to table Greene's motion. But 11 Republicans voted to proceed with the effort, more than it took to remove McCarthy last fall, a first in U.S. history.\n\nDemocrats have also made clear their help was for this moment alone, and not a promise of an enduring partnership for Johnson's survival.\n\n\"Our decision to stop Marjorie Taylor Greene from plunging the country into further chaos is rooted in our commitment to solve problems,\" said Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., after the vote.\n\n\"The only thing we ask of our House Republican colleagues is for traditional Republicans to further isolate the extreme MAGA Republican wing of the GOP,\" said Jeffries, who is in line to become speaker if Democrats win control of the House in the fall. \"We need more common sense and less chaos.\"\n\nAsked about a future motion to vacate the speaker, Jeffries said, \"Haven't given it a thought.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBy relying on Democratic backing, Johnson risks inciting more criticism that he is insufficiently loyal to the party.\n\nAnd the threat still lingers -- any single lawmaker can call up the motion to vacate the speaker.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Kevin

Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia.\n\nThe 359-43 vote on a motion to table Greene's measure required the help of Democrats, given the speaker's narrow majority. The vote could quiet calls for Johnson's removal among conservative hardliners, who have been angry about his support of a $95 billion foreign aid package that passed last month.\n\nJohnson's divided conference was evident on Wednesday as 11 Republicans sided with Greene, while 196 opposed her effort. Additionally, 163 Democrats voted to table Greene's motion, effectively protecting the speaker. Twenty-eight members from both parties either didn't vote or voted present.\n\nThe vote comes after Johnson's predecessor, former Republican Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California, was ousted in October by eight members of his own caucus. Only two Republicans voted against both Johnson and McCarthy: Reps.

The threat to his role as the functional head of the lower chamber of the U.S. Congress came from far-right Republican lawmaker and unabashed supporter of former President Donald Trump, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, whose grouse with Mr. Johnson was that he had shepherded and seen through a bill to provide a $95 billion national security aid package to Israel, Ukraine and other U.S. allies in Asia, with the bill for military support to Kyiv coming in at $61 billion. \"By passing the Democrats' agenda and handcuffing the Republicans' ability and influence legislation, our elected Republican Speaker Mike Johnson has aided and abetted the Democrats and the Biden administration in destroying our country,\" Ms. Greene said, in a speech on the floor of the house that was booed by her fellow Congressmen. In March, Ms. Greene had filed a motion that would trigger a vote to remove Mr. Johnson, and earlier this week she had warned that she would be bringing that motion to a vote. While Mr. Trump is said to have complimented Ms. Greene in a post on the Truth Social platform, even he said that he believed that Republicans were \"not in a position\" to be voting Mr. Johnson out.\n\nTo a significant extent, the House has become the testing ground for factional supremacy within the ranks of the Republican Party, a simmering conflict that has intensified as the presidential election of November 2024 has drawn closer. The lower house witnessed a similar pattern of turmoil during the election of Mr. Johnson's immediate predecessor, California Congressman Kevin McCarthy, who had to engineer no fewer than 15 rounds of voting to finally secure the Speaker's chair. Ultimately Mr. McCarthy was dismissed from the role in late October 2023 when his tenure was abruptly ended by a motion to vacate foisted by members of the House Freedom Caucus. This ultra-conservative group has broadly backed the political agenda of Mr. Trump and routinely attacked 'mainstream' Republican lawmakers who have relied on bipartisan cooperation to get bills passed, including critical funding for U.S. allies. Even as Voting Day approaches fast from the horizon, moderate congressional Republicans are faced with the festering dilemma that to win their re-election bids they cannot be seen as spoilers who made it harder for Congress to forge critical bipartisan legislation, yet the popularity of Mr. Trump and the stubbornness of his House ideologues make it difficult for them to repudiate a more combative approach to politics.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene made sure to milk every moment of the six weeks since she filed her motion to vacate. Inexplicably, she regularly paraded around the Hill with her boyfriend -- Right Side Broadcasting Network host Brian Glenn -- and was often also accompanied by her cueballed press secretary Nick Dyer. When Greene finally actually called for a vote on Wednesday night and a group of centrist Republicans gathered, Glenn and Dyer watched on. Dyer lit a cigarette. Glenn told me he supported his girlfriend \"one hundred per cent.\"\n\nGreene relished the fact that amid multiple important votes in Congress -- including lawmakers passing legislation to keep the government open and assisting allies like Ukraine -- all of the reporters huddled around her and asked for her thoughts. This happened despite the fact that she never had the votes to depose Mike Johnson. She didn't really have anything serious to offer him, either.\n\nWhen she finally pulled her motion to vacate on Wednesday, she enraged Republicans and Democrats alike for the simple reason that they were all about to go home early. It was just before a final round of votes, after which the House had already decided to let everyone leave. That might have been why representatives from both sides groaned, hollered and heckled her.\n\nHopefully, Greene enjoyed all that attention on Wednesday, when her attempt to boot Johnson failed spectacularly, because it will likely be the peak of her relevance. Unlike Matt Gaetz's successful motion to vacate against Kevin McCarthy, this vote has rendered Greene impotent. Her decision to trigger the motion despite the fact that she had little chance of success likely means she will have little power. Even her most powerful ally, Donald Trump, publicly rebuked her.\n\nThere is no other way to interpret Greene's decision than this: She had repeatedly been on the wrong side of the internal House Republican civil war. When Republicans took control of the House, she decided to align herself with Kevin McCarthy in hopes that she would get the committee assignments Democrats took away from her for making bigoted and conspiracy-mongering comments.\n\nThe alliance between Greene and McCarthy was surprising, given that McCarthy was a creature of the swampy establishment the MAGA wing always loathed. But Greene argued the need to get behind McCarthy in order to mitigate the risk that some Republicans might make a Democrat speaker.\n\nBy doing so, she wound up becoming part of the very establishment that Trump had spent years railing against. Meanwhile, her former friends like Gaetz and Representative Lauren Boebert of Colorado all blocked McCarthy -- which put Greene in the uncomfortable position of defending the establishment. When the House nearly devolved into fisticuffs, one of the more iconic photos that emerged showed Greene getting Trump on the phone and Representative Matt Rosendale brushing her off.\n\nJoining up with McCarthy proved to be temporarily beneficial to Greene. She joined the House Education and Workforce Committee (Republicans always change the name from \"Education and Labor\" when they're in charge, lest they sound too pro-union) and got to display nude pictures of Hunter Biden at Oversight Committee hearings.\n\nBut she began to lose her ability to credibly call herself a rebel. She voted for the debt limit agreement McCarthy's team brokered with the White House, despite calling it a \"s**t sandwich.\" Her needling of the Freedom Caucus -- the OG conservative hellraisers who are pros at making a speaker's life miserable -- led them to kick her out.\n\nMeanwhile, when she publicly threatened to break with McCarthy and said she'd file a motion to vacate if he didn't start an impeachment inquiry into Biden, it rang hollow. Everyone knew she wouldn't really do it: it would mean she would lose the power she had worked so hard to acquire.\n\nThe only thing she seemed effective at doing was stonewalling aid to Ukraine. Even when McCarthy sealed his fate by passing a stopgap spending bill in September, it did not come with aid to Ukraine -- a notable concession to Greene.\n\nHer desire to hold onto such power was precisely why she opposed vacating McCarthy when Gaetz pulled off his coup with seven other Republicans. She made occasional noise during the 22 days of the speaker-less Thunderdome but they mostly came off as wimpers and she didn't receive nearly as much attention for them as Nancy Mace, Gaetz, Chip Roy or Ken Buck.\n\nWhen Johnson, a far more MAGA-friendly speaker, came into office, Greene's influence further diminished -- especially as the impeachment inquiry sputtered along and Trump reassumed the formal mantle of standard bearer of the GOP.\n\nAnd ultimately, Gaetz's stunt also neutered Greene, because Johnson came to realise he could never placate the hard-right Republicans -- so he simply ignored them. His main grunts' desire to keep things normal and his willingness to work with Democrats meant they considered him a far more honest broker. Greene's bargaining price therefore became more expensive than anything Democrats could offer, even if that equaled billions of aid in Ukraine.\n\nIn truth, Greene's motion should not be seen as a chance for her to reassert her control of the party, but rather as an act of desperation. It was her attempt to re-seize the messaging wars and the spotlight from Gaetz, Mace and Boebert. Part of the reason it failed so spectacularly was because she created an impossible dilemma for herself by filing her motion so publicly. If she had never filed, she would look like a coward who backed down despite her pugnacious reputation; but if she called a vote and lost, she would be rendered powerless. She put herself between a rock and a hard place.\n\nShe obviously chose to call the vote, dragging out the process long enough to earn two meetings with Johnson and far-right Kentucky Representative Thomas Massie. This all happened despite the fact that Trump opposed it and despite the fact that only one member of the \"Gaetz Eight\" -- Representative Eli Crane -- voted against tabling the measure.\n\nDoing so has now made her look like the exact same thing that Trump mocks: a loser and a hater.\n\nAfter months of diverting the spotlight to herself, Greene has found herself on an empty stage. She never prevented the passage of the one thing she hated -- Ukraine aid -- and also failed to push her other project, the Biden impeachment.\n\nConversely, Johnson seems to have cracked the code of doing just enough MAGA -- he appeared with Representative Chip Roy in a press conference just hours before Roy voted against tabling Greene's motion -- while also managing the basic functions of governing. Johnson might be too polite to punish Greene. He might be. But then again, the polite ones are always the most dangerous.\n\nFor the past two years, Greene has garnered the press corps' attention because of her closeness to Trump and her ability to bend Republican leadership to her will. All the while, reporters gave her a platform to spout the most repulsive and repugnant rhetoric, with little to no consequences.\n\nNow that she has failed, she should receive less play than any other backbencher. Her fire is suddenly and ingloriously extinguished, just like the ashes of her flack's cigarette on the steps of the Capitol.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Marjorie Taylor Greene\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@RepMTG) May 9, 2024\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) disdainfully pointed out Johnson's statement on X, writing, \"Mike Johnson when asked if he will stop the witch hunt that aims to throw President Trump in jail FOR LIFE!\"\n\nGreene and Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY), who partnered to pull the trigger Wednesday night forcing a vote to eject Johnson after weeks pressuring him to end his coalition government with Democrats, had been pressuring Johnson to put up a fight against Democrats with spending bills and other must-pass legislation, such as the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) reauthorization, currently being considered.\n\nWednesday afternoon, Johnson, who had already surrendered leverage on the FAA bill to the Senate, unexpectedly scheduled a vote on a one-week FAA extension that would give Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) more time to finalize a package before the Friday night deadline.

Many Democrats also voted for Johnson to avoid a replay of October's chaos.\n\nSince winning the speaker's gavel, Johnson has dropped the narrow views of a relatively untried congressman from northwest Louisiana, serving his fourth term in the House, and embraced the political realities of national leadership. That evolution has angered enough party hardliners to seriously diminish his chances of remaining Republican House leader next year, regardless of whether the party holds its majority in the Nov. 5 election.\n\n\"I'm proud to serve in this position. It's not one that I aspired to. It's not one that I ever expected to have or planned for,\" Johnson said after Wednesday's vote. \"But it is the honor of my life and career to do this, and I will do it so long as this body will have me do that.\"\n\nWhen he won the speaker's gavel last October, the 52-year-old was viewed as a likeable but inexperienced candidate with no political enemies, who opposed U.S. aid to Ukraine, favored strict border restrictions and brought a strong Christian conservative record to culture war issues such as abortion.\n\nHe had also played a leading role in House Republican objections to 2020 presidential election results following Trump's false claims that he lost to Democratic President Joe Biden because of voter fraud. Those claims, and the support they drew from Republicans in Congress, led to the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\n'THAT'S WHAT LEADERS DO'\n\nAs speaker, Johnson has come to rely on Democrats to help him avoid government shutdowns, safeguard U.S. efforts against terrorism, aid Ukraine's struggle against Russian invasion - and now, save his job.\n\n\"He learned there was another side of the story. That's what leaders do. They're not dug in on their positions,\" said Representative Brian Fitzpatrick, a Republican centrist from Pennsylvania.\n\nJohnson spent hours in closed-door meetings this week listening to demands from Greene and her hardline ally Representative Thomas Massie, and later told reporters that the meetings were part of his open-door strategy to keep the Republican conference together by spending \"endless hours\" talking to members.\n\n\"It takes a lot of time. This is why I don't get enough sleep these days,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"You have to quite literally get everyone to work together,\" he added. \"I take Marjorie's ideas and Thomas' and everybody else's, and we assess them on their own value.\"\n\nJohnson's performance on spending bills and aid to U.S. allies has won him positive reviews from Republicans as well as some Democrats, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nSome Republicans say his stature as a party leader has been undercut by support from Democrats, who relished the chance last year to eject former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who was known for his fundraising prowess and political acumen.\n\n\"He's a better speaker for them than some of the other options, not because he's willing to work with them, but because you can outflank him,\" said one House Republican who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nThis Republican lawmaker, who voted to protect Johnson's job this week, said Democrats view Johnson's underlying conservative credentials as a plus for November - a point underscored by progressive Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\n\"Mike Johnson is still a dangerous leader who seeks to strip abortion rights and who also supported overturning the election and setting the stage for Jan. 6,\" she told reporters.\n\n(Reporting by David Morgan; Editing by Scott Malone and Leslie Adler)",

Direct to your inbox. Sign up for the Morning Report newsletter\n\nPresident Biden defended his economic record Wednesday, citing a recent consumer sentiment report that he said backs him up.\n\nHis green-eyeshade defense using a university report was not the sort of sales pitch many Democratic candidates preferred from Biden, who visited Racine, Wis., a battleground state that may decide next year's Oval Office occupant. Trump won Wisconsin by one point in 2016 and Biden won the state by a point in 2020.\n\nThe president, comparing his policies with those of former President Trump, rejected polls that show that voters trust Trump on the economy more than they trust Biden.\n\nDuring an interview with CNN, the president was hard pressed to construct an accessible story about how his economic policies are affecting real Americans.\n\n\"We've already turned it around,\" Biden said from Wisconsin. \"The polling data has been wrong all along.\"\n\nIn an unusual concession about an election-year vulnerability, he added that polls show voters \"think the nation's not in good shape, but [they think] they're personally in good shape.\"\n\nBiden recommended voters \"look at the markets'\" for reactions to the recent 1.6 percent gross domestic product report for the first quarter, which indicated a slowing economy. Cooling indicators of output are expected to lower inflationary pressures. Democratic presidents for eons have argued that Wall Street bets are not the real economy; Main Street holds the tape measure.\n\nVoters complain about inflation, rising gas prices, high interest rates, unaffordable housing costs and the sticker shock of college tuition. Voters gauge the health of any economy relying on what they see and experience. They blame incumbent presidents when they're anxious, and they look to political challengers when they're shopping for change.\n\nEven some of Biden's closest allies and surrogates have conceded that his economic sales pitch to Americans \"is a work in progress.\" Election Day is six months away.\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton, who transformed George H.W. Bush into a one-term president amid a recession, told an audience two months after his inauguration, \"I'd a lot rather get beat trying to put people to work than get beat fighting putting people to work.\"\n\nBiden conceded Wednesday that voters have many reasons for worrying their purchase power and their economic well-being have eroded. But he said 15 million jobs have been created during his term and wages are higher. He criticized Trump as invested in the wealthy, not the middle class, and as a spinner of economic promises, many of them illusions.\n\nReuters: Biden touts $3.3 billion Microsoft data center at failed Foxconn site Trump backed in Wisconsin.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump's hush money criminal trial resumes today in Manhattan. And House Republicans on Wednesday underscored deep internal divisions by voting with help from Democrats to table a motion triggered by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) to try to oust Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.). The vote to shield Johnson was 359-43-7, but both Republicans wound up weakened by the tempest. More about those events, below.\n\nGREENE FADES: The Speaker on Wednesday easily survived a move by Greene to strip him of the GOP role he's held for seven months. The House on a bipartisan basis overwhelmingly voted to table the Georgia lawmaker's efforts to oust Johnson because she believes he's collaborated with Democrats and backed more U.S. aid to Ukraine.\n\nThe Hill: These are the lawmakers who voted against tabling Greene's measure to oust Johnson.\n\n\"I appreciate the show of confidence from my colleagues to defeat this misguided effort,\" Johnson said after Wednesday's vote. \"That is certainly what it was ... Hopefully,\" he added, \"this is the end of the personality politics and the frivolous character assassination that has defined the 118th Congress.\"\n\nThe chamber voted 359-43-7, with Johnson receiving expected support from Democrats and Republicans alike. The final vote -- which was widely expected amid bipartisan opposition to Greene's gambit -- deals a major blow to the Georgia Republican. Only 11 Republicans supported Greene's motion, while 196 voted to keep Johnson in the Speaker's chair. Democrats overwhelmingly voted to save Johnson, with 163 in support of keeping him and 32 against.\n\nJohnson, who won the gavel in October following the ouster of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), will remain in the top job, but is now in the precarious position of being a GOP Speaker propped up by Democrats.\n\nMembers loudly booed Greene as she called up the resolution and jeered when she read it aloud. As she recited the measure, airing her grievances against Johnson in a more than 10-minute speech, Republicans lined up on the House floor to shake the Speaker's hand and pat him on the back. Still, Greene made clear that even if her attempt to depose the Speaker were unsuccessful, she still saw value in publicly undermining him (The Hill and The New York Times).\n\n\"If he remains Speaker with\" Democrats' help, she said on social media, \"he's fully compromised.\"\n\nFLIPPING THE SCRIPT: Sen. Ted Cruz's (R-Texas) push to finish work on the bipartisan Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) reauthorization has put him square in the middle of a Senate fight, a position that is a far cry from those his colleagues are used to as he takes a mini-detour from his role as a conservative rabble-rouser. Cruz, the top Republican on the Commerce Committee, has played the lead role for the party throughout the push to re-up the FAA's authority ahead of Friday's deadline.\n\nBut the irony is not lost on lawmakers who have watched Cruz up close and personal, especially on government spending battles throughout the years.\n\n\"It's been entertaining to be able to watch,\" one Senate Republican told The Hill's Al Weaver before quoting the movie \"Airplane!\" \"What's the old Hollywood joke? The foot's on the other hand.\"\n\nRepublican lawmakers on Wednesday went after the leaders of prominent U.S. K-12 school systems over what they say is a lack of enforcement when antisemitic incidents occur in their districts. New York City Public Schools Chancellor David Banks rebutted assertions and pushed back on lawmakers' claims that the entire New York City public school system is antisemitic, noting that while some members of Congress have said antisemitic things, he does not cast all of Congress as antisemitic (The Hill).\n\nNO U.S. WEAPONS: Biden on Wednesday warned the U.S. would stop supplying Israel with offensive weapons including bombs and artillery shells if Israeli forces launch an invasion of Rafah. His new red line emerges weeks after U.S. public demonstrations over the conflict in Gaza and months after he and other U.S. officials warned Israeli counterparts about the humanitarian repercussions of any military offensive in Rafah.\n\n\"Civilians have been killed in Gaza as a consequence of those bombs and other ways in which they go after population centers,\" told CNN. \"I made it clear that if they go into Rafah -- they haven't gone in Rafah yet -- if they go into Rafah, I'm not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the cities -- that deal with that problem.\"\n\nIsrael has launched \"targeted strikes\" against the southern Gaza city where more than a million Palestinians have taken shelter, though Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said a full-scale invasion is on the horizon.\n\nBiden has grown increasingly frustrated with Netanyahu in private, and last month suggested in a call with the prime minister that the U.S. could reassess its support for Israel if it did not do more to protect civilians and humanitarian workers (The Hill and The Wall Street Journal).\n\nNEGOTIATORS FROM ISRAEL AND HAMAS met in Cairo on Wednesday amid a renewed international push for a cease-fire in Gaza, though Israeli officials said that major gaps remain. In a sign of the growing urgency, Netanyahu met CIA Director William Burns on Wednesday afternoon in Israel, The New York Times reports. Burns has been shuttling across the region in recent days to try and clinch a cease-fire deal that would see the release of hostages held in Gaza and Palestinian prisoners held in Israel.\n\nHamas announced Wednesday it was unwilling to make more concessions to in truce negotiations, although talks were still under way in Cairo aimed at pausing Israel's seven-month-old offensive (Reuters).\n\nThe World Health Organization said Wednesday that the closure of the Rafah border crossing in Gaza meant health services in the southern part of the enclave would run out of fuel in three days. While Israel said it reopened a key Gaza border crossing in Kerem Shalom after a rocket attack, the United Nations said no aid has entered (Yahoo News and The Washington Post).\n\n\"All the fuel that entered Gaza went through Rafah crossing,\" said Jeremy Konyndyk, president of Refugees International. \"The whole aid operation runs on fuel, so if the fuel is cut off, the humanitarian operation collapses. Water can't be pumped. Lights cannot be kept on in hospitals. Vehicles cannot distribute aid.\"\n\nTRUMP WORLD\n\nFEDERAL CASES: Judge Aileen Cannon's indefinite delay on Tuesday of Trump's documents trial is placing yet another hurdle in the former president's pathway to seeing trial in any of his federal cases ahead of the election. The Hill's Rebecca Beitsch reports Trump's other federal trial is also facing roadblocks to reaching trial before the election, with proceedings in his Jan. 6 case on pause until the Supreme Court resolves a bid by the former president to toss the case by arguing he is immune from prosecution. If the cases don't reach trial before November and Trump wins, his Justice Department would almost certainly drop all charges.\n\nThe Hill: Senate Democrats are venting their fury over Cannon's decision to cancel the start date of the documents trial, accusing the Trump appointee of \"deliberately slow-walking\" the case.\n\nA GEORGIA APPEALS COURT agreed Wednesday to review a lower court's decision not to disqualify Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis (D) from prosecuting Trump in his election interference case in the state (The Hill).\n\nHUSH MONEY TRIAL: Trump's hush money trial will resume today with cross-examination of adult film actress Stormy Daniels, who testified earlier this week. Judge Juan Merchan, during a Tuesday sidebar conference, warned the former president for \"cursing audibly\" while Daniels was testifying (The Hill).\n\n\"I understand that your client is upset at this point, but he is cursing audibly, and he is shaking his head visually and that's contemptuous. It has the potential to intimidate the witness and the jury can see that,\" Merchan said during the brief sidebar, which took place just before the court's morning break.\n\nThe Hill: Is Trump still publicly railing about a New York gag order and fines for violations imposed on him by Merchan? You bet.\n\nMEDICAL MATTERS: Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., 70, has faced previously undisclosed health issues, including a parasite that he said ate part of his brain and died there (The New York Times). He has been hospitalized at least four times for atrial fibrillation, a common heart arrythmia that increases the risk of stroke, and he was previously diagnosed with mercury poisoning. \"I have cognitive problems, clearly,\" he said in the 2012 deposition. \"I have short-term memory loss, and I have longer-term memory loss that affects me.\" He says he has recovered from memory loss and has no aftereffects from the brain parasite. He declined to release his medical records, the Times reported.\n\nCNN: Kennedy is officially on ballots in five states -- Michigan, Utah, Hawaii, Delaware and California. His campaign says it's gathered enough signatures to put him on the ballot in two more battlegrounds, North Carolina and Nevada, as well as Ohio, Idaho, Nebraska and Iowa.\n\nBrick and mortar: Trump lobbied late Tuesday on social media in favor of keeping a new FBI building in Washington, although selection of a Maryland location was completed. It would be \"the centerpiece\" of his plan to \"totally renovate and rebuild\" Washington, D.C., if elected, he added. Keeping a new FBI headquarters in the nation's capital, according to Trump, would be \"important for ending violent crime, which I will do, quickly,\" he wrote in all caps (The Hill).", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alexis_simendinger@thehill.com", "name": "Alexis Simendinger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "kristina_karisch@thehill.com", "name": "Kristina Karisch", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hill_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Hill (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inauguration_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inauguration of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Department_of_Education", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City Department of Education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxconn", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foxconn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_H._W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George H.

And it does nothing to further the cause of the conservative movement.\"\n\nLawler's remark about a space laser refers to a controversial post from Greene in 2018, when she suggested that a \"laser beam or light beam\" from \"space solar generators,\" controlled by a wealthy Jewish family, might be to blame for devastating wildfires in California.\n\n\"The only people who have stymied our ability to govern are the very people that have pulled these types of stunts throughout the course of this Congress to undermine the House Republican majority,\" Lawler continued.\n\nLawler's remarks followed the House's vote Wednesday to block a conservative attempt to boot Johnson from the Speakership. The effort was spearheaded by Greene, who in a surprise Wednesday, moved to force a vote on her motion to vacate against Johnson.\n\nIn a 359-43-7 vote, the lower chamber passed a motion to table Greene's resolution, preventing it from hitting the floor for a vote. This came as little surprise after several Republicans and Democrats suggested they would protect Johnson as Greene held the threat over him for weeks.\n\nGreene's motion to vacate was publicly backed by only two other Republicans -- Reps. Thomas Massie (Ky.) and Paul Gosar (Ariz.) -- who cited Johnson's policy decisions in recent weeks.\n\nLawler argued the lack of congressional action on several conservative priorities can be at least partly blamed on Greene and others who hamper the Speaker's ability to negotiate.\n\n\"Members in our conference who have continually undermined the Speaker's ability to negotiate ... that is why if they're so upset about the things that haven't happened, they should take a look in the mirror, starting with Marjorie Taylor Greene,\" he said.\n\nThe New York Republican was one of several GOP members to criticize Greene's efforts.

Marjorie Taylor Greene has finally out-stupid-ed herself.\n\nThat's no small task. Or maybe it's a task so small that it can't be seen with the naked eye. Regardless, Greene's flailing and ultimately failed attempt to oust Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson for the crime of governing failed miserably Wednesday, bringing a chorus of boos down on the congresswoman and likely marking the end of her preposterous moment in American politics.\n\nGreene read her resolution to give Johnson the boot, saying: \"Now, therefore be it resolved that the office of the speaker of the House of Representatives is hereby declared to be vacant.\"\n\nTo which an unlikely coalition of Republicans and Democrats said, via a 359-43 vote to dismiss Greene's nonsense: \"That's about enough of that, you goofball.\"\n\nGreene's anger at Johnson started when he dared to pass legislation\n\nThe mess started after Johnson got his unruly GOP coalition to join Democrats and pass a much-needed foreign aid package that helped Ukraine and other American allies.\n\nApparently, \"doing things\" was a bridge too far for Greene, so she spent the past few weeks threatening Johnson's speakership and babbling on right-wing podcasts about how Republicans were caving to Democrats and blah, blah, blah.\n\nTrump trial update: Stormy Daniels spills details about alleged Trump affair. How will they spin this one?\n\nBut the Georgia lawmaker found few Republican friends who would follow her down this path, which clearly surprised her.\n\nOnly in today's GOP could a ridiculous figure like Greene gain power\n\nGreene's approach to politics - loud, wrong and, if that doesn't work, louder and wronger - had somehow managed to turn her into a Republican of influence. It was, in the most literal sense imaginable, dumb luck.\n\nDonald Trump's rampant dishonesty and penchant for being the worst person in the room made boorish, bloviating behavior something Republicans aspired to, and few have proved better at it than Greene. She is, in all ways, ridiculous, a caricature of a person who shouldn't be allowed near any lever of power.\n\nRepublicans still lying about voting: Trump and the RNC want slow counting of mail ballots to target Biden supporters\n\nAnd yet, she's in the halls of power, and she's on congressional committees and Trump seems to like her (because she lies for him) and ... well ... things just don't seem to make a lot of sense these days.\n\nBut there was always a problem with someone like her, someone so good at parroting Trump's utter disregard for facts or knowledge.\n\nGreene's tried to out-Trump Donald Trump, and it didn't go well\n\nThat problem, in today's GOP, is there can only be one person who gets away with lying and bullying and punishing people for no good reason, and that one person is Trump.\n\nHe - the MAGA king - didn't want Greene trying to oust Johnson. As much as Trump loves Greene's obsequiousness and pliable morality, her motion to vacate was a nonstarter. It's too close to the election, and an internal revolt would make House Republicans look chaotic, which they are.\n\nWhat Trump says goes, so Greene found herself a virtual loner on a quixotic quest to do the noisiest, dumbest thing possible.\n\nApparently incapable of not making a scene, she ignored Trump and pushed ahead, and on Wednesday finally - after several years of atrociousness - she was seen as the powerless, outmatched showboater she is.\n\nGreene's magnificently malevolent moment may have peaked\n\nGreene's Herculean displays of vacuousness always had an endpoint, even in a political party as uniquely absurd and useless as one helmed by Trump.\n\nIn 2021, she slid, hand-in-glove, into a Republican Party that has an appetite for stupidity. But like a dull-witted Icarus, she has now flown too close to the dumb.\n\nGreene won't go away, but her influence in the party she so eagerly sought to make worse will wane.\n\nShe has seen the limits of Trump's support, and her colleagues now have the permission structure necessary to shun the unserious monster they created.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Many Democrats also voted for Johnson to avoid a replay of October's chaos.\n\nSince winning the speaker's gavel, Johnson has dropped the narrow views of a relatively untried congressman from northwest Louisiana, serving his fourth term in the House, and embraced the political realities of national leadership. That evolution has angered enough party hardliners to seriously diminish his chances of remaining Republican House leader next year, regardless of whether the party holds its majority in the Nov. 5 election.\n\n\"I'm proud to serve in this position. It's not one that I aspired to. It's not one that I ever expected to have or planned for,\" Johnson said after Wednesday's vote. \"But it is the honor of my life and career to do this, and I will do it so long as this body will have me do that.\"\n\nWhen he won the speaker's gavel last October, the 52-year-old was viewed as a likeable but inexperienced candidate with no political enemies, who opposed U.S. aid to Ukraine, favored strict border restrictions and brought a strong Christian conservative record to culture war issues such as abortion.\n\nHe had also played a leading role in House Republican objections to 2020 presidential election results following Trump's false claims that he lost to Democratic President Joe Biden because of voter fraud. Those claims, and the support they drew from Republicans in Congress, led to the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\n'THAT'S WHAT LEADERS DO'\n\nAs speaker, Johnson has come to rely on Democrats to help him avoid government shutdowns, safeguard U.S. efforts against terrorism, aid Ukraine's struggle against Russian invasion - and now, save his job.\n\n\"He learned there was another side of the story. That's what leaders do. They're not dug in on their positions,\" said Representative Brian Fitzpatrick, a Republican centrist from Pennsylvania.\n\nJohnson spent hours in closed-door meetings this week listening to demands from Greene and her hardline ally Representative Thomas Massie, and later told reporters that the meetings were part of his open-door strategy to keep the Republican conference together by spending \"endless hours\" talking to members.\n\n\"It takes a lot of time. This is why I don't get enough sleep these days,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"You have to quite literally get everyone to work together,\" he added. \"I take Marjorie's ideas and Thomas' and everybody else's, and we assess them on their own value.\"\n\nJohnson's performance on spending bills and aid to U.S. allies has won him positive reviews from Republicans as well as some Democrats, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nSome Republicans say his stature as a party leader has been undercut by support from Democrats, who relished the chance last year to eject former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who was known for his fundraising prowess and political acumen.\n\n\"He's a better speaker for them than some of the other options, not because he's willing to work with them, but because you can outflank him,\" said one House Republican who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nThis Republican lawmaker, who voted to protect Johnson's job this week, said Democrats view Johnson's underlying conservative credentials as a plus for November - a point underscored by progressive Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\n\"Mike Johnson is still a dangerous leader who seeks to strip abortion rights and who also supported overturning the election and setting the stage for Jan. 6,\" she told reporters.\n\n(Reporting by David Morgan; Editing by Scott Malone and Leslie Adler)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., saying \"this is not the time\" to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson.\n\nThe House of Representatives on Wednesday killed an effort by Greene and Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., to vote on vacating the chair.\n\nGreen appeared to catch most Congressional watchers by surprise when she moved to force a vote on her motion to vacate the chair, which should have allowed for the vote.\n\nThough she has been seen in the past touting a MAGA hat in favor of Trump, the former president called on Republicans to table her motion.\n\n\"I absolutely love Marjorie Taylor Greene. She's got Spirit, she's got Fight, and I believe she'll be around, and on our side, for a long time to come,\" Trump posted on Truth Social. \"However, right now, Republicans have to be fighting the Radical Left Democrats, and all the Damage they have done to our Country. With a Majority of One, shortly growing to three or four, we're not in a position of voting on a Motion to Vacate. At some point, we may very well be, but this is not the time.\"\n\nHOUSE SQUASHES MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE'S MOTION TO OUST SPEAKER JOHNSON\n\nHe continued to say he is leading in the presidential polls, both nationally and in swing states.\n\nTrump said Republicans are doing well in the Senate, and he believed the party would do well in the House.\n\nHe then warned about giving off the message that Republicans were not unified.\n\nMARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE FILES MOTION TO OUST SPEAKER JOHNSON\n\n\"But if we show DISUNITY, which will be portrayed as CHAOS, it will negatively affect everything,\" he wrote. \"Mike Johnson is a good man who is trying very hard. I also wish certain things were done over the last period of two months, but we will get them done, together.\n\n\"It is my request that Republicans vote for \"THE MOTION TO TABLE,\" Trump added. \"We WILL WIN BIG - AND IT WILL BE SOON!\"\n\nJohnson got overwhelming Democratic and Republican support for the table vote, which passed 359 to 43, averting a vote on her motion. Just 11 Republicans voted against tabling the measure, along with 32 Democrats.\n\nHOUSE DEMS SAY THEY'LL BLOCK MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE FROM OUSTING SPEAKER JOHNSON\n\nOn the Republican side, Johnson won the support of 196 members, while 163 Democrats also voted to shield him.\n\nThe House GOP side of the chamber erupted in cheers when her move was squashed.\n\nGreene has been threatening to force a vote on taking Johnson's gavel since late March in protest of his handling of government funding and foreign aid.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHer resolution, known as a motion to vacate the chair, will now have to be voted on or tabled after Greene noticed it as \"privileged\" on Wednesday night -- meaning House leaders have two legislative days to take it up.\n\nFox News Digital's Elizabeth Elkind contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "greg_wehner@foxnews.com", "name": "Greg Wehner", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Massie", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Massie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chad"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Chad"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_Republicans", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Radical Republicans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_to_vacate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Motion to vacate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greene_County,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greene County, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Greene County, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/1024/512/trump-johnson-greene.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551299", "eventUri": "eng-9551299", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

It's regrettable, it's not who we are as Americans, and we're better than this. We need to get beyond it.\"\n\nBut while it may appear this was a simple case of the House working in unison, other factors and machinations were almost certainly at play.\n\nIt appears that former President Donald Trump saw potential disunity in the House as detrimental to his re-election hopes this November. Despite his past support for Greene, he made his thoughts and feelings known in advance of the bill's introduction:\n\n\"I absolutely love Marjorie Taylor Greene. She's got Spirit, she's got Fight, and I believe she'll be around, and on our side, for a long time to come.\n\n\"However, right now, Republicans have to be fighting the Radical Left Democrats, and all the Damage they have done to our Country. With a Majority of One, shortly growing to three or four, we're not in a position of voting on a Motion to Vacate. At some point, we may very well be, but this is not the time.\"\n\n\"But if we show DISUNITY, which will be portrayed as CHAOS, it will negatively affect everything,\" he continued in his Truth Social thread. \"Mike Johnson is a good man who is trying very hard. I also wish certain things were done over the last period of two months, but we will get them done, together... It is my request that Republicans vote for THE MOTION TO TABLE... We WILL WIN BIG - AND IT WILL BE SOON!\"\n\nAnd the former president may well have a point from a tactical strategy perspective.\n\nAs he leads in the polling, Mr. Trump will be wary of anything that upsets that trajectory or risks handing a significant victory to DC Democrats in Congress. After all, if - as polls indicate - he is on track to win the November election, his tenure in office could be born into the chaos of gaining the presidency but losing the legislature; effectively making him a lame-duck president on his first day back in office.\n\nTrump seems all too aware that if he is to create a lasting legacy, he needs more than just a pen and a phone.\n\nWhile House Democrats will no doubt claim a minor victory in ensuring the current speaker serves at their pleasure, a successful ousting would have perhaps provided a bevy of more damaging political ammunition.\n\nThe narrative from the Democrat leadership - and, indeed, the Biden-friendly Fourth Estate - has been that the \"adults are back in charge.\" The party can now rightly claim that that they put country before partisan politics - although political optics were almost certainly the unspoken goal. Backing the move to oust Johnson would have created a whirlwind of chaos that had the potential to become a double-edged danger.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) demurred on whether his caucus would support Johnson if another motion came to the floor. Instead, he opted for a bipartisan stance, saying he and his party would \"continue to solve problems for everyday Americans to put people over politics, as we once again did today.\" But his response may be only the thin veneer to an otherwise calculated risk.\n\nOn one hand, voting not to table the motion would have caused chaos within the GOP, allowing a slew of negative articles and soundbites over Republican disfunction. On the other, however, Biden is sinking badly in the polls and a solid legislative win could turn around the precipitous decline.\n\nIf President Joe Biden had been in a stronger position politically, it seems likely that the slim GOP majority would today be hunting for a compromise candidate.", "source": {"uri": "libertynation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liberty Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_angelides@libertynation.com", "name": "Mark Angelides", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/118th_United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "118th United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_Republicans", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Radical Republicans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partisan_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Partisan (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HarperCollins", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "HarperCollins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lame_duck_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lame duck (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Legislature"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.libertynation.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2152099163-min.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551299", "eventUri": "eng-9551299", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 143, "textEnd": 148}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

Mike Thompson (D-CA) expressed his exasperation with the whole idea -- and opined that Greene was taking things way too far.\n\n\"What have you thought of this week, MTG having all these private meetings with Speaker Johnson?\" asked Laslo. \"One of her top requests is defunding the special counsel, Jack Smith. What do you think of that?\"\n\n\"I just think that she's overplayed her hand, she's become more insignificant than she's ever been, and she's incredibly disruptive for, in regard to those of us who are here to do a job,\" said Thompson. \"She's not a serious legislator.\"\n\nRep.

Yesterday, the House of Representatives killed an effort by Republicans Marjorie Taylor Greene and Thomas Massie to force a vote on Speaker Mike Johnson's ouster. It was an overwhelming vote, 359-43-7, and it was brought by Greene just before she got a gentle rebuke from Donald Trump: \"I absolutely love Marjorie Taylor Greene,\" Trump posted on Truth Social. \"She's got Spirit, she's got Fight, and I believe she'll be around, and on our side, for a long time to come. However, right now, Republicans have to be fighting the Radical Left Democrats, and all the Damage they have done to our Country. With a Majority of One ... we're not in a position of voting on a Motion to Vacate. At some point, we may very well be, but this is not the time.\" Trump went on to cite his party's strong position in the polls before adding: \"But if we show DISUNITY, which will be portrayed as CHAOS, it will negatively affect everything! Mike Johnson is a good man who is trying very hard. I also wish certain things were done over the last period of two months, but we will get them done, together.\" When the voting results were announced, the GOP side of the House let loose with a cheer, after which Speaker Johnson said: \"I want to say that I appreciate the show of confidence from my colleagues to defeat this misguided effort. That is certainly what it was. I've said from the beginning, and I've made clear here every day [that] I intend to do my job.

Marjorie Taylor Greene has finally out-stupid-ed herself.\n\nThat's no small task. Or maybe it's a task so small that it can't be seen with the naked eye. Regardless, Greene's flailing and ultimately failed attempt to oust Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson for the crime of governing failed miserably Wednesday, bringing a chorus of boos down on the congresswoman and likely marking the end of her preposterous moment in American politics.\n\nGreene read her resolution to give Johnson the boot, saying: \"Now, therefore be it resolved that the office of the speaker of the House of Representatives is hereby declared to be vacant.\"\n\nTo which an unlikely coalition of Republicans and Democrats said, via a 359-43 vote to dismiss Greene's nonsense: \"That's about enough of that, you goofball.\"\n\nThe mess started after Johnson got his unruly GOP coalition to join Democrats and pass a much-needed foreign aid package that helped Ukraine and other American allies.\n\nApparently, \"doing things\" was a bridge too far for Greene, so she spent the past few weeks threatening Johnson's speakership and babbling on right-wing podcasts about how Republicans were caving to Democrats and blah, blah, blah.\n\nTrump trial update: Stormy Daniels spills details about alleged Trump affair. How will they spin this one?\n\nBut the Georgia lawmaker found few Republican friends who would follow her down this path, which clearly surprised her.\n\nGreene's approach to politics - loud, wrong and, if that doesn't work, louder and wronger - had somehow managed to turn her into a Republican of influence. It was, in the most literal sense imaginable, dumb luck.\n\nDonald Trump's rampant dishonesty and penchant for being the worst person in the room made boorish, bloviating behavior something Republicans aspired to, and few have proved better at it than Greene. She is, in all ways, ridiculous, a caricature of a person who shouldn't be allowed near any lever of power.\n\nRepublicans still lying about voting: Trump and the RNC want slow counting of mail ballots to target Biden supporters\n\nAnd yet, she's in the halls of power, and she's on congressional committees and Trump seems to like her (because she lies for him) and ... well ... things just don't seem to make a lot of sense these days.\n\nBut there was always a problem with someone like her, someone so good at parroting Trump's utter disregard for facts or knowledge.\n\nThat problem, in today's GOP, is there can only be one person who gets away with lying and bullying and punishing people for no good reason, and that one person is Trump.\n\nHe - the MAGA king - didn't want Greene trying to oust Johnson. As much as Trump loves Greene's obsequiousness and pliable morality, her motion to vacate was a nonstarter. It's too close to the election, and an internal revolt would make House Republicans look chaotic, which they are.\n\nWhat Trump says goes, so Greene found herself a virtual loner on a quixotic quest to do the noisiest, dumbest thing possible.\n\nApparently incapable of not making a scene, she ignored Trump and pushed ahead, and on Wednesday finally - after several years of atrociousness - she was seen as the powerless, outmatched showboater she is.\n\nGreene's Herculean displays of vacuousness always had an endpoint, even in a political party as uniquely absurd and useless as one helmed by Trump.\n\nIn 2021, she slid, hand-in-glove, into a Republican Party that has an appetite for stupidity. But like a dull-witted Icarus, she has now flown too close to the dumb.\n\nOpinion alerts: Get columns from your favorite columnists + expert analysis on top issues, delivered straight to your device through the USA TODAY app. Don't have the app?

Marjorie Taylor Green (R-GA) and Thomas Massie (R-KY) have worked tirelessly for weeks to hold Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) accountable. Wednesday, they made their move.\n\nThe duo pulled the trigger Wednesday night to force a vote on their motion to \"remove the Uniparty speaker,\" as Massie said afterward.\n\nGreene read her resolution on the floor before Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) forced a vote to table the resolution.\n\nAn astounding 163 Democrats voted to continue Johnson's coalition government with Democrats in a 359 to 43 vote.\n\nAfter the vote, Massie shared the text of Greene's resolution, which earned jeers and interruptions from who Greene fingered as \"the uniparty.\"\n\nThe full text of the resolution, which excoriates Johnson's record, is here:\n\nH. RES. 1209\n\nDeclaring the office of Speaker of the House of Representatives to be vacant.\n\nMs. GREENE of Georgia submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Rules.\n\nRESOLUTION\n\nDeclaring the office of Speaker of the House of Representatives to be vacant.\n\nWhereas, the House Republican Conference elected Mike Johnson on October 25, 2023, after three-and-a-half weeks of trying to decide on a new Speaker of the House.\n\nWhereas, Mike Johnson sent the Republican Conference a letter making promises as to what type of Speaker he would be and outlining his plans going forward. Mike Johnson put forth seven tenets that would guide the Conference under his speakership:\n\n1. Restore trust by ensuring total transparency, open processes, and regular order.\n\n2. Advance a comprehensive policy agenda supported by Conference consensus.\n\n3. Promote individual Members, and thus the whole team, by working to understand and emphasize each Member's unique strengths, district dynamics and challenges, and individual goals and objectives.\n\n4. Engage Members in productive working groups to formulate solutions in key policy areas and enhance our internal communications and team building.\n\n5. Effectively message to persuasively inform the Republican base and the American people of our policy agenda, why we are pursuing it, and how it will ensure liberty, opportunity, and security for all Americans.\n\n6. Build and utilize external coalitions in the conservative ecosphere, including think tanks, policy groups, and other allied organizations that can contribute to our efforts.\n\n7. Develop and grow our majority by building upon our resources and expanding the base to successfully advance our conservative vision and agenda.\n\nWhereas, Speaker Johnson has not lived up to a single one of his self-imposed tenets.\n\nWhereas, Speaker Johnson allowed the Conference only one day, rather than 72 hours, to review a 1000-plus page bill to which no amendments could be offered, rather than \"ensure total transparency, open processes, and regular order.\"\n\nWhereas, Speaker Johnson worked with Democrats to produce appropriations texts, NDAA text, and other legislative items, rather than with Republicans \"to understand and emphasize each Member's unique strengths and [engage with] them.\"\n\nWhereas, Speaker Johnson relied on majority Democrat support to pass a two-part omnibus spending bill, rather than \"advancing a policy agenda supported by Conference consensus.\"\n\nWhereas, on December 1, 2023, Speaker Johnson failed to protect the Republican majority when he allowed multiple votes to remove another Republican from the House of Representatives. It was unprecedented for a Member to be removed from Congress by a two-thirds vote prior to conviction of a crime. To this day, the Republican expelled from the House under Speaker Johnson has not been convicted of a crime. Meanwhile, a Democrat now holds that seat.\n\nWhereas, Speaker Johnson supported fully funding abortion, the trans agenda, the climate agenda, foreign wars, and Biden's border crisis, rather than \"ensuring liberty, opportunity, and security for all Americans.\"\n\nWhereas, Speaker Johnson relied on Democrat votes on at least two occasions, with the first transgression occurring on March 22, 2024, with House passage of H.Res. 1102 -- Part 2 of the Johnson/Schumer omnibus -- and the second transgression occurring on April 20, 2024, with House passage of H.R. 8035 -- the 61-billion-dollar Ukraine funding bill. On both occasions, the \"majority of the majority\" -- 112 Republicans -- voted against the measures, while only 101 voted in favor.\n\nWhereas, before Kevin McCarthy was ousted as Speaker, our Conference had passed seven appropriations bills, which were some of the strongest conservative bills passed in decades. Speaker Johnson refused to continue this important process. He instead led us to another CR on January 18, 2024, and got it passed with the support of 207 Democrats and only 107 Republicans, while 106 Republicans voted against it.\n\nWhereas, Speaker Johnson passed a third CR, this time calling it a \"process CR,\" as if that made continuing Nancy Pelosi's budget yet again any different from the previous CRs.\n\nWhereas, with little to no communication with our conference, Speaker Johnson passed the first minibus appropriations bill on March 6, and passed the second minibus appropriations bill two weeks later, on March 22.\n\nWhereas, a two-part omnibus, split into two minibuses, was crammed down our throats and passed under suspension of the rules, with only one day to review it.\n\nWhereas, Speaker Johnson's omnibus did nothing to stop Biden's deadly border invasion -- it fully funded it. Mike Johnson did nothing to stop the energy-killing Green New Deal climate agenda -- he fully funded it. He did nothing to stop the weaponized DOJ and FBI -- he fully funded them. He did nothing to stop the trans agenda on kids -- he fully funded it. He did nothing to stop full term abortions -- he fully funded them. He did nothing to stop the fueling of foreign forever wars -- he fully funded them.\n\nWhereas, on April 18, 2024, the Rules Committee passed H.Res. 1160 -- the rule providing for consideration of the 95-billion-dollar foreign funding package -- by a vote of 9 to 3. Notably, all Democrat members of the Committee voted to advance the measure to the floor while three Republicans opposed it. It is unprecedented for members of the minority party to advance a resolution out of the Rules Committee. Since 1995, there have been a few instances of rules advancing out of Committee with minority support; however, H.Res. 1160 is the only instance where this was done to bypass opposition from members of the majority party.\n\nWhereas, the last instance an appropriations measure which passed the House failed to include a \"majority of the majority\" was on final passage of the FY2015 Department of Homeland Security House appropriations bill during the 114th Congress. In the months following this failure, Speaker Boehner announced his resignation.\n\nWhereas, in a January 26, 2024, \"Dear Colleague,\" Speaker Johnson called the Senate supplemental and border security legislation, \"dead on arrival in the House.\" Likewise, in January 2024, Speaker Johnson took a trip to the U.S.-Mexico border where he said, \"If President Biden wants a supplemental spending bill focused on national security, it better begin by defending America's national security.\"\n\nWhereas, in the months following his border trip, Speaker Johnson introduced a 95-billion-dollar foreign aid supplemental with no border security attached.\n\nWhereas, excuses like, \"this is just how you have to govern in divided government,\" are pathetic, weak, and unacceptable. Even with our razor-thin Republican majority, we could have at least secured the border, with it being the number one issue in the country, and the issue that is causing Biden to trail President Trump in poll after poll.\n\nWhereas, Speaker Johnson's capitulation on his promise to secure the border came on the heels of Laken Riley being brutally murdered, women and children being raped by illegal alien monsters, and our own Border Patrol and Texas National Guard being run over by hordes of military-aged illegals.\n\nWhereas, great legislation like H.R. 2 and the Laken Riley Act are only messaging bills unless we fight to enforce them in our government funding bills.\n\nWhereas, while serving on the House Judiciary Committee, Mike Johnson was a strong defender of individual liberties and was the Chair of the Subcommittee on the Constitution and Limited Government. Despite his history as a defender of civil liberties, on April 12, 2024, Mike Johnson cast the deciding vote against requiring a warrant for U.S. person queries of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) Section 702 data.\n\nWhereas, our Conference could have also taken out funding for abortion and the trans agenda on kids if our own Speaker would have allowed us to offer amendments. Instead, Mike Johnson worked with Chuck Schumer rather than with the Conference, and gave Joe Biden and the Democrats everything they wanted -- no different from how a Speaker Hakeem Jeffries would have done.\n\nWhereas, Speaker Johnson fully funded Special Counsel Jack Smith's witch hunt and 91 indictments against President Trump, our Republican Presidential nominee. House Republicans could have used our power of the purse to stop this, but Speaker Johnson didn't even let us try.\n\nWhereas, Joe Biden's weaponized DOJ is arresting a new January 6th election protestor every single day and putting nonviolent political enemies, including veterans, mothers and fathers, and grandparents in jail for years.\n\nWhereas, our pro-life Christian conservative Republican Speaker Mike Johnson fully funded the DOJ as it is prosecuting and convicting peaceful pro-life activists who are facing eleven years in jail, again refusing to allow Republicans to offer amendments to stop these injustices.\n\nWhereas, actions are the only thing that matter, and words are meaningless without following through on them. By passing the Democrats' agenda and handcuffing Republicans' ability to influence legislation, our elected Republican Speaker Mike Johnson has aided and abetted the Democrats and the Biden administration in destroying our country.\n\nWhereas, removing this Uniparty Speaker will not give the Speaker's gavel to the Democrats, which would only happen if Republicans actually vote for Hakeem Jeffries. In fact, Minority Leader Jeffries, Nancy Pelosi, and other high-ranking Democrats have publicly stated they will save Mike Johnson from a vote to vacate him. In a recent interview, Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said, \"Even though we're in the minority... We effectively have been governing as if we were in the majority.\"\n\nWhereas, our country is nearly 35 trillion dollars in debt, and about 40 billion dollars are added to the debt every day. Our border is overrun by illegal invaders and terrorists from over 160 countries. Our people are being killed by the hundreds every single day by fentanyl. And Mike Johnson refuses to do anything about it.\n\nWhereas, Mike Johnson is ill-equipped to handle the rigors of the job of Speaker of the House and has allowed a Uniparty -- one that fuels foreign wars, tramples on civil liberties, and increases our disastrous national debt -- to take complete control of the House of Representatives.\n\nWhereas, Speaker Johnson's tenure is defined by one self-serving characteristic: When given a choice between advancing Republican priorities or allying with Democrats to preserve his own personal power, Johnson regularly chooses to ally himself with Democrats.\n\nNow, therefore, be it Resolved, That the office of Speaker of the House of Representatives is hereby declared to be vacant.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news",

Mike Johnson (R-LA) expressed his gratitude for the opposition to the \"misguided effort\" to oust him as House Speaker on Thursday.\n\nJohnson appeared on Fox News's Fox and Friends to respond to Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's (R-GA) effort to vacate him as speaker. There were 11 Republican members and 32 Democratic members who voted to keep her motion, while the rest voted to table it.\n\n\"Look, I appreciate the overwhelming show of confidence by my colleagues to defeat that misguided effort,\" Johnson said. \"Imagine if we closed the House in the middle of hot wars around the globe when China could move on Taiwan, Iran could fire a nuke at Israel. I mean, you know, anything could happen right now. And we need to be working here every day. The chaos and confusion do nothing but diminish our chances to save this country and hurt our cause.\"\n\nIn Johnson's opinion, another effort to oust him is unlikely, as he said Wednesday's vote was an \"overwhelming landslide outcome.\" The speaker has the support of some 359 members of Congress that come from both sides of the aisle.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\n\"I mean, I think the message is sent. We have serious work to do, y'all. there are two competing visions for the country. We are fighting to save America and preserve its founding principles, to get Donald Trump back at the house White House, and to win the majority in the Senate and the House for the Republican Party,\" Johnson said. \"We have no time for nonsense.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nThere were only two Republican members that voted to vacate their own party's Speaker during this vote and the last vote that removed Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), which were Reps. Andy Biggs (R-AZ) and Eli Crane (R-AZ). It only took eight Republicans at the time, combined with the votes of the Democratic members to remove McCarthy.\n\nJohnson is up for reelection in 2024, as is the House Minority leader, Rep.

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) insisted she achieved a \"great victory\" after her effort to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) was overwhelmingly defeated.\n\nDuring a Thursday interview, right-wing podcast host Steve Bannon reminded Greene she had been booed by her colleagues when she brought the \"motion to vacate\" to the House floor on Wednesday.\n\n\"You heard the K Street money just absolutely through the instruments of the Democratic Party and the Republican people that have been bought off, booed you, you know, lustily,\" Bannon said.\n\n\"Well, that was exactly what I expected, Steve,\" Greene replied. \"And you know, I think it was a great victory yesterday.\"\n\n\"It was a great victory for the American people to see the truth, for the curtain to be drawn back and them to see the ugly truth.\"\n\nALSO READ: 'Morality does not exist for him': Remembering Ted Cruz's epic Trump rant\n\nGreene blamed \"the uniparty\" because her motion went down in flames after it was tabled with a bipartisan vote.\n\n\"You can talk about the special interests controlling Washington, D.C., but the vote yesterday proved that Mike Johnson is completely bought and paid for by the Democrats,\" she opined.\n\nThe lawmaker claimed \"all the lies were proven\" with her failed vote but didn't explain herself.\n\n\"Democrats can't take control of the House,\" she continued.

Marjorie Taylor Greene's (R-GA) motion to vacate Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) on Wednesday, leaving just 10 Republicans joining Greene in her efforts to remove the speaker.\n\nOn Wednesday, 359 members of the House voted to table the motion to oust Johnson, with 43 people voting against it. Eleven Republicans and 32 Democrats voted not to table the motion, a threat that has been hanging over Johnson's head since Greene introduced the motion in March.\n\nAfter the defeat, Greene noted her effort to oust Johnson netted more GOP support than the successful move to remove House Speaker Kevin McCarthy last year with just eight Republicans. The difference is no Democrats voted to save McCarthy last year, while most sided with Johnson on Wednesday.\n\n\"I would say the Democrats validated him to the rest of the Congress,\" Greene said after the vote. \"Democrats saved him, Nancy Pelosi voted for him -- Nancy Pelosi doesn't vote for Republicans unless she has full control of the House -- Hakeem Jeffries, the entire leadership team, Jerry Nadler, Jamie Raskin, they all voted for Mike Johnson. That is the most terrifying thing to our constituents and to the American people.\"\n\nGreene brought the motion to vacate forward during the House vote series and was instantly met with loud boos from her own party. She launched into a lengthy speech detailing her grievances against Johnson.\n\nWhile Greene was speaking on the House floor Wednesday on moving her motion forward, several members of the Main Street Caucus left the chamber and gathered before reporters on the Capitol steps. Chairman Dusty Johnson (R-SD) and several others blasted Greene for throwing a \"tantrum.\"\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\n\"All of us in life get to decide how we handle disappointment: you can be productive or you can be destructive,\" the South Dakota congressman said. \"Ms. Marjorie Taylor Greene is choosing destructive.\"\n\n\"Most of us by the time we turn 12 years old figured out the tantrums don't actually work, but apparently not everybody in Congress got the memo,\" the congressman added.\n\nHere are the 11 Republicans and 32 Democrats who voted against tabling a motion to vacate:\n\nRepublicans who sided with Greene Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) Andy Biggs (R-AZ) Eric Burlison (R-MO) Eli Crane (R-AZ) Warren Davidson (R-OH) Paul Gosar (R-AZ) Thomas Massie (R-KY) Alex Mooney (R-WV) Barry Moore (AL) Chip Roy (R-TX) Victoria Spartz (R-IN) Democrats who joined Greene Nanette Barragan (D-CA) Jamaal Bowman (D-NY) Cori Bush (D-MO) Greg Casar (D-TX) Joaquin Castro (D-TX) Yvette Clarke (D-NY) Gerry Connolly (D-VA) Diana DeGette (D-CO) Lloyd Doggett (D-TX) Veronica Escobar (D-TX) Maxwell Frost (D-FL) John Garamendi (D-CA) Sylvia Garcia (D-TX) Robert Garcia (D-CA) Jimmy Gomez (D-CA) Josh Harder (D-CA) Jonathan Jackson (D-IL) Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) Sydney Kamlager-Dove (D-CA) Barbara Lee (D-CA) Summer Lee (D-PA) Rob Menendez (D-NJ) Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) Pat Ryan (D-NY) Mary Gay Scanlon (D-PA) Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) Nydia Velazquez (D-NY) Maxine Waters (D-CA) Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-NJ) Nikema Williams (D-GA)\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nPresent votes Judy Chu (D-CA) Jesus \"Chuy\" Garcia (D-IL) Ilhan Omar (D-MN) Mark Pocan (D-WI) Jan Schakowsky (D-IL) Mark Takano (D-CA) Norma Torres (D-CA)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Image via Gage Skidmore.\n\nUS Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's (R-GA) failed effort to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) was supported by only two of her GOP colleagues -- Reps. Thomas Massie (KY) and Paul Gosar (AZ).\n\nAfter both Republicans and Democrats smacked down Greene's effort Wednesday, Fox News Senior Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram shared words from Massie: \"Has anybody heard a defense of Mike Johnson, from our GOP colleagues? Has anybody said he's doing a great job? What I hear is, you know, he's doing a lousy job. We just don't agree with your timing.\"\n\nThe Kentucky lawmaker, according to Capitol Hill reporter Juliegrace Brufke, added that \"he thinks GOP colleagues who voted to table will get an 'a** whipping' from their base.\"\n\nREAD MORE: GOP donors say Mike Johnson's fundraising won't 'ever get to the level of McCarthy'\n\nFormer Speaker Kevin McCarthy -- although slammed for his House leadership and ousted by his colleagues in September -- was known for his superb fundraising skills. According to Republican members and donors, Johnson has so far lacked in that area.\n\nGOP donor Eric Levine told The Daily Beast earlier this week, \"McCarthy was a money machine. He just had a great talent for it.\n\nHe added, \"People like to donate money to winners. Now that he's demonstrated leadership, I think you'll see a shift. I don't think he'll ever get to the level -- maybe he will -- but I don't think he'll ever get to the level of McCarthy. But there's no shame in that. McCarthy was just in a class of his own in terms of raising money. But I think you'll start seeing a significant uptick.\"\n\nAhead of Greene's failure to oust the speaker, US Rep. Kelly Armstrong defended Johnson, (R-ND) telling CNN reporter Manu Raju, \"I probably have the longest personal relationship with Mike Johnson of anybody here. I served with him when I got here in Congress in 2018. If Mike Johnson is not thoughtful enough, and not conservative enough to be the Speaker of the House, they have real problems because there ain't anybody else that's going to be acceptable for that job.\"\n\nFollowing the House's rejection of Greene's motion, Pergram also tweeted Johnson's reaction, writing, \"I am glad this distraction will not inhibit that important work and all the other things on the table and on the agenda for us right now. Hopefully, this is the end of the personality politics and the frivolous character assassination that has defined the 118th Congress. It's regrettable and it's not who we are as Americans.\"\n\nREAD MORE: House GOP unites behind bashing Rep. Greene's 'failing act of political theater'\n\nThe GOP leader added, \"We're better than this. We need to get beyond it. The Speaker of the House serves the whole House, that's the job. But I am a lifelong, movement conservative Republican and I intend to continue to govern in accordance with those core principles.\"\n\nAdditionally, Pergram shared that former President Donald Trump responded via social media, writing, \"Trump on Truth Social on Greene's effort to oust Johnson. He asked GOPers to block Greene's gambit: 'It is my request that Republicans vote for 'THE MOTION TO TABLE.'

Marjorie Taylor Greene and Thomas Massie announced plans to oust Republican speaker.\n\nThe Republican Party is in disarray. You only have to look as far as the U.S. House of Representatives to find evidence of it.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., has been doing what she does best: Making headlines for her antics. In March, she filed a motion to remove House Speaker Mike Johnson. Last week, she said she was planning to bring the motion to the floor soon. Those plans have since failed spectacularly, thanks to both parties voting Wednesday against Greene's motion to vacate. Members of both parties actually booed her.\n\nI'm glad that Republicans stood up to her absurd effort. It's one of the first times in a long time that we've seen them back away from their party's most extreme members. What Greene ultimately proved is what many of us have known for almost a decade: The divisions that Donald Trump's presidency exacerbated are evident in the Republican Party.\n\nIt's good to see her lose again to more sane members of Congress. But the Republican Party has more work to do, given how far members have strayed.\n\nWhat the Republican Party should be doing to beat Biden\n\nPresident Joe Biden is trailing Trump in the polls, so you'd assume Republicans would use everything in their arsenal to destroy any hopes of reelection by showing signs of unity to voters who are on the fence.\n\nThey could use this time to promote their presidential candidate or hammer home the idea that Biden is to blame for the civil unrest on college campuses or the increased cost of living. They could even use this time to announce a vice president who unifies the party or start being productive in Congress.\n\nInstead, they're allowing the moment to slip away by focusing on the continual eroding of abortion rights and by continuing to lie about elections.\n\nWhy cancel graduations?: Columbia cancels commencement ceremony because of student protests. It's the wrong choice.\n\nBiden is vulnerable, and it doesn't seem like Republicans know what to do about that.\n\nInstead, Republicans let infighting within the party take center stage, like Wednesday's big House vote. This should be disappointing to anyone who still believes that there are two formidable parties in the United States.\n\nA new poll from USA TODAY/Suffolk University found that 1 in 4 registered voters are saying they might change their votes ahead of November, and voters who have decided are evenly split between Biden and Trump. It feels like Republicans could take full advantage of this moment by just showing leadership. Instead, they're missing the mark.\n\nRepublicans are acting very predictable\n\nRepublicans have taken a clear stance on student protesters, decrying antisemitism and calling the pro-Palestinian movement a \"radical left revolution.\"\n\nThey also don't seem to exert much energy to fight this perceived travesty, apart from Speaker Johnson's trip to Columbia University and Colorado Rep. Lauren Boebert's visit to George Washington University.\n\nTrump's campaign is also trying to capitalize on it, highlighting purported connections between Biden donors and student activists.\n\nThese moves amount to nothing more than unsuccessful attempts to hijack the conversation over the Israel-Hamas war, and everyone can see through them.\n\nEven GOP voters have changed their feelings on the war after months of conflict: A Gallup poll from March saw an increase in the number of Republicans disapproving of Israel's military action when compared with polling from November.\n\nI'd rather see Republicans at least speaking with their own voters on the ground, taking the time to educate people on why they support Israel. I'd rather they focus on passing policies that support their agenda - or condemning the racism exhibited by a now-expelled fraternity brother who mocked a Black woman during a recent pro-Palestinian protest. It seems like they could be saying more that would actually win voters.\n\nRepublicans need to regroup: If Marjorie Taylor Greene is the future of the Republican Party, I don't want it\n\nFor Republicans, this conversation should be an easy way to win over disaffected voters. Instead, they're using it to stoke the fires of the same base they continually rely on, Trump supporters who were always going to vote for the party.\n\nIssues with both parties this election cycle\n\nTruthfully, neither party seems willing to admit that it has propped up a pair of weak candidates for the November election. Trump has spent the weeks ahead of the Republican National Convention in court as a defendant in a New York criminal trial.\n\nBiden, meanwhile, has been MIA - save for his administration announcing that it intended to reclassify marijuana on the Drug Enforcement Administration's substance list and condemning student protesters while making minimal effort to change the country's allegiance to Israel.\n\nThe Republicans could really be honing in on some issues at this moment. The economy is doing well, but Americans are still feeling the high cost of living every day. Biden hasn't been able to convince voters of his economic achievements, which gives Republicans something they can use to convince voters that things were better four years ago than they are today.\n\nIf Republicans are thinking ahead, they'll use this time to rebuild their base and remind them of what they feel is at stake in this election. They would be using the fear of college students as a rallying cry for law and order.\n\nInstead, they have to deal with Greene's antics that put conservatives in the news for all the wrong reasons.\n\nGreene's move to oust the speaker didn't come to fruition. What she has accomplished, however, is making the Republican Party look foolish ahead of November. Good news for Democrats, but bad news about the state of democracy overall.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

But circumstances have changed.\n\nRepresentative Mike Johnson can now, for better or worse, truly lay claim to being speaker of the whole House, after Democrats saved him from a Republican-led coup on Wednesday in another remarkable moment in a chaotic Congress filled with them. Had Democrats not come to his rescue, the votes existed in his own party to potentially oust him.\n\nIt was the logical outcome of a session in which House Democrats, despite being in the minority, have repeatedly supplied the votes and even the procedural backing to do most of the heavy legislative lifting to stave off default, fund the government and aid U.S. allies, forming an uneasy coalition government with more mainstream Republicans.\n\nThe result left Mr. Johnson, a Louisiana Republican still new to the job, indebted to Democrats even as he immediately sought to distance himself from them by emphasizing his deep conservative credentials. Democrats said their support for him underscored their bona fides as the grown-up party willing to go so far as to back a conservative Republican speaker to prevent the House from again going off the rails.\n\nNow the two parties will have to navigate this previously unexplored terrain as they head into an election season that will determine who is speaker next year.\n\nThe reality is that after passing the foreign aid package including funding for Ukraine that prompted the push by Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican of Georgia, to depose Mr. Johnson, little polarizing legislative work remains to be done this Congress while the fight for House control is about to get into full swing. That fact led Mr. Johnson to walk off the House floor to high-fives from his Republican supporters and quickly try to remind his colleagues and America that, despite the decisive Democratic assist, he is still a die-hard right winger.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'\u00e9tat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coup d'\u00e9tat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/09/multimedia/09DC-ASSESS-fgvk/09DC-ASSESS-fgvk-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551299", "eventUri": "eng-9551299", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

Gaetz alleged was a \"secret side deal on Ukraine\" to provide Kiev with more funding.

Very early appointment this morning so I'll keep it short. The first of the two big stories is Speaker Mike Johnson, who is turning into the Paul Ryan of Kevin McCarthys, gets to keep his speakership mostly because the Democrats have turned him into the Joe Biden of Nancy Pelosis.\n\nEleven Republicans in the House of Representatives voted against the motion to table Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's (R-GA) motion to vacate, ousting Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) from his position.\n\nReps. Andy Biggs (R-AZ), Eric Burlison (R-MO), Eli Crane (R-AZ), Warren Davidson (R-OH), Paul Gosar (R-AZ), Thomas Massie (R-KY), Alex Mooney (R-WV), Barry Moore (R-AL), Chip Roy (R-TX), Victoria Spartz (R-IN), along with Greene, were the Republicans who voted against tabling the motion to vacate.\n\nGreene's motion to vacate came after she filed a motion to vacate Johnson from his position as speaker of the House in March. Conservatives in the House have argued that Johnson has capitulated to the Democrats and [so-called quote-unquote \"president\"] Joe Biden.\n\nIn April, Johnson proposed a $95 billion foreign aid package. The package sent roughly $26 billion to Israel, $61 billion to Ukraine, and $8 billion to supporting allies in the Indo-Pacific.\n\nOn Monday, Greene and Massie met with Johnson for roughly three hours in an attempt to propose accountability measures to ensure Johnson would not advance an agenda that Republican members of the House opposed.\n\nAfter the meeting, Greene said that she and Massie had engaged in a \"very long discussion with Speaker Johnson\" and would be meeting with him again the next day. Greene added that she had been \"patient\" and \"diligent\" and that nothing \"has changed.\"\n\nYes, we're on Hamas's side now. It's as official as it can get without Old Joe Biden asking Congress for a declaration of war against Israel: the Biden regime has thrown the weight of the United States government behind the effort to save Hamas. As Israel begins its action in Rafah against Hamas's last significant forces, Biden apparatchiks have come out strongly in support of the jihadis, attempting to kneecap Israel's efforts by withholding crucial and previously agreed-upon arms shipments. . .\n\n. . . The Biden gang pressures Israel and not Iran or Hamas because this is all about securing the Arab Muslim vote in Michigan and elsewhere. The pressure on Old Joe has been high for months. Back in November, Nihad Awad, executive director of the Hamas-linked Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), who infamously said that he was \"happy\" about Hamas' Oct. 7 jihad massacre of 1,200 Israelis, declared at a pro-Hamas rally: \"No cease-fire, no votes. No votes in Michigan, no votes in Arizona, no votes in Georgia, no votes in Nevada, no votes in Wisconsin, no votes in Pennsylvania. No votes for you anywhere if you don't call for a ceasefire now.\" A ceasefire, like cutting off Israel's arms shipment, would allow Hamas to survive. That's why Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Ramallah) agreed, adding: \"The American people won't forget. Biden, support a ceasefire now. Or don't count on us in 2024.\"\n\n. . . The U.S. government has gone all-in on saving Hamas, just as Israel has a chance to realize its stated goal of destroying the organization forever.\n\nWhy is the Biden regime betraying an ally, a course of action that could have repercussions with other allies and potential allies for generations to come? Why has the regime essentially switched sides in Israel's conflict with the same jihadis who scream \"Death to America\" as well as \"Death to Israel\"? It's all about getting that vote in Michigan, as well as expressing the left's hatred for particularity and for groups that refuse to efface all their individuality and join the collective. But the longer this keeps up, the Biden regime will not just imperil Israel, but the nation that had been the Jewish state's great defender. Not that any of its apparatchiks will care about that.", "source": {"uri": "acecomments.mu.nu", "dataType": "news", "title": "acecomments.mu.nu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., is up for reelection this year - along with every other federal representative.\n\nGreene has represented Georgia's 14 congressional district since 2021.

Greene has gained notoriety as a far-right conservative who has embraced former President Donald Trump as well as conspiracy theories like QAnon and that 9/11 was an inside job.\n\nMost recently, Greene stirred up controversy when she attempted to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., after he helped pass a foreign aid package that sent $95 billion to Ukraine, Israel, Gaza, and the Indo-Pacific; an attempt that ultimately failed.\n\nThe entire US House of Representatives is up for election every two years. This year, Greene doesn't face a challenger in the primary.\n\nThere are four candidates in the Democratic primary. They include Clarence Blalock, Shawn Harris, Deric Houston, and Joseph Leigh.\n\nThe general election is on Nov. 5, along with the presidential election.\n\nNo congressional districts in Georgia are likely to be competitive in November because of the way Republicans have drawn the district lines that keeps their advantage.\n\nIn Georgia's 14th district, this means that Greene is likely to win again. The Cook Political Report, a political forecasting newsletter, lists Greene's seat as \"solid Republican.\"\n\nThis outcome is barring any unanticipated developments, including if Trump picks Greene as his running mate.

Becca Balint, D-Vt., voted to table a measure that would have declared the speaker's office vacant. Had it passed, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., would have been removed, and the body would have been without a leader for the second time in a year.\n\nThe measure was advanced by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., and other hard-right House members who criticized Johnson for working with Democrats to provide military aid to Ukraine and Israel and to fund the government, but it was opposed by most Republicans. The vote to table it was 359-43.\n\nThe last time such a measure was considered, in October 2023, Balint and fellow Democrats joined hard-right Republicans in voting to oust then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.

Plus, who is challenging the Georgia Rep?Margie Cullen, USA TODAYMay 9, 2024 at 12:38 PM\n\nFirebrand Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., is up for reelection this year - along with every other federal representative.\n\nGreene has represented Georgia's 14th congressional district since 2021. A rural district located in northwest Georgia, it is a mostly solidly Republican district. Greene has gained notoriety as a far-right conservative who has embraced former President Donald Trump as well as conspiracy theories like QAnon and that 9/11 was an inside job.\n\nMost recently, Greene stirred up controversy when she attempted to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., after he helped pass a foreign aid package that sent $95 billion to Ukraine, Israel, Gaza, and the Indo-Pacific; an attempt that ultimately failed.\n\nThe entire US House of Representatives is up for election every two years. This year, Greene doesn't face a challenger in the primary.\n\nWhen is the Georgia election?\n\nThe primary election for Georgia's 14th congressional district is on May 21.\n\nNo one is currently running against incumbent Greene in the Republican primary.\n\nSign up for Your Vote: Text USA TODAY reporters and the elections team by joining our SMS service.\n\nThere are four candidates in the Democratic primary. They include Clarence Blalock, Shawn Harris, Deric Houston, and Joseph Leigh.\n\nThe general election is on Nov. 5, along with the presidential election.\n\nWill Greene win reelection?\n\nNo congressional districts in Georgia are likely to be competitive in November because of the way Republicans have drawn the district lines that keeps their advantage.\n\nIn Georgia's 14th district, this means that Greene is likely to win again. The Cook Political Report, a political forecasting newsletter, lists Greene's seat as \"solid Republican.\"\n\nThis outcome is barring any unanticipated developments, including if Trump picks Greene as his running mate. While not necessarily a leading contender, she campaigned for Trump in Iowa and New Hampshire and has been transparent about her desire for the role.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Portsmouth Herald: MTG is up for reelection this year in Georgia.

It's worth understanding why they didn't.\n\nLast year, Democratic lawmakers made no secret of the fact that they did not like, trust, or respect then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. When the California Republican faced a plot from some of his own members to strip him of his gavel, members of the House minority were only too pleased to lend their support and show McCarthy the door.\n\nSeven months later, far-right Republicans launched another attempt to oust one of their own party's speakers, but this time, the vast majority of House Democrats voted to rescue Speaker Mike Johnson.\n\nThis was not a surprise. On the contrary, Democratic leaders formally announced last week that this is precisely what they'd do if given the chance.\n\nBut in the abstract, it might seem counterintuitive.\n\nBy most measures, Johnson is the most far-right House speaker in modern American history. He's also an election denier who played a prominent role in trying to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. On practically every issue of national significance, Democrats see the Louisiana Republican's positions as radical, ridiculous, and/or dangerous.\n\nSo why in the world did so many Democrats, including every member of the party's leadership team throw him a life-preserver instead of an anvil? Why didn't they simply do what they did with McCarthy and let the GOP majority deal once again with the consequences of their self-imposed chaos?\n\nPart of this is the result of Democrats wanting to present themselves to the public as the mature party -- the \"adults in the room\" -- that can be counted on to be responsible with the institution's interests. The party has also come to realize that in a narrowly divided chamber, Johnson has repeatedly turned to Democrats to govern in recent months -- most notably on U.S. aid to Ukraine -- and the party has come to feel a degree of comfort with the status quo.\n\nBut a recent Wall Street Journal report touched on the most important element of all:\n\nIt's difficult to overstate how important this was, and is, to the party. When coming to terms with why progressive Democrats would rescue the most far-right House speaker in modern times, the phrase \"better the devil you know than the devil you don't\" is worth keeping in mind.\n\nMembers of the House minority party are well aware of the fact that they could've taken down Johnson, but these same Democrats had every reason to believe that the House speaker's successor would very likely be worse: a Republican who wouldn't turn to them on must-pass legislation and who wouldn't mind if Russia took part of eastern Europe by force.\n\nDemocrats see Johnson as a radical Republican election denier with an even temperament, who hasn't lied to them, hasn't broken any deals with them, and listened to reason on aid to Ukraine.\n\nThat's not much, but for 163 members of the House Democratic minority, it was enough.", "source": {"uri": "msnbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MSNBC.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_McCarthy_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin McCarthy (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "History of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempts_to_overturn_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_Republicans", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Radical Republicans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_quo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Status quo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Europe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Christian_Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Christian Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-10/231030-Mike-Johnson-al-1230-940985.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551299", "eventUri": "eng-9551299", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 113, "relevance": 1}

All The Way Out Here", "body": "Sweet Jesus, sometimes life among the stupid can be so satisfying! Machine Gun Marjie must be looking for puppies to kick right now. I saw this coming yesterday. MAGA Marjie held a closed door meeting with House Speaker Mike Johnson, which ended with her leaving the meeting to announce that she had backed off on her motion to vacate the chair, as long as Johnson did what she wanted by her ultimatum date. But when Johnson emerged, he basically laughed off the meeting as a regular bullsh*t session to hear her concerns, and there was no ultimatum.\n\nNobody trifles with Laborious MTG. So she went ahead and pulled the trigger on the motion to vacate today. Even an imbecile like MTG had to know it was a kamikaze mission. It's been known for two weeks now that enough moderate GOP representatives would vote to sink her, and that Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries was not whipping Democratic votes against Johnson. But her ego demanded retribution, succeed of fail, so she laid the motion on the floor, and hasn't stopped falling downstairs yet.\n\nBut here's the thing. Several signals were sent today, and they all blow an ill wind for mental midgets like Greene, Gosar, Roy, Comer, Gaetz and Jordan. In dealing with Johnson, Jeffries hsa normally requested that Johnson drag along at least half of his caucus in return tor Democratic support, in order to avoid having it look like the Democrats were bailing the GOP and Johnson out. Normally Johnson has been right about the 50% mark. In today's vote, he had more than 67% of caucus behind him.\n\nJeffries left his caucus free to vote their consciences, and they broke hard for Johnson. After the vote to table the motion, basicfally killing it, Johnson took a brief victory lap. Jeffries was more fulsome in his victory lap, laying down a marker, The Democrats voted today not as repuvlican vs Democrat, but in favor of bipartisanship to continue to deal with the peoples problems. The time for disruption and chaos is over. English translation, I kept you here, and I can take you out.\n\nNow for those subliminal messages, and they're fascinating. In today's vote, there were only 47 NO votes, about half of them being Democrats. I've been writing for months now that after a year and a half of minority GOP gridlock and bullsh*t, moderate GOP House members are desperate for something to take home and run on. This was a stark warning to the Freedom caucus that the days of disruption are over. If the moderates can find common ground, they'll pass legislation, and try to save their jobs. If it has to be bipartisan, so be it.\n\nThe Democratic message was equally interesting. With the overwhelming GOP support, Jeffries didn't really need toput on that massive show of Democratic support to save Johnson, a couple of dozen would have done, with a closer result. That vote result was intentional, and Jeffries even referenced it in his statement, the Democrats are all in on a bipartisan House working together to solve problems, not hold sham show hearings. The Freedom caucus is on notice. Their welcome has worn out.\n\nBut here's something that really intrigues me. The first time that Jeffries bailed Mike Johnson out, it made logical sense. After all, Johnson was holding up the aid bills for Israel, Ukraine, and Taiwan. it was a simple quid pro quo, we bail your ass out, you bring those bills to the floor for an up-or-down vote. And that's exactly how it turned out, which tells you one thing right off of the bat. At least Mike Johnson is a good faith broker, unlike Cave0In McCarthy.\n\nBut this time is different. Passing those aid bills were the last pieces of really critical business for the House until September, when annual budget spending bills come up for renewal. Why wouldn't Jeffries simply unite the Democratic caucus to vote to oust Johnson, and then simply sit back and enjoy the freak show while the MAGAt's step all over their cranks trying to pick a successor? Let them make a damaging spectacle of themselves with the voters heading into the November election?\n\nI can think of two logical reasons. For one, Jeffries wanted the Democrats to be in on the ultimate beatdown of the Freedom caucus, and lay their flag down. And they sure as hell accomplished that today. And for once, a clearly distracted trump was caught with his pants down, (pun intended) and either didn't have the chance, or the interest in telling MTG to forget a motion that could only damage the MAGA conference.\n\nHere's the second reason. The more I see of hakeem Jeffries, the more I like and admire him. He's going to make a very able Speaker to replace Madame Nancy next January. And he has an agenda. Clearly Jeffries sees some largely bipartisan bills in the hopper that a bipartisan House could pass that would likely pass the Senate, and be signed by President Biden. And when it comes to political branding, being able to tell your constituents that the Democrats got bipartisan legislation over the top is a helluva lot better than the GOP having to run on Democratic support rather than getting the job done with their majority.\n\nHere's my best guess. I find it inconceivable that Machine Gun Marjie will raise the motion again, just to force the GOP caucus to put their names on their votes, for later exploitation. Which means that once again Johnson is going to need Democratic support to stay there. Which means an I wash your back, you wash mine moment. And I think I know the loofah that Jeffries is going to want Johnson to use on his back.\n\nbeing the Senate passed comprehensive immigration reform bill across the finish line would be a political boon for Biden, and a political nightmare for Trump, depriving him of his favorite racist campaign trope.\n\nJust how much does Mike Johnson want to be the Speaker of the House, and whatr does he want his legislative legacy to be? If MTG pulls another d*ck move a month from now, and once again the Democrats overwhelmingly support Johnson, all bets are off.\n\nSometime between Memorial day and the July 4th holiday, look for Johnson to put the Senate bill on the floor for debate and an up-or-down vote. El Pendejo Presidente will be f*cking furious!, but who cares? The Democrats will have proven twice that they have the muscle to keep Johnson in place, and what moderate GOP House member wouldn't love bringing comprehensive immigration reform home to his or her district to run on in November? It's a win-win situation all around, except for His Lowness and his MAGA mob.\n\nWe'll know soon enough. But so far Jeffries has been playing 3 dimensional chess in the minority, while the MAGAt's are playing Parcheesi. The House Freedom caucus has played out its hand. What did Tommy LOee Jones say in Under Siege? The difference between a political movement and a revolution is that a movement moves forward a certain distance, then stops. A revolution has a way of keep coming back around, in your face. It looks like the MAGA Movement has stalled out.", "source": {"uri": "politizoom.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PolitiZoom"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Shortly before the vote, the House Freedom Caucus announced it \"strongly opposes\" the measure because it would facilitate more spending than they support.\n\nNevertheless, about half of Republicans joined with Democrats in passing the third stopgap funding measure in recent months. The action came a few hours after the Senate had voted overwhelmingly to pass the bill by a vote of 77-18.\n\nThe measure extends current spending levels and buys time for the two chambers to work out their differences over full-year spending bills for the fiscal year that began in October.\n\nThe temporary measure will run to March 1 for some federal agencies. Their funds were set to run out Friday. It extends the remainder of government operations to March 8.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the president would sign the resolution and urged Republicans to quit wasting time on partisan spending bills.\n\n\"House Republicans must finally do their job and work across the aisle to pass full-year funding bills that deliver for the American people and address urgent domestic and national security priorities by passing the President's supplemental request,\" Jean-Pierre said.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has been under pressure from his right flank to scrap a $1.66 trillion budget price tag he reached with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer earlier this month for the spending bills.

Chip Roy, R-Texas, said the continuing resolution passed Thursday will facilitate that agreement, and urged colleagues to vote against it.\n\n\"It's Groundhog Day in the House chamber all the time, every day, yet again spending money we don't have,\" Roy said.\n\nJohnson has insisted he will stick with the deal, and centrists in the party have stood behind him. They say that changing course now would be going back on his word and would weaken the speaker in future negotiations.\n\nRep. Rosa DeLauro, the ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, said Americans expect Congress to govern and work in a bipartisan fashion.\n\n\"Some of my colleagues would see that this government would shut down and don't care how hurtful that would be,\" DeLauro said.\n\nHouse Republicans have fought bitterly over budget levels and policy since taking the majority at the start of 2023. Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., was ousted by his caucus in October after striking an agreement with Democrats to extend current spending the first time. Johnson has also come under criticism as he has wrestled with how to appease his members and avoid a government shutdown in an election year.\n\n\"We just needed a little more time on the calendar to do it and now that's where we are,\" Johnson said Tuesday about the decision to extend federal funding yet again. \"We're not going to get everything we want.\"\n\nMost House Republicans have so far refrained from saying that Johnson's job is in danger. But a revolt of even a handful of Republicans could endanger his position in the narrowly divided House.\n\nVirginia Rep. Bob Good, one of eight Republicans who voted to oust McCarthy, has been pushing Johnson to reconsider the deal with Schumer.\n\n\"If your opponent in negotiation knows that you fear the consequence of not reaching an agreement more than they fear the consequence of not reaching an agreement, you will lose every time,\" Good said this week.\n\nOther Republicans acknowledge Johnson is in a tough spot. \"The speaker was dealt with the hand he was dealt,\" said Kentucky Rep. Andy Barr, noting the constraints imposed by the party's slim majority.\n\nIn Thursday afternoon's vote, 107 House Republicans voted to keep federal agencies funded and 106 voted against the measure. To almost lose the majority of his conference underscores the challenges facing the new speaker and signals the difficulty he will have in striking a deal that will not alienate many of his GOP colleagues. They are clamoring for deeper non-defense spending cuts and myriad conservative policy mandates.\n\nMeanwhile, 207 Democrats voted for the resolution and only two voted against.\n\nThe short-term measure comes amid negotiations on a separate spending package that would provide wartime dollars to Ukraine and Israel and strengthen security at the U.S.-Mexico border. Johnson is also under pressure from the right not to accept a deal that is any weaker than a House-passed border measure that has no Democratic support.\n\nJohnson, Schumer and other congressional leaders and committee heads visited the White House on Wednesday to discuss that spending legislation. Johnson used the meeting to push for stronger border security measures while Biden and Democrats detailed Ukraine's security needs as it continues to fight Russia.\n\nBiden has requested a $110 billion package for the wartime spending and border security.\n\n-- -- --\n\nAssociated Press writers Farnoush Amiri, Lisa Mascaro and Darlene Superville contributed to this report.", "source":

However, Scalise failed to secure the majority votes needed to secure the gavel, prompting him to drop his bid one day later.\n\nIt's not clear whether Scalise would be able to secure enough support this time around, especially after a growing number of GOP lawmakers vowed not to back his bid last year.\n\nMajority Whip Tom Emmer (R-MN) is another top consideration for the speakership after serving in House GOP leadership for the last two years.\n\nEmmer was among those who ran for speaker in October, although, like Scalise, the majority whip was unable to secure the votes needed to win the gavel. His candidacy largely unraveled after former President Donald Trump came out in opposition to his bid, calling Emmer a RINO, or \"Republican In Name Only.\"\n\nSince then, though, Emmer's and Trump's relationship has been repaired. Emmer endorsed Trump in January, with the former president returning the favor to back the majority whip's reelection in April. That could shift some Republicans in Emmer's favor if he chose to launch another bid for speaker in the future.\n\nHouse Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan (R-OH) is also among those who are considered as top choices for the speakership despite failing to secure the gavel in October.\n\nJordan was also among the first to launch a speakership bid to replace McCarthy. However, after three speakership votes, support for the Ohio Republican began to wane -- prompting Republicans to vote to remove him as their nominee.\n\nHowever, Jordan is well-liked among his conservative colleagues as well as Trump, making it likely he could be eyed as a top contender should the former president return to the White House next year.\n\nAnother Republican leader who could be a top contender is House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik (R-NY), a top Trump ally in the House.\n\nUnlike the others, Stefanik did not pursue a speakership bid in October after McCarthy's removal. However, the conference chairwoman is well known among her GOP colleagues and has established herself as a top defender of Trump in the lower chamber.\n\nHowever, Stefanik is also on a short-list of candidates being considered for Trump's running mate in the 2024 election, making it likely she would not seek the top House position.\n\nEven if those candidates did launch bids for the speakership at some point in the future, it's not guaranteed Republicans would coalesce around a single candidate. That was the struggle GOP lawmakers faced in October, eventually leading to Johnson's candidacy as a relatively unknown lawmaker at the time.\n\nJohnson has indicated he plans to continue in his leadership position despite efforts to oust him, telling reporters this week he has already begun to map out a plan for the party next year. Johnson said he has the backing of Trump, which could help secure enough support across the GOP conference to solidify his hold on the gavel.\n\nOther lawmakers have suggested there is no lawmaker who could secure the full support of the conference, with Rep. Troy Nehls (R-TX) repeatedly joking last year that not even \"the Lord Jesus himself could manage this group.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nSome lawmakers have cheekily suggested putting themselves in the speaker's chair, becoming a running joke on Capitol Hill.\n\n\"Under the Burchett administration,\" Rep. Tim Burchett (R-TN) vowed to have \"Taco Tuesdays and a mariachi band.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Now, they're weighing the consequences for her and those who supported her time-wasting move.\n\nCNN reported on the aftermath of the failed attempt by MTG to oust Johnson and asked several other representatives if they were considering punishment. Rep. Marcus Molinaro (R-NY) said, \"Ultimately, there needs to be accountability. ... Some people here think they're more important than everyone else. They are not.\" Though Rep.

I think, you know, Chip Roy and Thomas Massie both serve on the Rules Committee. They should be immediately removed from that committee. You're not entitled to that committee. You're not there to represent yourself. You're there to do the work of the majority. And I think, there should be consequences here.\n\nLawler also told Bolduan that Greene should be removed from her committee assignments as well.

When the California Republican faced a plot from some of his own members to strip him of his gavel, members of the House minority were only too pleased to lend their support and show McCarthy the door.\n\nSeven months later, far-right Republicans launched another attempt to oust one of their own party's speakers, but this time, the vast majority of House Democrats voted to rescue Speaker Mike Johnson.\n\nThis was not a surprise. On the contrary, Democratic leaders formally announced last week that this is precisely what they'd do if given the chance.\n\nBut in the abstract, it might seem counterintuitive.\n\nBy most measures, Johnson is the most far-right House speaker in modern American history. He's also an election denier who played a prominent role in trying to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. On practically every issue of national significance, Democrats see the Louisiana Republican's positions as radical, ridiculous, and/or dangerous.\n\nSo why in the world did so many Democrats, including every member of the party's leadership team throw him a life-preserver instead of an anvil? Why didn't they simply do what they did with McCarthy and let the GOP majority deal once again with the consequences of their self-imposed chaos?\n\nPart of this is the result of Democrats wanting to present themselves to the public as the mature party -- the \"adults in the room\" -- that can be counted on to be responsible with the institution's interests. The party has also come to realize that in a narrowly divided chamber, Johnson has repeatedly turned to Democrats to govern in recent months -- most notably on U.S. aid to Ukraine -- and the party has come to feel a degree of comfort with the status quo.\n\nBut a recent Wall Street Journal report touched on the most important element of all:\n\nIt's difficult to overstate how important this was, and is, to the party. When coming to terms with why progressive Democrats would rescue the most far-right House speaker in modern times, the phrase \"better the devil you know than the devil you don't\" is worth keeping in mind.\n\nMembers of the House minority party are well aware of the fact that they could've taken down Johnson, but these same Democrats had every reason to believe that the House speaker's successor would very likely be worse: a Republican who wouldn't turn to them on must-pass legislation and who wouldn't mind if Russia took part of eastern Europe by force.\n\nDemocrats see Johnson as a radical Republican election denier with an even temperament, who hasn't lied to them, hasn't broken any deals with them, and listened to reason on aid to Ukraine.\n\nThat's not much, but for 163 members of the House Democratic minority, it was enough.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_McCarthy_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin McCarthy (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempts_to_overturn_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "History of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_Republicans", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Radical Republicans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_quo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Status quo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Europe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Christian_Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Christian Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/VoCugQtds.n0YucWlfloGA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/msnbc_articles_593/692c821d06fb9a6d293063b21f776abf", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551299", "eventUri": "eng-9551299", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 106, "relevance": 1}

Marjorie Taylor Greene's (R-GA) motion to vacate. But it's not necessarily an endorsement of his leadership.\n\nThe motion to oust Johnson was shot down by a majority of both Republicans and Democrats largely due to an overwhelming desire to prevent the House from being plunged into another chaotic leaderless period. But others conceded it would also be too difficult to find another speaker who could win the support of the entire GOP conference.\n\nEven as Greene and Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) pushed to remove Johnson, the pair acknowledged they did not have a short list of candidates to replace him. However, Massie cited \"at least a dozen members of our conference who either politically or privately have done things in their life that qualify them to lead.\"\n\nAlthough no Republican has publicly indicated interest in becoming speaker, here are four lawmakers who are considered to be top options should the situation arise.\n\nMajority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA)\n\nAmong the most obvious contenders to replace Johnson should he be ousted would be Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA), the No. 2 Republican in the House.\n\nScalise was among the first to announce his candidacy for speaker after former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) was ousted in October, and the majority leader was the first to be nominated for the position. However, Scalise failed to secure the majority votes needed to secure the gavel, prompting him to drop his bid one day later.\n\nIt's not clear whether Scalise would be able to secure enough support this time around, especially after a growing number of GOP lawmakers vowed not to back his bid last year.\n\nMajority Whip Tom Emmer (R-MN)\n\nMajority Whip Tom Emmer (R-MN) is another top consideration for the speakership after serving in House GOP leadership for the last two years.\n\nEmmer was among those who ran for speaker in October, although, like Scalise, the majority whip was unable to secure the votes needed to win the gavel. His candidacy largely unraveled after former President Donald Trump came out in opposition to his bid, calling Emmer a RINO, or \"Republican In Name Only.\"\n\nSince then, though, Emmer's and Trump's relationship has been repaired. Emmer endorsed Trump in January, with the former president returning the favor to back the majority whip's reelection in April. That could shift some Republicans in Emmer's favor if he chose to launch another bid for speaker in the future.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan (R-OH)\n\nHouse Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan (R-OH) is also among those who are considered as top choices for the speakership despite failing to secure the gavel in October.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nJordan was also among the first to launch a speakership bid to replace McCarthy. However, after three speakership votes, support for the Ohio Republican began to wane -- prompting Republicans to vote to remove him as their nominee.\n\nHowever, Jordan is well-liked among his conservative colleagues as well as Trump, making it likely he could be eyed as a top contender should the former president return to the White House next year.\n\nGOP Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik (R-NY)\n\nAnother Republican leader who could be a top contender is House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik (R-NY), a top Trump ally in the House.\n\nUnlike the others, Stefanik did not pursue a speakership bid in October after McCarthy's removal. However, the conference chairwoman is well known among her GOP colleagues and has established herself as a top defender of Trump in the lower chamber.\n\nHowever, Stefanik is also on a short-list of candidates being considered for Trump's running mate in the 2024 election, making it likely she would not seek the top House position.\n\nOther options\n\nEven if those candidates did launch bids for the speakership at some point in the future, it's not guaranteed Republicans would coalesce around a single candidate. That was the struggle GOP lawmakers faced in October, eventually leading to Johnson's candidacy as a relatively unknown lawmaker at the time.\n\nJohnson has indicated he plans to continue in his leadership position despite efforts to oust him, telling reporters this week he has already begun to map out a plan for the party next year. Johnson said he has the backing of Trump, which could help secure enough support across the GOP conference to solidify his hold on the gavel.\n\nOther lawmakers have suggested there is no lawmaker who could secure the full support of the conference, with Rep. Troy Nehls (R-TX) repeatedly joking last year that not even \"the Lord Jesus himself could manage this group.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nSome lawmakers have cheekily suggested putting themselves in the speaker's chair, becoming a running joke on Capitol Hill.\n\n\"Under the Burchett administration,\" Rep. Tim Burchett (R-TN) vowed to have \"Taco Tuesdays and a mariachi band.\"\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Here's why his job is far from safe. - The Boston Globe", "body": "But while Democrats in the minority threw the Louisiana congressman a life raft by voting on his side, they made clear they might not do so again. That means the threat for Johnson still lingers as Greene and other lawmakers can at any time call up another motion to oust him.\n\nThe episode highlights the increasingly precarious situation for Johnson, who faces the same conservative forces that took down his predecessor, Kevin McCarthy, but with an even smaller majority that has forced him to continuously rely on Democratic support to carry out the most basic functions of legislating. Republicans control the House by the barest of margins, 217-213.\n\nHere's what to know about how the House can remove a speaker and what's ahead for Johnson:\n\nThe current rules of the House allow any lawmaker -- Democrat or Republican -- to put forward a resolution declaring the speaker's chair vacant. If the House approves the resolution, it has the effect of ousting the speaker from office.\n\nThe \"motion to vacate\" has existed for most of congressional history. But it had never been deployed successfully until last October when a rebel band of Republicans joined with Democrats to oust McCarthy as speaker.\n\nMcCarthy's removal came, in part, as the result of the concessions he was forced to make to win the speaker's gavel in the first place. Among the concessions was agreeing that a motion to vacate could be triggered by a single member -- the threshold that historically has been the norm, but that had been abandoned by Democrats in the majority.\n\nProponents of allowing a single lawmaker to file the motion said it promotes accountability, noting its long history in the House.\n\nAt any point, a member of the House can introduce a privileged resolution -- a designation that gives it priority over other measures -- to declare the office of the speaker of the House of Representatives vacant.\n\nOnce the motion is introduced, the lawmaker sponsoring it can request a vote on the House floor. Such a request forces House leaders to take action within two legislative days.\n\nBut there are procedural motions that members of either party can make to slow or stop the process -- and that's exactly what happened when Greene called for a vote Wednesday on removing Johnson.\n\nThe No. 2 House Republican, Steve Scalise, immediately made a motion to \"table\" Greene's resolution, which defeats it if successful. The vote to table was fast and overwhelming, with lawmakers voting 359-43 to defeat her effort and keep Johnson in the job.\n\nThe speaker had fought for months to navigate an increasingly fractured Republican conference, which has -- in effect -- been operating in the majority in name only since January 2023.\n\nRepublicans unanimously chose Johnson late last year to replace McCarthy after several candidates for the job failed to gain enough support. His conservative bent was seen as a welcome departure by the most extreme members of his party who had accused McCarthy for years of being too moderate.\n\nBut Greene, who became a McCarthy ally late in his tenure, has been skeptical of Johnson's speakership from the beginning. While she criticized her fellow far-right colleagues for toppling McCarthy, she had warned Johnson for months that she would try to remove him in a similar fashion if he were to push ahead with a package to support Ukraine as it battles Russia's invasion.\n\n\"He should not bring funding for Ukraine,\" Greene had told reporters.\n\nBut Johnson did just that last month when he advanced a foreign aid package for Ukraine to the floor where it was overwhelmingly approved and signed into law.\n\nOther Republicans are also critical of Johnson, including Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who was a co-sponsor of Greene's resolution to oust him.\n\nIt remains to be seen, but the vote Wednesday showed Johnson's job is far from safe.\n\nWithout Democratic help, Johnson could have easily been ousted. Eleven Republicans voted to proceed with Greene's effort, more than the number of GOP votes it took to oust McCarthy last fall. Seven Democrats voted present and all but 32 of the others voted with Republicans to block the effort to oust him.\n\n\"Our decision to stop Marjorie Taylor Greene from plunging the country into further chaos is rooted in our commitment to solve problems,\" Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said after the vote.\n\nAsked what they might do if there were another attempt to oust the speaker, Jeffries said, \"Haven't given it a thought.\"\n\nSome Republicans are frustrated by the threats to Johnson and were dismissive of Greene. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., said of those trying to remove the speaker, \"They're pretty good at getting attention, but they have not been recognized for their ability to get things done.\"\n\nHe said if they keep pushing to oust the speaker, \"I think you can expect more of the same: Failure.\"\n\nThe speaker of the House, under the rules of the chamber, is required to keep a list of individuals who can act as speaker pro tempore in the event a chair is vacated. The list, which is oddly written by the sitting speaker at any given time, remains with the House clerk and would be made public if the speakership were vacant.\n\nThe first person on that list would be named speaker pro tempore and their first order of business would be to hold an election for a new speaker. The House then would vote as many times as it took to elect a speaker.\n\nIn the case of McCarthy, the role of speaker pro tem fell to his close confidant Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., the chair of the House Financial Services Committee. He was in the role for three weeks, until Johnson's election.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_to_vacate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Motion to vacate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Scalise", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steve Scalise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First-past-the-post voting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliamentary procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusty_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dusty Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_pro_tempore", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President pro tempore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Massie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Massie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Financial_Services", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on Financial Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_tempore", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro tempore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_McHenry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick McHenry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speaker (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Subcultures", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Subcultures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/AObOn2Ixl9GnLvmyHlptdQEXpy0=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/YHNJL727VNWHLYN7XIKIRCRG7Q.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551299", "eventUri": "eng-9551299", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 452988436, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 406, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 406}}}

The second this year. Only this time it was against Mike Johnson, the speaker who replaced Kevin McCarthy after he was removed during a motion to vacate earlier in the year.\n\nThe big change this time was that Democrats rallied to Johnson's side, defending him against the Republicans that tried to take him out and resoundingly defeating the measure, which really takes a lot of the wind out of the sails of future rebellions against the Republican speaker at least for the rest of 2024. Democrats and moderate Republicans are both tired of this level of chaos and want to defang the Republicans, who want to make life harder for the leader of the House of Representatives. That doesn't mean they're all allies now however. Mike Johnson is going to spend the rest of the year pushing very partisan measures across the floor of the House of Representatives in order to draw a contrast between Republicans and Democrats that voters understand when they go to cast a ballot in November. There will be a very small number of must pass legislation coming up.\n\nRight now, Congress is working on reauthorization of the FAA. Later in the year, they're going to have to once again pass a budget bill to keep the government funded. Those will probably be very bipartisan measures. And one of the big ironies of the extreme polarization that's happening in the House, including within the Republican faction, is that the House is now effectively functioning more like the bipartisan Senate, which requires a supermajority of 60 senators, and which is always a bipartisan coalition in order to get almost anything done.\n\nThat's now the situation that the House finds itself in. The House is typically the significantly more partisan body. But because of the Republican dissenters against Johnson, they've turned the House into a much more bipartisan place, which really won't get much done this year. So one lesson from Marjorie Taylor Greene this week is that if she comes to the king, she better not miss, she came for the king and she missed. And now she's going to find herself on the outs with the Republicans, probably for the rest of the year.", "source": {"uri": "gzeromedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GZERO Media"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_to_vacate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Motion to vacate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Lieber", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jon Lieber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_McCarthy_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin McCarthy (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partisan_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Partisan (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supermajority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://www.gzeromedia.com/media-library/implications-for-us-house-as-gop-fails-to-oust-speaker-johnson-gzero-us-politics.jpg?id=52211937&width=1245&height=700&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551299", "eventUri": "eng-9551299", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 452988559, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 407, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 407}}}

Marjorie Taylor Greene, his job secured only after House Democrats turned out in force to put an end to the GOP chaos, for now.\n\nBut the oversized role Trump played in propping up Johnson cannot be understated -- or relied upon to save the speaker again.\n\nIn fact, the indicted former president who has been known to flip his friends into foes warned that while Republicans shouldn't be voting to remove Johnson, \"At some point, we may very well be, but this is not the time.\"\n\nThe outcome puts on display the fragility of the unexpected but strategically beneficial alliance that Trump and Johnson have formed ahead of the November election when both hope to be returned to power -- the Republican president in the White House and the loyal foot soldier in Congress.\n\n\"Seems like they're on the same page, and I think that's great,\" said lawyer Cleta Mitchell, who was a key figure in Trump's efforts to challenge the 2020 election.\n\nJohnson has worked diligently to align himself with the former president, the conservative Christian setting aside his once critical views of the presidential contender to present himself as a chief implementer of the Trump Republican Party's Make America Great Again agenda on Capitol Hill.\n\nBarely six months on the job, since Johnson replaced the ousted then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy, the new leader has dashed multiple times to Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort, securing crucial support, including at a glitzy Republican National Committee gala this past weekend.\n\nWhen Trump invited Johnson to the stage to say a few words, the speaker praised the former president as the \"strongman\" the country needs in the White House. Trump and Johnson are cordial, according to a person with knowledge of their relationship, and granted anonymity to discuss it.\n\n\"He's doing a great job,\" Trump said alongside Johnson after another visit last month, ahead of the House vote to approve a national security package with Ukraine funding that Greene warned would lead to a vote on Johnson's ouster.\n\nIn return for his seal of approval, Trump is increasingly able to rely on the speaker's high-profile standing to legitimize his relentless attacks on the U.S. election process, the judicial system and the multiple criminal cases against him, including the federal indictment for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election ahead of the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack.\n\n\"All these cases need to be dropped,\" says Johnson, a constitutional lawyer, who as the House speaker is second in the line of presidential succession. \"President Trump has done nothing wrong. ... It has to stop.\"\n\nTrump is already pre-emptively contesting the 2024 election as potentially rigged before the first ballots are cast, and Johnson, who helped lead legal challenges to Joe Biden's 2020 election victory, is in a powerful position to again question the legitimacy of the outcome.\n\nAsked this week if he believed the 2020 election was legitimate and if he would stand by the new state-certified results this fall, Johnson shook his head in frustration, and demurred. \"What we're talking about today is the 2024 election, nobody can go back and relitigate what happened in 2020,\" he said.\n\nThe joint venture between Trump and Johnson was in clear focus Wednesday ahead of the House action when the speaker, flanked on the Capitol steps by a who's who of the former president's advisers, announced new legislation that would require proof of citizenship before Americans are eligible to vote.\n\nJohnson had promised Trump a voting-citizenship bill during one of the Mar-a-Lago visits, and the unveiling of it alongside Mitchell, Stephen Miller, the architect of Trump's hardline immigration policies, and others showed just how embedded the former president's Make America Great Again movement has become in the House speaker's agenda.\n\nElection experts said there is scant evidence that non-citizens vote in U.S. elections, and past reviews including one pursued by the Trump administration have not produced significant cases of wrongdoing.\n\nNevertheless, Johnson and the others argued without proof that immigrants are being brought into the U.S. to illegally vote. The legislation can be seen as groundwork for the challenges Trump may pose in the aftermath of the November election.\n\n\"If this bill does not become law, then Joe Biden and Democrats will have engineered one of the greatest interferences in any democratic nation in the history of the world,\" Miller said outside the Capitol.\n\nStill, the legislative push did not placate Greene, who hours later tried and failed to remove the speaker from office.\n\nColleagues booed in protest. An overwhelming majority, 359-43, kept Johnson in his job, for now.\n\n\"I'm proud of what I did today,\" Greene said afterward on the Capitol steps.\n\nIt's the second time in a matter of months that Republicans have worked to oust their own speaker, an unheard of level of party upheaval with a move rarely seen in U.S. history.\n\nWithout Democratic help, Johnson would have certainly faced a more dismal outcome. All told, 196 and 163 Democrats voted to table Greene's motion. But 11 Republicans voted to proceed with the effort, more than it took to remove McCarthy last fall, a first in U.S. history.\n\nDemocrats have also made clear their help was for this moment alone, and not a promise of an enduring partnership for Johnson's survival.\n\n\"Our decision to stop Marjorie Taylor Greene from plunging the country into further chaos is rooted in our commitment to solve problems,\" said Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., after the vote.\n\n\"The only thing we ask of our House Republican colleagues is for traditional Republicans to further isolate the extreme MAGA Republican wing of the GOP,\" said Jeffries, who is in line to become speaker if Democrats win control of the House in the fall. \"We need more common sense and less chaos.\"\n\nAsked about a future motion to vacate the speaker, Jeffries said, \"Haven't given it a thought.\"\n\nBy relying on Democratic backing, Johnson risks inciting more criticism that he is insufficiently loyal to the party.\n\nAnd the threat still lingers -- any single lawmaker can call up the motion to vacate the speaker.\n\nAssociated Press writers Kevin Freking, Michelle Price, Stephen Groves, Mary Clare

Here's why his job is far from safe.", "body": "In a stunning show of unity in the often divided House, Democrats joined a majority of Republicans on Wednesday to save the GOP Speaker from an attempt by fellow Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene to remove him from his post.\n\nBut while Democrats in the minority threw the Louisiana Congressman a life raft by voting on his side, they made clear they might not do so again. That means the threat for Johnson still lingers as Greene and other lawmakers can at any time call up another motion to oust him.\n\nThe episode highlights the increasingly precarious situation for Johnson, who faces the same conservative forces that took down his predecessor, Kevin McCarthy, but with an even smaller majority that has forced him to continuously rely on Democratic support to carry out the most basic functions of legislating. Republicans control the House by the barest of margins, 217-213.\n\nHere's what to know about how the House can remove a Speaker and what's ahead for Johnson:\n\nWhat is a motion to vacate?\n\nThe current rules of the House allow any lawmaker -- Democrat or Republican -- to put forward a resolution declaring the Speaker's chair vacant. If the House approves the resolution, it has the effect of ousting the Speaker from office.\n\nThe \"motion to vacate\" has existed for most of congressional history. But it had never been deployed successfully until last October when a rebel band of Republicans joined with Democrats to oust McCarthy as Speaker.\n\nMcCarthy's removal came, in part, as the result of the concessions he was forced to make to win the Speaker's gavel in the first place. Among the concessions was agreeing that a motion to vacate could be triggered by a single member -- the threshold that historically has been the norm, but that had been abandoned by Democrats in the majority.\n\nProponents of allowing a single lawmaker to file the motion said it promotes accountability, noting its long history in the House.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nAt any point, a member of the House can introduce a privileged resolution -- a designation that gives it priority over other measures -- to declare the office of the Speaker of the House of Representatives vacant.\n\nOnce the motion is introduced, the lawmaker sponsoring it can request a vote on the House floor. Such a request forces House leaders to take action within two legislative days.\n\nBut there are procedural motions that members of either party can make to slow or stop the process -- and that's exactly what happened when Greene called for a vote Wednesday on removing Johnson.\n\nThe No. 2 House Republican, Steve Scalise, immediately made a motion to \"table\" Greene's resolution, which defeats it if successful. The vote to table was fast and overwhelming, with lawmakers voting 359-43 to defeat her effort and keep Johnson in the job.\n\nWho is trying to oust Johnson and why?\n\nThe Speaker had fought for months to navigate an increasingly fractured Republican conference, which has -- in effect -- been operating in the majority in name only since January 2023.\n\nRepublicans unanimously chose Johnson late last year to replace McCarthy after several candidates for the job failed to gain enough support. His conservative bent was seen as a welcome departure by the most extreme members of his party who had accused McCarthy for years of being too moderate.\n\nBut Greene, who became a McCarthy ally late in his tenure, has been skeptical of Johnson's speakership from the beginning. While she criticized her fellow far-right colleagues for toppling McCarthy, she had warned Johnson for months that she would try to remove him in a similar fashion if he were to push ahead with a package to support Ukraine as it battles Russia's invasion.\n\n\"He should not bring funding for Ukraine,\" Greene had told reporters.\n\nBut Johnson did just that last month when he advanced a foreign aid package for Ukraine to the floor where it was overwhelmingly approved and signed into law.\n\nOther Republicans are also critical of Johnson, including Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who was a co-sponsor of Greene's resolution to oust him.\n\nCould there be enough votes to oust Johnson?\n\nIt remains to be seen, but the vote Wednesday showed Johnson's job is far from safe.\n\nWithout Democratic help, Johnson could have easily been ousted. Eleven Republicans voted to proceed with Greene's effort, more than the number of GOP votes it took to oust McCarthy last fall. Seven Democrats voted present and all but 32 of the others voted with Republicans to block the effort to oust him.\n\n\"Our decision to stop Marjorie Taylor Greene from plunging the country into further chaos is rooted in our commitment to solve problems,\" Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said after the vote.\n\nAsked what they might do if there were another attempt to oust the Speaker, Jeffries said, \"Haven't given it a thought.\"\n\nSome Republicans are frustrated by the threats to Johnson and were dismissive of Greene. Rep. Dusty Johnson, a South Dakota Republican, said of those trying to remove the Speaker, \"They're pretty good at getting attention, but they have not been recognized for their ability to get things done.\"\n\nHe said if they keep pushing to oust the Speaker, \"I think you can expect more of the same: Failure.\"\n\nIf Johnson is ousted, what would happen next?\n\nThe Speaker of the House, under the rules of the chamber, is required to keep a list of individuals who can act as Speaker Pro Tempore in the event a chair is vacated. The list, which is oddly written by the sitting Speaker at any given time, remains with the House Clerk and would be made public if the speakership were vacant.\n\nThe first person on that list would be named Speaker Pro Tempore and their first order of business would be to hold an election for a new Speaker. The House then would vote as many times as it took to elect a Speaker.\n\nIn the case of McCarthy, the role of speaker pro tem fell to his close confidant Rep. Patrick McHenry, a North Carolina Republican, the Chair of the House Financial Services Committee. He was in the role for three weeks, until Johnson's election.\n\n___\n\nRepublished with permission of The Associated Press.", "source": {"uri": "floridapolitics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Florida Politics - Campaigns & Elections.

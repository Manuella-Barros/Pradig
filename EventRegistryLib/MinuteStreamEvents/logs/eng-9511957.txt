Talking about things?\"\n\nRelated: Prince Louis Stars in 6th Birthday Portrait Taken by Kate Middleton as She and William Share Personal Message\n\nOn Thursday, Prince William got to see firsthand the work of the Matrix Project, which Freddie highlighted in his letter for bringing boys aged 11 to 14 together for weekly meetings that develop ideas and projects to tackle mental health challenges. The royal joined a session with some of the boys and was told how the group launched the #AmIManlyEnough campaign last year to encourage males to communicate more about their feelings and tackle the stigma of mental health.\n\nWilliam also met representatives of Student Voice to hear about their projects set up at the school to promote positive mental health and joined a workshop with students discussing issues related to well-being, including designing their own calm kits and their dream well-being hub.\n\n\"What a beautiful opportunity for our youngsters to shine a spotlight on everything we do in school,\" headteacher Christina Handy-Rivett told PEOPLE. \"And to have His Royal Highness who pioneers and supports mental health it was such a special moment.\"\n\n\"We are extraordinarily excited and so proud. It's such a unique response to help support and raise awareness of what we are undertaking as a school community to really engage strategies to support mental health and wellbeing .\"\n\nHandy-Rivett added that they were \"shocked\" at the overwhelming response to the letter which they posted on social media.\n\nCan't get enough of PEOPLE's Royals coverage?

And this is a perfect example of that,\" added Kerry Whitehouse, senior mental health lead at the school to PEOPLE.\n\n\"For us to have members of the royal family who are actively championing mental health is incredible. For young people to look at the future king and see him championing work and being passionate about the same things as they are is incredibly important.\"\n\n\"It's a huge issue which often gets overlooked. There is no price tag you can put on seeing influential people, on another scale -- and these are global influencers -- championing the messages our students believe in.\"\n\nLater on Thursday, Prince William is set to see two more organizations focused on giving a second chance to those who are homeless and fighting addiction.\n\nSince Princess Kate made her announcement on March 22 that she was undergoing treatment, William has curtailed his public duties, making sure he is home as much as possible for the couple's three children -- Prince George, 10, Princess Charlotte, 8, and Prince Louis, who celebrated his sixth birthday on April 23 -- and helping Kate.\n\nBoth Prince William and Princess Kate have prioritized the promotion of mental health for much of their public life. Alongside Prince Harry, they spearheaded the successful Heads Together campaign that did much for raising awareness of the challenges many people face.\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up

I promised I would come.'\n\nBut for William, the moment was bittersweet since he was without Kate, 42, who has stepped back from public engagements after starting a course of 'preventative' chemotherapy.\n\n'I am sorry Catherine can't be here as well. She would have loved to,' William told a staff member.\n\nPrince William greeted Freddie Hadley (left) today, praising him for his 'very well written' letter outlining his school's mental health initiatives\n\nThe Princess of Wales announced she was battling cancer last month - amid mounting pressure for the Palace to comment on her condition.\n\nIn the emotional message, filmed in Windsor, Kate revealed the news had come as a 'huge shock' and that she and William 'have been doing everything we can to process and manage this privately for the sake of our young family'.\n\nToday marked the first time that William has undertaken what is known as a 'royal away day' since news of the Princess of Wales's cancer diagnosis and treatment was publicly announced.\n\nGiven her commitment to improving the mental wellbeing of children with the Shaping Us campaign, Kate would have likely enjoyed today's engagement.\n\nFreddie Hadley, 12, posted his letter on X, formerly Twitter, on World Mental Health Day last October telling the royal about the brilliant work he and his friends at St Michael's Church of England High School in Rowley Regis, Sandwell, were doing.\n\nTo his delight, William personally replied, writing: 'Good afternoon Freddie, I'm so sorry Catherine and I can't be with you and the rest of the students at St Michael's today. 'Tackling mental health challenges and stigmas head on is so important, please keep up this important work. W'\n\nBut Freddie's letter clearly had a deeply moving effect on the prince, who asked his team to secretly arrange a visit to the school next time he was planning public engagements in the West Midlands.\n\nAnd today he shocked the schoolboy and his classmates by arriving unannounced as the first of three engagements in the region.\n\nWilliam apologised for Kate's absence, adding that 'she would have loved to' be there (seen in November)\n\nWilliam is snapped shaking hands with 12-year-old Freddie Hadley, who made the initial invitation to visit the school\n\nFreddie Hadley, 12, wrote to the Prince of Wales last year telling him about the initiative he and his peers have set up to help pupils manage their mental health\n\nAfter initially sending his apologies for not being able to visit Freddie and his classmates, William gave St Michael's school a wave today ahead of his arrival\n\nIt is the first time that William has undertaken what is known as a 'royal away day' since news of the Princess of Wales' cancer diagnosis and treatment was publicly announced.\n\nFreddie had no idea that the Prince was going to visit - instead he and his fellow pupils were told to prepare for a VIP guest.... The Lord Lieutenant of the West Midlands.\n\nEven as he saw the suite of cars with a police escort approaching the campus , he later said, he still didn't click.\n\nBut when he saw William get out of the car, his face broke into a broad grin.\n\n'So this is the young lad who started it all off,' William said. Very nice to see you, thank you for your letter.' 'You're very welcome,' replied Freddie.\n\n'Did you think you would get a response, like that?' asked the prince. 'Yes I did,' Freddie said.\n\n'Oh you did, that's confidence, ' laughed William. He asked: 'Why did you decide to write to me?'\n\nFreddie explained that he had been very impressed with the royal's work on mental health issues.\n\nDuring his visit, William met representatives of Student Voice and had conversations with students about mental health\n\nPrince William revealed Princess Charlotte 's favourite joke this morning during a surprise school visit on a day of engagements in the West Midlands where he joined Freddie Hadley (centre) on the school's radio station\n\nInside the school William was taken to meet the school's 'wellbeing champions' and handed a cup of 'positivity-tea'\n\nThe prince apologised for not being able to come when he was first invited on world Mental Health Day but said he hope he had made up for it.\n\nInside the building William told one member of staff: ' Lots of people write letters but Freddie's was a really well written letter. I promised I would come. ' He added: 'I am sorry Catherine can't be here as well. She would have loved to.'\n\nSt. Michael's employs a whole school approach to mental health and wellbeing and in May 2022 achieved a gold standard award by the Carnegie Centre of Excellent for Mental Health in Schools.\n\nThe school launched 'Student Voice' in 2012, consisting of up to 100 students who meet at lunchtimes, after school, in the evenings and during school periods to develop initiatives ranging from fundraising to mental health, including working with elderly members of the community.\n\nIt's team of enthusiastic student Wellbeing Ambassadors also help design and implement a range of initiatives to support students.\n\nPrince William waves to crowds of royal fans as he visits a school in Sandwell today\n\nDuring his visit William plans to meet representatives of Student\n\nVoice, and join a session with the Matrix Project which was set up to shine a spotlight on male mental health and sees boys aged 11-14 meet weekly to develop ideas and projects to tackle mental health challenges.\n\nThe group launched its #AmIManlyEnough campaign last year to tackle\n\nthe stigma around male mental health and encourage men and boys to communicate more about their feelings.\n\nHe will also join a workshop with a larger group of students who ara discussing a range of issues related to mental health and wellbeing, including designing their own calm kits and their dream wellbeing hub.\n\nDuring the visit, William revealed that when he began undertaking royal work, he never initially intended to look into mental health as his most championed cause\n\nIn his letter to William last year Freddie neatly wrote that he and his friends had set up #AMIMANLYENOUGH? with the aim of tackling the stigma that 'girls cry and boys get mad'.\n\n'Through our work we discovered that suicide is the biggest killer in young males and this won't change unless people start the conversation,' he wrote, with extraordinary maturity.\n\n'Our passion for mental health has given us opportunities to organise and lead community events, present at national conferences, take part in radio interviews and even gain celebrity endorsement.'\n\nHe invited the heir to the throne to join the 'soft launch' of their campaign on World Mental Health Day as their VIP guest.\n\nAnd while William had to regretfully decline on that occasion, he made his mind up to go and see their work in action at some point in the near future.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Michael's_Church_of_England_High_School,_Rowley_Regis", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "St Michael's Church of England High School, Rowley Regis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandwell", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sandwell"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sandwell"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowley_Regis", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rowley Regis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rowley Regis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catherine, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chemotherapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Midlands_(county)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Midlands (county)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Midlands (county)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windsor,_Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Windsor, Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Windsor, Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Lieutenant_of_the_West_Midlands", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lord Lieutenant of the West Midlands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Mental_Health_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Mental Health Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_VIII", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edward VIII"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_VII", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edward VII"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Charlotte_of_Wales_(1796\u20131817)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Princess Charlotte of Wales (1796\u20131817)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold standard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stigma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social stigma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/04/25/14/84082163-0-image-m-46_1714053580938.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9511957", "eventUri": "eng-9511957", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 216, "relevance": 1}

Prince and Princess of Wales have worked tirelessly to end the stigma surrounding mental health.\n\nThey have awarded grants from their Royal Foundation to organisations working in the field, and Wills himself has previously made it a priority to boost support for 999 heroes.\n\nIn the height of the Pandemic, the couple were so moved by stories from NHS staff and emergency workers, they created the 'Our Frontline' scheme.\n\nThey worked with charities Mind, Samaritans, Shout and Hospice UK to give round the clock mental health support to key workers.\n\nMeanwhile, in 2018, Prince William made headlines when he opened up about the struggles he faced after Princess Diana's death.\n\nHe teamed up with the Heads Together campaign, which worked to squash the stigma surrounding mental health, and previously admitted he disapproved on the monarchy's 'stiff upper lip' tradition.\n\nIt comes as The Princes and Princess of Wales also shared a heartfelt message this morning to mark Anzac Day.\n\n\"On #AnzacDay we remember all Australians and New Zealanders who have served and died in military operations #LestWeForget,\" they penned on their X platform.\n\nAnzac Day, April 25, marks the anniversary of the start of the First World War Gallipoli landings.\n\nIt is a national day of remembrance for Australia and New Zealand.\n\nThousands of Anzac troops, Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, died alongside British allies in the ill-fated 1915 campaign.\n\nWaves of Allied forces launched an amphibious attack on the strategically important Turkish peninsula, which was key to controlling the Dardanelles straits, the crucial route to the Black Sea and Russia.\n\nBut the plan backed by Winston Churchill, then first lord of the admiralty, was flawed and the campaign, which faced a heroic defence by the Turks, led to a stalemate and withdrawal eight months later.\n\nAnzac Day has taken place every year since 1916 and now also stands for all soldiers of those nations involved in military conflict.\n\nLast year Prince William laid a wreath of red poppies and white flowers at Wellington Arch in Hyde Park Corner, London.", "source": {"uri": "the-sun.com",

During a small group session to record for the school radio show, Prince William was asked to share a \"dad joke,\" but he opted to quote a classic that is a current hit with his 8-year-old daughter, Princess Charlotte.\n\n\"I am here with the gang here talking about male mental health, and I've been asked to produce a dad joke. I was trying to channel Jack Whitehall because most of his jokes are pretty dad-like,\" the royal began referring to the British actor and comedian, as seen in a video shared to X by Rebecca English of the Daily Mail.\n\n\"I think what I'll do is say a joke that is Charlotte's favorite joke at the moment, that she keeps telling me,\" he told the pupils, adding that they'd have to interact for it to work.\n\n\"Knock knock,\" Prince William began. \"Who's there?\" the students replied in unison.\n\n\"Interrupting cow,\" Prince William continued.\n\nAs the kids started to reply, \"Interrupting cow who?\" Prince William interjected with \"Moo!\" prompting giggles from the group.\n\n\"That's the one I hear a lot of at home at the moment,\" said the royal dad, who shares Prince George, 10, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, 6, with his wife, Kate Middleton.\n\n\"That's the greatest one I can think of that's clean and broadcastable,\" he added with a laugh before receiving a compliment from one special student.\n\n\"It's good, it's good!\" said 12-year-old Freddie Hadley, who sat next to the Prince of Wales.\n\nSt. Michael's Church of England High School came on the royal's radar after Freddie wrote a letter to Prince William and Princess Kate, 42. Freddie invited the royal couple to the school's celebrations for World Mental Health Day in October 2023.\n\nKing Charles' elder son replied with a personal message on X: \"Good afternoon Freddie, I'm so sorry Catherine and I can't be with you and the rest of the students at St Michael's today. Tackling mental health challenges and stigmas head on is so important, please keep up this important work.\"\n\nPrince William signed the message \"W,\" indicating that the note came directly from him.\n\nOn April 25, the pair finally got to meet when the royal visited the school, where Prince William told Freddie, \"Your letter worked.\"\n\nPrince William got to see firsthand the work of the Matrix Project, which Freddie highlighted in his letter for bringing boys aged 11 to 14 together to develop ideas and projects to tackle mental health challenges. He joined a session with some of the boys and was told how they launched the #AmIManlyEnough campaign to encourage men to communicate their feelings and tackle taboos surrounding mental health.\n\nCan't get enough of PEOPLE's Royals coverage? Sign up for our free Royals newsletter to get the latest updates on Kate Middleton, Meghan Markle and more!\n\nFreddie Hadley tells PEOPLE that it was a \"massive shock\" to see Prince William arrive at his school.\n\n\"He is a very nice guy,\" the student says. \"When I sat down with him about what we do in school with our Matrix Project, I got more comfortable and I felt like I got into his way of thinking about it. He asked us about why we do our stuff and why he is an advocate for male mental health.\"\n\nFreddie adds that William \"said from working with charities for mental health he realizes -- as he's a male himself -- he's gone through those things before. He realizes it is such a massive thing in today's society, and he wanted to step up and get these issues sorted out.\"\n\nPrince William also met representatives of Student Voice to hear about their projects set up at St. Michael's to promote positive mental health and joined a workshop with students discussing issues related to well-being, including designing calm kits and their dream well-being hub.\n\n\"What a beautiful opportunity for our youngsters to shine a spotlight on everything we do in school,\" headteacher Christina Handy-Rivett tells PEOPLE. \"And to have His Royal Highness, who pioneers and supports mental health, it was such a special moment.\"\n\nPrince William's day is set to continue with visits to two organizations dedicated to providing support for those who are homeless and fighting addiction.", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

'Tackling mental health challenges and stigmas head on is so important, please keep up this important work.

I'm sorry I couldn't come to you in October.'\n\nLater in the visit, the Prince joined Freddie and his classmates for a segment on the school's radio station, where he was asked to share a 'dad joke'.\n\nThe father-of-three went on to share a quip that he claimed is Princess Charlotte's favourite.\n\nHe said: 'I'm kind of trying to channel Jack Whitehall, because most of his jokes are pretty dad-like.'\n\nThe Prince of Wales also thanked the station and the school for welcoming him - despite the fact he supports Aston Villa.\n\nIt is the first time that William has undertaken what is known as a 'royal away day' since news of the Princess of Wales' cancer diagnosis and treatment was publicly announced.\n\nSt. Michael's employs a whole school approach to mental health and wellbeing and in May 2022 achieved a gold standard award by the Carnegie Centre of Excellent for Mental Health in Schools.\n\nThe school launched 'Student Voice' in 2012, consisting of up to 100 students who meet at lunchtimes, after school, in the evenings and during school periods to develop initiatives ranging from fundraising to mental health, including working with elderly members of the community.\n\nLittle Freddie, pictured, wrote to the Prince of Wales last year informing him about a mental health initiative he and his friends have set up at school\n\nFreddie and William appeared instantly engaged in conversation after meeting, as the Prince has arrived to learn more about Freddie's work in mental health\n\nWilliam looked sharp in a black suit with a black skinny tie as he arrived at the school as the first of three engagements in the West Midlands today\n\nPrince William looked sharp in a dark suit with a blue checked shirt and a skinny black tie as he smiled upon arrival\n\nFreddie Hadley, 12, wrote to the Prince of Wales last year telling him about the initiative he and his peers have set up to help pupils manage their mental health\n\nIt's team of enthusiastic student Wellbeing Ambassadors also help design and implement a range of initiatives to support students.\n\nDuring his visit William plans to meet representatives of Student Voice, and join a session with the Matrix Project which was set up to shine a spotlight on male mental health and sees boys aged 11-14 meet weekly to develop ideas and projects to tackle mental health challenges.\n\nThe group launched its #AmIManlyEnough campaign last year to tackle the stigma aroundmale mental health and encourage men and boys to communicate more about their feelings.\n\nAfter initially sending his apologies for not being able to visit Freddie and his classmates, William gave St Michael's school a wave today ahead of his arrival\n\nHe will also join a workshop with a larger group of students who are discussing a range of issues related to mental health and wellbeing, including designing their own calm kits and their dream wellbeing hub.\n\nIn his letter to William last year Freddie neatly wrote that he and his friends had set up #AMIMANLYENOUGH?

W\"\n\nBut today, Freddie's wish came true, as he got to discuss the work they do with Wills.\n\nAnd, William will later join boys aged 11-14 in a session speaking about male mental health.\n\nThe Prince and Princess of Wales have worked tirelessly to end the stigma surrounding mental health.\n\nThey have awarded grants from their Royal Foundation to organisations working in the field, and Wills himself has previously made it a priority to boost support for 999 heroes.\n\nIn the height of the Pandemic, the couple were so moved by stories from NHS staff and emergency workers, they created the 'Our Frontline' scheme.\n\nThey worked with charities Mind, Samaritans, Shout and Hospice UK to give round the clock mental health support to key workers.\n\nMeanwhile, in 2018, Prince William made headlines when he opened up about the struggles he faced after Princess Diana's death.\n\nHe teamed up with the Heads Together campaign, which worked to squash the stigma surrounding mental health, and previously admitted he disapproved on the monarchy's 'stiff upper lip' tradition.\n\nIt comes as The Princes and Princess of Wales also shared a heartfelt message this morning to mark Anzac Day.\n\n\"On #AnzacDay we remember all Australians and New Zealanders who have served and died in military operations #LestWeForget,\" they penned on their X platform.\n\nAnzac Day, April 25, marks the anniversary of the start of the First World War Gallipoli landings.\n\nIt is a national day of remembrance for Australia and New Zealand.\n\nThousands of Anzac troops, Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, died alongside British allies in the ill-fated 1915 campaign.\n\nWaves of Allied forces launched an amphibious attack on the strategically important Turkish peninsula, which was key to controlling the Dardanelles straits, the crucial route to the Black Sea and Russia.\n\nBut the plan backed by Winston Churchill, then first lord of the admiralty, was flawed and the campaign, which faced a heroic defence by the Turks, led to a stalemate and withdrawal eight months later.\n\nAnzac Day has taken place every year since 1916 and now also stands for all soldiers of those nations involved in military conflict.\n\nLast year Prince William laid a wreath of red poppies and white flowers at Wellington Arch in Hyde Park Corner, London.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk",

I'm sorry I couldn't come to you in October.'\n\nLater in the visit, the Prince joined Freddie and his classmates for a segment on the school's radio station, where he was asked to share a 'dad joke'.\n\nThe father-of-three went on to share a quip that he claimed is Princess Charlotte's favourite.\n\nHe said: 'I'm kind of trying to channel Jack Whitehall, because most of his jokes are pretty dad-like.'\n\nThe Prince of Wales also thanked the station and the school for welcoming him - despite the fact he supports Aston Villa.\n\nDuring the same conversation, William revealed that when he began undertaking royal work, he never initially intended to look into mental health as his most championed cause.\n\nWilliam's a hit with the kids!

He cupped his hands around it and said he was glad it was still hot.\n\n'I hope you're not disappointed,' he told the pupils who had only just discovered he was the VIP guest. 'It could have gone either way.'\n\nThe children aged between 12 and 15 talked him through the incredible work the school has being doing around mental health, including their 21 days of kindness in order to form a a habit.\n\nAs they went round and round the table William grinned in admiration, remarking: 'Wow, well done everyone. And you can do it all so fast. These are all things you guys have been doing? You've been busy.\n\nLittle Freddie, pictured, wrote to the Prince of Wales last year informing him about a mental health initiative he and his friends have set up at school\n\nFreddie and William appeared instantly engaged in conversation after meeting, as the Prince has arrived to learn more about Freddie's work in mental health\n\nWilliam looked sharp in a black suit with a black skinny tie as he arrived at the school as the first of three engagements in the West Midlands today\n\nHundreds of students at St. Michael's Church of England High School eagerly await the Prince\n\nPrince William looked sharp in a dark suit with a blue checked shirt and a skinny black tie as he smiled upon arrival\n\nFreddie Hadley, 12, wrote to the Prince of Wales last year telling him about the initiative he and his peers have set up to help pupils manage their mental health\n\n'What's been the biggest challenge? ' The pupils told him they had been determined to foster a sense of positivity. 'We try to overcome the bumps in the road,' the Prince was told.\n\n'And what does mental health mean to you guys?' William asked. 'Does it get a good reaction now? Do people still feel a bit shy? '\n\n'It's the feeling you have about yourself,' another pupil told him, 'you chose your own label.'\n\nDuring his visit, William met representatives of Student Voice and joined a session with the Matrix Project, which was set up to shine a spotlight on male mental health and sees boys aged 11-14 meet weekly to develop ideas and projects to tackle mental health challenges.\n\nThe group launched its #AmIManlyEnough campaign last year to tackle the stigma aroundmale mental health and encourage men and boys to communicate more about their feelings.\n\nAfter initially sending his apologies for not being able to visit Freddie and his classmates, William gave St Michael's school a wave today ahead of his arrival\n\nHe also joined a workshop with a larger group of students who were discussing a range of issues related to mental health and wellbeing, including designing their own calm kits and their dream wellbeing hub.\n\nIn his letter to William last year Freddie neatly wrote that he and

with the aim of tackling the stigma that 'girls cry and boys get mad'.\n\n'Through our work we discovered that suicide is the biggest killer in young males and this won't change unless people start the conversation,' he wrote, with extraordinary maturity.\n\n'Our passion for mental health has given us opportunities to organise and lead community events, present at national conferences, take part in radio interviews and even gain celebrity endorsement.'\n\nHe invited the heir to the throne to join the 'soft launch' of their campaign on World Mental Health Day as their VIP guest.\n\nAnd while William had to regretfully decline on that occasion, he made his mind up to go and see their work in action at some point in the near future.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_VIII", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Edward VIII"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_(archangel)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michael (archangel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Midlands_(county)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "West Midlands (county)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Midlands (county)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Michael's_Church_of_England_High_School,_Rowley_Regis", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St Michael's Church of England High School, Rowley Regis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandwell", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sandwell"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sandwell"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowley_Regis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rowley Regis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rowley Regis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Mental_Health_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Mental Health Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_tie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Black tie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold standard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stigma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social stigma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/04/25/11/84075871-0-image-m-40_1714042045712.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9511957", "eventUri": "eng-9511957", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4588235294117646, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

I thought if I wrote the letter to him he might recognise us, which he did on Twitter.\"\n\n\"I completely thought it was the Lord Lieutenant who was coming today. Obviously, it was a great surprise so I understand why they didn't tell me, but honestly it's just been wonderful.\n\nI'm just standing there and I see Prince William walking down the drive and I'm like, wow, all this work's finally paid off\n\n\"I couldn't get my head around it, I'm meeting Prince William the future king - it's insane really. I'm just standing there and I see Prince William walking down the drive and I'm like, wow, all this work's finally paid off.\"\n\nThe school runs a number of wellbeing initiatives and William joined a group of pupils, including Freddie, who were from the all-male Matrix Project which runs the Am I Manly Enough? campaign, tackling the stigma around male mental health.\n\nThe group also takes part in a school show, broadcast on local radio, on the topic, and lightens the issue by having a segment on \"dad jokes\" and the prince was asked to contribute and told them a \"knock-knock\" joke.\n\nIn his pre-recorded piece William told the listeners: \"I've been asked to produce a dad joke so I'm trying to channel Jack Whitehall, because most of his jokes are pretty dad-like.\n\n\"I think what I'll do, is I'll say a joke which is Charlotte's favourite joke at the moment, she keeps telling me.\"\n\nWilliam said \"knock knock\" and when the pupils said \"who's there\" the royal replied \"Interrupting cow\" and as the group tried to say \"interrupting cow who?\" he made them laugh by saying \"Mooo\".\n\nThe schoolboys quizzed the prince, who was gifted a brink pink Am I Manly Enough? reusable cup, about his interest in the issue, and he told them he found mental health was the \"bigger piece\", when you put together the \"jigsaw\" of issues like homelessness and depression.\n\nAfter chatting to people in the sector he realised many people were \"terrified\" to talk about the issue: \"I was suddenly like 'this is unacceptable, we've got to be able to talk about this'.\n\n\"And what is quite interesting, when we first started talking about mental health not one celebrity wanted to join us and talk about it - not one.\"\n\nHe stressed the problem of mental health needed to be faced \"upstream\" rather than just focusing on a cure \"If you can tackle these things earlier, you get to them quicker\".\n\nWilliam later joined other pupils engaged in well-being activities like table discussions, and during his visit he found his support of Aston Villa football club, in an area close to local rivals Wolverhampton Wanderers and Birmingham City, raised a few eyebrows.\n\nAs he left the school he was given a rapturous send-off by dozens of children in an atrium area and outside he went on a walkabout shaking hands of pupils as he made his way to his car.", "source": {"uri": "indy100.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "indy100.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Michael's_Church_of_England_High_School,_Rowley_Regis", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "St Michael's Church of England High School, Rowley Regis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandwell", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sandwell"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sandwell"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Midlands_(county)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "West Midlands (county)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Midlands (county)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stigma", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social stigma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Lieutenant_of_Ireland", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lord Lieutenant of Ireland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_visit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State visit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Whitehall", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jack Whitehall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Depression (mood)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Villa_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aston Villa F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://www.indy100.com/media-library/the-prince-of-wales-speaks-to-freddie-hadley-12-who-made-the-initial-invitation-to-visit-st-michaels-church-of-england-high-s.jpg?id=52104615&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C416%2C0%2C417", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9511957", "eventUri": "eng-9511957", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

The group successfully launched the #AmIManlyEnough campaign last year to confront the stigma associated with male mental health and encourage men and boys to openly express their emotions.\n\nMuch to Freddie's joy, Prince William responded to his social media request two days later, during World Mental Health Day, praising Freddie and St Michael's School for their admirable work in addressing mental health problems faced by students. However, he mentioned that he and his wife Kate were not able to spend the day with him.\n\nTo everyone's surprise, including Freddie's, Prince William then turned up at the school. Upon meeting the ambitious young man for the first time, William told him \"I'm here now and I'm sorry I couldn't come to your school in October\", reports the Express.\n\nThe Prince engaged in a heartfelt conversation with Freddie, enquiring about the effectiveness of the Matrix Project at his school. He asked the lad: \"Do you find when you're in the group talking with your friends they all open up as well and are interested in it? \" to which Freddie confidently responded: \"Yes.\"\n\nIn a personal touch last October, the Prince of Wales reached out to Freddie with a letter saying: \"Good afternoon Freddie, I'm so sorry Catherine and I can't be with you and the rest of the students at St Michael's today.

He has more than 25 years' experience at PEOPLE covering the royals, human interest and celebrity.\n\nPrince William is continuing his work to highlight better mental health for young people -- and showing that you never know what might come out of a social media post.\n\nThe Prince of Wales, 41, stepped out amid his wife Kate Middleton's ongoing cancer treatment to visit a school that had caught his eye for their award-winning student-led initiatives. William headed to Birmingham, in England's West Midlands, on April 25 to see St. Michael's Church of England High School in Sandwell.\n\nThe school came on the royal's radar after 12-year-old Freddie Hadley wrote a letter to Prince William and Princess Kate, 42, that was shared on social media for World Mental Health Day in Oct. 2023. Freddie invited the couple to their campaign's launch, writing, \"Our passion for mental health has given us opportunities to organize and lead community events, present at national conferences, take part in radio interviews and even gain celebrity endorsement.\"\n\nPrince William personally replied to the letter on X (formerly Twitter) by writing, \"Good afternoon Freddie, I'm so sorry Catherine and I can't be with you and the rest of the students at St Michael's today. Tackling mental health challenges and stigmas head on is so important, please keep up this important work.\" The Prince of Wales signed the tweet with a \"W,\" the sign that the note came directly from the royal rather than his team.\n\n\"Your letter worked,\" Prince William told Freddie Hadley, 12, from Sandwell, West Midlands on Thursday. They then chatted about how Freddie and his school pals talk about their feelings.\n\n\"They open up?\" William asked. \"What's been the biggest thing? Talking about things?\"\n\nOn Thursday, Prince William got to see firsthand the work of the Matrix Project, which Freddie highlighted in his letter for bringing boys aged 11 to 14 together for weekly meetings that develop ideas and projects to tackle mental health challenges. The royal joined a session with some of the boys and was told how the group launched the #AmIManlyEnough campaign last year to encourage males to communicate more about their feelings and tackle the stigma of mental health.\n\nWilliam also met representatives of Student Voice to hear about their projects set up at the school to promote positive mental health and joined a workshop with students discussing issues related to well-being, including designing their own calm kits and their dream well-being hub.\n\n\"What a beautiful opportunity for our youngsters to shine a spotlight on everything we do in school,\" headteacher Christina Handy-Rivett told PEOPLE. \"And to have His Royal Highness who pioneers and supports mental health it was such a special moment.\"\n\n\"We are extraordinarily excited and so proud. It's such a unique response to help support and raise awareness of what we are undertaking as a school community to really engage strategies to support mental health and wellbeing .\"\n\nHandy-Rivett added that they were \"shocked\" at the overwhelming response to the letter which they posted on social media.\n\nCan't get enough of PEOPLE's Royals coverage? Sign up for our free Royals newsletter to get the latest updates on Kate Middleton, Meghan Markle and more!\n\n\"We are always encouraging children to dream big -- I say to them the sky's the limit and don't put limitations on yourself and if you don't ask, you don't get. And this is a perfect example of that,\" added Kerry Whitehouse, senior mental health lead at the school to PEOPLE.\n\n\"For us to have members of the royal family who are actively championing mental health is incredible.

In one of his stop offs, he visited St Michael's School in Rowley Regis, where he learned about student-led initiatives that are available to pupils to support their mental wellbeing. There he teamed up with several youngsters to record a segment for the school's radio station and the prince was asked to share a \"dad joke\".\n\nWilliam speaks with children at St Michael's Church\n\nAnd in a cheeky swipe at Jack, he said: \"I've been asked to produce a dad joke so I will channel Jack Whitehall as most of his jokes are a bit dad like.\" He added: I think what I'll do is tell Charlotte's favourite joke - but you have to interact with me.\"\n\nHe added: \"Knock, knock\", to which the kids said: \"Who's there?\" He said: \"Interrupting Cow.\" And before the children had a chance to reply: \"Interupting cow, who\" he said: \"Mooooo.\" As the children giggled, William nodded knowing it was a cheesy line - and said: \"I get that a lot at home. It's the greatest one I can think of that's clean and broadcastable!\"\n\nAnd William's quip obviously got back to Jack, who shared a video of William talking about him on X, formerly Twitter, and wrote: \"Rinsed by the future King\" followed by a heart emoji. William's visit to the school comes after back in October to mark World Mental Health Day, pupil Freddie Hadley sent a personal letter to William inviting him to the school after informing him about the Matrix Project.\n\nIn the letter, Freddie explained that it saw a group of 11 to 14-year-old boys meet every week to develop ideas and projects to shine a spotlight on male mental health.\n\nWilliam shook hands with pupils as he left the school\n\nHe then invited William to the school for the launch of a campaign last October, saying he would love for the prince to be there as a VIP. Unfortunately, William and wife Kate were unable to make it at the time due to a prior engagement, but today, William dropped by to see the pupils. On arrival, William congratulated Freddie for his work and sending him a letter and told him: \"Well done you, I'm here now. Your letter worked. I'm sorry I couldn't come to you in October.\"\n\nThe school runs a number of wellbeing initiatives and William joined a group of pupils, including Freddie, who were from the all-male Matrix Project which runs the Am I Manly Enough? campaign, tackling the stigma around male mental health. The schoolboys quizzed the prince, who was gifted a brink pink Am I Manly Enough? reusable cup, about his interest in the issue, and he told them he found mental health was the \"bigger piece\", when you put together the 'jigsaw' of issues like homelessness and depression.\n\nAfter chatting to people in the sector he realised many people were 'terrified' to talk about the issue: \"I was suddenly like 'this is unacceptable, we've got to be able to talk about this'. And what is quite interesting, when we first started talking about mental health not one celebrity wanted to join us and talk about it - not one.\"\n\nPrince William with comedian Jack Whitehall\n\nWilliam later joined other pupils engaged in well-being activities like table discussions, and during his visit he found his support of Aston Villa football club, in an area close to local rivals Wolverhampton Wanderers and Birmingham City, raised a few eyebrows. As he left the school he was given a rapturous send-off by dozens of children in an atrium area and outside he went on a walkabout shaking hands of pupils as he made his way to his car.\n\nToday's engagements in the West Midlands mark the second public outings for William since wife Kate revealed her cancer diagnosis and treatment before Easter. Last week, he returned to duties and gave a helping hand loading food and cooking in the kitchen at food distribution charity Surplus to Supper, in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey.", "source": {"uri":

There he teamed up with several youngsters to record a segment for the school's radio station and the prince was asked to share a \"dad joke\".\n\nWilliam chats to students during a 'Talking Tables' initiative\n\nAnd in a cheeky quip, he said: \"I've been asked to produce a dad joke so I will channel Jack Whitehall as most of his jokes are a bit dad like. \"I think what I'll do is tell Charlotte's favourite joke - but you have to interact with me.

On arrival, William congratulated Freddie for his work and sending him a letter and told him: \"Well done you, I'm here now. Your letter worked. I'm sorry I couldn't come to you in October.\"\n\nAfter visiting the school, William then headed to Woodgate Valley Urban Farm in Birmingham, which supports children and young people facing mental health challenges.\n\nToday's engagements in the West Midlands mark the second public outings for William since wife Kate revealed her cancer diagnosis and treatment before Easter.

Thank you for all the kind wishes today.\"The image was followed by a camera emoji and attributed to the Princess of Wales.", "source": {"uri": "irishmirror.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jennifer_newton@irishmirror.ie", "name": "Jennifer Newton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Midlands_(county)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "West Midlands (county)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Midlands (county)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Mental_Health_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Mental Health Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_(archangel)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael (archangel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowley_Regis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rowley Regis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rowley Regis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Charlotte_of_Wales_(born_2015)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Princess Charlotte of Wales (born 2015)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunbury-on-Thames", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunbury-on-Thames"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sunbury-on-Thames"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Whitehall", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jack Whitehall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_broadcasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Radio broadcasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Louis_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prince Louis of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother's_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mother's Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emoji"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charitable organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Easter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chemotherapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensington", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kensington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kensington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surrey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Surrey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windsor,_Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Windsor, Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Windsor, Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://i2-prod.irishmirror.ie/incoming/article32668991.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_The-Prince-Of-Wales-Visits-The-West-Midlands.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9511957", "eventUri": "eng-9511957", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

She would have loved to.\"\n\nThe royal also commended Freddie for his impressive letter, saying: \"Lots of people write letters but Freddie's was a really well-written letter. I promised I would come.\"\n\nFreddie had reached out to William on Twitter during World Mental Health Day last October, detailing the mental health initiatives he and his peers were championing at their school.\n\nIn a delightful twist, the Prince of Wales responded to Freddie's efforts, stating: \"Good afternoon Freddie, I'm so sorry Catherine and I can't be with you and the rest of the students at St Michael's today\", reports the Express.\n\nHe continued to praise the school's commitment to mental health, urging them to \"Tackling mental health challenges and stigmas head-on is so important, please keep up this important work.\"\n\nPrince William then instructed his team to discreetly arrange a visit to the school during his next round of public engagements in the West Midlands.\n\nThe young pupil and his friends were stunned when the royal dad-of-three arrived at their school today, marking the beginning of his trio of engagements in the area.\n\nTo maintain the surprise, school officials told Freddie that he would be receiving a visit from the Lord Lieutenant of the West Midlands instead.\n\nIt wasn't until Freddie spotted William emerging from his motorcade as it neared the school that he realised the true identity of his visitor.\n\nUpon meeting, William greeted Freddie with: \"So this is the young lad who started it all off. Very nice to see you, thank you for your letter.\"\n\nFreddie warmly responded: \"You're very welcome.\"\n\nWilliam's update on wife Kate comes after she bravely revealed her cancer diagnosis in a video message to the nation on 22 March. In the video, Kate asked that time, space and privacy be given to her family as she revealed that she had begun chemotherapy.\n\nShe said: \"This of course came as a huge shock, and William and I have been doing everything we can to process and manage this privately for the sake of our young family.

I thought if I wrote the letter to him he might recognise us, which he did on Twitter.\"\n\n\"I completely thought it was the Lord Lieutenant who was coming today.

I'm just standing there and I see Prince William walking down the drive and I'm like, wow, all this work's finally paid off.\"\n\nThe school runs a number of wellbeing initiatives and William joined a group of pupils, including Freddie, who were from the all-male Matrix Project which runs the Am I Manly Enough? campaign, tackling the stigma around male mental health.\n\nThe group also takes part in a school show, broadcast on local radio, on the topic, and lightens the issue by having a segment on \"dad jokes\" and the prince was asked to contribute and told them a \"knock-knock\" joke.\n\nIn his pre-recorded piece William told the listeners: \"I've been asked to produce a dad joke so I'm trying to channel Jack Whitehall, because most of his jokes are pretty dad-like.\n\n\"I think what I'll do, is I'll say a joke which is Charlotte's favourite joke at the moment, she keeps telling me.\"\n\nWilliam said \"knock knock\" and when the pupils said \"who's there\" the royal replied \"Interrupting cow\" and as the group tried to say \"interrupting cow who?\" he made them laugh by saying \"Mooo\".\n\nThe schoolboys quizzed the prince, who was gifted a brink pink Am I Manly Enough? reusable cup, about his interest in the issue, and he told them he found mental health was the \"bigger piece\", when you put together the \"jigsaw\" of issues like homelessness and depression.\n\nAfter chatting to people in the sector he realised many people were \"terrified\" to talk about the issue: \"I was suddenly like 'this is unacceptable, we've got to be able to talk about this'.\n\n\"And what is quite interesting, when we first started talking about mental health not one celebrity wanted to join us and talk about it - not one.\"\n\nHe stressed the problem of mental health needed to be faced \"upstream\" rather than just focusing on a cure \"If you can tackle these things earlier, you get to them quicker\".\n\nWilliam later joined other pupils engaged in well-being activities like table discussions, and during his visit he found his support of Aston Villa football club, in an area close to local rivals Wolverhampton Wanderers and Birmingham City, raised a few eyebrows.\n\nAs he left the school he was given a rapturous send-off by dozens of children in an atrium area and outside he went on a walkabout shaking hands of pupils as he made his way to his car.", "source": {"uri": "edp24.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eastern Daily Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stigma", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social stigma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Michael's_Church_of_England_High_School,_Rowley_Regis", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St Michael's Church of England High School, Rowley Regis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandwell", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sandwell"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sandwell"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Midlands_(county)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Midlands (county)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Midlands (county)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Lieutenant_of_Ireland", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lord Lieutenant of Ireland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manly,_New_South_Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manly, New South Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manly, New South Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Whitehall", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jack Whitehall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Depression (mood)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Villa_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aston Villa F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://www.edp24.co.uk/resources/images/18011390/", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9511957", "eventUri": "eng-9511957", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

And his first stop of the day is St Michael's School in Rowley Regis, where he is learning about student-led initiatives that are available to pupils to support their mental health.\n\nBack in October to mark World Mental Health Day, pupil Freddie Hadley sent a personal letter to William inviting him to the school today after informing him about the Matrix Project. In the letter, Freddie explained that it saw a group of 11 to 14-year-old boys meet every week to develop ideas and projects to shine a spotlight on male mental health.\n\nWilliam meet pupil Freddie Hadley, who had previously sent him a letter\n\nHe then invited William to the school for the launch of a campaign, saying he would love for the prince to be there as a VIP. Unfortunately, William and wife Kate were unable to make it at the time due to a prior engagement, but today, William dropped by to see the pupils.\n\nThere he learned about all of the projects that the pupils had set up to support mental health and then joined in with a session of the Matrix Project. He also joined a wider well-being led project, where he learned how pupils had been designing their own calm kits.\n\nToday's engagements in the West Midlands mark the second public outings for William since wife Kate revealed her cancer diagnosis and treatment before Easter. Last week, he returned to duties and gave a helping hand loading food and cooking in the kitchen at food distribution charity Surplus to Supper, in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey.\n\nVolunteer Rachel Candappa, 71, handed two get well soon cards to the prince addressed to the King and Kate. William, who looked visibly moved, said: \"Thank you, you are very kind\". When Rachel told the heir to the throne to look after Kate he placed his left hand on her shoulder and promised \"I will\". Speaking afterwards Rachel, of Sunbury-on-Thames, said: \"I said take care of her and he said 'I will'.\n\nMeanwhile, earlier this week, William and Kate released a new photo of their youngest son Prince Louis to mark his sixth birthday. The unedited close-up image, showing Louis grinning at the camera as he lies barefoot on a blanket on the grass, was taken in the last few days at Windsor by Kate, who announced last month that she is undergoing chemotherapy after being diagnosed with cancer.\n\nIt was posted on Kensington Palace's social media accounts, some six weeks after the furore surrounding the Mother's Day portrait which the princess admitted editing. William and Kate thanked royal fans for the birthday messages they received for their youngest child. The post read: \"Happy 6th Birthday, Prince Louis! Thank you for all the kind wishes today.\"The image was followed by a camera emoji and attributed to the Princess of Wales.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jennifer_newton@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Jennifer Newton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_(archangel)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michael (archangel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Midlands_(county)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "West Midlands (county)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Midlands (county)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Mental_Health_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Mental Health Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_England", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Church of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowley_Regis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rowley Regis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rowley Regis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunbury-on-Thames", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunbury-on-Thames"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sunbury-on-Thames"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Easter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Louis_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prince Louis of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother's_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mother's Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charitable organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chemotherapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensington", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kensington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kensington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surrey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Surrey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windsor,_Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Windsor, Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Windsor, Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Grandparents", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Grandparents", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32668847.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_The-Prince-Of-Wales-Visits-The-West-Midlands.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9511957", "eventUri": "eng-9511957", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

In the letter, Freddie explained that a group of boys aged 11-14 meet every week to develop ideas and projects that put a spotlight on male mental health.\n\nHe invited the future king to the school for the launch of a campaign last October, but unfortunately, the royal was unable to make it due to a prior engagement.\n\nOn arrival today, William congratulated Freddie for his efforts and told him: \"Well done you, I'm here now. Your letter worked. I'm sorry I couldn't come to you in October.\"\n\nThe two then joined other children to record a segment for the school's radio station and the prince was asked to share a \"dad joke\". He proceeded to tell a knock knock joke, which he said was Princess Charlotte's favorite.\n\nToday's engagements mark the second public outing for William since wife Princess Kate Middleton revealed she was undergoing cancer treatment. Last week, he returned to royal duties by helping to load a food truck and cooking in the kitchen at food distribution charity Surplus.\n\nWilliam's break from duties coincided with an extended holiday from school for the couple's three children, Prince George, 10, Princess Charlotte, 8, and Prince Louis, 5. During his time off, William was spotted attending a soccer match with George on April 11.\n\nA Timeline of Kate Middleton's Cancer Battle: Surgery, Chemo and More\n\nA source exclusively told Us Weekly in March that William and Kate \"wanted to wait to tell the world the news until their children were off school for the Easter break so they could have time to process the news [about her healthy battle] before the whole world was talking about [it].\"\n\nThe couple has been keeping a low profile since Kate revealed her medical issues, although she and William took the time to thank well-wishers in March.\n\n\"The prince and princess are both enormously touched by the kind messages from people here in the U.K., across the Commonwealth and around the world in response to Her Royal Highness' message,\" Kensington Palace said in a statement at the time.\n\n\"They are extremely moved by the public's warmth and support and are grateful for the understanding of their request for

I'm forgetting about the fakakta school run though, of course. That's why he couldn't attend the Anzac service. In any case, William popped over to Birmingham today. He did a walkabout and said hello to students and then he met with kids at St. Michael's Church of England High School in Sandwell.\n\nThe photos from this event are fascinating, because out of context, it's just an egg-looking prince sitting in front of signs asking \"Am I Manly Enough?\" That is the point of it, in context. William was visiting a student-led campaign focused on defanging toxic masculinity in teenage boys. From People:\n\nThe school came on the royal's radar after 12-year-old Freddie Hadley wrote a letter to Prince William and Princess Kate, 42, that was shared on social media for World Mental Health Day in Oct. 2023. Freddie invited the couple to their school group's #AmIManlyEnough campaign launch, writing, \"Through our work, we discovered that suicide is the biggest killer in young males, and this won't change until people start the conversation.\"\n\nPrince William got to see firsthand the work of the Matrix Project, which Freddie highlighted in his letter for bringing boys aged 11 to 14 together for weekly meetings that develop ideas and projects to tackle mental health challenges. The royal joined a session with some of the boys and was told how the group launched the #AmIManlyEnough campaign last year to encourage males to communicate more about their feelings and tackle the stigma of mental health.\n\nWilliam also met representatives of Student Voice to hear about their projects set up at the school to promote positive mental health and joined a workshop with students discussing issues related to well-being, including designing their own calm kits and their dream well-being hub.\n\n\"What a beautiful opportunity for our youngsters to shine a spotlight on everything we do in school,\" headteacher Christina Handy-Rivett tells PEOPLE. \"And to have His Royal Highness, who pioneers and supports mental health, it was such a special moment.\"\n\n[From People]\n\nThe campaign itself is wonderful and it's amazing that these kids are leading it. I'm sure they loved the fact that William highlighted the campaign and that he traveled to their school and heard about their work. Now, the bad stuff: William is actually a terrible representative for advocacy work around destigmatizing men's mental health and decentralizing toxic masculinity. William and his allies have spent years raging about Prince Harry having too much therapy. William leads with rage, with violence, with anger and toxicity.

In the letter, Freddie explained that a group of boys aged 11-14 meet every week to develop ideas and projects that put a spotlight on male mental health.\n\nHe invited the future king to the school for the launch of a campaign last October, but unfortunately, the royal was unable to make it due to a prior engagement.\n\nOn arrival today, William congratulated Freddie for his efforts and told him: \"Well done you, I'm here now. Your letter worked. I'm sorry I couldn't come to you in October.\"\n\nThe two then joined other children to record a segment for the school's radio station and the prince was asked to share a \"dad jokes\". He proceeded to tell knock knock jokes, which he said were Princess Charlotte's favorite.\n\nToday's engagements mark the second public outing for William since wife Princess Kate Middleton revealed she was undergoing cancer treatment. Last week, he returned to royal duties by helping to load a food truck and cooking in the kitchen at food distribution charity Surplus.\n\nWilliam's break from duties coincided with an extended holiday from school for the couple's three children, Prince George, 10, Princess Charlotte, 8, and Prince Louis, 5. During his time off, William was spotted attending a soccer match with George on April 11.\n\nA source exclusively told Us Weekly in March that William and Kate \"wanted to wait to tell the world the news until their children were off school for the Easter break so they could have time to process the news [about her healthy battle] before the whole world was talking about [it].\"\n\nThe couple has been keeping a low profile since Kate revealed her medical issues, although she and William took the time to thank well-wishers in March.\n\n\"The prince and princess are both enormously touched by the kind messages from people here in the U.K., across the Commonwealth and around the world in response to Her Royal Highness' message,\" Kensington Palace said in a statement at the time.\n\n\"They are extremely moved by the public's warmth and support and are grateful for the understanding of their request for privacy at this time.\"", "source": {"uri": "usmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Us Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dom_hines@usmagazine.com", "name": "Dom Hines", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Mental_Health_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Mental Health Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Midlands_(county)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Midlands (county)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Midlands (county)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Charlotte_of_Wales_(1796\u20131817)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Princess Charlotte of Wales (1796\u20131817)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catherine, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_George,_Duke_of_Kent", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prince George, Duke of Kent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Louis_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prince Louis of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensington_Palace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kensington Palace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charitable organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Highness", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Royal Highness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Easter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commonwealth of Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Us_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Us Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Grandparents", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Grandparents", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Prince-William.jpg?crop=0px%2C82px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9511957", "eventUri": "eng-9511957", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 320, "textEnd": 328}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-11", "textStart": 1977, "textEnd": 1985}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

As a father of three himself, he presumably gets ample opportunity to shell them out with George, Charlotte, and Louis. But why limit all that corny humor to the walls of his castle? Recently, the future King of England stopped by a school for a surprise visit after he was invited by one of the students on Thursday, where he hung out and told knock knock jokes.\n\nPrince William spent time at St. Michael's Church of England High School in Birmingham on Thursday after he was invited by a 12-year-old student named Freddie last October. Freddie wanted Prince William to come see the school's Matrix Project, which focused on de-stigmatizing male mental health support, an issue the Prince of Wales has long championed himself. While Prince William and Kate Middleton were unable to visit in October, Prince William visited on his own on Thursday to meet Freddie and other students. \"Well done you, I'm here now. Your letter worked. I'm sorry I couldn't come to you in October,\" Prince William said upon meeting Freddie.\n\nHe even joined the young student on his podcast where he was able to tell a classic dad joke, which he explained was a particular favorite of his 8-year-old daughter Princess Charlotte. \"It's one she keeps telling me,\" he explained in a video of his podcast interview. It was a knock knock joke about the interrupting cow. And everyone loved it.\n\nPrince William, who is also dad to 10-year-old Prince George and 6-year-old Prince Louis, has long been a fan of the dad joke. Just ask him what his favorite emoji is and he'll tell you it's an \"aubergine,\" also known as the eggplant emoji. He's been known to really ham it up during his royal visits, like when he was at a restaurant and jumped on the phone to start taking lunch reservations, or when he played along when a little kid asked him where Prince William was and pretended to be someone else.\n\nHis sense of humor will come in handy at home these days, with both his father, King Charles III and Kate Middleton undergoing cancer treatment, both he and his young are children probably feeling the weight of this in their home. A good knock knock joke would not go amiss every now and then.", "source": {"uri": "romper.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Romper"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dad_joke", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dad joke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_V", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_England", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Church of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monarchy of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_(archangel)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael (archangel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Castle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catherine, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_VII", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edward VII"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Charlotte_of_Wales_(1796\u20131817)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Princess Charlotte of Wales (1796\u20131817)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Louis_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prince Louis of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_III_of_Spain", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charles III of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eggplant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eggplant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emoji"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2024/4/25/649594c7-d968-40ea-83ef-2c3f77bda193-getty-2149542329.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9511957", "eventUri": "eng-9511957", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Last year, 12-year-old Freddie Hadley invited William to St Michael's Church of England High School to learn more about the Matrix Project, a group they founded to spotlight boys' mental health, for World Mental Health Day. William thanked Hadley at the time, but this week, he traveled to the school to meet the student and spend some time learning about the campus initiative to support mental health.\n\n\"I'm just standing there and see Prince William walking down... and I'm like, 'Woah,'\" Hadley told Sky News afterward. \"I couldn't get my head around it... I'm meeting Prince William, the future king, it's insane.\" Hadley added that he and the prince discussed mental health but they also talked about their shared favorite soccer team, Aston Villa.\n\nHe talked with a range of students about the wellbeing programs at the school, before joining the boys of the Matrix Project to do a special appearance on their podcast. Before diving into conversation, the prince warmed up by sharing a few \"dad jokes,\" including one he said he learned from his daughter, Princess Charlotte. \"Knock, knock,\" he said, and the students responded, \"Who's there?\"\n\n\"Interrupting cow,\" said the prince, adding \"Moo!\" as the students tried to repeat it back.\n\nHe added that some of the humor at his house might not be appropriate to air. \"That is what I hear a lot at home at the moment. That's the greatest one I can think of that is clean and broadcastable.\"\n\nThe trip to Rowley Regis marked William's second day back to public engagements after an extended break after his wife, Kate Middleton, announced a recent cancer diagnosis on March 22. In a video shared with news organizations, the princess said the cancer was discovered after a January abdominal surgery and as a result, she was undergoing a round of chemotherapy.\n\nKerry Whitehouse, St Michael's mental health specialist, told People that students gave the prince gifts for his wife during the Thursday visit, including sunflowers made of Legos \"building things is therapeutic and sunflowers represent happiness, positivity, and strength\" and sunflower seeds in order \"to sow seeds of positivity.\" Whitehouse said, \"He thanked us and said the Lego would go down well in the house.\"", "source": {"uri": "vanityfair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vanity Fair"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conde_nast@vanityfair.com", "name": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "type": "author",

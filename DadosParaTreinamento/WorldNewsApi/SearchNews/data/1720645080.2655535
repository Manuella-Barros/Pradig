The Bridgerton star, 29, went topless as she soaked up the Mediterranean sunshine during the couple's holiday. Phoebe, who played Daphne Bridgerton on the Netflix series, wore a pair of blue denim shorts and a patterned bikini top. Cameron, 28, who is the son of Hollywood producer Brad Fuller, was also dressed casually in a white polo shirt and red pattnered shorts. The pair looked on cloud nine as they snuggled while relaxing on deck, with Phoebe planting a kiss on Cameron's cheek. The couple, who got engaged in May, looked in good spirits as they wrapped their arms around each other. Phoebe let her brunette locks fall loose down her shoulders and was also seen sporting a tan beach hat and a pair of sunglasses. Before their boat trip, Phoebe wore a white top and carried a matching tote bag as she went for a stroll with Cameron. The actress stood on her tip toes to give him a kiss while he was also seen taking a picture of her as they enjoyed their holiday. The outing comes after Phoebe's mother, Coronation Street actress Sally Dynevor, confirmed her daughter had recently got engaged. The couple appeared to announce their engagement in May this year, and Sally, 60, has given the American actor-and-producer her seal of approval. The Coronation Street star was overjoyed when Phoebe, 29, shared her happy news and she can't wait for the wedding. Appearing on Loose Women, she said: 'My daughter has just got engaged ... He's gorgeous, he's such a lovely man. I'm so, so happy. I'm thrilled, it's actually made my year.' Sally insisted she won't be getting involved in the couple's wedding plans and will let them decide what they want for their big day. Discussing the ceremony, she said: 'To be honest, I'll be keeping well out of it.' Sally's attention has turned to what comes after the nuptials, and she is hoping that grandchildren come along sooner rather than later. The soap actress - who is married to scriptwriter Tim Dynevor, with whom she has two other children - said: 'I can't wait for my grandchildren, [although] let's not jump ahead!' Phoebe and Cameron shared the news of their engagement via Instagram on May 13, uploading a photo of Cameron embracing his shocked fianc\u00e9e from behind on a stone balcony. Phoebe had her hands clasped to her face in shock with her engagement ring on display. Phoebe first sparked engagement rumours when she attended the star-studded Met Gala with a huge diamond ring on her left hand. Phoebe has been dating the son of Hollywood producer Brad Fuller for a year after first being spotted together leaving a hotel in March 2023. Phoebe and Cameron made their first public appearance as couple at Wimbledon in July last year. The pair then made another rare appearance together in February this year at the 2024 Baftas, where Phoebe was nominated for the EE Rising Star Award. Cameron previously dated fellow internet personality Lauren Elizabeth for nearly three years.", "summary": "The Bridgerton star, 29, went topless as she soaked up the Mediterranean sunshine during the couple's holiday.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-13508579/Topless-Phoebe-Dynevor-puts-loved-display-fianc-Cameron-Fuller-couple-enjoy-romantic-yacht-trip-St-Tropez.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/08/11/85871249-0-image-m-62_1717843541745.jpg", "video": "https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2023/12/04/926003437209629330/1024x576_MP4_926003437209629330.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-08 16:23:47", "author": "Editor,Melody Fletcher", "authors": ["Editor", "Melody Fletcher"], "language": "en", "catgory": "entertainment", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": 0.191}

{"id": 243265434, "title": "Simone Biles Leads All-Around Competition, Thrills Fans in Day 1 of US Olympic Trials", "text": "Simone Biles continued her comeback tour on Friday during the first day of women's competition at the 2024 U.S. Olympic trials in Minnesota. Coming off her ninth all-around U.S. Championships title, Biles showed why she has a very strong chance to make her third Olympic team. She started off on the uneven bars, posting a commendable score of 14.425 to put her at No. 2 in the standings behind Leanne Wong through one rotation. Biles didn't look as strong on the balance beam, as she nearly fell on her mount. However, she was able to stay on and record a 13.650 score. It still represented a step down from her performance at the U.S. Championships, as she recorded identical 14.800 scores during both of her attempts. While the four-time Olympic gold medalist wasn't able to meet her usual high standards on the balance beam, that wasn't the case during her floor exercise. Biles was terrific once again, putting together the highest-scoring routine of the night with a score of 14.850. After her exceptional performance, she moved into first place through three rotations. Her momentum continued during the vault, as she nailed her famous Yurchenko double pike and secured a score of 15.975. With her strong end to the night, she ended the day at the top of the leaderboard in the all-around competition at 58.900. Jordan Chiles sat at No. 2 with a score of 56.400, while former Olympic all-around champion Sunisa Lee's 56.025 was good enough for No. 3. Fans were amazed by her dominant performance. Biles will now attempt to become the first U.S. gymnast since Dominique Dawes to make three Olympic teams. She'll be back in action during Day 2 of the women's competition on Sunday.", "summary": "Simone Biles continued her comeback tour on Friday during the first day of women's competition at the 2024 U.S. Olympic trials in Minnesota.

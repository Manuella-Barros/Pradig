With rainfall being a consistent feature of this contest, points were hard to come by in this opening group stage matchup. Caoimhe Keon got the scoring underway for Donegal with a great strike that found the Kerry net just 3 minutes into the contest. Both sides would enter half-time level, as the rain continued to fall \u2013 1-03 to 0-06. Things would continue to be tricky for both teams in the second half, but Kerry would build a two point advantage early on and leave Donegal with a task to battle back. That two point advantage would last for Kerry until when with minutes to spare, Donegal found a crucial spark when Katie Dowds scored her team\u2019s first point in almost 15 minutes of play. Then Donegal were given a golden opportunity as time ticked down, as Suzanne White expertly dispatched a free to grab a crucial draw for her side in the All Ireland series. Next up for the Donegal Ladies is a game against Waterford on the 23rd of June, the final game of Group 2.", "summary": "<p>Donegal 1-6 v 0-9 Kerry Donegal&#8217;s senior ladies battled to a draw against Kerry this afternoon in Ballybofey.

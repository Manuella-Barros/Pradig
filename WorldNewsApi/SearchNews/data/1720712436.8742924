The band, who have released four studio albums since 2016, will perform at Wythenshawe Park as part of the biggest headline show of their career during the August Bank Holiday weekend. The show, on Sunday, August 25, will also feature performances from Inhaler, Shed Seven, Seb Lowe, TTRRUUCES, and recent Northern Music Awards winners The K's.

The buses will run from Stockport Interchange between 4pm and 8pm, and return fans back there from Wythenshawe Park from 10pm to 1am. The service will see buses run every six minutes, meaning it will be a flexible option for fans looking to get to the festival site with ease - and will take just 20 minutes. The service will operate on a pay when you board basis, meaning fans can just turn up and pay the fare on the day (\u00a33 each way). Announcing the partnership today, the band created an amusing video explaining how fans can get to their gig \u2018in style'. Percussionist Josh Dewhurst explained of the buses: \"It's not just a ride, it's an experience.\u201d With the band making cameos throughout, including pianist Myles Kellock taking on the role of a bus driver, the video also featured them talking to people in Stockport, with differing views ranging from \u2018absolutely fantastic\u2019 to \u2018absolutely fantastic\u2019. In September, Blossoms will release their fifth album Gary - which is, naturally, named after a 8-foot fibreglass gorilla that was stolen from Reynard Garden in Carluke, Scotland last year. The album, co-produced by regular collaborator James Skelly of The Coral alongside Jungle\u2019s Josh-Lloyd Watson, also features two tracks co-written with rising country singer CMAT. \u201cWe hired an AirBnB on the seafront in Anglesey and locked ourselves away for the writing session with Ciara (CMAT) and it was one of the most inspiring few days we\u2019ve had as a band,\u201d band member Tom Ogden said. \u201cDuring the writing process, we were listening to a lot of Bowie, Blondie, and Hall & Oates.\u201d Blossoms will play Wythenshawe Park on August 25.

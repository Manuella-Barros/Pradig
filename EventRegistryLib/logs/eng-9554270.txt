(AP) -- A state commission that investigates ethical violations in New York was created unconstitutionally, an appeals court said Thursday in a ruling that could strip the watchdog agency of its enforcement powers.\n\nThe ruling stems from a lawsuit filed by former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who is fighting an attempt by the state Commission on Ethics and Lobbying in Government to force him to forfeit $5 million he got for writing a book about his administration's efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nCuomo argues the commission lacks authority under the state constitution to prosecute him.\n\nThe Appellate Division of state Supreme Court unanimously upheld a lower court in ruling in favor of Cuomo, with judges writing that the creation of the panel \"though well intentioned in its actions, violated the bedrock principles of separation of powers.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

Kathy Hochul in 2022 to investigate possible ethics and lobbying violations by state officials, employees, lobbyists and their clients.\n\nIt replaced a previous ethics commission widely criticized for not being independent enough. Lawmakers said they wanted to restore public trust in government after Cuomo's 2021 resignation in a sexual harassment scandal.\n\nA lower court judge said in September that the law creating the commission made it too independent from the governor under terms of the state constitution. The judge said the enforcement of ethics laws is a power that belongs to the executive branch, yet the governor cannot control commission members, force them to explain their actions or remove them for neglecting their duties.\n\n\"This has been a three-year exercise to bend the law to fit the political will of those in charge and hopefully after this second -- and unanimous -- court decision, this partisan and baseless prosecution will finally end,\" Cuomo spokesman Rich Azzopardi said in a statement after the Thursday ruling.\n\nCuomo has battled both this commission and its predecessor, the Joint Commission on Public Ethics, over his book earnings. State officials have claimed Cuomo hadn't kept a promise not to use any state resources on the book. Cuomo has denied those allegations.\n\nCuomo resigned in August 2021 after the attorney general released the results of an investigation that concluded the then-governor had sexually harassed at least 11 women. Cuomo has denied the allegations.\n\nAP writer Anthony Izaguirre contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Andrew Cuomo gets one step closer to blowing up NY's ethics agency", "body": "Make your contribution now and help Gothamist thrive in 2024. Donate today\n\nFormer Gov. Andrew Cuomo picked up a big win in his quest to keep the proceeds from his $5.1 million COVID-era book deal, dealing a major blow to New York's new ethics board in the process.\n\nThe state Appellate Division in Albany unanimously decided in Cuomo's favor Thursday, upholding a lower court's ruling that effectively strips the newly formed Commission on Ethics and Lobbying in Government (COELIG) of its enforcement powers.\n\nThe decision marks a major victory for Cuomo, who has spent the last three years fighting off attempts by state ethics regulators to claw back the money he received for writing a book on the early days of the COVID pandemic, before his abrupt fall from grace over sexual misconduct allegations.\n\nBut the implications could be far broader: The court's decision could leave Albany without any entity to enforce the state's ethics laws, which are meant to ensure public officials are actually acting in the public's interest.\n\nThe mid-level appeals court upheld Supreme Court Justice Thomas Marcelle's September decision.\n\n\"The Legislature, though well intentioned in its actions, violated the bedrock principles of separation of powers,\" Associate Justice Mark Powers wrote in the 5-0 decision.\n\nState Attorney General Letitia James' office could still choose to appeal to the state's top court, the Court of Appeals. But because the Appellate Division's ruling was unanimous, the appeal likely isn't automatic -- the Court of Appeals will have to agree to hear the case.\n\nIn a joint statement, COELIG chair Frederick Davie and executive director Sanford Berland said they'll work with James' office to seek an appeal. They also said they hope to receive a stay that would preserve their enforcement powers while the case is argued.\n\n\"We respectfully disagree with the result reached by the court and are reviewing all options, including, if appropriate, recommending interim legislation,\" they said in the statement.\n\nIn their ruling Thursday, the judges found the 2022 law creating the ethics panel violates the state constitution in two key ways.\n\nThe first was by taking enforcement powers away from the executive branch and giving it to the board, a majority of whose members are appointed by the legislative branch. As structured in the law, COELIG has broad power to investigate and enforce ethics law violations by executive branch employees, including by imposing fines.\n\nThe court ruled that structure violates the constitutional separation of powers.\n\nThe second constitutional violation has to do with an entity known as the Independent Review Committee, a panel of law school deans tasked with approving or denying nominees to the ethics board depending on their credentials.\n\nThe court found that the committee amounts to a new state agency with executive power, also in violation of separation of powers.\n\n\"It usurps the Governor's power to ensure the faithful execution of the applicable ethics laws,\" the court ruled.\n\nThe battle over Cuomo's book, \"American Crisis: Leadership Lessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic,\" dates back to before he resigned from office in 2021 under the weight of various scandals.\n\nThen a rising national star thanks to his daily televised COVID briefings, Cuomo inked a multi-million-dollar deal to write the book in 2020. The leadership of the ethics commission at the time, known as the Joint Commission on Public Ethics (JCOPE) -- which he created during his tenure -- gave him permission to write the book, so long as he followed rules that included not using state resources to complete the project.\n\nJCOPE ordered Cuomo to turn over his book proceeds after a steady stream of news stories detailed that many of Cuomo's top government aides worked on the project alongside the then-governor, though the governor's office said they willingly volunteered their time. Cuomo successfully sued to overturn the fine, though the ruling allowed for a new investigation to proceed.\n\nAfter current Gov. Kathy Hochul and state lawmakers approved a law creating a new state ethics board in 2022, COELIG launched a new investigation -- prompting Cuomo to sue, which led to Thursday's decision.\n\nIn a statement, Cuomo spokesperson Rich Azzopardi said \"no one is above the law nor the constitution, including the Legislature and the Executive Chamber.\"\n\n\"This has been a three-year exercise to bend the law to fit the political will of those in charge and hopefully after this second -- and unanimous -- court decision, this partisan and baseless prosecution will finally end,\" Azzopardi said.", "source": {"uri": "gothamist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gothamist"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Cuomo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Cuomo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Supreme_Court,_Appellate_Division", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Separation of powers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albany,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Albany, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Albany, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letitia_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Letitia James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothamist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gothamist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lobbying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Executive (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucien_Berland", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lucien Berland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associate_Justice_of_the_Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_constitution_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State constitution (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_attorney_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State attorney general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Legislature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathy_Hochul", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kathy Hochul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_(education)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dean (education)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://cms.prod.nypr.digital/images/344911/fill-1200x650|format-webp|webpquality-85/", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554270", "eventUri": "eng-9554270", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

One of its first orders of business--investigate Cuomo's pandemic memoir.\n\nCuomo secured a $5.1 million deal for the book. The ethics panel was tasked at investigating claims the former governor used state resources, including employees working on the clock, to complete the book. Cuomo has denied those claims. But COELIG concluded he did in fact use state resources, and the panel wanted him to forfeit those earnings.\n\nIn the latest ruling, the judge agrees with a lower court that COELIG was created with well intentions but \"violated the bedrock principles of separation of powers.\"\n\nThis ruling could strip the agency of its enforcement powers.\n\nCuomo's lawsuit called those powers unconstitutional.\n\nIn a statement to CBS 6, Cuomo spokesman Rich Azzopardi doubled down on that stance.\n\n\"As we've said from the very beginning, no one is above the law nor the constitution -- including the legislature and the executive chamber. The attorney general also never should have defended such a flagrantly unconstitutional law, but since it tracks with her personal politics it's no surprise.

It defies common sense for the Third Department Appellate Court to throw up its hands and say the Governor has to be able to fire the same ethics officials whose job is to make sure the Governor follows the laws. The terrible logic of this decision is to create an imperial Governor who can ignore ethics laws and can only be removed through impeachment or the ballot box. Lastly, we find it feckless that the Appellate Court did not respond to the well-supported arguments supporting the law's constitutionality that we and our colleagues made in a lengthy amicus brief,\" writes Reinvent Albany.\n\nYou can read an amicus brief from Reinvent Albany here.

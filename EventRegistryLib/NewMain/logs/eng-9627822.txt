Houthis Struck Aircraft Carrier in Red Sea", "body": "U.S. defense officials have rejected claims that Yemen's Ansar Allah group, also known as the Houthis, succeeded in striking -- and damaging -- an American aircraft carrier in the Red Sea last week.\n\n\"There is no truth to the Houthi claim of striking the USS Eisenhower or any U.S. Navy vessel,\" U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) said in a statement carried by media outlets on June 5.\n\nLast week, Houthi spokesman Yahya Saree claimed the group had fired missiles and drones at the aircraft carrier, which has been deployed in the Red Sea since late last year.\n\nAt the time, a U.S. defense official told Reuters that he was unaware of any attack on the USS Eisenhower.\n\nNevertheless, on May 31, CENTCOM reported that the Yemen-based group had fired two anti-ship ballistic missiles (ASBMs) over the Gulf of Aden and four drones over the Red Sea.\n\nCENTCOM said the missiles failed to cause damage or casualties, adding that U.S. forces downed three drones while a fourth crashed into the sea.\n\nBut a day later, Mr. Saree repeated the claim, saying the group had successfully targeted the Eisenhower with \"missiles and drones.\"\n\nCENTCOM, in its June 5 statement, said the claims were part of an \"ongoing disinformation campaign that the Houthis have been conducting for months.\"\n\nThe Epoch Times' request for comment on the issue drew a terse reply from a U.S. Defense Department spokesperson whose emailed response said \"100 percent false.\"\n\nIn a statement issued soon afterward, CENTCOM said that the operations had hit 13 targets in Houthi-controlled parts of the country along the Red Sea coast.\n\nAccording to the UK defense ministry, the allies targeted three sites in the port of Hodeidah, where it said Houthis had kept drones and surface-to-air missiles.\n\n\"Utmost care was taken in planning the strikes to minimize any risk to civilians or non-military infrastructure,\" the ministry said in a statement.\n\nHouthis later claimed that the strikes had killed 16 people -- including civilians -- and injured dozens more.\n\nIran, which is closely aligned with the Houthis, condemned the strikes as a \"violation of international law and Yemen's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\"\n\nSince January, U.S. and British naval forces have carried out sporadic strikes on Houthi targets in response to the group's repeated attacks on Red Sea shipping.\n\nAccording to the Houthis, the attacks -- which began last November -- are a legitimate response to the Israeli military offensive in the Gaza Strip.\n\nRepeated Houthi attacks in and around the Red Sea have severely disrupted regional maritime traffic and taken a toll on international commerce.\n\nIn January, the Pentagon announced the launch of \"Operation Prosperity Guardian,\" a multi-nation coalition tasked with protecting Red Sea shipping.\n\nBacked by Iran, the Houthis overran much of Yemen -- including the capital, Sanaa -- in 2014.\n\nEarlier this year, the U.S. State Department labeled the Houthis a \"specially designated global terrorist group.\"\n\n\"During the past week, we have seen a notable reduction in the number and intensity of attacks,\" he told Reuters.\n\n\"This is more proof that the international community can, with decisiveness, stop this,\" the Greek official added.\n\nA longstanding NATO member, Greece currently hosts the headquarters of the European Union's naval operations in the Red Sea.\n\nBut on the same day that Mr. Stylianides made the remarks, CENTCOM reported that the Houthis had fired two ASBMs into the Red Sea \"in the past 24 hours.\"\n\n\"There were no injuries or damage reported by U.S., coalition, or commercial ships,\" CENTCOM said in a June 4 statement.\n\nIt added: \"Continued malign and reckless behavior by the Iranian-backed Houthis threatens regional stability and endangers the lives of mariners across the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.\"\n\nBased at Florida's MacDill Airforce Base, CENTCOM's area of responsibility includes the Middle East, Central Asia, and parts of South Asia.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Prior to this, the Houthis had not managed to reach as far as the Mediterranean, which is a rather troubling development for the West.\n\nThe attacks came only days after a Houthi spokesman warned of a new campaign targeting vessels heading to Israel from the Mediterranean.\n\nThe Houthis have also threatened to broaden attacks further in the Indian Ocean.

Eisenhower with unmanned aerial vehicles on Saturday in retaliation for Israel's ongoing military operation against Hamas in Gaza.\n\nChinese and Iranian state-run media outlets circulated the rumor, publishing a clearly doctored photograph of the American ship on social media (we have compiled several example photos in this article). However, U.S. Central Command denies the claim. According to Voice of America, a CENTCOM official asserted that, \"There is no truth to the Houthi claim of striking the USS Eisenhower or any U.S. Navy vessel,\" adding that \"This is an ongoing disinformation campaign that the Houthis have been conducting for months.\"\n\nOver the last few months, the U.S. and the United Kingdom have been carrying out frequent barrages against Houthi assets in the Middle East in an effort to further degrade the group's capabilities.\n\nThe Iran-backed militants continue to cause headaches in the Gulf of Oman and Red Sea, attacking international shipping routes frequently. Since the October 7 Hamas massacre in Israel, the Houthis have partnered with regional affiliates to strike vessels they claim are linked to the Jewish state and the West. From October to March alone, the Houthis carried out at least 60 attacks in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.\n\nIn a direct response to these unwarranted barrages, UK and U.S. forces target Houthi assets and weapons depots in Yemen. The Houthis have embroiled Yemen in civil war since 2014 after they seized control of the country's northern Sana'a province and forced out the government. The conflict evolved into a larger and quite lethal war.\n\nJust as the Islamic Republic supports Gaza-based Hamas terrorists via weapons transfers, funding, training and propaganda, so it also backs the Houthis in Yemen. Tehran is proficient in exploiting regional instability to exert control. As detailed by War on the Rocks, \"They assemble these parts into working weapons with technical assistance from Hezbollah and Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps advisers. This approach has allowed the Houthis to now field short and long-range drones and an increasingly diversified fleet of missiles capable of striking deep inside Saudi Arabia.\"\n\nThe Houthis' increased barrages targeting ships in the Gulf of Oman are a dangerous escalation, according to U.S. officials. Approximately one-fifth of the world's crude oil traded by sea passes through the Strait of Hormuz. The Iran-backed group knows it can interrupt the flow of the global economy using lethal UAVs, missiles, rockets and other projectiles. The rebels may claim to only target ships linked to Israel, but the Pentagon has refuted this claim and provided evidence indicating the group also targets multinational ships. As explained by a Department of Defense spokesperson, \"The Houthis continue to endanger commercial shipping that goes through that region, continue to put at risk U.S. forces, other countries' forces in the region who want to see commerce continue to flow in a very crucial area in the Middle East.\"\n\nAlthough Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree claims that the Eisenhower was damaged in recent barrages, this narrative is clearly pure fiction. However, the militant group is well supplied with UAVs thanks to Iran, and eliminating the Houthis' weapons depots should remain a top priority for U.S. and Israeli forces alike.\n\nMaya Carlin, National Security Writer with The National Interest, is an analyst with the Center for Security Policy and a former Anna Sobol Levy Fellow at IDC Herzliya in Israel.

though the Israeli military denied the claim.\n\nHouthi military spokesman Yahya Sarea said in a statement aired by Houthi-run al-Masirah TV that \"the precise operations\" were carried out with drones in retaliation for the \"massacres committed by the Israeli enemy in the (Palestinian) area of Rafah\" in Gaza.\n\nMeanwhile, Israeli military sources told Xinhua that they were \"unfamiliar with such an incident.\" Witnesses from companies operating in Haifa said that the port was operating normally.\n\nSarea claimed that one operation targeted two ships carrying military equipment, and another targeted a ship that \"violated the Houthi's entry ban on the port of Haifa in occupied Palestine (Israel).\"\n\nThe Israeli enemy should expect more operations, said the spokesman.\n\nThe Houthi rebel group, which controls several cities in northern Yemen, including the capital Sanaa, began last November to launch anti-ship ballistic missiles and drones targeting what they said were Israeli-linked ships transiting the Red Sea, to show solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn response, the U.S.-British naval coalition stationed in the waters has since January conducted air raids and missile strikes against Houthi targets to deter the group, but it only led to an expansion of Houthi attacks to include U.S. and British commercial vessels and naval ships.

While making unsubstantiated claims that they had launched missiles and drones they did not claim any hits and none of the claims matched reports from the maritime security forces.\n\nTwo Greek bulkers both traveling north in the Red Sea were reportedly targeted. Spokesperson Yahya Saree said it was related to \"companies violating the decision to ban entry to the ports,\" of Israel. One ship he cited was the Roza (93,386 dwt), a Liberian-registered bulker built in 2010. Her last AIS signal shows the ship bound for the Suez Canal. The other ship was the Vantage Dream (29,084 dwt) also registered in Liberia. She is traveling from India and also showing that she is approaching the Suez Canal.\n\nThe third claim cited the Maersk Line Ltd. vessel Maersk Seletar (108,299 dwt). She operates under the U.S. flag and is transporting materials for the U.S. military showing a destination of Oman. She made the circuit around Africa with the Houthis saying she was targeted while transiting the Arabian Sea.\n\nThe only report of a specific incident was days old and came from the UK Maritime Trade Organizations. They reported today that a master \"reported a significant explosion a short distance from the port side of the vessel.\" On inspection, the master said no damage was found.\n\nAnalysts are noting that the report cites a position further to the north in the Red Sea which seems to align with the Houthis claims of an increased range. The report lists the position of the vessel as 50 nautical miles southwest of Al Shuqaiq, Saudi Arabia.\n\nThese claims appeared as Greece's Minister of Maritime Affairs Christos Stylianides asserted to a reporter from Reuters that the EU Operation Aspides is seeing a decline in the attacks by the Houthi. He said they had seen \"a notable reduction in the number and intensity of attacks,\" over the past week citing the joint efforts between the forces patrolling in the region.\n\nAfter the Houthi reported targeting the aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, the U.S. and UK forces staged new strikes. They said storage locations, command and control, and launch sites were all damaged.\n\nU.S. Central Command however continues to report frequent downing of missiles and drones coming from the Houthi.

Security Council's ISIL/Al Qaeda/Taliban Sanctions Monitoring Team.\n\nAri Heistein is a non-resident fellow at the Counter Extremism Project who has published reports on the Houthis' procurement and financing structures, their misuse of telecommunications technology, their targeting of religious minorities, and the group's oppression of women and journalists.\n\nWhen referring to themselves, members of the Iran-backed \"axis of resistance\" tend to attribute their movements and actions to nature. For years, Hamas has described murder sprees and rocket attacks as the natural response to their circumstances. Similarly, Yemen's Houthis and their allies have described their own organization as \"organic\" and their malign activities as \"a legitimate and natural response.\" This rhetoric aims to send a message to Western audiences: \"if you saw things from our perspective then you would be on our side.\"\n\nBut such claims are most obviously contradicted by the intensive and nefarious efforts of these organizations to indoctrinate the populations under their control. If the Houthis were a \"natural response\" to their surroundings, would they need to rule their own information environment with an iron fist, brainwash children in schools and summer programs, and then blackmail families to send their kids to the front lines? Presumably this would be entirely unnecessary if all or most of their fellow Yemenis felt a natural sense of agreement with them. Here we already identify a problem with some Western commentary on the Houthis, which conflates the group with Yemen itself. But there are millions of Yemenis still living under the auspices of the internationally-recognized legitimate Government of Yemen. When the Houthis act, it is not Yemen acting; it is an illegal militia that happens to control part of Yemen.\n\nLess than a year after they took Sanaa in 2014, the Houthis seized control of the telecommunications infrastructure and media outlets to promote their own radical vision for Yemen while suppressing competing ideologies. According to Citizen Lab, they used surveillance and censorship tools taken from the previous regime to dramatically intensify the monitoring and regulation of Yemenis' online activity - controlling both what citizens could say and what information they could access. But the Houthis do not limit their activities to IT infrastructure: having coopted or silenced every journalist in the territory they rule, they have now moved on to ensuring that even social media influencers are not able to expose the injustices and hardships of living under the Houthi regime. Their aim is to dominate the information space in Yemen in order to ensure the general public's loyalty despite the misrule of the Houthi family and their cronies.\n\nWhile seeking information dominance in Yemen more generally, it is clear that the group places a particular focus on efforts to radicalize Yemen's youngest. It is undoubtedly one of the most disturbing elements of the Yemeni civil war -- a conflict filled with more than its fair share of tragedy and brutality -- to see how some in the next generation of Yemenis have already sworn away their lives to a regime that places no value on human life, let alone childhood. One study noted of the Houthis' revamped educational system that \"To normalize weapons and violence, textbooks used pictures of weapons, deceased children, bloodshed, and militarizing narratives in a repetitive manner across all 1-9 grades.\"\n\nIn addition to updating the school curricula in order to push Houthi rhetoric during the academic year, the Houthis have also pushed military-style summer programs for children, referred to as \"Summer Centers.\" This is where children, hundreds of thousands of whom are below the age of 14, are exposed to Houthi doctrine and engaged in live fire training exercises. Recent media reports from Yemen indicate that the regime has launched a massive public relations campaign to convince parents to send their children to these institutions. It is unclear what the scope of attendance is for Houthi summer programs throughout Yemen, but it appears that in at least some cases they are succeeding in their mission of indoctrination: in one instance it was reported that an anti-Houthi man was beaten to death by his children at the instruction of the regime for seeking to prevent their participation.\n\nSadly, the Houthis' designs for Yemen are worse than simply indoctrinating children - the regime also sends them to die on its behalf. According to the Yemen Peace Forum, the Houthis have recruited over ten thousand child soldiers thus far, and in 2020-21 alone approximately 2,000 of the Houthis' child soldiers are believed to have died fighting for the regime. Despite the Houthis signing an Action Plan with the United Nations to \"end and prevent the recruitment and use of children in armed conflict\" in 2022, this problem has only intensified since October 7, 2023, when the Houthis sought to claim the mantle of the Palestinian cause by attacking both Israel and international shipping in the Red Sea.\n\nIndoctrination alone is not enough to explain why children fight and die for the regime. As they rule over a poverty-stricken population with scant resources, the Houthis leverage their control of international humanitarian assistance to blackmail families in need into sending their children to the front lines. Such methods comport with the Houthis' wider recruitment of fighters, in some cases from non-Zaidi backgrounds, via financial motivation; they also sadly comport with the appallingly widespread practice of marrying off young girls, some far short even of the age of puberty, to old men for the financial advantage of their families.\n\nThere are further obvious knock-on effects of these horrendous abuses of minors. Neither child soldiers nor child brides will ever be given the chance to be educated or develop their full potential as citizens. The economies of both parts of Yemen - that controlled by the legitimate government as well as that under Houthi domination - are already impoverished by gender inequality and the widespread and destructive use of qat as a narcotic. It is difficult to foresee how Yemen will ever be able to prosper in the light of these compounding Houthi crimes.\n\nIf the Houthis' indoctrination and recruitment programs continue, Yemen will remain a miserable place controlled by armed radicals for the foreseeable future and rest assured, the Houthis will aim to drag the rest of the region down with Yemen. During his tenure as UK Ambassador to Yemen, Amb. Fitton-Brown heard the Houthi leaders themselves cite that their \"advantage\" over Western governments was that they did not care how many Yemenis had to die in order to fulfill their apocalyptic vision.\n\nAs is evident from the massive resources and effort invested in compelling Yemenis to buy into Houthi ideology and then make the ultimate sacrifice for the regime, there is nothing \"natural\" about this extremist Iran-backed organization and its activities. At the same time, it is clear that if the Houthi regime and their indoctrination machine are not stopped soon, they will reshape Yemen in a way that could take generations to undo. While the primary victims of Houthi radicalization and militarization are the Yemenis condemned to live under their rule, the region and the global economy will also suffer the consequences of inaction in the face of a growing and increasingly entrenched Houthi threat.", "source": {"uri": "counterextremism.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Counter Extremism Project"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Houthi movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Telecommunications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indoctrination", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indoctrination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rhetoric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islamic State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter_Extremism_Project", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Counter Extremism Project"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Yemen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet of Yemen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppression", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oppression"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Al-Qaeda"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taliban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014\u2013present)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yemeni civil war (2014\u2013present)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanaa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sanaa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children_in_the_military", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Children in the military"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radicalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Radicalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Militia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ideology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Censorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children,_Youth_and_Family", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children, Youth and Family", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Child_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Child Welfare", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://www.counterextremism.com/sites/default/files/blog_images/cep%20blog%20houthi%20youth_fitton-brown%20heistein_060524.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627822", "eventUri": "eng-9627822", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

Subsequently, the armed forces of the United States and the United Kingdom began to deliver joint strikes on rebel-held positions in several Yemeni cities, using aircraft, warships and submarines, targeting Houthi missile sites, drones and radiolocation systems.", "source": {"uri": "tass.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TASS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Red Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houthi movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TASS", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TASS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Port"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bab-el-Mandeb", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bab-el-Mandeb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jewish state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_operation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Military operation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_navigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of navigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Aden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Aden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Warship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submarine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Submarine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Nautical", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Nautical", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Naval", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Naval", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Safety", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Safety", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://tass.com/img/blocks/common/tass_logo_share_ru.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627822", "eventUri": "eng-9627822", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 8, "textEnd": 14}], "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

That would have included the disbursal of at least $1.5 billion in civil-servant salaries by Riyadh to Houthi-controlled territories, according to a person involved in negotiating the deal.\n\nA US State Department official, who asked not to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter, said President Joe Biden's administration supports peace in Yemen to address longstanding economic and humanitarian crises in the country. But he emphasized that agreements tied to the so-called UN road map can only proceed if the Houthis stop the Red Sea attacks, which began in November ostensibly to put pressure on Israel to end its war in Gaza.\n\nThe move demonstrates how US and UK airstrikes against the Houthis since early January have done little to deter the group, whose missile attacks and hijackings have upended shipping through one of the main arteries for global trade. Yet the shelving of the peace deal could undo a fragile two-year truce and reignite land fighting among Yemen's warring factions, potentially drawing in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states like the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe resurgence of another Middle East conflict alongside the Israel-Hamas war would further highlight the Biden administration's struggles to bring calm to the region -- just months before November's presidential election. Washington has been striving to broker a cease-fire deal in Gaza for several months with limited success.\n\nHouthi Banks\n\nIn tandem with the US decision on the UN peace plan, the Central Bank of Yemen, which is part of the internationally-recognized and Saudi-backed Yemeni government based in Aden, has taken a series of measures against banks located in Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen's north, including the capital Sanaa, that would undermine Houthi authority and cut their access to foreign currency.\n\nWhen the Houthis overthrew the government in 2014 and captured Sanaa, they seized all institutions including the then-national central bank, setting their own exchange rate for the Yemeni riyal and rules for all financial transactions connected to trade, humanitarian aid and remittances. In March they minted currency.\n\nAhmed Ghalib, the central bank governor, suspended operations of six banks in Sanaa last week for noncompliance with an order for all financial institutions to relocate their headquarters to Aden, while issuing a new directive instructing Yemenis to exchange old bank notes circulating in Houthi-controlled areas for new ones.\n\nThat was to protect Yemen's financial system, he said, especially after the Houthis were re-designated a global terrorist group in January. It's effectively an attempt to end the dual banking and currency system that has emerged in Yemen since the Houthis took power.\n\nThe central bank move is being supported by the US and Western allies and has most likely received tacit approval from the Saudis, who bankroll the Aden government and central bank there, said four people with direct knowledge of the situation. The US State Department official declined to comment on that aspect of the plan, while officials with Saudi Arabia's ministries of defense and foreign affairs who are responsible for the Yemen dossier did not respond to messages requesting comment.\n\nEconomic War\n\nThe Houthis accused the US and Saudi Arabia of orchestrating and waging a new economic war against them in response to their stance in the Gaza conflict. Prominent members of the movement have threatened to launch missile attacks on Saudi Arabian airbases as well as key projects associated with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's plan to diversify the economy.\n\n\"It's a dangerous game of pouring fuel on fire,\" Abdul Malik Al-Houthi who heads the Houthis' Ansarullah Movement, said last week.\n\nMBS, as the Saudi de facto ruler is known, has long been striving to end the Yemen war, green-lighting direct negotiations with the Houthis after he failed to oust them from power during a seven-year military intervention that killed 377,000 people, provoked widespread humanitarian suffering and exposed Saudi Arabia to hundreds of missile and drone attacks including against its vital oil facilities.\n\nIn an effort to diffuse the current standoff, the office of the UN Special Envoy for Yemen has invited top leaders from the Houthis and the Aden-based government to meet to discuss possible solutions over the currency and banks but they have yet to respond, said a person informed about this move, who did not wish to be named due to the delicate nature of the ongoing efforts.\n\nThe envoy, Hans Grundberg, declined to comment on the invitation but said the UN is determined to implement the peace road map.\n\nTurning Point\n\nIf carried out fully, the Yemeni government's moves will drain liquidity in Houthi areas and impact all financial dealings there, said Maged Al-Madhaji, chairperson and co-founder of the Sanaa Center for Strategic Studies.\n\n\"We're at one of the major turning points in the Yemen war because if the current truce unravels it will be very hard to reinstate it,\" he said.\n\nAnti-Houthi factions, who say they have been excluded from Saudi Arabia's deal with the Houthis and were compelled to rubber-stamp it in December, now want to leverage the international pressure on the group to extract their own concessions, namely by ending a Houthi embargo on oil exports from the south, Al-Madhaji said.\n\nAmr Al-Bidh, a senior official with the Southern Transitional Council, one of the main factions in the Aden-based government, said it will take more than financial pressure to tackle the long-term threats posed by the Houthis, who have been armed, funded and trained by Iran for years.\n\nFathi Al-Fahem, a Yemeni trader and businessman operating mainly in Sanaa, said the banking measures if implemented would impact his ability to import basic staples such as wheat from Australia. That would compound the hardship suffered by Yemenis in what is already one of the poorest countries in the world.\n\n\"As it is, the situation is dire,\" he said.\n\n--With assistance from Fiona MacDonald and Thomas Hall.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Flight QR017, a Boeing 787 Dreamliner, landed shortly before 1pm Dublin time (1200 GMT), the airport said. \"Upon landing, the aircraft was met by emergency services, including Airport Police and our Fire and Rescue department, due to 6 passengers and 6 crew (12 total) on board reporting injuries after the aircraft experienced turbulence while airborne over Turkey,\" Dublin Airport said in a statement. Irish broadcaster RTE, citing passengers arriving at Dublin Airport, said the incident lasted less than 20 seconds and occurred during food and drinks service. Qatar Airways did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. The incident took place five days after a Singapore Airlines flight from London to Singapore was forced to land in Bangkok due to severe turbulence, which killed a 73-year-old British man and left 20 others in intensive care. Turbulence-related airline accidents are the most common type, according to a 2021 study by the US National Transportation Safety Board. From 2009 through 2018, the US agency found that turbulence accounted for more than a third of reported airline accidents and most resulted in one or more serious injuries, but no aircraft damage.", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/qatar-airways-qr017-doha-dublin-turbulence-injured-4364821", "image": "https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--37-HBGd4--/c_crop,h_900,w_1600,x_0,y_133/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/v1/mediacorp/cna/image/2024/05/26/istock-2152442624.jpg?itok=LjaeKpIV", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 13:53:00", "author": "Cna", "authors": ["Cna"], "language": "en", "source_country": "sg", "sentiment": -0.299}

Even that, however, was ruled out over six weeks ahead of time when Sharks general manager Mike Grier was asked whether Boston University\u2019s Macklin Celebrini would be his selection after winning the lottery at the start of May. \u201cI would say, I would think so,\u201d Grier said. \u201cYeah.\u201d And so there was not even a cursory sheen of nerves on Friday when franchise great Joe Thornton announced that the Sharks would, indeed, kick off the draft by taking Celebrini, who won the Hobey Baker Award last year as the top player in college hockey. Celebrini joins a franchise whose junior team he played for as recently as 2018 when his father, Rick, joined the Golden State Warriors as director of sports medicine and performance. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy,\u201d Celebrini said on Sportsnet. \u201cHonestly it\u2019s surreal that life came full circle and I\u2019m back to where I was.\u201d Celebrini\u2019s ascension to No. 1 was followed by Chicago taking Michigan State defenseman Artyom Levshunov second overall and Anaheim taking OHL forward Beckett Sennecke third. The Blue Jackets then took WHL center Cayden Lindstrom fourth, followed by Celine Dion announcing Montreal would select Russian defenseman Ivan Demidov fifth. It\u2019s not yet clear whether Celebrini, who played his freshman year of college at age 17 before becoming a legal adult a mere two weeks ago, will sign with the Sharks or return to BU for another season. After scoring 32 goals with 32 assists in a mere 38 games, leading the Terriers to the Frozen Four, there\u2019s an argument to be made that Celebrini outgrew college hockey before even getting to the age when most kids step on campus. But the Sharks, in the midst of a painful rebuild, will be cognizant about ensuring that Celebrini is not exposed if he starts the year in the NHL. At this early juncture of the offseason \u2014 San Jose has just nine forwards under contract with approximately $30.4 million of salary cap space, per CapFriendly \u2014 it\u2019s not clear who would play alongside the left-handed center if he makes the jump. If he does, the Sharks would likely need to try and add more talent than they featured last season, if only to help the rookie develop as he adjusts to playing against adults. Whether he goes to the league immediately or not, Celebrini marks a badly-needed stroke of luck for a franchise that has not made the playoffs since 2019. He is not considered the kind of generational prospect that Connor Bedard was a year ago, but Celebrini has earned plaudits for his all-around ability and two-way play \u2014 and was the no-doubt No. 1 pick in this draft. The Vancouver native is already used to the Bay Area, and because of his father\u2019s job, counts the likes of Steve Nash and Ryan Kesler \u2014 Rick Celebrini also worked for the Canucks \u2014 as peers. Now, he\u2019ll start forging his own legacy on the south end of the Bay.", "summary": "Celebrini joins a franchise whose junior team he played for as recently as 2018 when his father, Rick, joined the Golden State Warriors as director of sports medicine and performance.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/06/28/sports/sharks-pick-macklin-celebrini-with-no-1-pick-in-nhl-draft/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/newspress-collage-gfdpkee3h-1719621180039.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1719606815&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 00:41:18", "author": "Ethan Sears", "authors": ["Ethan Sears"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.13}

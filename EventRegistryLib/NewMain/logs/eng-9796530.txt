But with increased tensions between Beijing and the West, China appeared to back off from the deal.\n\nHowever, a recent signal from Chinese President Xi Jinping indicated a thawing of icy panda relations.\n\nIn November, Chinese President Xi Jinping raised hopes his country would start sending pandas to the U.S. again after he and President Joe Biden convened in Northern California for their first face-to-face meeting in a year and pledged to try to reduce tensions.\n\n\"We are ready to continue our cooperation with the United States on panda conservation,\" Xi said in late 2023.\n\nDecades after Beijing began working with zoos in the U.S. and Europe to protect the species, the number of giant pandas in the wild has risen to 1,900, up from about 1,100 in the 1980s. They're no longer considered \"at risk\" of extinction but have been given the safer status of \"vulnerable.\"", "source": {"uri": "khou.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KHOU 11 Houston"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_panda", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Giant panda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_biology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conservation biology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Zoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Zoological_Park_(United_States)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Zoological Park (United States)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ling-Ling_and_Hsing-Hsing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Zoo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Zoo"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Nixon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pat Nixon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Zoo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Zoo"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamboo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bamboo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Richard Nixon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panda_diplomacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Panda diplomacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of the People's Republic of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Northern California"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xi Jinping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diplomacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Taoism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Taoism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Falun_Dafa", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Falun Dafa", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://media.khou.com/assets/KHOU/images/d2819ee8-2cb7-420d-8efc-049845f57cd5/20240806T210851/d2819ee8-2cb7-420d-8efc-049845f57cd5_1140x641.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796530", "eventUri": "eng-9796530", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 81, "textEnd": 89}], "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 237, "relevance": 1}

Yun Chuan and Xin Bao arrived at the San Diego Zoo earlier this summer and are the first giant pandas to enter the U.S. in 21 years.\n\nIn celebration of their debut, Governor Gavin Newsom has proclaimed August 8, 2024, as California Panda Day.\n\nPanda Ridge at the San Diego Zoo opens August 8 at noon. Guests will have several options to see the animals, including obtaining a free giant panda timed ticket or by just joining a standby line. Additionally, advanced reservations are available for an exclusive 60-minute Early Morning with Pandas Walking Tour before the zoo opens to guests for the day.\n\nPanda Ridge is described as an \"expansive and multidimensional experience... inspired by famous geological formations in China, emulating the mountainous forest ecosystems where giant pandas thrive while immersing you into their world,\" a statement from Erika Kohler, San Diego Zoo senior vice president and executive director read.\n\nYun Chuan and Xin Bao arrived in San Diego in late June and have spent the last several weeks acclimating to the zoo and their new habitat.\n\nYun Chuan and Xin Bao arrived in San Diego June 27. The giant pandas' arrival is part of a special conservation agreement between China and the U.S. The San Diego Zoo last hosted pandas in 2019, but China recalled most of its giant pandas from U.S. zoos over diplomatic tensions.\n\nYun Chuan and Xin Bao resume the symbolization of friendship between the two countries, or panda diplomacy. Mayor Todd Gloria visited China in June to participate in farewell ceremonies for the panda pair before they started their journey to San Diego.\n\nSince their arrival, the San Diego Zoo has worked with Chinese experts to satisfy the pandas' dietary needs and preferences. Veterinary teams from both the U.S. and China are paying attention to a range of health factors, including weight and appetite, to make sure the pandas thrive.\n\nStaff have provided the panda pair with a variety of fresh bamboo, in addition to a local adaptation of a traditional Chinese bun called \"panda bread.\" They have conducted food adaptability exercises and have monitored the pandas' weight to make sure they are adjusting properly.\n\nYun Chuan is almost five years old. His mother was the fourth cub born at the San Diego Zoo in 2007.\n\nYou can spot Yun Chuan by looking for his long, slightly pointed nose. Zoo officials say he looks \"extremely comfortable whether he is exploring on the grass or climbing trees.\"\n\nXin Bao is four years old.

However, the Smithsonian's National Zoo will receive a new pair of pandas by the end of the year after its last bears returned to China last November. As part of the loan agreement, U.S. zoos typically pay $1 million a year toward China's wildfire conservation efforts, and all cubs born in the U.S. must return to China by age 4.\n\nBoth pandas at the San Diego Zoo were born at the Wolong Shenshuping Panda Base in China's Sichuan province.\n\nYun Chuan is a nearly five-year-old male panda described by the zoo as \"mild-mannered, gentle and lovable.\" He is the grandson of Bai Yun and Gao Gao, who both lived at the San Diego Zoo for more than a decade. His mother, Zhen Zhen, was the fourth cub born at the zoo.\n\nXin Bao is a nearly four-year-old female panda described by the zoo as a \"gentle and witty introvert with a sweet round face and big ears.\"\n\n\"Her name means a treasure of prosperity and abundance, and we hope she will bring you good luck,\" Ambassador Xie said. He also spoke about China being California's top trading partner as well as the large Chinese community in the state and the abundance of Chinese tourists.\n\nAmong the pandas' biggest fans are two kids who were proudly wearing \"Panda Ridge\" t-shirts and carrying plushies at the zoo Thursday morning.\n\n\"Pandas are their favorite animals, if you could only see what our house looks like in terms of stuffed animals,\" their father James Metz said.\n\nIt was also his seven-year-old daughter's birthday, making it an extra special occasion.

Together with our partners, we continue to make significant strides in ensuring a hopeful future for this iconic species,\" said Paul Baribault, President and CEO of San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, in a July statement.\n\nThe Panda Ridge habitat where the pair will live is four times larger than the previous panda enclosure, the zoo said, and takes cues from China's landscape with features emulating canyons, mountains and cliffs. There's also a new shade tree for climbing.\n\nVisitors to the zoo will have three ways to see the pandas: by obtaining a complimentary timed ticket on the day of the visit; joining the standby line; or making reservations for a 60-minute, early morning walking tour.\n\nThe walking tour is not included in the price of admission, which is required for the tour. The tours start at $92 per person.

The four giant pandas at Zoo Atlanta will go back to China later this year.\n\nBut San Diego's agreement with China may represent a new phase in panda diplomacy; China announced in April it would also send pandas to the San Francisco Zoo for the first time.\n\nThe San Diego Zoo, one of the world's most renowned, was the first American institution to carry out cooperative research on giant pandas with China. Since 1994, it has worked with the Sichuan conservation center to study the species' behavior, genetics, artificial breeding, nutrition and disease prevention.\n\nThe San Diego Zoo has said that it is working closely with Chinese experts to cater to the pandas' dietary needs, providing a variety of fresh bamboo and a local adaptation of wowotou, a traditional Chinese bun also called \"panda bread.\"\n\nCNN's Jessie Yeung, Manveena Suri, Fred He and Kaila Nichols contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Together with our partners, we continue to make significant strides in ensuring a hopeful future for this iconic species,\" said Paul Baribault, President and CEO of San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, in a July statement.\n\nThe Panda Ridge habitat where the pair will live is four times larger than the previous panda enclosure, the zoo said, and takes cues from China's landscape with features emulating canyons, mountains and cliffs. There's also a new shade tree for climbing.\n\nVisitors to the zoo will have three ways to see the pandas: by obtaining a complimentary timed ticket on the day of the visit; joining the standby line; or making reservations for a 60-minute, early morning walking tour.\n\nThe walking tour is not included in the price of admission, which is required for the tour. The tours start at $92 per person. The zoo's website was showing sold out tours through the month of August.\n\nYun Chuan and Xin Bao have been \"acclimating well\" since their arrival in the Golden State on June 27, the zoo said in a news release in July.\n\nYun Chuan is a nearly 5-year-old male born to Zhen Zhen, the fourth cub born at the San Diego Zoo.\n\n\"He's identifiable by his long, slightly pointed nose and seems to be extremely comfortable whether he is exploring on the grass or climbing trees,\" the zoo said in a news release.\n\nXin Bao is a nearly 4-year-old female whose name means \"precious treasure of prosperity and abundance.\"\n\n\"She is best recognized by her large, round face and big, fluffy ears, and she enjoys sunbathing quietly and focusing on her favorite food,\" the zoo added.\n\nThe young pandas are on loan from China after Chinese leader Xi Jinping suggested sending pandas to the San Diego Zoo as \"envoys of friendship between the Chinese and American peoples.\"\n\nChina loans pandas to more than 20 countries under a program often referred to as \"panda diplomacy.\" Its panda loans to the US stretch back to 1972 - though the number of loans has decreased in recent years as US-China relations worsened.\n\nOver the past few years, pandas from the Memphis Zoo and Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington, DC, were returned to China. The four giant pandas at Zoo Atlanta will go back to China later this year.\n\nBut San Diego's agreement with China may represent a new phase in panda diplomacy; China announced in April it would also send pandas to the San Francisco Zoo for the first time.\n\nThe San Diego Zoo, one of the world's most renowned, was the first American institution to carry out cooperative research on giant pandas with China. Since 1994, it has worked with the Sichuan conservation center to study the species' behavior, genetics, artificial breeding, nutrition and disease prevention.\n\nThe San Diego Zoo has said that it is working closely with Chinese experts to cater to the pandas' dietary needs, providing a variety of fresh bamboo and a local adaptation of wowotou, a traditional Chinese bun also called \"panda bread.\"\n\nCNN's Jessie Yeung, Manveena Suri, Fred He and Kaila Nichols contributed to this report.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com", "source": {"uri": "aol.com",

Throngs of media gathered inside the zoo, while the city of San Diego warned of traffic jams ahead of the much-anticipated event Thursday.\n\nThe San Diego Zoo rolled out the red carpet for the first public showing of its celebrity residents, who were already dressed in black-and-white attire. The two giant pandas were seen sunbathing and chowing down on bamboo in their new home as the first pandas to enter the U.S. in two decades.\n\nFor years, the Chinese government has loaned pandas to zoos around the world in a practice called \"panda diplomacy.\" These fuzzy ambassadors have long been a symbol of the U.S.-China friendship, ever since Beijing gifted a pair of pandas to the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., in 1972.\n\nBut in recent years, China stopped renewing panda loans to zoos and calling back home the animals it had given to Western countries as relations soured. The San Diego Zoo's previous pandas left in 2018 and 2019.\n\nThen in February, the China Wildlife Conservation Association announced it was sending two more pandas to San Diego and also signing agreements with the zoo in the Spanish capital of Madrid, quelling fears that Beijing was ending its historic panda diplomacy. San Diego's pandas arrived in June and have been acclimating to their new home before being seen by the public.\n\n\"This is about something much deeper, much richer, than just the two beautiful pandas we celebrate,\" Gov. Gavin Newsom said at the opening ceremony that included dancing, music, and remarks from Chinese ambassador Xie Feng, and other local officials. \"It's about celebrating our common humanity.\"\n\nFor the occasion, Newsom proclaimed Aug. 8 as California Panda Day and recognized the San Diego Zoo as the first organization in the U.S. to establish a cooperative panda conservation program with China.\n\nXie said he met someone on his flight who had traveled all the way from Washington, D.C., to see the pandas.\n\n\"Two little panda fans from California wrote several letters to me proposing giving China grizzly bears to get pandas,\" Xie said, eliciting laughs.\n\nOnly four other giant pandas currently reside in the United States, all at the zoo in Atlanta. However, the Smithsonian's National Zoo will receive a new pair of pandas by the end of the year after its last bears returned to China last November. As part of the loan agreement, U.S. zoos typically pay $1 million a year toward China's wildfire conservation efforts, and all cubs born in the U.S. must return to China by age 4.\n\nBoth pandas at the San Diego Zoo were born at the Wolong Shenshuping Panda Base in China's Sichuan province.\n\nYun Chuan is a nearly five-year-old male panda described by the zoo as \"mild-mannered, gentle and lovable.\" He is the grandson of Bai Yun and Gao Gao, who both lived at the San Diego Zoo for more than a decade. His mother, Zhen Zhen, was the fourth cub born at the zoo.\n\nXin Bao is a nearly four-year-old female panda described by the zoo as a \"gentle and witty introvert with a sweet round face and big ears.\"\n\n\"Her name means a treasure of prosperity and abundance, and we hope she will bring you good luck,\" Ambassador Xie said. He also spoke about China being California's top trading partner as well as the large Chinese community in the state and the abundance of Chinese tourists.\n\nAmong the pandas' biggest fans are two kids who were proudly wearing \"Panda Ridge\" t-shirts and carrying plushies at the zoo Thursday morning.\n\n\"Pandas are their favorite animals, if you could only see what our house looks like in terms of stuffed animals,\" their father James Metz said.\n\nIt was also his seven-year-old daughter's birthday, making it an extra special occasion. For weeks, the family has been eagerly watching live panda feeds from China in anticipation of the bears' arrival.\n\nYun Chuan and Xin Bao were hanging out and relaxing after eating, Metz said.",

The first character of his name, \"Yun,\" is a nod to his grandmother Bai Yun, who lived at the San Diego Zoo for 23 years.\n\nXin Bao is a nearly 4-year-old female and is described as a \"gentle and witty introvert with a sweet round face and big ears,\" a zoo statement reads. Her name means a \"new treasure of prosperity and abundance.\"\n\n\"For 30 years, we've worked alongside our Chinese conservation partners to save, protect and care for giant pandas and their ecosystems,\" Kohler said. \"And now we have the opportunity to continue caring for and conserving these incredible bears as we expand on our transformative work to secure a future for their species.\"\n\nSan Diego Zoo was the first zoo in the United States to have a cooperative panda conservation program.\n\nChina recalled almost all of its pandas who were on loan to zoos in the U.S. around five years ago after relations between the two countries soured. Cooperation between China and the U.S. has led to the possibility of pandas returning to zoos, including the San Diego Zoo.\n\nThere is typically a $1 million per year fee paid by the zoos for two pandas, and the money is used for China's conservation efforts, according to a 2022 report by America's Congressional Research Service.\n\nChina first gifted the U.S. with pandas in 1972, when two were sent to the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. Part of the goal in loaning pandas to zoos in the United States was to help breed cubs and boost the population.\n\nConservation efforts have saved the giant pandas from extinction by increasing the population from fewer than 1,000 to more than 1,800 in the wild and captivity, causing the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List to downgrade the giant panda from Endangered to Vulnerable in 2021.", "source": {"uri": "kpbs.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "KPBS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Zoo", "type": "loc", "score": 5,

Newsom declares California Panda Day", "body": "LOS ANGELES -- California's state animal might be the grizzly bear, but today is another bear's big moment to shine.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom has declared Aug. 8, 2024, to be California Panda Day -- a playful (but also politically significant) nod to Thursday's public debut of two giant pandas, Yun Chuan and Xin Bao, at the San Diego Zoo.\n\nThese two pandas, in a gesture of goodwill from China, are the first to be sent to the United States in more than two decades.\n\n\"This conservation collaboration is part of California and China's long history of working together toward shared goals,\" said Newsom, who is expected to visit the zoo in the morning. \"Building on our strong foundation of partnership and deep cultural and economic ties, I traveled to China last year to advance priority issues including climate action and economic development.\n\n\"We hope that the newly arrived panda 'envoys of friendship' will lead to further exchanges and cooperation between California and China,\" he added, in his official proclamation of California Panda Day.\n\nYun Chuan and Xin Bao arrived in San Diego in June after a collaborative conservation agreement reignited a \"panda diplomacy\" between China and the U.S. that had appeared to falter for a few years.\n\n(For more than five decades, beginning in 1972, China has lent pandas to zoos across the U.S. as \"envoys of friendship,\" but doubts about the future of these loans grew in 2019 after the San Diego Zoo returned its last giant pandas to China. The Memphis Zoo and the Smithsonian's National Zoo have also sent back several pandas in recent years, when their multiyear agreements were up.)\n\nSan Diego is a particularly meaningful place to ring in this next era of panda diplomacy. The San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance was the first organization in the nation to establish a cooperative panda conservation program, and researchers there have since made significant contributions to our scientific understanding of how to nurture such a keystone species.\n\nOne of the new pandas, Yun Chuan, in fact, is the son of Zhen Zhen, a female panda born at the San Diego Zoo in 2007.\n\nAt almost 5 years old, Yun Chuan is identifiable by his long, pointy nose. He has an active personality, but he is also known to be gentle and sensitive to others. He's serious about his bamboo but will always let other pandas go first, according to his wildlife care specialists.\n\nXin Bao, the smaller of the two, has a large, round face and big, fluffy ears that help set her apart from other pandas. She is almost 4 years old and naturally playful -- her caretakers have said she is witty and curious, and has proved to be an excellent climber and will even roughhouse a bit with other pandas.\n\nTheir new home, the newly expanded \"Panda Ridge\" at the San Diego Zoo, has been designed to reflect the sweeping mountains, canyons and cliffs of China's Sichuan, Gansu and Shaanxi provinces. Four times larger than the zoo's previous panda habitat, this reimagined space also features shade trees for climbing and rolling hillsides for Yun Chuan and Xin Bao to explore.\n\nPeople wishing to see the new pandas can do so in several ways: Obtain a complimentary timed ticket on the day of your visit, join a standby line in person, or reserve an exclusive 60-minute \"Early Morning With Pandas Walking Tour.\" Additional information can be found on the zoo's website.", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Throngs of media gathered inside the zoo, while the city of San Diego warned of traffic jams ahead of the much-anticipated event Thursday.\n\nThe San Diego Zoo rolled out the red carpet for the first public showing of its celebrity residents, who were already dressed in black-and-white attire. The two giant pandas, the first to enter the U.S. in two decades, seemed unfazed by all the attention, sunbathing and chowing down on bamboo in their new home.\n\nFor years, the Chinese government has loaned pandas to zoos around the world in a practice called \"panda diplomacy.\" These fuzzy ambassadors have long been a symbol of the U.S.-China friendship, ever since Beijing gifted a pair of pandas to the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., in 1972.\n\nBut in recent years, China stopped renewing panda loans to zoos and calling back home the animals it had given to Western countries as relations soured. The San Diego Zoo's previous pandas left in 2018 and 2019.\n\nThen in February, the China Wildlife Conservation Association announced it was sending two more pandas to San Diego and also signing agreements with the zoo in the Spanish capital of Madrid, quelling fears that Beijing was ending its historic panda diplomacy. San Diego's pandas arrived in June and have been acclimating to their new home before being seen by the public.\n\n\"This is about something much deeper, much richer, than just the two beautiful pandas we celebrate,\" Gov. Gavin Newsom said at the opening ceremony that included dancing, music, and remarks from Chinese ambassador Xie Feng, and other local officials. \"It's about celebrating our common humanity.\"\n\nFor the occasion, Newsom proclaimed Aug. 8 as California Panda Day and recognized the San Diego Zoo as the first organization in the U.S. to establish a cooperative panda conservation program with China.\n\nXie said he met someone on his flight who had traveled all the way from Washington, D.C., to see the pandas.\n\n\"Two little panda fans from California wrote several letters to me proposing giving China grizzly bears to get pandas,\" Xie said, eliciting laughs.\n\nOnly four other giant pandas currently reside in the United States, all at the zoo in Atlanta. However, the Smithsonian's National Zoo will receive a new pair of pandas by the end of the year after its last bears returned to China last November. As part of the loan agreement, U.S. zoos typically pay $1 million a year toward China's wildfire conservation efforts, and all cubs born in the U.S. must return to China by age 4.\n\nBoth pandas at the San Diego Zoo were born at the Wolong Shenshuping Panda Base in China's Sichuan province.\n\nYun Chuan is a nearly five-year-old male panda described by the zoo as \"mild-mannered, gentle and lovable.\" He is the grandson of Bai Yun and Gao Gao, who both lived at the San Diego Zoo for more than a decade. His mother, Zhen Zhen, was the fourth cub born at the zoo.\n\nXin Bao is a nearly four-year-old female panda described by the zoo as a \"gentle and witty introvert with a sweet round face and big ears.\"\n\n\"Her name means a treasure of prosperity and abundance, and we hope she will bring you good luck,\" Ambassador Xie said. He also spoke about China being California's top trading partner as well as the large Chinese community in the state and the abundance of Chinese tourists.\n\nAmong the pandas' biggest fans are two kids who were proudly wearing \"Panda Ridge\" t-shirts and carrying plushies at the zoo Thursday morning.\n\n\"Pandas are their favorite animals, if you could only see what our house looks like in terms of stuffed animals,\" their father James Metz said.\n\nIt was also his seven-year-old daughter's birthday, making it an extra special occasion. For weeks, the family has been eagerly watching live panda feeds from China in anticipation of the bears' arrival.\n\nYun Chuan and Xin Bao were hanging out and relaxing after eating, Metz said.\n\nA portrait of one of the panda's grandmothers, who lived at the zoo for more than 20 years, was created by California-based artist Shepard Fairey, who is best known for designing the \"Hope\" imagery in former President Barack Obama's 2008 campaign.", "source": {"uri": "hjnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@hjnews.com", "name":

The two giant pandas were seen sunbathing and chowing down on bamboo in their new home as the first pandas to enter the U.S. in two decades.\n\nFor years, the Chinese government has loaned pandas to zoos around the world in a practice called \"panda diplomacy.\" These fuzzy ambassadors have long been a symbol of the U.S.-China friendship, ever since Beijing gifted a pair of pandas to the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., in 1972.\n\nBut in recent years, China stopped renewing panda loans to zoos and calling back home the animals it had given to Western countries as relations soured. The San Diego Zoo's previous pandas left in 2018 and 2019.\n\nThen in February, the China Wildlife Conservation Association announced it was sending two more pandas to San Diego and also signing agreements with the zoo in the Spanish capital of Madrid, quelling fears that Beijing was ending its historic panda diplomacy.

Together with our partners, we continue to make significant strides in ensuring a hopeful future for this iconic species,\" said Paul Baribault, President and CEO of San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, in a July statement.\n\nThe Panda Ridge habitat where the pair will live is four times larger than the previous panda enclosure, the zoo said, and takes cues from China's landscape with features emulating canyons, mountains and cliffs. There's also a new shade tree for climbing.\n\nVisitors to the zoo will have three ways to see the pandas: by obtaining a complimentary timed ticket on the day of the visit; joining the standby line; or making reservations for a 60-minute, early morning walking tour.\n\nThe walking tour is not included in the price of admission, which is required for the tour. The tours start at $92 per person. The zoo's website was showing sold out tours through the month of August.\n\nYun Chuan and Xin Bao have been \"acclimating well\" since their arrival in the Golden State on June 27, the zoo said in a news release in July.\n\nYun Chuan is a nearly 5-year-old male born to Zhen Zhen, the fourth cub born at the San Diego Zoo.\n\n\"He's identifiable by his long, slightly pointed nose and seems to be extremely comfortable whether he is exploring on the grass or climbing trees,\" the zoo said in a news release.\n\nXin Bao is a nearly 4-year-old female whose name means \"precious treasure of prosperity and abundance.\"\n\n\"She is best recognized by her large, round face and big, fluffy ears, and she enjoys sunbathing quietly and focusing on her favorite food,\" the zoo added.\n\nThe young pandas are on loan from China after Chinese leader Xi Jinping suggested sending pandas to the San Diego Zoo as \"envoys of friendship between the Chinese and American peoples.\"\n\nChina loans pandas to more than 20 countries under a program often referred to as \"panda diplomacy.\" Its panda loans to the US stretch back to 1972 - though the number of loans has decreased in recent years as US-China relations worsened.\n\nOver the past few years, pandas from the Memphis Zoo and Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington, DC, were returned to China. The four giant pandas at Zoo Atlanta will go back to China later this year.\n\nBut San Diego's agreement with China may represent a new phase in panda diplomacy; China announced in April it would also send pandas to the San Francisco Zoo for the first time.\n\nThe San Diego Zoo, one of the world's most renowned, was the first American institution to carry out cooperative research on giant pandas with China. Since 1994, it has worked with the Sichuan conservation center to study the species' behavior, genetics, artificial breeding, nutrition and disease prevention.\n\nThe San Diego Zoo has said that it is working closely with Chinese experts to cater to the pandas' dietary needs, providing a variety of fresh bamboo and a local adaptation of wowotou, a traditional Chinese bun also called \"panda bread.\"\n\nCNN's Jessie Yeung, Manveena Suri, Fred He and Kaila Nichols contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

A large number of media personnel gathered at the zoo in anticipation of the event, with the city of San Diego cautioning about potential traffic congestion prior to the highly awaited Thursday debut.\n\nThe San Diego Zoo extended a warm welcome for the public unveiling of its famous residents, who were already sporting their iconic black-and-white fur. These two giant pandas, the first to arrive in the U.S. in twenty years, appeared unperturbed by the spotlight, leisurely sunning themselves and munching on bamboo in their newly established residence.\n\nFor decades, China has been lending pandas to zoos worldwide as part of a diplomatic gesture known as \"panda diplomacy.\" These lovable creatures have served as enduring symbols of the friendship between the United States and China, a tradition that dates back to 1972 when Beijing presented a pair of pandas to the National Zoo in Washington, D.C.\n\nBut in recent years, China stopped renewing panda loans to zoos and calling back home the animals it had given to Western countries as relations soured. The San Diego Zoo's previous pandas left in 2018 and 2019.\n\nThen in February, the China Wildlife Conservation Association announced it was sending two more pandas to San Diego and also signing agreements with the zoo in the Spanish capital of Madrid, quelling fears that Beijing was ending its historic panda diplomacy. San Diego's pandas arrived in June and have been acclimating to their new home before being seen by the public.\n\n\"This is about something much deeper, much richer, than just the two beautiful pandas we celebrate,\" Gov. Gavin Newsom said at the opening ceremony that included dancing, music, and remarks from Chinese ambassador Xie Feng, and other local officials. \"It's about celebrating our common humanity.\"\n\nFor the occasion, Newsom proclaimed Aug. 8 as California Panda Day and recognized the San Diego Zoo as the first organization in the U.S. to establish a cooperative panda conservation program with China.\n\nXie said he met someone on his flight who had traveled all the way from Washington, D.C., to see the pandas.\n\n\"Two little panda fans from California wrote several letters to me proposing giving China grizzly bears to get pandas,\" Xie said, eliciting laughs.\n\nOnly four other giant pandas currently reside in the United States, all at the zoo in Atlanta. However, the Smithsonian's National Zoo will receive a new pair of pandas by the end of the year after its last bears returned to China last November. As part of the loan agreement, U.S. zoos typically pay $1 million a year toward China's wildfire conservation efforts, and all cubs born in the U.S. must return to China by age 4.\n\nBoth pandas at the San Diego Zoo were born at the Wolong Shenshuping Panda Base in China's Sichuan province.\n\nYun Chuan is a nearly five-year-old male panda described by the zoo as \"mild-mannered, gentle and lovable.\" He is the grandson of Bai Yun and Gao Gao, who both lived at the San Diego Zoo for more than a decade. His mother, Zhen Zhen, was the fourth cub born at the zoo.\n\nXin Bao is a nearly four-year-old female panda described by the zoo as a \"gentle and witty introvert with a sweet round face and big ears.\"\n\n\"Her name means a treasure of prosperity and abundance, and we hope she will bring you good luck,\" Ambassador Xie said. He also spoke about China being California's top trading partner as well as the large Chinese community in the state and the abundance of Chinese tourists.\n\nAmong the pandas' biggest fans are two kids who were proudly wearing \"Panda Ridge\" t-shirts and carrying plushies at the zoo Thursday morning.\n\n\"Pandas are their favorite animals, if you could only see what our house looks like in terms of stuffed animals,\" their father James Metz said.\n\nIt was also his seven-year-old daughter's birthday, making it an extra special occasion. For weeks, the family has been eagerly watching live panda feeds from China in anticipation of the bears' arrival.\n\nYun Chuan and Xin Bao were hanging out and relaxing after eating, Metz said.\n\nAt the ceremony, officials unveiled a portrait of one of the panda's grandmothers, who lived at the zoo for more than 20 years. It was created by California-based artist Shepard Fairey, who is best known for designing the \"Hope\" imagery in former President Barack Obama's 2008 campaign.", "source": {"uri":

Agence France-Presse\n\nSAN DIEGO -- California pulled out all the stops Thursday to welcome the arrival of two new giant pandas from China, the first to be sent by Beijing to the United States in 21 years.\n\nThe young bears were greeted by children in panda hats and dignitaries, as well as a show including traditional Chinese dances.\n\nYun Chuan and Xin Bao appeared, however, to be little moved by the performances and the symbolism of their arrival, at a time of gradually thawing US-China relations.\n\nREAD: San Diego zoo to return beloved giant pandas to China\n\nAfter traveling nearly 7,000 miles (11,000 kilometers) from the mountainous region of Sichuan, the two creatures are now the undisputed stars of the San Diego Zoo.\n\n\"My children only wanted to see two things in America: orcas and pandas,\" Guillaume Courcoux, a Swiss tourist whose family was among the spectators Thursday, told AFP. \"They were very impressed.\"\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom celebrated the \"panda mania\" and declared August 8 \"Panda Day\" in the state.\n\n\"This is about something much deeper, much richer than just the two beautiful pandas we celebrate,\" the Democrat said. \"It's about celebrating our common humanity. It's about celebrating the things that bind us together.\"\n\nREAD: Calgary Zoo returning pandas to China due to bamboo barriers\n\nUntil recently, the loan of the two pandas seemed an unlikely dream.\n\nWith fierce trade competition, and disagreements over Taiwan and human rights, tensions between China and the United States have been rising for several years -- to the point that Beijing's traditional \"panda diplomacy\" seemed to have frozen.\n\nIn recent years, pandas at zoos in Washington DC, Atlanta and Memphis were all returned to Beijing, after loan agreements were not renewed.\n\nHowever, at a key summit between US President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping in November, the latter announced that Beijing would continue the program in the United States.\n\nChina's loaning of pandas around the world is both a diplomatic symbol and a way to help the survival of a vulnerable species.\n\nIn addition to San Diego, pandas are expected to return to zoos in Washington and San Francisco by 2025.\n\n'Our shared future'\n\nChina first offered its pandas to the United States in 1972 under US President Richard Nixon.\n\nSince then, the country has used its loan of the black-and-white bears to send diplomatic messages.\n\nFor instance, after President Barack Obama met with the Dalai Lama in 2010, who is seen as a rebel by Beijing, China recalled two of its pandas.\n\nThe San Diego Zoo has enjoyed a decades-long partnership with Chinese authorities, having received two pandas in 1996 that gave birth to six cubs in captivity.\n\nAll of the pandas were returned to China in 2019, in line with earlier agreements.\n\nThe return of the pandas is not only a boon for the zoo, where their presence attracts thousands of visitors a year, but also supports the propagation of the species, which is notoriously difficult in the wild.\n\nZoo officials described four-year-old Yun Chuan as a \"mild-mannered, gentle and lovable\" male, who was named after his grandmother, Bai Yun, one of the initial two pandas loaned to San Diego.\n\nThe other panda, three-year-old female Xin Bao, is a \"gentle and witty introvert,\" zoo officials said. Her name means a \"new treasure of prosperity and abundance.\"\n\n\"We hope she will bring you good luck to California, to San Diego,\" China's ambassador to the United States Xie Feng said.",

The pandas arrived at the end of June. Sandy Huffaker/Getty Images/Getty Images North America hide caption\n\nThe San Diego Zoo opened a long-awaited giant panda exhibit to the public on Thursday, breathing new life into U.S.-Chinese panda diplomacy and delighting panda fans in California.\n\nThe special public unveiling of \"Panda Ridge\" was slated for noon local time on Thursday -- a date proclaimed by Gov. Gavin Newsom as California Panda Day as he welcomed \"envoys of friendship\" from China.\n\nThe older panda, Yun Chuan (pronounced \"yoon chu-an,\" according to the zoo), is a male who is nearly 5 years old.\n\n\"His mother Zhen Zhen was born in 2007 and was the fourth cub born at the San Diego Zoo. He's identifiable by his long, slightly pointed nose,\" the zoo said.\n\nXin Bao (pronounced \"sing bao\"), a female, is almost 4. Her distinguishing features include a \"large, round face and big, fluffy ears,\" the zoo said.\n\nThey're the first pandas to come to the United States in 21 years.\n\nPeople wanting to visit the zoo on Thursday should expect \"giant crowds, and heavy traffic,\" according to NPR member station KPBS.\n\nThe zoo said that in addition to a standby line that opened hours before the exhibit, it would issue complimentary timed tickets to see the pandas. The zoo also offers a one-hour early-morning walking tour focusing on the animals, with a price starting at $92.\n\nThe San Diego Zoo has a long history of housing pandas, but it recently went five years without the well-loved animal after its last two pandas, Bai Yun and Xiao Liwu, were removed from their home in Panda Canyon in the spring of 2019.\n\nThe Smithsonian's National Zoo in Washington, D.C., also said farewell to its pandas last November, in what struck many local fans as an abrupt departure. For much of this year, Zoo Atlanta was the only U.S. zoo with giant pandas.\n\nBut earlier this year, both the National Zoo and the San Francisco Zoo announced they will also see the return of giant pandas, likely by the end of 2024 and in 2025, respectively, as Chinese officials have made fresh agreements with their U.S. counterparts.\n\nChina first sent pandas to the U.S. in 1972, in a program that was seen as both a relationship-building exercise for the two countries and a chance for conservation experts to collaborate to help the black-and-white bears' population rebound.\n\nSince then, giant pandas have come to the U.S. under a loan program, with the animals and their offspring remaining the property of China. Those loans were often extended, but the deals have shown the strain of U.S.-China relations in recent years.\n\nIn 2016, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature changed how it designates giant pandas on its list of threatened species, classifying them as \"vulnerable\" to extinction rather than endangered.", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "NPR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bill_chappell@npr.org", "name": "Bill Chappell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Zoo", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Zoo"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_panda", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Giant panda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getty_Images", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Getty Images"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panda_diplomacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Panda diplomacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Zoological_Park_(United_States)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Zoological Park (United States)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NPR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiao_Liwu", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xiao Liwu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoo_Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zoo Atlanta"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bai_Yun", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bai Yun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Zoo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Zoo"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China\u2013United_States_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China\u2013United States relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservation movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smithsonian_Institution", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Smithsonian Institution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Union for Conservation of Nature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Endangered species"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extinction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerable_species", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vulnerable species"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threatened_species", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Threatened species"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Zoology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Zoology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal Welfare", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Reptiles_and_Amphibians", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Reptiles and Amphibians", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Exotic", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Exotic", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6480x3645+0+83/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F54%2F35%2Fa27d2481441385558d44d25037cd%2Fgettyimages-2165259843.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796530", "eventUri": "eng-9796530", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 223, "relevance": 1}

Newsom said in the proclamation.\n\nCaretakers describe the 5-year-old male Yun Chuan as inquisitive, smart and a bit shy, while 4-year-old Xin Bao is more laid back.\n\n\"(Yun Chuan) loves his bamboo. He's really comfortable in his habitat. He explores, and he's curious,\" Dr. Megan Owen, VP of Wildlife and Conservation Science for the San Diego Zoo, told \"Good Morning America.\"\n\nOwen said the zoo has grown eight different species of bamboo to suit the bears' palates.\n\n\"We give each of our pandas a choice so that they can tell us which are their favorites. And we need to balance that with what are the most nutritious species of bamboo for the bears,\" she explained.\n\nAfter snapping a stalk of bamboo in half, the pandas delicately use their teeth to remove the outside layer and eat the inner shoot, as well as the leaves and stems.\n\nBecause bamboo is relatively low in nutritional value, giant pandas consume about 40 pounds every day to meet their needs, so infants rely on mother's milk and, in some cases, panda baby formula.\n\n\"Our team worked to develop a giant panda formula that increased the success rate for giant panda cubs' survival from 5% to 95% -- a really incredible contribution,\" Owen said.\n\nTensions between the U.S. and China temporarily paused the panda lending program, but the resumption of so-called panda diplomacy is now being celebrated in both countries.\n\n\"We have so many things that we're discussing at the global political levels that we see every day in the news. What's powerful is this is something we both share priorities with, we both see the importance of wildlife conservation, we both understand it's important to the world,\" Paul Baribault, president and CEO of San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, told \"GMA.\"\n\nThe pandas are the first to enter the U.S. in over two decades, according to the zoo.\n\nBaribault previously made the announcement about the pandas' official debut last month.\n\n\"We are delighted to introduce Yun Chuan and Xin Bao to our San Diego Zoo community,\" he said in a statement at the time, via press release. \"Our newest residents will bring joy to our visitors and symbolize the enduring spirit of international conservation efforts.\"\n\nFor soon-to-be visitors who may need help differentiating the pandas, wildlife specialists said Yun Chuan has a \"long, slightly pointed, nose tip,\" and Xin Bao can be recognized by her \"large, round face and big, fluffy ears.\"\n\nSince their arrival at San Diego Zoo on June 27, Yun Chuan and Xin Bao have been put in isolation to help them get acclimated to their new environment in the newly reimagined Panda Ridge, an innovative space built as their habitat, featuring trees for climbing, a wide variety of plants, and rolling hillsides that allow the pandas to navigate and explore vertically.\n\nFor the guests who want to experience the giant pandas, the zoo is offering three options, visitors can either obtain a complimentary Giant Panda Timed Ticket on the day of their visit, join the standby line, or get an exclusive 60-minute guide called Early Morning with Pandas Walking Tour.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Xin Bao regularly lumbers up the steep hill.\n\n\"She is a very curious bear. She's done a lot of exploring on the hillside,\" noted Megan Owen, vice president of wildlife conservation science for San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance.\n\nAfter flying in from China and spending six weeks out of view, giant pandas Xin Bao and Yun Chuan will make their public debut at noon Thursday.\n\nThis is the first time since 2019 the zoo has cared for pandas, and interest is high. Tickets for morning walking tours to see the bears quickly sold out for most of August, and the mayor is warning panda watchers to be wary of traffic jams heading into Balboa Park.\n\nThe bears are in a new habitat called Panda Ridge that's four times bigger than the zoo's previous panda space. It features pools and misters to keep the bears cool and boasts rock outcroppings, lush trees and bushes inspired by Chinese forests where wild pandas roam.\n\nZoo officials say they're excited about giving visitors a chance to see pandas for the first time since they bade farewell to 6-year-old panda Xiao Liwu and his mother Bai Yun, who had lived at the zoo for 23 years.\n\nThe latest panda pair came to San Diego this summer under a 10-year research agreement with China, with the zoo paying $1 million a year in exchange for the animals. Yun Chuan and Xin Bao, who arrived at the end of June, were the first giant pandas to enter the U.S. in 21 years.\n\n\"The enthusiasm of our guests, and of San Diego for giant pandas being here again, it is just really quite heartwarming,\" Owen said Friday while giving a tour of the habitat. \"Everyone is on board with this, and they are so excited about it, so I can't wait for people to see the giant pandas.\"\n\nYun Chuan just turned 5 and Xin Bao is 4 -- they both have July birthdays. Pandas are solitary animals in the wild and are housed separately in zoos, except during the breeding season when there is a short window of ovulation. Zoo officials hope the pandas eventually will produce cubs. The first chance to try will likely be next spring or the following year, Owen said.\n\nFor now, Yun Chuan is housed in the smaller of the two habitat spaces, the one on the east side without the hill. Zoo officials say it is likely they'll rotate the two bears between the habitats later.\n\n\"Eventually males have a bigger territory naturally so that will become Yun Chuan's space\" with the hillside, said curator of mammals Nicki Boyd. She said his running up and down the hill will \"build up his muscles for breeding.\" The hill in Panda Ridge formerly was part of a habitat for takins, mammals native to China that are related to sheep and wild goats that also enjoy climbing.\n\nEach habitat area includes an air-conditioned bedroom off public view that the bears can access whenever they want. At night, the bears are moved into bedrooms in a building next door, built in 2003, that serves as the zoo's research hub for giant pandas.\n\nZoo officials say visitors have several ways they can see the pandas: They can obtain a complimentary timed ticket, join a standby line in person, or reserve an exclusive, 60-minute early morning walking tour.\n\nThe free timed tickets are set for every 15 minutes between 9:30 a.m. and 3 p.m. and can be obtained day-of at the ticket booth when admission tickets are purchased, or at various locations in the main plaza. The zoo notes on its website that standby does not guarantee \"giant panda habitat access\" and that the tickets are first come, first served. The zoo said \"thousands\" of timed tickets would be issued each day.\n\nThe walking tours are a new option for panda watchers. While zoo gates typically open at 9 a.m., the tours begin at 8:15 and 8:30. Tickets are $92 to $115 per person, depending on the day, and can be booked online or by calling (619) 718-3000.\n\nFor those unable to visit in person, there eventually will be a Panda Cam up and running at some point, providing an online window to watch the bears and their antics. It is unclear if the zoo will stream footage live or show recorded material. Owen said details are still being worked out.\n\nBoyd, the curator of mammals, said the two pandas easily settled into their new home after arriving in San Diego on June 27. \"They've exceeded all my expectations with acclimation,\" she said.\n\nThe pandas are closely monitored, with zoo employees noting how much they're eating and how they're spending their time. Those observations are important, Owen said.\n\n\"When they are doing well they are active and exploring, they are resting comfortably in the afternoons, they are eating well and just exhibiting behaviors that reflect a happy bear,\" she said.\n\nEach bear has a distinct personality. Yun Chuan is laid back, easygoing and loves his bamboo.\n\nHe ate during the entire flight to San Diego, Owen said, \"which is a sign of comfort, that's a really good sign. So he transitions well.\"\n\nXin Bao, who is the smaller of the two, is smart and curious and likes to check out everything around her. \"She is just very engaged in her environment,\" Owen said. \"She wants to know. She's always looking around.\"\n\nOn Friday, Xin Bao could be seen scrambling up the hill, taking a dip in her pool and sitting and sorting through a pile of bamboo, picking out stalks she wanted to eat and gathering up handfuls of leaves to munch on.\n\nPandas eat up to 40 pounds of locally grown bamboo a day and are fed three times daily, with more bamboo left out in their off-exhibit bedroom areas at night, in case they want a midnight snack.\n\nThe zoo has a long history of caring for pandas. Pandas first came to the San Diego Zoo in 1987 under an exhibition loan and returned in 1996 under a conservation agreement focused on improving panda reproduction. That program resulted in six cubs being born and scientists helped develop techniques credited with keeping nursery-reared cubs alive, including creating panda-milk formula. The zoo also orchestrated the first successful artificial insemination of a giant panda outside of China.\n\nThe zoo had to secure an import permit from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service before bringing the pandas into the country. In its application, the zoo broadly outlined conservation research it plans to undertake over the next decade, seeking to help captive pandas as well as those in the wild.\n\nPandas were long considered endangered in the wild, but gains in panda health and forest protection prompted their status to be upgraded to vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature in 2016.\n\nZoo officials say giant pandas embody the important conservation mission -- and they hope those who see the bears will embrace the need to protect animals and their natural habitats. The only pandas in the U.S. right now are at Zoo Atlanta, but Chinese officials have signed agreements to send panda pairs to the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., and the San Francisco Zoo, which has never had pandas.\n\nZoo officials didn't respond to questions about how much the pandas might boost their August attendance. When a panda pair came to San Diego for a 200-day stay in 1987, they drew upwards of 2 million visitors, according to the zoo.\n\nMayor Todd Gloria this week urged residents to visit and welcome the pandas, but to consider taking public transit or using ride-share services. Motorists should expect heavy traffic on Park Boulevard and around Balboa Park on Thursday and Friday and for the next several weekends, city officials said.", "source": {"uri": "sandiegouniontribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San Diego Union-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "karen_kucher@sandiegouniontribune.com", "name": "Karen Kucher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_panda", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Giant panda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Habitat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Zoo_Wildlife_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiao_Liwu", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xiao Liwu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bai_Yun", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bai Yun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Zoo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Zoo"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamboo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bamboo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife_conservation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wildlife conservation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rock (geology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Curator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_congestion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Traffic congestion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Takin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_goat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wild goat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ovulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balboa_Park_(San_Diego)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Balboa Park (San Diego)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheep", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sheep"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Air conditioning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoo_Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zoo Atlanta"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Zoo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Zoo"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Gloria", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Todd Gloria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Zoological_Park_(United_States)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Zoological Park (United States)"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Zoology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Zoology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal Welfare", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Reptiles_and_Amphibians", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Reptiles and Amphibians", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Exotic", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Exotic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Animals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/sut-l-zoo-pandas-001a.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796530", "eventUri": "eng-9796530", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 4392, "textEnd": 4399}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 223, "relevance": 1}

Newsom says 'It's panda-mania'", "body": "The San Diego Zoo previewed their new Panda Ridge to the public, debuting the first giant panda pair to enter the U.S. in 21 years.\n\nA pair of giant pandas that arrived in San Diego from China a little more than a month ago have finally debuted and are now on display for the public at San Diego Zoo.\n\nYun Chuan (yoon chu-an) and Xin Bao (sing bao), who are the first pandas to enter the United States in 21 years, as per San Diego Zoo, and their new home Panda Ridge, was unveiled to the public in a grand ceremony Thursday that also had California Governor Gavin Newsom in attendance.\n\n\"There's nothing I enjoy more than watching the press report on pandas, the Penn Domain. That's right, Bob, it's panda-mania here in San Diego,\" Newsom said addressing the crowd.\n\nHe added the arrival of the giant pandas \"was something much deeper, much richer than just the two beautiful pandas we celebrate.\"\n\n\"It is about understanding,\" Newsom said. \"It's about celebrating our common humanity. It is about celebrating the things that bind us together.\"\n\nSan Diego Mayor Todd Gloria said he was very glad to have the pandas here.\n\n\"To Yun Chuan and Xin Bao our newest furriest cutest San Diego. We are so glad to have them here. I cannot wait for San Diego to see these two magnificent creatures,\" Gloria said.\n\nA mural specially designed for this occasion by world-renowned artist, activist and OBEY clothing founder Shepard Fairey was also unveiled and put on display during the event.\n\nSince their arrival in late June, Yun Chuan and Xin Bao have been acclimating to their home in the newly reimagined Panda Ridge, an \"innovative space is four times larger than the San Diego Zoo's previous panda habitat.\" The new enclosure is inspired by \"famous geological formations in China, emulating mountains, canyons, and cliffs,\" and the pandas' native habitats in China's Sichuan, Gansu and Shaanxi provinces San Diego Zoo said, adding that it features \"new shade trees for climbing, a diverse array of plants, and rolling hillsides that allow Yun Chuan and Xin Bao to navigate and explore vertically.\"\n\nGet to know Xin Bao and Yun Chuan\n\nXin Bao (pronounced sin bao) is a 4-year-old female, and the zoo describes her as active, alert and witty, adding that she is superb climber. Xin Bao's name means \"new treasure of prosperity and abundance,\" according to the San Diego Zoo.\n\nThe zoo said guests may be able to spot Xin Bao pretty easily due to her large, round face and big ears that give her a unique look.\n\nYun Chuan (pronounced yoon chu-ahn), who is almost five years old, has familial ties to the San Diego Zoo. His maternal grandmother, Bai Yun, as well as his grandfather, Gao Gao, both stayed at the San Diego Zoo in the early 2000s. His mother, Zhen Zhen, was born at the zoo in 2007.\n\nYun Chuan name means \"cloud\" and \"big river,\" alluding to the place in China he's from - Sichuan, according to the San Diego Zoo. Altogether, his name means \"big river of cloud,\" a reminder of the \"flowing clouds that often shroud the forests where giant pandas live in the mountains of southwestern China,\" the zoo said.\n\nHe can be easily identified by his long, pointy nose, the zoo said.\n\nHow many pandas are coming to US zoos?\n\nYun Chuan and Xin Bao are not the only giant pandas who will be coming to the U.S.\n\nIn May, the Smithsonian National Zoo said it will get one male and one female panda from China sometime before the end of 2024. The 2-year-old male, Bao Li, is the grandson of Tian Tian and Mei Xiang, the two pandas who left the National Zoo to return to China in November. The female, Qing Bao, is also 2 years old.\n\nSan Francisco zoogoers also celebrated in April, when the city's zoo said it will get two more pandas from China sometime in 2025.\n\nContributing: Claire

He's really comfortable in his habitat. He explores, and he's curious,\" Dr. Megan Owen, VP of Wildlife and Conservation Science for the San Diego Zoo, told \"Good Morning America.\"\n\nOwen said the zoo has grown eight different species of bamboo to suit the bears' palates.\n\n\"We give each of our pandas a choice so that they can tell us which are their favorites. And we need to balance that with what are the most nutritious species of bamboo for the bears,\" she explained.\n\nAfter snapping a stalk of bamboo in half, the pandas delicately use their teeth to remove the outside layer and eat the inner shoot, as well as the leaves and stems.\n\nBecause bamboo is relatively low in nutritional value, giant pandas consume about 40 pounds every day to meet their needs, so infants rely on mother's milk and, in some cases, panda baby formula.\n\n\"Our team worked to develop a giant panda formula that increased the success rate for giant panda cubs' survival from 5% to 95% -- a really incredible contribution,\" Owen said.\n\nTensions between the U.S. and China temporarily paused the panda lending program, but the resumption of so-called panda diplomacy is now being celebrated in both countries.\n\n\"We have so many things that we're discussing at the global political levels that we see every day in the news. What's powerful is this is something we both share priorities with, we both see the importance of wildlife conservation, we both understand it's important to the world,\" Paul Baribault, president and CEO of San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, told \"GMA.\"\n\nThe pandas are the first to enter the U.S. in over two decades, according to the zoo.\n\nBaribault previously made the announcement about the pandas' official debut last month.\n\n\"We are delighted to introduce Yun Chuan and Xin Bao to our San Diego Zoo community,\" he said in a statement at the time, via press release. \"Our newest residents will bring joy to our visitors and symbolize the enduring spirit of international conservation efforts.\"\n\nFor soon-to-be visitors who may need help differentiating the pandas, wildlife specialists said Yun Chuan has a \"long, slightly pointed, nose tip,\" and Xin Bao can be recognized by her \"large, round face and big, fluffy ears.\"\n\nSince their arrival at San Diego Zoo on June 27, Yun Chuan and Xin Bao have been put in isolation to help them get acclimated to their new environment in the newly reimagined Panda Ridge, an innovative space built as their habitat, featuring trees for climbing, a wide variety of plants, and rolling hillsides that allow the pandas to navigate and explore vertically.\n\nFor the guests who want to experience the giant pandas, the zoo is offering three options, visitors can either obtain a complimentary Giant Panda Timed Ticket on the day of their visit, join the standby line or get an exclusive 60-minute guide called Early Morning with Pandas Walking Tour.", "source": {"uri": "abcnews.go.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Zoo", "type":

Newsom says 'It's panda-mania'", "body": "A pair of giant pandas that arrived in San Diego from China a little more than a month ago have finally debuted and are now on display for the public at San Diego Zoo.\n\nYun Chuan (yoon chu-an) and Xin Bao (sing bao), who are the first pandas to enter the United States in 21 years, as per San Diego Zoo, and their new home Panda Ridge, was unveiled to the public in a grand ceremony Thursday that also had California Governor Gavin Newsom in attendance.\n\n\"There's nothing I enjoy more than watching the press report on pandas, the Penn Domain. That's right, Bob, it's panda-mania here in San Diego,\" Newsom said addressing the crowd.\n\nHe added the arrival of the giant pandas \"was something much deeper, much richer than just the two beautiful pandas we celebrate.\"\n\n\"It is about understanding,\" Newsom said. \"It's about celebrating our common humanity. It is about celebrating the things that bind us together.\"\n\nSan Diego Mayor Todd Gloria said he was very glad to have the pandas here.\n\n\"To Yun Chuan and Xin Bao our newest furriest cutest San Diego. We are so glad to have them here. I cannot wait for San Diego to see these two magnificent creatures,\" Gloria said.\n\nA mural specially designed for this occasion by world-renowned artist, activist and OBEY clothing founder Shepard Fairey was also unveiled and put on display during the event.\n\nSince their arrival in late June, Yun Chuan and Xin Bao have been acclimating to their home in the newly reimagined Panda Ridge, an \"innovative space is four times larger than the San Diego Zoo's previous panda habitat.\" The new enclosure is inspired by \"famous geological formations in China, emulating mountains, canyons, and cliffs,\" and the pandas' native habitats in China's Sichuan, Gansu and Shaanxi provinces San Diego Zoo said, adding that it features \"new shade trees for climbing, a diverse array of plants, and rolling hillsides that allow Yun Chuan and Xin Bao to navigate and explore vertically.\"\n\nXin Bao (pronounced sin bao) is a 4-year-old female, and the zoo describes her as active, alert and witty, adding that she is superb climber. Xin Bao's name means \"new treasure of prosperity and abundance,\" according to the San Diego Zoo.\n\nThe zoo said guests may be able to spot Xin Bao pretty easily due to her large, round face and big ears that give her a unique look.\n\nYun Chuan (pronounced yoon chu-ahn), who is almost five years old, has familial ties to the San Diego Zoo. His maternal grandmother, Bai Yun, as well as his grandfather, Gao Gao, both stayed at the San Diego Zoo in the early 2000s. His mother, Zhen Zhen, was born at the zoo in 2007.\n\nYun Chuan name means \"cloud\" and \"big river,\" alluding to the place in China he's from - Sichuan, according to the San Diego Zoo. Altogether, his name means \"big river of cloud,\" a reminder of the \"flowing clouds that often shroud the forests where giant pandas live in the mountains of southwestern China,\" the zoo said.\n\nHe can be easily identified by his long, pointy nose, the zoo said.\n\nSan Diego is offering three ways for guests to experience giant pandas:\n\nYun Chuan and Xin Bao are not the only giant pandas who will be coming to the U.S.\n\nIn May, the Smithsonian National Zoo said it will get one male and one female panda from China sometime before the end of 2024. The 2-year-old male, Bao Li, is the grandson of Tian Tian and Mei Xiang, the two pandas who left the National Zoo to return to China in November. The female, Qing Bao, is also 2 years old.\n\nSan Francisco zoogoers also celebrated in April, when the city's zoo said it will get two more pandas from China sometime in 2025.\n\nContributing: Claire Thornton, Saleen Martin, USA TODAY\n\nSaman Shafiq is a trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

The zoo held a grand ceremony to welcome the pandas, during which officials also opened their new habitat to the public. The event was attended by China's Ambassador to the United States, Xie Feng, California Governor Gavin Newsom, and the Mayor of San Diego, among other dignitaries. The debut of these pandas was widely seen as a symbol not only of their endearing nature but also of unity and goodwill.\n\nYun Chuan, four years old, and Xin Bao, three years old, were born at the Wolong Shenshuping Panda Base in Sichuan, China. Since arriving in Los Angeles on June 27, they have gradually adapted to their new home -- a 6,000-square-foot private habitat known as \"Panda Ridge.\" This marks the first time in over two decades that China has sent giant pandas to the United States. According to the zoo, Yun Chuan is recognized for his \"long, pointy nose,\" while Xin Bao is beloved for her \"large, round face and big, fluffy ears.\"\n\nSan Diego Zoo staff have meticulously designed a new environment for the pandas to ensure their health and comfort. The arrival of these pandas has garnered widespread attention, with many animal enthusiasts eagerly visiting to catch a glimpse of the zoo's adorable new residents. The pandas' presence reestablishes the San Diego Zoo as a vital bridge for cultural exchange and friendship between China and the United States.\n\nDuring the ceremony, Ambassador Xie Feng shared a humorous story: \"Two young panda fans from California wrote to me, proposing to trade grizzly bears for pandas. I'm delighted to tell them that after eight months of joint efforts, we have finally brought Yun Chuan and Xin Bao to San Diego. Your dreams have come true, without having to give us grizzly bears,\" his joke eliciting laughter from the audience.\n\nAmbassador Xie further emphasized, \"California has not only welcomed the pandas warmly but has also led the way in fostering friendly exchanges and cooperation with China.\" He expressed hope that the pandas' arrival would inject new energy into China-California exchanges and contribute to stabilizing the broader bilateral relationship.\n\nGovernor Gavin Newsom echoed the ambassador's sentiments, highlighting the deeper significance behind the celebration. \"This is not just about two pandas,\" Newsom said. \"It's about exchange, understanding, and something much deeper and richer than the event itself. It's about celebrating our shared humanity.\"\n\nNewsom praised the pandas' arrival as a moment of pride and excitement, underscoring California's commitment to global animal conservation. He declared August 8 as \"California Panda Day\" in honor of Yun Chuan and Xin Bao's debut, stating, \"Giant pandas are beloved worldwide, and their conservation story is an inspiring example of strong partnerships and innovative strategies to protect our natural heritage.\"\n\nThis new habitat, \"Panda Ridge,\" reflects the sweeping landscapes of China's Sichuan, Gansu, and Shaanxi provinces. Four times larger than the zoo's previous panda habitat, this reimagined space features shade trees for climbing and rolling hillsides for the pandas to explore. The habitat aims to recreate an environment similar to their native surroundings, ensuring that Yun Chuan and Xin Bao can thrive in their new home.\n\nThe pandas' arrival fulfills a promise made by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi earlier this year to send giant pandas to the U.S. by the end of the year. The first pair of giant pandas arrived in the U.S. in 1972 at the Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington, D.C., following President Richard Nixon's historic diplomatic visit to China. This new chapter continues the legacy of panda diplomacy, strengthening the cultural ties and friendship between the two nations.", "source": {"uri": "lapost.us", "dataType": "news", "title":

For decades, China has sent pandas to zoos around the world, generally on limited loans, as a diplomatic tool to build alliances and goodwill. But relations between the two nations have soured in recent years. The last time China sent pandas to the United States was to the Memphis Zoo in 2003, and the National Zoo's famous pandas were recalled to China last year.\n\nThe new pair of pandas, who hail from the Wolong Shenshuping Panda Base in Sichuan province, landed in the United States in late June following a farewell ceremony in China. They were hidden from the public for several weeks as they acclimated to their new homes: a brand-new habitat that the zoo touts as four times larger than its previous panda enclosure.\n\nYun Chuan's mother, Zhen Zhen, was born at the San Diego Zoo in 2007, and his grandmother Bai Yun was a mainstay of the zoo from her arrival in 1996 until her return to China in 2019.\n\nTo mark the pandas' debut, Gov. Gavin Newsom declared Aug. 8 as California Panda Day.\n\n\"This is about something much deeper, much richer than just the two beautiful pandas we celebrate,\" Newsom said at the ceremony. \"It's about celebrating our common humanity.\"\n\nYun Chuan and Xin Bao arrived as leases on America's pandas began to expire. The Smithsonian's National Zoo returned Mei Xiang, Tian Tian and their son Xiao Qi Ji in November, and Zoo Atlanta in Georgia is set to return its four pandas this year, which would have left the country with no remaining pandas.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping acknowledged how beloved the National Zoo's pandas were as he announced plans to send new pandas to the United States during a speech in San Francisco in November. In May, the National Zoo announced it also will receive a new pair of pandas this year.\n\nLei Guang, executive director of the 21st Century China Center at the University of California at San Diego, cautioned that people shouldn't attach too much political or diplomatic significance to the animals. \"The return of giant pandas is a positive development in what is otherwise still a bleak relationship between the U.S. and China.\"\n\nInstead, he saw the pandas as the symbol of what is possible when the two countries cooperate, allowing researchers to study the animals and work on their conservation. The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists the giant panda as vulnerable to extinction.\n\nAt the welcome ceremony, Chinese Ambassador Xie Feng jokingly recalled letters he received from two young panda fans from California proposing that California could send its grizzly bears to China in exchange for pandas.\n\n\"Your dream has come true,\" Xie said, \"even without giving us grizzly bears.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_panda", "type": "wiki",

He is the son of Zhen Zhen, who was born at the San Diego Zoo in 2007 to parents Bai Yun and Gao Gao. The first character of his name, Yun, is a nod to his grandmother Bai Yun, who lived at the San Diego Zoo for 23 years.\n\nXin Bao is a nearly 4-year-old female and is described by the Zoo as a \"gentle and witty introvert with a sweet round face and big ears.\" Her name means a \"new treasure of prosperity and abundance.\"\n\nSan Diego Zoo was the first zoo in the United States to have a cooperative panda conservation program.\n\n\"That practice has evolved to reflect shifting domestic and international circumstances,\" the report read. \"The panda has become a diplomatic symbol for China, and serves to soften its authoritarian image.\"\n\nChina first sent giant pandas to the U.S. in 1972 -- to the National Zoo in Washington D.C. -- after President Richard Nixon's visit to the country that year.\n\nIn the decade that followed, gifting giant pandas became China's standard practice when forming diplomatic relationships with other countries.\n\nIn 1984, Beijing stopped gifting giant pandas for free and started a commercial rental model instead, leasing the animals to foreign zoos for short-term exhibitions.\n\nStarting in late 1999, the short-term leasing model was replaced by long-term \"collaborative research project\" leases, usually for 10 years, that are renewable. If a panda gives birth to a cub, the annual rent would increase, and the cub would be returned to China at 3 or 4 years old.\n\nAccording to the same report, hosting institutions typically pay China an annual fee of $1 million per pair of pandas.\n\nConservation efforts have helped preserve giant pandas by increasing the population from fewer than 1,000 to more than 1,800 in the wild and captivity, prompting the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List to downgrade the species from \"endangered\" to \"vulnerable\" in 2021.\n\nIn 2019, amid the intensified trade war between the United States and China, giant panda Bai Yun and its cub Xiao Liwu were taken back to China from the San Diego Zoo. Until May 2024, only four giant pandas were left in the U.S. at the Atlanta Zoo. However, at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit (APEC) in San Francisco last November, Chinese leader Xi Jinping signaled Beijing may send more sets of pandas to the U.S.\n\nSan Diego mayor Todd Gloria welcomed the new furry residents by visiting China back in June to participate in a send-off ceremony for Yun Chuan and Xin Bao before they flew to their new home at the San Diego Zoo.",

I recognize that they symbolize hope and the promise of working together for peace and for harmony.\"\n\nThe mayor remarked that it was a great day for his city, and he \"could not be prouder to be here to celebrate the grand opening of Panda Ridge, the new home to our newest San Diegans, Yun Chuan and Xin Bao.\"\n\n\"Our giant panda work inspires countless people and reinforces a longstanding tradition of collaboration between California and China,\" said Paul Baribault, president and CEO of the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, adding that \"Giant pandas can unite us. They remind us transformative change is possible when we come together for wildlife, for conservation, and for people. We are more interconnected than ever before.\"\n\nThe San Diego Zoo is one of the most visited zoos in the United States. Located in Balboa Park, it is home to over 12,000 animals representing over 680 species and subspecies.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom and Chinese Ambassador to the United States Xie Feng also attended the Panda Ridge opening ceremony.\n\nNewsom told Xinhua that he believes in the opportunity these pandas provide to further peace.\n\n\"We're all in this together,\" said Newsom. \"It is about people to people, not just panda to panda.\"\n\nThe governor, who on Wednesday proclaimed Aug. 8 as California Panda Day, noted in his speech that the new pandas were about \"celebrating our common humanity\" and \"celebrating the things that bind us together.\"\n\nXie Feng pointed out that California has a special bond with giant pandas, and the San Diego Zoo is the first U.S. institution to cooperate with China on panda conservation.\n\n\"The arrival of Yun Chuan and Xin Bao as we celebrate the 45th anniversary of our diplomatic ties has sent a clear and important message: China-U.S. cooperation on panda conservation will not cease, our people-to-people exchanges and subnational cooperation will not stop, and once opened, the door of China-U.S. friendship will not be

I recognize that they symbolize hope and the promise of working together for peace and for harmony.\"\n\nThe mayor remarked that it was a great day for his city, and he \"could not be prouder to be here to celebrate the grand opening of Panda Ridge, the new home to our newest San Diegans, Yun Chuan and Xin Bao.\"\n\n\"Our giant panda work inspires countless people and reinforces a longstanding tradition of collaboration between California and China,\" said Paul Baribault, president and CEO of the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, adding that \"Giant pandas can unite us. They remind us transformative change is possible when we come together for wildlife, for conservation, and for people. We are more interconnected than ever before.\"\n\nThe San Diego Zoo is one of the most visited zoos in the United States. Located in Balboa Park, it is home to over 12,000 animals representing over 680 species and subspecies.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom and Chinese Ambassador to the United States Xie Feng also attended the Panda Ridge opening ceremony.\n\nNewsom told Xinhua that he believes in the opportunity these pandas provide to further peace.\n\n\"We're all in this together,\" said Newsom. \"It is about people to people, not just panda to panda.\"\n\nThe governor, who on Wednesday proclaimed Aug. 8 as California Panda Day, noted in his speech that the new pandas were about \"celebrating our common humanity\" and \"celebrating the things that bind us together.\"\n\nXie Feng pointed out that California has a special bond with giant pandas, and the San Diego Zoo is the first U.S. institution to cooperate with China on panda conservation.\n\n\"The arrival of Yun Chuan and Xin Bao as we celebrate the 45th anniversary of our diplomatic ties has sent a clear and important message: China-U.S. cooperation on panda conservation will not cease, our people-to-people exchanges and subnational cooperation will not stop, and once opened, the door of China-U.S. friendship will not be shut again,\" said the ambassador.\n\nThe ambassador noted that the \"story of our panda conservation cooperation is also a most vivid example of our two peoples reaching out to each other.\" \u25a0",

Gavin Newsom proclaimed Thursday as California Panda Day.\n\nHe issued a proclamation that says, in part: \"The bear has long held pride of place in California as a symbol of our state's spirit and strength, from our state flag and seal to its enduring significance for Native American tribes across the state. This week, California is proud to celebrate another iconic bear as a pair of giant pandas make their public debut at the San Diego Zoo.\"\n\nChina recalled almost all its pandas on loan to U.S. zoos around five years ago, after relations between the countries chilled. But cooperation between China and the U.S. led to the possibility of pandas returning to U.S. zoos, including San Diego's.\n\nNow that possibility has become a reality.\n\nAccording to a San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance statement, Yun Chuan is nearly 5 years old and is mild-mannered, gentle and lovable. He's the son of Zhen Zhen (pronounced jen jen), who was born at the San Diego Zoo in 2007 to parents Bai Yun (pronounced bye yoon) and Gao Gao (pronounced gow gow). The first character of his name, \"Yun,\" is a nod to his grandmother, Bai Yun, who lived at the San Diego Zoo for 23 years.\n\nXin Bao is a nearly 4-year-old female described as a \"gentle and witty introvert with a sweet round face and big ears.\" Her name means a \"new treasure of prosperity and abundance.\"\n\nGuests will have several options to see the zoo's newest stars, including:\n\n-- obtaining a free giant panda timed ticket by scanning QR codes located on signs posted throughout the zoo, selecting an available time, and heading to the Timed Ticket line at Panda Ridge at the designated time;\n\n-- joining a standby line beginning at 9:30 a.m.;\n\n-- securing advance reservations for an exclusive 60-minute Early Morning with Pandas Walking Tour, before the zoo opens to guests for the day.\n\nPanda Ridge is described as an \"expansive and multidimensional experience ... inspired by famous geological formations in China, emulating the mountainous forest ecosystems where giant pandas thrive while immersing you into their world,\" according to Erika Kohler, the San Diego Zoo's senior vice president and executive director.\n\nYun Chuan and Xin Bao arrived in San Diego in late June and have spent the last several weeks acclimating to the zoo and their new habitat.\n\n\"For 30 years, we've worked alongside our Chinese conservation partners to save, protect and care for giant pandas and their ecosystems,\" Kohler said. \"And now we have the opportunity to continue caring for and conserving these incredible bears as we expand on our transformative work to secure a future for their species.\"\n\nSan Diego's was the first zoo in the U.S. to have a cooperative panda conservation program.\n\nThere is typically a $1 million-per-year fee paid by zoos for two pandas, and the money is used for China's conservation efforts, according to a 2022 report by America's Congressional Research Service.\n\nChina first gifted the U.S. with pandas in 1972, when two were sent to the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. Part of the goal in loaning pandas to zoos in the U.S. was to help breed cubs and boost the population.\n\nConservation efforts have saved the giant pandas from extinction by increasing the population from fewer than 1,000 to more than 1,800 in the wild and captivity, causing the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List to downgrade the giant panda from Endangered to Vulnerable in 2021.\n\nIn addition to giant crowds, San Diego's giant pandas are expected to draw heavy traffic around the zoo. The city says it's ready.\n\nTo help ease traffic, people visiting the zoo can take a free shuttle that will pick up and drop off at the Inspiration Point parking lot, where parking is free.\n\nPublic transit is recommended, with bus lanes along Park Boulevard allowing buses to travel more easily. In addition, the Metropolitan Transit System's Rapid 215 and Route 7 provide direct access to the zoo. On weekends, two children 12 and under ride for free, no pass required, with every paying adult.\n\n\"The debut of Yun Chuan and Xin Bao has become the talk of the town among panda lovers in San Diego and Southern California, and MTS is ready to take visitors right to the doorstep of the San Diego Zoo,\" said Stephen Whitburn, MTS board chair and San Diego City Councilman.\n\n\"With thousands of visitors expected to flock to the zoo over the course of the next few weeks, the easiest and quickest way to get to Panda Ridge is by taking public transit.\"\n\nAdditionally, \"dedicated bike lanes and high-visibility crosswalks on Park Boulevard provide a safe, convenient option for pedestrians and people on bicycles or mobility devices,\" a city statement said.", "source": {"uri": "kpbs.org",

Here's how", "body": "The San Diego Zoo is offering three ways to experience the giant pandas\n\nThe day has finally arrived. San Diegans can finally greet two giant pandas at the San Diego Zoo.\n\nPomp and circumstance surrounded the public debut of Yun Chuan and Xin Bao, the first pandas to enter the U.S. in 21 years. The kick-off ceremony Wednesday was set to be attended by local officials and other dignitaries, including California Gov. Gavin Newsom and First Partner Jennifer Siebel Newsom.\n\nYun Chuan and Xin Bao arrived in San Diego back in June and have since been acclimating to their home in the newly renovated habitat: Panda Ridge.\n\nPanda Ridge will open to the public at noon on Thursday.\n\nThe zoo describes Panda Ridge as \"four times larger than the San Diego Zoo's previous panda habitat and is inspired by famous geological formations in China, emulating mountains, canyons, and cliffs.\" Panda Ridge also features new shade trees for climbing, a diverse array of plants, and rolling hillsides that allow Yun Chuan and Xin Bao to navigate and explore vertically.\n\nYun Chuan is nearly 5 years old and is described as mild-mannered, gentle and lovable. He is the son of Zhen Zhen (pronounced jen jen) who was born at the San Diego Zoo in 2007 to parents Bai Yun (pronounced bye yoon) and Gao Gao (pronounced gow gow). The first character of his name, \"Yun,\" is a nod to his grandmother Bai Yun, who lived at the San Diego Zoo for 23 years, according to the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance. The second part of his name, \"Chuan,\" means \"big river,\" and is a nod to the province of Sichuan, where he's from.\n\nXin Bao is a nearly 4-year-old female who is described as a \"gentle and witty introvert with a sweet round face and big ears,\" according to a zoo statement. Her name means a \"new treasure of prosperity and abundance.\"\n\nThe San Diego Zoo offers three ways to experience the giant pandas at the zoo.\n\nTimed Tickets:\n\nWhen you arrive at the zoo, you can scan the ticket QR code on signs located throughout the zoo, select an available time and then head to the timed ticket line at the Panda Ridge at your designated time. You can also request help at any admission booths for the time tickets.\n\nStandby line:\n\nNo ticket is needed to join the standby line at the Panda Ridge. You can start making line anytime from 9:30 a.m. until the giant pandas are off exhibit or the zoo closes.\n\nEarly morning pandas walking tour:\n\nThe 60-minute early morning tour is where an expert guide will lead you to exclusive viewings of the giant pandas. The tour is available at an additional cost of $92+ a person and is not included with admission. All tour participants require a ticket, regardless of age. The tours are scheduled to start at 8:15 a.m.\n\nFor more details on how to visit the pandas, click here.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom proclaimed California Panda Day on Thursday for the panda's public debut.\n\nThe proclamation reads in part \"As the San Diego Zoo welcomes visitors to Panda Ridge this week, I encourage Californians to take this unique opportunity to appreciate one of the most iconic wildlife species and recognize the important partnerships at work to help them thrive for generations to come.\"\n\nThe City of San Diego alerted residents and tourists about the potential increased traffic around Balboa Park starting Thursday and the remainder of August.\n\nPeople visiting the San Diego Zoo can take advantage of a free shuttle that will pick up and drop off at the Inspiration Point parking lot where parking is free. Additionally, public transportation is recommended, with bus lanes along Park Boulevard allowing buses to travel more easily, and Rapid 215 and Route 7 provide direct access to the San Diego Zoo.", "source": {"uri": "nbcsandiego.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC 7 San Diego"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Zoo", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Zoo"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_panda", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Giant panda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Habitat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Siebel_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Siebel Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bai_Yun", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bai Yun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canyon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canyon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cliff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Zoo_Wildlife_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gao_Gao", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gao Gao"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sichuan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sichuan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_5_in_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interstate 5 in California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balboa_Park_(San_Diego)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Balboa Park (San Diego)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wildlife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bus"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Zoology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Zoology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Wildlife", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Wildlife", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Animal_Sports/Bullfighting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Animal Sports/Bullfighting", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.nbcsandiego.com/2024/08/image-37-1.png?resize=1200%2C675&quality=85&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796530", "eventUri": "eng-9796530", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 218, "relevance": 1}

Members of the media were able to take photos of the the fluffy black-and-white animals eating bamboo and tumbling around in their new home early on Wednesday.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom proclaimed Aug. 8, 2024, as \"California Panda Day\" and said the arrival of the pandas is \"part of California and China's long history of working together toward shared goals.\"\n\nWhile stateside, Yun Chuan -- whose parent, Zhen Zhen, was born at the San Diego Zoo in 2007 -- and Xin Bao will live in the zoo's Panda Ridge area. Zoo representatives say the habitat has been newly renovated and is four times Its previous size. \"It is inspired by famous geological formations in China, emulating mountains, canyons, and cliffs,\" according to the zoo.\n\nBefore the pandas arrived this summer, the U.S. was on the brink of having no large pandas for the first time in over 50 years. Pandas are only native to China, but the country has loaned out the beloved animals to American zoos for decades -- part of so-called \"panda diplomacy.\" The practice started in 1972, when China gave two pandas to the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. But since 2023, most of the pandas have been sent back to China or are scheduled to return this year.\n\nYet, in 2023, Chinese President Xi Jinping signaled that new pandas would be sent to the states to serve as \"envoys of friendship between the Chinese and American peoples.\"\n\n\"These pandas are of course diplomats.

Throngs of media gathered inside the zoo, while the city of San Diego warned of traffic jams ahead of the much-anticipated event Thursday.\n\nThe San Diego Zoo rolled out the red carpet for the first public showing of its newest residents, who were already dressed in black-and-white attire. The two giant pandas were seen sunbathing and chowing down on bamboo in their new home as the first pandas to enter the U.S. in two decades.\n\nFor years, the Chinese government has loaned pandas to zoos around the world in a practice called \"panda diplomacy.\" These fuzzy ambassadors have long been a symbol of the U.S.-China friendship, ever since Beijing gifted a pair of pandas to the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., in 1972.\n\nAs relations soured between the two countries, China stopped renewing panda loans to U.S. zoos, making the arrival of San Diego Zoo's newest residents a big relief to many. The city's previous pandas left in 2018 and 2019.\n\nDuring his meeting with President Joe Biden in San Francisco last November, Chinese president Xi Jinping said he was \"ready to continue our cooperation with the United States on panda conservation\" and pledged to reduce tensions between the two countries.\n\nOnly four other giant pandas currently reside in the United States, all at the zoo in Atlanta.

It's about celebrating the things that bind us together.\"\n\nUntil recently, the loan of the two pandas seemed an unlikely dream.\n\nWith fierce trade competition, and disagreements over Taiwan and human rights, tensions between China and the United States have been rising for several years - to the point that Beijing's traditional \"panda diplomacy\" seemed to have frozen.\n\nIn recent years, pandas at zoos in Washington DC, Atlanta and Memphis were all returned to Beijing, after loan agreements were not renewed.\n\nHowever, at a key summit between US President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping in November, the latter announced that Beijing would continue the program in the United States.\n\nChina's loaning of pandas around the world is both a diplomatic symbol and a way to help the survival of a vulnerable species.\n\nIn addition to San Diego, pandas are expected to return to zoos in Washington and San Francisco by 2025.\n\nChina first offered its pandas to the United States in 1972 under US President Richard Nixon.\n\nSince then, the country has used its loan of the black-and-white bears to send diplomatic messages.\n\nFor instance, after President Barack Obama met with the Dalai Lama in 2010, who is seen as a rebel by Beijing, China recalled two of its pandas.\n\nThe San Diego Zoo has enjoyed a decades-long partnership with Chinese authorities, having received two pandas in 1996 that gave birth to six cubs in captivity.\n\nAll of the pandas were returned to China in 2019, in line with earlier agreements.\n\nThe return of the pandas is not only a boon for the zoo, where their presence attracts thousands of visitors a year, but also supports the propagation of the species, which is notoriously difficult in the wild.\n\nZoo officials described four-year-old Yun Chuan as a \"mild-mannered, gentle and lovable\" male, who was named after his grandmother, Bai Yun, one of the initial two pandas loaned to San Diego.\n\nThe other panda, three-year-old female Xin Bao, is a \"gentle and witty introvert,\" zoo officials said. Her name means a \"new treasure of prosperity and abundance.\"\n\n\"We hope she will bring you good luck to California, to San Diego,\" China's ambassador to the United States Xie Feng said.",

Throngs of media gathered inside the zoo, while the city of San Diego warned of traffic jams ahead of the much-anticipated event Thursday.\n\nThe San Diego Zoo rolled out the red carpet for the first public showing of its celebrity residents, who were already dressed in black-and-white attire. The two giant pandas were seen sunbathing and chowing down on bamboo in their new home as the first pandas to enter the U.S. in two decades.\n\nFor years, the Chinese government has loaned pandas to zoos around the world in a practice called \"panda diplomacy.\" These fuzzy ambassadors have long been a symbol of the U.S.-China friendship, ever since Beijing gifted a pair of pandas to the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., in 1972.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The San Diego Zoo's previous pandas left in 2018 and 2019.\n\nThen in February, the China Wildlife Conservation Association announced it was sending two more pandas to San Diego and also signing agreements with the zoo in the Spanish capital of Madrid, quelling fears that Beijing was ending its historic panda diplomacy. San Diego's pandas arrived in June and have been acclimating to their new home before being seen by the public.\n\n\"This is about something much deeper, much richer, than just the two beautiful pandas we celebrate,\" Gov. Gavin Newsom said at the opening ceremony that included dancing, music, and remarks from Chinese ambassador Xie Feng, and other local officials. \"It's about celebrating our common humanity.\"\n\nFor the occasion, Newsom proclaimed Aug. 8 as California Panda Day and recognized the San Diego Zoo as the first organization in the U.S. to establish a cooperative panda conservation program with China.\n\nXie said he met someone on his flight who had traveled all the way from Washington, D.C., to see the pandas.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"Two little panda fans from California wrote several letters to me proposing giving China grizzly bears to get pandas,\" Xie said, eliciting laughs.\n\nOnly four other giant pandas currently reside in the United States, all at the zoo in Atlanta. However, the Smithsonian's National Zoo will receive a new pair of pandas by the end of the year after its last bears returned to China last November. As part of the loan agreement, U.S. zoos typically pay $1 million a year toward China's wildfire conservation efforts, and all cubs born in the U.S. must return to China by age 4.\n\nBoth pandas at the San Diego Zoo were born at the Wolong Shenshuping Panda Base in China's Sichuan province.\n\nYun Chuan is a nearly five-year-old male panda described by the zoo as \"mild-mannered, gentle and lovable.\" He is the grandson of Bai Yun and Gao Gao, who both lived at the San Diego Zoo for more than a decade. His mother, Zhen Zhen, was the fourth cub born at the zoo.\n\nXin Bao is a nearly four-year-old female panda described by the zoo as a \"gentle and witty introvert with a sweet round face and big ears.\"\n\n\"Her name means a treasure of prosperity and abundance, and we hope she will bring you good luck,\" Ambassador Xie said. He also spoke about China being California's top trading partner as well as the large Chinese community in the state and the abundance of Chinese tourists.\n\nAmong the pandas' biggest fans are two kids who were proudly wearing \"Panda Ridge\" t-shirts and carrying plushies at the zoo Thursday morning.\n\n\"Pandas are their favorite animals, if you could only see what our house looks like in terms of stuffed animals,\" their father James Metz said.\n\nIt was also his seven-year-old daughter's birthday, making it an extra special occasion. For weeks, the family has been eagerly watching live panda feeds from China in anticipation of the bears' arrival.\n\nYun Chuan and Xin Bao were hanging out and relaxing after eating, Metz said.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Their arrival was marked by a celebration attended by California Governor Gavin Newsom and Chinese Ambassador Xie Feng. The pandas are seen as symbols of diplomatic cooperation and cultural connection between the U.S. and China.\n\nTwo Chinese giant pandas are now California residents as their enclosure at the San Diego Zoo opened to the public on Thursday in an international ceremony.\n\nThe pandas, Yun Chuan and Xin Bao, are the first to enter the United States in 21 years and were welcomed by California Governor Gavin Newsom and the Chinese ambassador to the United States Xie Feng. Yun Chuan, a 5-year-old male, is easily recognized by his long, slightly pointed nose, while Xin Bao is a 4-year-old female with big fluffy ears; her name means a 'precious treasure of prosperity and abundance.'\n\nYun Chuan's name means 'big river of cloud.' His mother, Zhen Zhen, was born at the San Diego Zoo in 2007. The zoo is working closely with Chinese experts to help with the adaptation period and understanding of the needs of the two pandas. The pair are enjoying a variety of fresh bamboo and a local adaptation of 'wotou,' a traditional Chinese steamed corn bread also called 'panda bread.'\n\n'The arrival of Yun Chuan and Xin Bao, as we celebrate the 45th anniversary of our diplomatic ties, has sent a clear and important message,' said Ambassador Xie Feng. 'China-US cooperation on panda conservation will not cease. Our people-to-people exchanges and sub-national cooperation will not stop, and once opened, the door of China-U.S. friendship will not be shut again.'\n\nNewsom said the new pandas were about 'celebrating our common humanity. It's about celebrating the things that bind us together.' 'And so, for me, this spirit of pride that is associated with this opening today and the experience that so many will have, that we just had at Panda Ridge, is about a deeper meaning,' Newsom added.\n\nVisitors of all ages to Panda Ridge on Thursday were exuberant about the pandas' cuteness. 'I have never seen a panda before, I've only seen them on TV and nature documentaries,' said Kobi Davis from Michigan. 'They are super cute. They just kind of laze around, you know, there's charm in that.'\n\nKeena Butcher from Canada called them 'quiet, thoughtful creatures' and noted, 'we can have hope for our future if we can conserve them.' China's Communist government has long used 'panda diplomacy' to enhance the country's soft power, lending the large but cuddly-looking black-and-white bears to zoos in various countries over the decades as goodwill animal ambassadors.\n\nIn late 2023, Washington's National Zoo said goodbye to its beloved giant pandas, which were returned to China amid heightened tensions between the two global superpowers. In May this year, the National Zoo said China would send two young pandas to Washington by the end of the year.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xie_Feng_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Xie Feng (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Zoo", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Zoo"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_panda", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Giant panda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Governor of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Traditional Chinese characters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservation movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamboo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bamboo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maize", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maize"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chinese Communist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panda_diplomacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Panda diplomacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Zoological_Park_(United_States)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Zoological Park (United States)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soft power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superpower", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Superpower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Taoism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Taoism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Falun_Dafa", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Falun Dafa", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/29_05_2024_12_15_14_4578399.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796530", "eventUri": "eng-9796530", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

The city's previous pandas left in 2018 and 2019.\n\nDuring his meeting with President Joe Biden in San Francisco last November, Chinese president Xi Jinping said he was \"ready to continue our cooperation with the United States on panda conservation\" and pledged to reduce tensions between the two countries.\n\nOnly four other giant pandas currently reside in the United States, all at the zoo in Atlanta. However, the Smithsonian's National Zoo will receive a new pair of pandas by the end of the year after its last bears returned to China last November. As part of the loan agreement, U.S. zoos typically pay $1 million a year toward China's wildfire conservation efforts, and all cubs born in the U.S. must return to China by age 4.\n\nThe opening ceremony included dancing, music, and remarks from Gov, Gavin Newsom, Chinese ambassador Xie Feng, and other local officials.\n\n\"This is about something much deeper, much richer, than just the two beautiful pandas we celebrate,\" Newsom said. \"It's about celebrating our common humanity.\"\n\nFor the occasion, Newsom proclaimed Aug. 8 as California Panda Day and recognized the San Diego Zoo as the first organization in the U.S. to establish a cooperative panda conservation program with China.\n\nAmbassador Xie said he met someone on his flight who had traveled all the way from Washington, D.C., to see the pandas.\n\n\"Two little panda fans from California wrote several letters to me proposing giving China grizzly bears to get pandas,\" Xie said, eliciting laughs.\n\nBoth pandas were born at the Wolong Shenshuping Panda Base in China's Sichuan province.\n\nYun Chuan is a nearly five-year-old male panda described by the zoo as \"mild-mannered, gentle and lovable.\" He is the grandson of Bai Yun and Gao Gao, who both lived at the San Diego Zoo for more than a decade. His mother, Zhen Zhen, was the fourth cub born at the zoo.\n\nXin Bao is a nearly four-year-old female panda described by the zoo as a \"gentle and witty introvert with a sweet round face and big ears.\"\n\n\"Her name means a treasure of prosperity and abundance, and we hope she will bring you good luck,\" Ambassador Xie said. He also spoke about China being California's top trading partner as well as the large Chinese community in the state and the abundance of Chinese tourists.\n\nAmong the pandas' biggest fans are two kids who were proudly wearing \"Panda Ridge\" t-shirts and carrying plushies at the zoo Thursday morning.\n\n\"Pandas are their favorite animals, if you could only see what our house looks like in terms of stuffed animals,\" their father James Metz said.\n\nIt was also his seven-year-old daughter's birthday, making it an extra special occasion. For weeks, the family has been eagerly watching live panda feeds from China in anticipation of the bears' arrival.\n\nYun Chuan and Xin Bao were hanging out and relaxing after eating, Metz said.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

After several weeks of acclimating to their new surroundings, they made their official debut at the Zoo's Panda Ridge on Thursday.\n\nPanda Ridge has been designed to replicate the pandas' native habitat as closely as possible, offering them a comfortable and engaging space in which to live and thrive. It features lush vegetation, bamboo groves and various items to stimulate the pandas' natural behavior.\n\nYun Chuan prefers to rest lazily on the climbing frames, while Xin Bao, the smaller of the two, is smart and curious, making the most of her opportunities to explore everything around her.\n\nTogether, the two pandas consume up to 18 kilograms of locally grown bamboo each day.\n\nAt an exclusive media preview on Wednesday, hundreds of panda enthusiasts got a sneak peek at the pandas. Many expressed their excitement about the return of pandas to the zoo, noting that they are an integral part of San Diego's history.\n\n\"We felt really sad, the whole city was sad when the pandas left,\" said zoo visitor Sheron Natalie. \"We waited and waited, and finally they came back. We are so happy.\"\n\nJessica Chenoweth was likewise enthusiastic. \"They're now coming back. It feels like this is their family's home, and I can't wait to bring my son later to see them firsthand,\" she said.\n\nAdriana Sanchez, a website operator from Mexico, said she will promote the pandas on her site, which has 13,000 followers who are mothers. \"We have a song about pandas, and we all love to sing it in Mexico City,\" she said.\n\nA visitor identified only as Noreen said that the pandas \"represent a real sense of peace. That panda right there is a signal of diplomacy between the United States and China. We hope it's a good beginning to bring them back together.\"\n\nSan Diego Mayor Todd Gloria, who visited China in June to participate in farewell ceremonies for the panda pair before they began their journey to the US, said that Yun Chuan and Xin Bao symbolize the enduring friendship between the two countries.\n\nSince the arrival of the pair, the San Diego Zoo has collaborated with Chinese experts to meet the pandas' dietary needs and preferences. Veterinary teams from both the US and China are closely monitoring various health factors, including weight and appetite, to ensure that the pandas thrive.\n\nStaff members have provided the pandas with a variety of fresh bamboo, along with a local adaptation of a traditional Chinese bun called \"panda bread\".\n\nPandas are solitary animals in the wild and are housed separately in zoos, except during the brief breeding season. San Diego Zoo officials hope the pandas will eventually produce cubs, with the first opportunity likely to occur next spring or the following year.", "source": {"uri": "chinadaily.com.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "China Daily"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_panda", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Giant panda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Zoo", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Zoo"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_biology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservation biology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamboo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bamboo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate change mitigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vegetation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_San_Diego", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of San Diego"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Gloria", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Todd Gloria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Traditional Chinese characters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diplomacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mexico City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mexico City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle_Choices", "label": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle Choices", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Falun_Dafa", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Falun Dafa", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 58}], "image": "http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202408/08/66b4e56fa3104e74e4a73b8f.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796530", "eventUri": "eng-9796530", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4980392156862745, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

Gavin Newsom as California Panda Day as he welcomed \"envoys of friendship\" from China.\n\nThe older panda, Yun Chuan (pronounced \"yoon chu-an,\" according to the zoo), is a male who is nearly 5 years old.\n\n\"His mother Zhen Zhen was born in 2007 and was the fourth cub born at the San Diego Zoo. He's identifiable by his long, slightly pointed nose,\" the zoo said.\n\nXin Bao (pronounced \"sing bao\"), a female, is almost 4. Her distinguishing features include a \"large, round face and big, fluffy ears,\" the zoo said.\n\nThey're the first pandas to come to the United States in 21 years.\n\nPeople wanting to visit the zoo on Thursday should expect \"giant crowds, and heavy traffic,\" according to NPR member station KPBS.\n\nThe zoo said that in addition to a standby line that opened hours before the exhibit, it would issue complimentary timed tickets to see the pandas. The zoo also offers a one-hour early-morning walking tour focusing on the animals, with a price starting at $92.\n\nThe San Diego Zoo has a long history of housing pandas, but it recently went five years without the well-loved animal after its last two pandas, Bai Yun and Xiao Liwu, were removed from their home in Panda Canyon in the spring of 2019.\n\nThe Smithsonian's National Zoo in Washington, D.C., also said farewell to its pandas last November, in what struck many local fans as an abrupt departure.

Those loans were often extended, but the deals have shown the strain of U.S.-China relations in recent years.\n\nIn 2016, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature changed how it designates giant pandas on its list of threatened species, classifying them as \"vulnerable\" to extinction rather than endangered.", "source": {"uri": "kpbs.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "KPBS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bill_chappell@kpbs.org", "name": "Bill Chappell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Zoo", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Zoo"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_panda", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Giant panda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panda_diplomacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Panda diplomacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiao_Liwu", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xiao Liwu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bai_Yun", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bai Yun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Zoological_Park_(United_States)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Zoological Park (United States)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NPR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoo_Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zoo Atlanta"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Zoo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Zoo"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China\u2013United_States_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China\u2013United States relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservation movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smithsonian_Institution", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Smithsonian Institution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Union for Conservation of Nature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Endangered species"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extinction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerable_species", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vulnerable species"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threatened_species", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Threatened species"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Zoology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Zoology", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal Welfare", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Anime", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Anime", "wgt": 7}], "image": "https://cdn.kpbs.org/dims4/default/4813fa9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5696x3204+0+534/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnpr.brightspotcdn.com%2Fdims3%2Fdefault%2Fstrip%2Ffalse%2Fcrop%2F5696x4272%20286%200%2Fresize%2F5696x4272%21%2F%3Furl%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F54%2F35%2Fa27d2481441385558d44d25037cd%2Fgettyimages-2165259843.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796530", "eventUri": "eng-9796530", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

First giant pandas from China in decades make their public debut in San Diego", "body": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom proclaimed Aug. 8 California Panda Day in honor of Yun Chuan and Xin Bao's debut. (Scripps News)\n\nFor the first time in 21 years, two new giant pandas are calling the U.S. home, and now you can finally say hello to them in person.\n\nAfter arriving more than a month ago from China, Yun Chuan and Xin Bao made their public debut at the San Diego Zoo on Thursday, with a grand ceremony marking the first time the public could check out the fluffy duo and their new home, Panda Ridge. And as the pair sunbathed and snacked on bamboo inside, crowds gathered around them to dance, ogle and be a part of the \"panda-mania,\" as California Gov. Gavin Newsom called it.\n\nNewsom, addressing the visitors alongside Chinese ambassador Xie Feng, said the moment was not only a celebration of the animals but one signifying a \"much deeper, much richer\" celebration.\n\n\"It is about understanding,\" Newsom said. \"It's about celebrating our common humanity. It is about celebrating the things that bind us together.\"\n\nRELATED STORY | Giant pandas will be returning to the National Zoo in Washington\n\nTensions between the U.S. and China had temporarily paused the program known as \"panda diplomacy\" in which China loans its native animals to zoos around the world. This began in the 1940s as a show of goodwill from China toward its international allies, and it had been alive in the U.S. since the 1970s until relations between the two nations soured. But the presence of Yun Chuan and Xin Bao appears to show a mending of the diplomatic relationship, which Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged to work toward in a meeting with President Biden last year.\n\nNewsom -- in proclaiming Aug. 8, 2024, as California Panda Day -- said he'd traveled to China last year to \"advance priority issues, including climate action and economic development.\" He called the giant pandas an example of how strong worldly partnerships can protect wildlife and their habitats and applauded the San Diego Zoo for being the country's first organization to establish a cooperative panda conservation program with China.\n\n\"This conservation collaboration is part of California and China's long history of working together towards shared goals,\" Newsom said in the proclamation. \"We hope that the newly arrived panda 'envoys of friendship' will lead to further exchanges and cooperation between California and China.\"\n\nRELATED STORY | Who are the pandas the San Diego Zoo is getting from China?\n\nAs for the pandas themselves, the zoo says 5-year-old male Yun Chuan is \"gentle and lovable,\" \"kind, clever and sensitive to others.\" Although he's \"serious about his bamboo,\" the zoo says he always lets other pandas go first. He can be distinguished by his long, slightly pointed nose tip. And he has strong ties to his new home: His mother, Zhen Zhen, was the fourth cub born there, and his maternal grandmother whom he was named after, Bai Yun, and his grandfather resided there in the early 2000s.\n\nMeanwhile, the zoo describes 4-year-old female Xin Bao as \"very active, alert, witty,\" \"an excellent climber,\" adding that she is \"naturally playful and will even roughhouse a bit with some of the other pandas.\" Her name means \"a new treasure of prosperity and abundance,\" and the zoo said she'll \"no doubt\" be a reminder of blessings and success.

It's about celebrating the things that bind us together.\"\n\nUntil recently, the loan of the two pandas seemed an unlikely dream.\n\nWith fierce trade competition, and disagreements over Taiwan and human rights, tensions between China and the United States have been rising for several years -- to the point that Beijing's traditional \"panda diplomacy\" seemed to have frozen.\n\nIn recent years, pandas at zoos in Washington DC, Atlanta and Memphis were all returned to Beijing, after loan agreements were not renewed.\n\nHowever, at a key summit between US President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping in November, the latter announced that Beijing would continue the program in the United States.\n\nChina's loaning of pandas around the world is both a diplomatic symbol and a way to help the survival of a vulnerable species.\n\nIn addition to San Diego, pandas are expected to return to zoos in Washington and San Francisco by 2025.\n\n- 'Our shared future' -\n\nChina first offered its pandas to the United States in 1972 under US President Richard Nixon.\n\nSince then, the country has used its loan of the black-and-white bears to send diplomatic messages.\n\nFor instance, after President Barack Obama met with the Dalai Lama in 2010, who is seen as a rebel by Beijing, China recalled two of its pandas.\n\nThe San Diego Zoo has enjoyed a decades-long partnership with Chinese authorities, having received two pandas in 1996 that gave birth to six cubs in captivity.\n\nAll of the pandas were returned to China in 2019, in line with earlier agreements.\n\nThe return of the pandas is not only a boon for the zoo, where their presence attracts thousands of visitors a year, but also supports the propagation of the species, which is notoriously difficult in the wild.\n\nZoo officials described four-year-old Yun Chuan as a \"mild-mannered, gentle and lovable\" male, who was named after his grandmother, Bai Yun, one of the initial two pandas loaned to San Diego.\n\nThe other panda, three-year-old female Xin Bao, is a \"gentle and witty introvert,\" zoo officials said. Her name means a \"new treasure of prosperity and abundance.\"\n\n\"We hope she will bring you good luck to California, to San Diego,\" China's ambassador to the United States Xie Feng said.\n\nstr-rfo/jgc/aha", "source": {"uri": "wfxg.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WFXG FOX54"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters",

A pair of giant pandas that will make their debut at the San Diego Zoo Thursday.\n\nIn the latest example of panda diplomacy between the United States and China, Xin Bao and Yun Chuan are the first pandas to come to the U.S. in 21 years.\n\n\"Giant pandas are beloved around the world and their conservation story is an inspiring example of strong partnerships and innovative strategies to protect the world's natural heritage,\" Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a proclamation issued this week, declaring Thursday California Panda Day.\n\nWhile the grizzly bear is the official state animal, Newsom said, \"California is proud to celebrate another iconic bear.\"\n\nFive-year-old Yun Chuan is a boy that can be identified because of his long, pointy nose, the zoo said. Xin Bau is a girl almost four years old who has a round face and large fluffy ears. The pair arrived in San Diego in June and have been adjusting to a new expanded habitat called Panda Ridge that will also debut Thursday.\n\nFour times larger than the San Diego Zoo's former panda habitat, the 6,000-square-foot space is designed to emulate China's mountains, canyons and cliffs and includes shade trees for the pandas to climb and rolling hills for them to wander as they nosh on bamboo. Zoo visitors can see the pandas after purchasing a ticket and can make reservations for a 60-minute Early Morning with Pandas Walking Tour.\n\nThe San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance is one of several U.S. zoos that house pandas and work to preserve species. The mother of one of the new pandas was born in San Diego in 2007.\n\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature lists the giant panda as vulnerable to extinction because of climate change, habitat loss due to infrastructure development and low birth rates. According to the National Zoo, there are about 1,864 giant pandas living in their native habitat in central China and another 600 who live in zoos and breeding centers globally.\n\nSo-called panda diplomacy dates back to the 1950s, when the People's Republic of China gifted pandas to its socialist allies. Most famously, Chairman Mao Zedong gave a pair of pandas named Ping Ping and Qi Qi to the Soviet Union in 1957 to celebrate the 1917 October Revolution in Russia that changed the government from tsarism to socialism.\n\nIn the years since, China has given pandas to democratic countries in the West, including the United Kingdom and the United States. The U.S. received its first panda pair -- Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing -- at the Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington, D.C. in April 1972, following President Richard Nixon's visit to China.",

It's about celebrating the things that bind us together.\"\n\nThe welcome ceremony included traditional Chinese dances and speeches from Chinese Ambassador Xie Feng and other local officials.\n\n\"Two little panda fans from California wrote several letters to me proposing giving China grizzly bears to get pandas,\" Xie said, eliciting laughs.\n\nYun Chuan and Xin Bao arrived at the San Diego Zoo in June and were acclimatizing before being revealed to the public. Both were born in the Wolong Shenshuping Panda Base in China's Sichuan province.\n\nYun, described by the zoo as \"mild-mannered, gentle and lovable,\" is a nearly 5-year-old male panda.\n\nHis ancestors Bai Yun and Gao Gao both lived at the San Diego Zoo for over a decade, while his mother, Zhen Zhen, was the fourth cub born at the zoo.\n\nXin is a nearly 4-year-old female described as a \"gentle and witty introvert with a sweet round face and big ears.\"\n\n\"Her name means a treasure of prosperity and abundance, and we hope she will bring you good luck,\" Ambassador Xie said.\n\nChina has long used \"panda diplomacy\" to enhance relations with countries across the world, especially the US, while also promoting the conservation of the vulnerable species.\n\nWhenever relations worsened, Beijing often recalled some of its pandas in a show of disagreement.\n\nTensions soared amid recent friction between Washington and Beijing over trade competition, Taiwan, Russia and the South China Sea, seemingly freezing the long-observed loaning of pandas to the United States.\n\nOnly four other pandas currently reside in the US, all in Atlanta.\n\nHowever, Chinese President Xi Jinping announced that Beijing would continue the program in the US during a key summit with US President Joe Biden.\n\nMore pandas are expected to arrive at the zoos in Washington and San Francisco by 2025.", "source": {"uri": "dw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deutsche Welle"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Zoo", "type": "loc",

Yun Chuan is active, but is \"known to be quite gentle,\" said the zoo.\n\nXin Bao is an almost 4-year-old female recognized by her round face and fluffy ears.\n\nXin Bao's name means \"precious treasure of prosperity and abundance,\" and she's described as \"very active, alert, witty and an excellent climber.\"\n\nOUTSIDE OF CHINA, PANDAS ARE ONLY FOUND IN THESE 5 ZOOS AROUND THE WORLD\n\nThe pandas' arrival is the result of the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance's 30-year partnership with conservationists in China, which aims to protect and recover giant pandas and bamboo forests.\n\n\"By uniting our strengths, we're restoring flourishing populations and healthy ecosystems, so giant pandas can thrive,\" the zoo states on its website.\n\n\"In the exciting next step of our partnership, we're working to improve overall health and resilience for populations vulnerable to extinction and loss of genetic diversity,\" the statement continued.\n\nSpecies conservation has been at the forefront of global efforts since the bears' populations dwindled in the 1990s.\n\nThe San Diego Zoo built an alliance with China to \"shift panda recovery from an uncertain future to one of hope and prosperity,\" the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance wrote in a June article.\n\nPANDAS TO RETURN TO SAN DIEGO ZOO AS CHINA BRINGS BACK 'PANDA DIPLOMACY'\n\nThe zoo welcomed its first giant pandas in 1996, making \"critical\" discoveries about the animals' reproductive behavior as well as physiology, health, genetics, nutrition and habitat needs, according to the zoo.\n\nFor more Lifestyle articles, visit foxnews/lifestyle\n\n\"We developed a giant panda milk formula, and together with our partners, other neonatal techniques that drastically increased survival rates for nursery-raised cubs from less than 10% to more than 90%,\" the zoo wrote in an article.\n\nIn 1999, the alliance also achieved the first successful artificial insemination of a giant panda outside of China.\n\nThe pandas, along with their U.S.-born babies, were sent back to China at the end of their 12-year loan agreement.\n\nDC'S SMITHSONIAN NATIONAL ZOO TO WELCOME PAIR OF YOUNG PANDAS FROM CHINA\n\nIn 2016, the conservation status of giant pandas changed from endangered to vulnerable.\n\nNow, the offspring of previous San Diego-raised pandas are returning to the U.S. to further conservation efforts.\n\nPeople visiting the San Diego Zoo can view the pandas for free, or they can book an early-morning walking tour that includes accompaniment by an expert guide and exclusive viewings.\n\nAs of Feb. 2024, Zoo Atlanta is the only other U.S. zoo to house giant pandas, including the first panda twins born in America in more than a quarter-century, according to the AP.\n\nThe National Zoo in Washington, D.C., is expecting the arrival of two young giant pandas by the end of 2024, Reuters reported in May.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nThis is just

The occasion drew throngs of media and visitors, including California Governor Gavin Newsom, who proclaimed August 8 as California Panda Day.\n\nThe pandas, Yun Chuan and Xin Bao, appeared unfazed by the attention as they sunbathed and dined on bamboo in their new home.Yun Chuan, a nearly 5-year-old male, and Xin Bao, a nearly 4-year-old female, were born at the Wolong Shenshuping Panda Base in China's Sichuan province. The San Diego Zoo described Yun Chuan as \"mild-mannered, gentle and lovable,\" while Xin Bao was noted for her \"gentle and witty\" nature.\n\nGovernor Newsom, during the opening ceremony filled with music and dancing, emphasized the deeper significance of the event beyond the pandas themselves. \"This is about celebrating our common humanity,\" Newsom said, highlighting the symbolic importance of the pandas as a gesture of renewed goodwill between the US and China.\n\nThe ceremony also featured remarks from Chinese Ambassador Xie Feng, who shared stories of panda fans eager to witness the event. Xie noted the excitement surrounding the pandas' arrival, including a story about two California children who suggested trading grizzly bears for pandas.\n\nThe arrival of Yun Chuan and Xin Bao is part of a broader effort to revive China's \"panda diplomacy,\" which had seen a decline in recent years due to strained international relations. The San Diego Zoo, which had previously housed pandas until 2019, was selected alongside Madrid Zoo to continue this conservation collaboration.\n\nSan Diego's pandas are among only six giant pandas currently in the US, with the other four residing in Atlanta. The Smithsonian's National Zoo is also set to receive a new pair of pandas later this year, after its previous bears returned to China.\n\nAs part of the loan agreement, US zoos contribute $1 million annually to China's wildlife conservation efforts, with all cubs born in the US required to return to China by age four.\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Since then, they have been acclimating to their new home at the San Diego Zoo, called Panda Ridge.\n\nNewsom's proclamation, issued less than a day before their first public appearance, expressed pride that Southern California's premier zoo was the first to receive another set of beloved bears from China, which has long used them as ambassadors of friendship on board.\n\nThe last pandas residing in America's most beautiful city were sent back to China about five years ago.\n\nThe bear has long held a special place in California as a symbol of our state's spirit and strength, from our flag and seal to its enduring importance to Native American tribes across the state, the proclamation reads. This week, California is proud to celebrate another iconic bear, as a pair of giant pandas make their public debut at the San Diego Zoo.\n\nHe then praised the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance's enduring commitment to conservation efforts, as the first zoological organization in the nation to establish a cooperative program to preserve, care for and grow the giant panda population.\n\nYun Chuan, one of two pandas on loan to San Diego, is a testament to those efforts, Newsom said. The four-year-old male's mother, Zhen Zhen, was born in America's Most Beautiful City in 2007.\n\nGiant pandas are beloved around the world, and their conservation story is an inspiring example of strong partnerships and innovative strategies to protect the world's natural heritage, Newsom said in the proclamation.\n\nAs the San Diego Zoo welcomes visitors to Panda Ridge this week, he continued, I encourage Californians to take advantage of this unique opportunity to appreciate one of the most iconic wildlife species and recognize the important partnerships at work to help them thrive for generations to come.\n\nThe full text of the governor's proclamation can be found here.\n\nNewsom is also expected to travel to San Diego on Thursday for the official opening of Panda Ridge, San Diego Zoo officials said. The public tour will officially begin at noon after a special opening ceremony.\n\nSan Diego Zoo Officials confirmed in February that they would be the first American organization to receive pandas after Chinese President Xi Jinping has announced his intention to renew their use as diplomatic symbols of friendship with the United States\n\nThe San Diego Zoo was one of several wildlife groups to which China has gifted a pair of pandas over the years since 1972, when Beijing and Washington, D.C., struck a loan deal as part of normalization efforts between the two nations.\n\nThe loans were later extended to support breeding and conservation efforts. During the 30 years the pandas have resided at the San Diego Zoo, care teams have made great strides in exploring ways to protect and restore the giant panda population, as well as the bamboo forests on which they depend.\n\nThanks to these efforts, alongside other conservation groups, the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List downgraded the giant panda from endangered to vulnerable in 2021.\n\nIn anticipation of the bears' arrival, the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance has made major improvements to its existing panda enclosure, expanding it to about 6,000 feet in size, according to a report.application submitted to the US Fish and Wildlife AllianceGuest capacity has also been doubled, from approximately 80 to 173 people.\n\nEven though Panda Ridge will be able to accommodate more people, the zoo and San Diego officials still expect some chaos.\n\nThe zoo offers visitors three ways to experience giant pandas: through the limited-time free giant panda ticket, a standby line, and a paid 60-minute experience. Early Morning Panda Walking Tour.\n\nTraffic and parking may also be affected around Balboa Park, where the zoo is located. For those heading to the grand opening, advice on How to get around can be found here.\n\nYun Chuan, a four-year-old male, has been described as a gentle, kind and friendly animal. He also already has ties to the San Diego Zoo: His mother, Zhen Zhen, was born at the zoo in 2007. His grandmother, Bai Yun, lived at the San Diego Zoo for 23 years.\n\nIt is recognizable by its long, slightly pointed nose, according to the Wildlife Alliance. It also appears to be quite comfortable exploring grass or climbing trees.\n\nXin Bao, a three-year-old female, is described as an introverted, gentle but witty person. She has a cute round face and big, bushy ears. Zoo officials said her name means \"new treasure of prosperity and abundance.\"\n\nSince arriving in San Diego, she has been known to quietly sunbathe and concentrate while munching on her favorite foods.\n\nAccording to the zoo, the two pandas were born at the Wolong Shenshuping Panda Base in Sichuan.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors":

'It's worth the wait.'", "body": "Even a mayor, governor and diplomat couldn't outshine the San Diego Zoo's newest celebrities Thursday, as a long line of admirers formed to greet the first two giant pandas to enter the United States in 21 years.\n\nOn loan from China, Yun Chuan and Xin Bao made their public debut to an adoring crowd.\n\nNot only are the zoo's newest residents the \"furriest, cutest San Diegans,\" according to Mayor Todd Gloria, these pandas are diplomats, symbolizing hope for future generations of their species.\n\n\"We are so glad to have them here,\" Gloria said. \"I cannot wait for San Diego to see these two magnificent creatures, and by doing so, to recommit ourselves to the important work of conserving the giant panda ... in celebration of two cultures coming together to do something truly magnificent.\"\n\nChinese dignitaries and local elected officials, including Gov. Gavin Newsom, welcomed the pandas to San Diego with a private ceremony Thursday morning, complete with entertainment from traditional Chinese dancers and singers.\n\nBy early afternoon, hundreds of zoo visitors had gathered outside Panda Ridge, the zoo's newly renovated habitat for the pandas, anxiously awaiting their turn to meet the duo.\n\n\"It's just such a great message of conservation and preservation for all the animals for our future,\" said former San Diego Zoo volunteer Keena Butcher.\n\nChina owns and leases all giant pandas in U.S. zoos and has loaned the animals for decades as \"panda diplomacy\" to strengthen national ties and advance panda conservation efforts.\n\nXie Feng, the Chinese ambassador to the U.S., said the recent trade with the San Diego Zoo, China's first partner in panda conservation 30 years ago, was a \"dream come true.\"\n\nNewsom echoed that sentiment, saying the panda loan was a symbol of a larger partnership for a greater good.\n\n\"This is about something much deeper, much richer than just the two beautiful pandas,\" Newsom said. \"It's about celebrating our common humanity. ... We've got to triumph together.\"\n\nGina Luce and her fianc\u00e9, Martin Guzman, traveled from Orange County to see the pandas. Although the afternoon heat beat down on the line, both held a stuffed panda, with unfaltering grins on their faces.\n\n\"It's worth the wait ... to make memories (together),\" said Guzman. \"My grandkids call me 'the bear,' so I tell them that I'm the brown panda bear.\"\n\nYun Chuan and Xin Bao are the first pandas in San Diego since 2019. They arrived at the zoo on June 27 after a conservation agreement was signed in February.\n\nButcher, the former zoo volunteer, was thrilled she was lucky enough to be in town when the pandas made their debut.\n\n\"Right now, I live in Italy, so I'm here for our annual summer vacation, and it was perfect timing to see the pandas,\" Butcher said.\n\nButcher was most excited to see Yun Chuan, pronounced \"yoon chu-ahn,\" the 5-year-old son of Zhen Zhen, who in 2007 became the fourth cub to be born at the San Diego Zoo.\n\n\"To continue that San Diego lineage and the partnership between the United States and China, it's just a really great positive thing for our world,\" she said.\n\nYun, which means \"cloud,\" is a nod to his grandmother Bai Yun -- who lived at the San Diego Zoo for 23 years -- while Chuan means \"big river,\" a nod to the province of Sichuan, where he's from.\n\nWildlife care specialists say Yun Chuan is easygoing and loves his bamboo almost as much as he loves his afternoon naps.\n\nThey hope he will eventually mate with his counterpart, 4-year-old Xin Bao, pronounced \"sing bao,\" and produce a cub or two.\n\nXin Bao's name means \"precious treasure of prosperity and abundance.\"\n\nShe's naturally playful and curious and can often be seen atop the hillside in her new habitat, munching on bamboo, according to wildlife care specialists.\n\nIt's that jovial attitude that resonated most with some of the zoo's younger visitors, including 6-year-olds Abigail Wang and Reverie Wood, both of whom had donned black and white striped attire for their visits Thursday.\n\n\"They're playful,\" Abigail said shyly as she stroked her fluffy panda purse.\n\nA few were also eager to show off their unique, panda-inspired clothing pieces, including Butcher, who'd gotten her panda shirt years ago in Greece.\n\nLa Mesa resident Lucy Conover twirled in her black and white dress covered in stitched pandas and bamboo.\n\n\"I got it in high school and I'm a master's student now, so I've been tailoring this dress so I can wear it as long as possible because it's one of my favorite dresses,\" she said.\n\nAnother former zoo volunteer, Conover said her visit to the pandas Thursday invoked fond memories of her childhood.\n\n\"I was here on one of the last days the pandas were here, and I remember how sad everybody was to see them go,\" she recalled. \"I just thought it would be so uplifting to come here the day they returned.\"\n\nShe woke up early Thursday and was one of the first ones to get a complimentary timed ticket -- one of three ways for the public to see the pandas, along with joining a stand-by line or paying for an exclusive, 60-minute early morning walking tour.\n\nMost zoo visitors said the process to get timed tickets to see the pandas was easy. Many like Conover had arrived early and were able to secure their 15-minute time slots at ticket booths before the zoo opened that morning.\n\nLongtime San Diego resident Harvey Rogoff said he was the first in line around 7:15 a.m. at the booth. \"You have to plan ahead,\" he said.\n\nA photographer, Rogoff had also prepped two DSLR cameras -- one with a long lens, one short -- and donned a Chinese soccer jersey for the visit.\n\nHowever, it wasn't his first rodeo. He says he's photographed every panda to ever reside at the zoo over the years, including all six cubs.\n\nIn fact, he took a print he'd taken of Zhen Zhen as a baby with him to China when he visited the Chengdu Panda Base and presented it to the director of panda research as a gift.\n\nThe pandas were also a welcome return for other long-time admirers, like Kiri Cragin-Folwell, who recalls the two most important things she needed to know when she worked at the zoo during her high school years: where the bathrooms and the pandas were.\n\n\"That's 90 percent of your questions (you'd get),\" she said, laughing.\n\nIt seems as though balance at the San Diego Zoo has once again been restored.", "source": {"uri": "sandiegouniontribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San Diego

Throngs of media gathered, while the City of San Diego warned of traffic jams. The San Diego Zoo rolled out the red carpet Thursday for the first public showing of its newest residents. Visitors watched the two giant pandas sunbathe and chow down on bamboo in their new home, the first pandas to enter the US in two decades. For years, the Chinese government has loaned pandas to zoos around the world in a practice called \"panda diplomacy.\" These fuzzy ambassadors have long been a symbol of the US-China friendship, ever since Beijing gifted a pair of pandas to the National Zoo in Washington, DC, in 1972.\n\nThe opening ceremony included dancing, music, and remarks from Gov. Gavin Newsom, Chinese ambassador Xie Feng, and local officials. \"This is about something much deeper, much richer, than just the two beautiful pandas we celebrate,\" Newsom said. \"It's about celebrating our common humanity.\" The governor recognized the zoo as the first organization in the US to establish a cooperative panda conservation program with China. Ambassador Xie said he met someone on his flight traveling from Washington, DC, to see the pandas. \"Two little panda fans from California wrote several letters to me proposing giving China grizzly bears to get pandas,\" Xie said, eliciting laughs.\n\nBoth pandas were born at the Wolong Shenshuping Panda Base in China's Sichuan province. Yun Chuan is a nearly 5-year-old male described by the zoo as \"mild-mannered, gentle and lovable.\" He is the grandson of Bai Yun and Gao Gao, who both lived at the San Diego Zoo for more than a decade. Xin Bao is a nearly 4-year-old female described as a \"gentle and witty introvert with a sweet round face and big ears.\" Only four other giant pandas reside in the US, all at the zoo in Atlanta. However, the Smithsonian's National Zoo is to receive a new pair of pandas by the end of the year. As part of the loan agreement, US zoos typically pay $1 million a year toward China's wildfire conservation efforts. All cubs born in the US must return to China by age 4.

But two California celebrities are getting a whole lot of attention this week.\n\nA pair of giant pandas from China will make their public debut Thursday at the San Diego Zoo. The first new pandas to enter the United States in 21 years, Yun Chuan, a 5-year-old male, and Xin Bao, a 4-year-old female, are generating a frenzy of excitement.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom rode the wildlife wave Wednesday, proclaiming Thursday as \"California Panda Day,\" and announcing that he and his wife, Jennifer Siebel Newsom, will attend the opening of Panda Ridge at the San Diego Zoo. The new habitat for the bears is four times the size of the previous panda enclosure that the famed Southern California zoo built for its last pair, which returned to China in 2019.\n\nSince 1972, when China first loaned pandas to the National Zoo in Washington D.C., as part of a gesture of friendliness to former President Richard Nixon and his wife, Pat Nixon, the affable ambassadors have been considered an important part of diplomacy between the two countries.\n\nAfter growing tension between the two countries five years ago, China recalled many of its pandas from the U.S., and today the only ones remaining are at the Atlanta Zoo.\n\nBut a panda rapprochement now appears to be underway.\n\nIn San Francisco last November during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit, Chinese President Xi Jinping announced during talks with President Biden that China would send new pandas to America as \"envoys of friendship.\"\n\nThen in April, San Francisco Mayor London Breed signed an agreement with the China Wildlife Conservation Association to bring two pandas to San Francisco Zoo in 2025 after the zoo builds a panda enclosure. The city is working to raise $25 million for the project by asking prominent companies and philanthropists -- from SalesForce to Google -- to contribute.\n\n\"We are ready to welcome visitors from all over the world to our beautiful zoo,\" Breed said in April. \"This is a momentous opportunity, and one I am grateful for. I know I join so many who can't wait to see them in San Francisco.\"\n\nSimilarly, in May, the Smithsonian's National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute announced two giant pandas will be coming to the zoo in Washington, D.C. by the end of 2024.\n\nThe San Diego pair arrived in late June. They have been acclimating well to their new surroundings, zoo officials say.\n\n\"(Yun Chuan) loves his bamboo. He's really comfortable in his habitat. He explores, and he's curious,\" Megan Owen, vice president of wildlife and conservation science for the San Diego Zoo told \"Good Morning America\" on Tuesday.\n\nOwen said the zoo has grown eight different species of bamboo for the bears to eat. They can eat 40 pounds or more a day.\n\n\"We give each of our pandas a choice so that they can tell us which are their favorites,\" she said. \"And we need to balance that with what are the most nutritious species of bamboo for the bears.\"\n\nPandas typically grow to up to 250 pounds and reach 6 feet in length. Under pressure from deforestation and population growth in China, their native country, their numbers have slowing been increasing due to conservation efforts. In 2016, they were upgraded from endangered to vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Today there are about 1,800 in the wild and more than 200 in captivity.\n\nSan Diego Zoo officials, and San Diego city leaders are warning of heavy traffic around Balboa Park, where the zoo is located, for the first few days and are urging visitors to take public transportation or carpool.\n\nThe zoo isn't saying how many new visitors it expects. China typically charges U.S. zoos $1 million a year for 10 years to have the pandas on loan. In 1987, the first time pandas came to San Diego Zoo, they drew 2 million visitors that year.\n\nOfficials in both countries hope the new pair will give birth to a cub.\n\nThe zoo expects to set up a \"panda cam\" soon so the public can look-in on the fuzzy couple. Until then, visitors to the zoo can see the pandas by getting a first-come-first served timed ticket to Panda Ridge as part of their zoo admission, by waiting in a stand-by line when those timed slots are full, or by paying $92 to $115 a person for a 60-minute early morning special tour with a zoo expert.", "source": {"uri": "mercurynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San Jose Mercury News"},

The pair are enjoying a variety of fresh bamboo and a local adaptation of \"wotou\", a traditional Chinese steamed corn bread that's also called \"panda bread\".\n\n\"The arrival of Yun Chuan and Xin Bao, as we celebrate the 45th anniversary of our diplomatic ties, has sent a clear and important message,\" said Ambassador Xie Feng.\n\n\"China-US cooperation on panda conservation will not cease. Our people to people exchanges and sub-national cooperation will not stop and once opened, the door of China-U.S. friendship will not be shut again.\"\n\nNewsom said the new pandas were about \"celebrating our common humanity.

His mother Zhen Zhen was born in the zoo in 2007, and his grandmother Bai Yun lived there for 23 years until 2019.\n\n\"The long wait is finally over,\" the zoo posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, just minutes after the opening, adding that the bears \"have been showing off their different personalities, snacking on bamboo, and exploring their new habitats\".\n\nPaul Baribault, president of the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, said that the \"innovative space is four times larger than the San Diego Zoo's previous panda habitat and is inspired by renowned geological formations in China, replicating mountains, canyons, and cliffs\".\n\nMore giant pandas are expected to arrive in the US in the coming months - at the National Zoo in Washington, as well as zoos in San Francisco; Atlanta; and Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nChina initiated its panda diplomacy with the US by giving two bears to the National Zoo in 1972, following US President Richard Nixon's trip to China.\n\nBefore the arrival of the new pair in California, only four pandas remained in the US, all housed at the Atlanta Zoo, as US-China ties frayed. The Atlanta pandas are scheduled to return to China by the end of the year, when their loan agreement concludes.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

His mother, Zhen Zhen, was born at the San Diego Zoo in 2007.\n\nThe zoo is working closely with Chinese experts to help with the adaptation period and understanding of the needs of the two pandas. The pair are enjoying a variety of fresh bamboo and a local adaptation of 'wotou,' a traditional Chinese steamed cornbread that's also called 'panda bread.'\n\n'The arrival of Yun Chuan and Xin Bao, as we celebrate the 45th anniversary of our diplomatic ties, has sent a clear and important message,' said Xie.\n\n'China-U.S. cooperation on panda conservation will not cease. Our people-to- people exchanges and subnational cooperation will not stop, and once opened, the door of China-U.S. friendship will not be shut again,' he added.\n\nNewsom said the new pandas were about 'celebrating our common humanity. It's about celebrating the things that bind us together.'\n\n'And so, for me, this spirit of pride that is associated with this opening today with the experience that so many will have, that we just had at Panda Ridge, is about a deeper meaning,' Newsom added.\n\nVisitors of all ages to Panda Ridge on Thursday were exuberant about the pandas' cuteness.\n\n'I have never seen a panda before. I've only seen them on TV and nature documentaries,' said Kobi Davis from Michigan. 'They are super cute. They just kind of laze around, you know. There's charm in that.'\n\nKeena Butcher from Canada called them 'quiet, thoughtful creatures, and just realize we can have hope for our future if we can conserve them.'\n\nChina's Communist government has long used 'panda diplomacy' to enhance the country's soft power, lending the large but cuddly looking black-and-white bears to zoos in various countries over the decades as goodwill animal ambassadors.\n\nIn late 2023, Washington's National Zoo said goodbye to its beloved giant pandas, which were returned to China amid heightened tensions between the two global superpowers.\n\nIn May this year, the National Zoo said China would send two young pandas to Washington by the end of the year.\n\nReuters is a news agency founded in 1851 and owned by the Thomson Reuters Corporation based in Toronto, Canada.

Atkins, California state senator; Si Ping, deputy secretary general of China Wildlife Conservation Association; Todd Gloria, mayor of San Diego; and other U.S. and Chinese dignitaries and civic leaders. The event included a special Chinese musical and artistic performance and the reveal of an original Shepard Fairey artwork created to celebrate the occasion.\n\n\"We are delighted to introduce Yun Chuan and Xin Bao to the world,\" said Paul Baribault, president and CEO of San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance. \"Guests will have an opportunity to visit with these remarkable giant pandas, be inspired by their importance, learn about all we do to help conserve them alongside our trusted Chinese partners, and join us to help protect their future.\"\n\n\"Last November, President Xi Jinping announced in San Francisco that China is ready to continue cooperation with the U.S. on panda conservation,\" said His Excellency Xie Feng, Chinese ambassador to the United States. \"The arrival of Yun Chuan and Xin Bao in San Diego as we celebrate the 45th anniversary of our diplomatic ties has sent a clear and important message: China-U.S. cooperation on panda conservation will not cease, our people-to-people exchanges and subnational cooperation will not stop, and, once opened, the door of China-U.S. friendship will not be shut again.\"\n\n\"Welcoming these national treasures to the San Diego Zoo is a proud moment for California that reflects our strong foundation of partnership with China on a host of issues, from climate action to economic development,\" said Governor Gavin Newsom. \"Working together with our international partners to protect this iconic wildlife species, we can achieve remarkable outcomes for conservation and cultural exchange, benefiting our communities and the planet.\"\n\nYun Chuan is a five-year-old male, identifiable by his long, slightly pointed nose. His mother, Zhen Zhen (jen jen), was born at the San Diego Zoo in 2007. Xin Bao is a four-year-old female, best recognized by her large, round face and big, fluffy ears.\n\nSince arriving in late June, the pair have been acclimating to their new home in the reimagined Panda Ridge. Four times larger than the previous panda habitat, the newly refreshed and expanded Panda Ridge takes inspiration from the breathtaking, lush landscapes in and around giant pandas' native habitats in Sichuan, Gansu and Shaanxi provinces in China.\n\nAn original portrait commemorating the significance of giant pandas coming to San Diego was created by California-based artist Shepard Fairey, best known for creating former President Barack Obama's iconic \"Hope\" campaign poster in 2008, and unveiled at the event. Titled \"Friendship Across the Earth,\" the portrait features Bai Yun -- the beloved panda who lived at the San Diego Zoo for more than 20 years -- with the words Majesty, Respect and Conservation alongside graphic representations, the globe and patterns of bamboo and flowers. Bai Yun was selected to celebrate the importance of her legacy to giant panda conservation and represent a bridge to the next generation.\n\nThis year marks the 30th anniversary of the conservation partnership between San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance and China Wildlife Conservation Association. The collaboration has greatly advanced giant panda conservation, leading to the downgrading of the giant panda's status from Endangered to Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature in 2016. The efforts include developing a giant panda milk formula and other neonatal conservation techniques that dramatically increased the survival of nursery-reared cubs from less than 10% to over 90%, as well as advanced reproductive techniques and the contribution of valuable expertise to efforts led by Chinese scientists to track wild giant pandas at the Foping National Nature Reserve using GPS technology. The ongoing collaboration aims to further enhance the health and resilience of giant panda populations, especially the most vulnerable and isolated groups.\n\nStarting today, there are three ways to experience giant pandas at the San Diego Zoo. Visitors can obtain a complimentary Giant Panda Timed Ticket upon their arrival at the Zoo to skip the wait, join the standby line at Panda Ridge, or make reservations for an exclusive, Early Morning with Pandas walking tour. Advance reservations are currently being accepted for the walking tour. More information about Yun Chuan and Xin Bao, as well as how to experience them, is available at sdzwa.org/giantpandas.\n\nSan Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance wants to thank our donors for their continued support, especially Kenneth C. Griffin and Peng Zhao. We are grateful for their lead gifts, which inspire others to join them in supporting panda conservation in San Diego and around the globe. In recognition of their donations, we are pleased to name one of the habitats within Panda Ridge in their honor.\n\nAbout San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance\n\nSan Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, a nonprofit conservation leader, inspires passion for nature and collaboration for a healthier world.

China owns and leases all giant pandas in U.S. zoos and for decades has lent out the animals as a sign of friendship or to strengthen national ties, a practice known as \"panda diplomacy.\"\n\nSingle-day passes cost $74 for visitors 12 and older and $64 for children ages 3 to 11. On \"value days\" designated by the zoo, those prices change to $70 and $60.\n\nWhere are they in the zoo?\n\nThe bears are in a new habitat called Panda Ridge that's four times bigger than the zoo's previous panda space. It features pools and misters to keep the bears cool and boasts rock outcroppings, lush trees and bushes inspired by Chinese forests where wild pandas roam.\n\nHow can visitors get in line to see them?\n\nZoo officials say visitors have several ways they can experience the pandas.\n\nOne is to obtain a complimentary timed ticket, which can be acquired the day-of at the ticket booth when admission tickets are purchased or at various locations in the main plaza. The free timed tickets are set for every 15 minutes between 9:30 a.m. and 3 p.m. The tickets are on first come, first served. The zoo said \"thousands\" of timed tickets would be issued each day.\n\nAnother is to join a standby line in person, from 9:30 a.m. until the pandas are off habitat or the zoo closes, whichever occurs earlier. But the zoo notes on its website that standby does not guarantee \"giant panda habitat access.\"\n\nThose wanting more time with the pandas, and the ability to reserve a sure thing, can book an exclusive, 60-minute early morning walking tour.\n\nAre there additional fees for the pandas?\n\nThe timed day-of tickets and standby line are free, but the walking tours are a new option for panda watchers and will cost you. While zoo gates typically open at 9 a.m., the tours begin at 8:15 and 8:30 a.m. Tickets are $92 to $115 per person, depending on the day, and can be booked online or by calling (619) 718-3000.\n\nAm I certain to see the giant pandas if I go?\n\nThe timed ticket does not guarantee a view of the pandas. \"Panda Ridge includes grasses, tree logs, boulders, and other features that may limit your ability to view the pandas as they navigate their landscape,\" the zoo website says. \"In addition, wildlife may be temporarily cared for in private behind-the-scenes habitats at any time by our team of specialized wildlife care and health experts.\"\n\nHow do you distinguish between the two pandas?\n\nZoo officials say Yun Chuan is identifiable by his long, pointy nose, while Xin Bao, who is the smaller of the two, is best recognized by her large, round face and big, fluffy ears.\n\nEven so, the duo are nearly identical to the untrained eye.\n\nIn fact, they are similar in size. Weighing in at 230 lbs., Yun Chuan is only slightly larger than Xin Bao, who is 220 lbs., according to zoo officials.\n\nThe easiest way to identify them is by their enclosures.\n\nFor now, it's ladies first. Xin Bao is the first to greet guests entering Panda Ridge, as she is housed in the larger of the two habitat spaces.\n\nFurther along the path, guests will encounter Yun Chuan in the smaller habitat without a hill on the east side. Zoo officials say they'll likely rotate the two bears between the habitats later.\n\nWhen is the best time to see the pandas?\n\nAlthough zoo officials say the pandas are typically most active at sunrise and sunset, they will spend overall about 80 percent of their time either eating or sleeping.\n\nPandas eat up to 40 pounds of locally grown bamboo a day and are fed three times daily, with more bamboo left out in their off-exhibit bedroom areas at night, in case they want a midnight snack.\n\nAre large crowds expected at the zoo?\n\nAhead of the panda debut on Aug. 8, the city of San Diego issued a traffic alert for the area around Balboa Park and the zoo, telling locals to expect extra traffic through Aug. 11 and on weekends throughout August.\n\nWhat are the options for traveling to the zoo?\n\nDrivers can park in a lot in front of the zoo or at Inspiration Point -- with a shuttle service -- for free. For public transportation, visitors can use Rapid 215 and Route 7 MTS buses to be dropped off in front of the zoo. These bus routes are accessible from some trolley stations, including Santa Fe Depot and City College.

Throngs of media gathered inside the zoo, while the city of San Diego warned of traffic jams ahead of the much-anticipated event Thursday.\n\nThe San Diego Zoo rolled out the red carpet for the first public showing of its newest residents, who were already dressed in black-and-white attire. The two giant pandas were seen sunbathing and chowing down on bamboo in their new home as the first pandas to enter the U.S. in two decades.\n\nFor years, the Chinese government has loaned pandas to zoos around the world in a practice called \"panda diplomacy.\" These fuzzy ambassadors have long been a symbol of the U.S.-China friendship, ever since Beijing gifted a pair of pandas to the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., in 1972.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The city's previous pandas left in 2018 and 2019.\n\nDuring his meeting with President Joe Biden in San Francisco last November, Chinese president Xi Jinping said he was \"ready to continue our cooperation with the United States on panda conservation\" and pledged to reduce tensions between the two countries.\n\nOnly four other giant pandas currently reside in the United States, all at the zoo in Atlanta. However, the Smithsonian's National Zoo will receive a new pair of pandas by the end of the year after its last bears returned to China last November. As part of the loan agreement, U.S. zoos typically pay $1 million a year toward China's wildfire conservation efforts, and all cubs born in the U.S. must return to China by age 4.\n\nThe opening ceremony included dancing, music, and remarks from Gov, Gavin Newsom, Chinese ambassador Xie Feng, and other local officials.\n\n\"This is about something much deeper, much richer, than just the two beautiful pandas we celebrate,\" Newsom said. \"It's about celebrating our common humanity.\"\n\nFor the occasion, Newsom proclaimed Aug. 8 as California Panda Day and recognized the San Diego Zoo as the first organization in the U.S. to establish a cooperative panda conservation program with China.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nAmbassador Xie said he met someone on his flight who had traveled all the way from Washington, D.C., to see the pandas.\n\n\"Two little panda fans from California wrote several letters to me proposing giving China grizzly bears to get pandas,\" Xie said, eliciting laughs.\n\nBoth pandas were born at the Wolong Shenshuping Panda Base in China's Sichuan province.\n\nYun Chuan is a nearly five-year-old male panda described by the zoo as \"mild-mannered, gentle and lovable.\" He is the grandson of Bai Yun and Gao Gao, who both lived at the San Diego Zoo for more than a decade. His mother, Zhen Zhen, was the fourth cub born at the zoo.\n\nXin Bao is a nearly four-year-old female panda described by the zoo as a \"gentle and witty introvert with a sweet round face and big ears.\"\n\n\"Her name means a treasure of prosperity and abundance, and we hope she will bring you good luck,\" Ambassador Xie said. He also spoke about China being California's top trading partner as well as the large Chinese community in the state and the abundance of Chinese tourists.\n\nAmong the pandas' biggest fans are two kids who were proudly wearing \"Panda Ridge\" t-shirts and carrying plushies at the zoo Thursday morning.\n\n\"Pandas are their favorite animals, if you could only see what our house looks like in terms of stuffed animals,\" their father James Metz said.\n\nIt was also his seven-year-old daughter's birthday, making it an extra special occasion. For weeks, the family has been eagerly watching live panda feeds from China in anticipation of the bears' arrival.\n\nYun Chuan and Xin Bao were hanging out and relaxing after eating, Metz said.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Atkins, California state senator; Gavin Newsom, governor of California; His Excellency Xie Feng, Chinese ambassador to the United States; Paul Baribault, president and CEO of San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance; Si Ping, deputy secretary general of China Wildlife Conservation Association; and Todd Gloria, mayor of San Diego at Panda Ridge ribbon ceremony at San Diego Zoo.\n\nThe ceremony was attended by Gavin Newsom, governor of California; His Excellency Xie Feng, Chinese ambassador to the United States; Toni G. Atkins, California state senator; Si Ping, deputy secretary general of China Wildlife Conservation Association; Todd Gloria, mayor of San Diego; and other U.S. and Chinese dignitaries and civic leaders. The event included a special Chinese musical and artistic performance and the reveal of an original Shepard Fairey artwork created to celebrate the occasion.

His mother, Zhen Zhen (jen jen), was born at the San Diego Zoo in 2007. Xin Bao is a four-year-old female, best recognized by her large, round face and big, fluffy ears.\n\nSince arriving in late June, the pair have been acclimating to their new home in the reimagined Panda Ridge. Four times larger than the previous panda habitat, the newly refreshed and expanded Panda Ridge takes inspiration from the breathtaking, lush landscapes in and around giant pandas' native habitats in Sichuan, Gansu and Shaanxi provinces in China.\n\nAn original portrait commemorating the significance of giant pandas coming to San Diego was created by California-based artist Shepard Fairey, best known for creating former President Barack Obama's iconic \"Hope\" campaign poster in 2008, and unveiled at the event. Titled \"Friendship Across the Earth,\" the portrait features Bai Yun-the beloved panda who lived at the San Diego Zoo for more than 20 years-with the words Majesty, Respect and Conservation alongside graphic representations, the globe and patterns of bamboo and flowers. Bai Yun was selected to celebrate the importance of her legacy to giant panda conservation and represent a bridge to the next generation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis year marks the 30th anniversary of the conservation partnership between San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance and China Wildlife Conservation Association. The collaboration has greatly advanced giant panda conservation, leading to the downgrading of the giant panda's status from Endangered to Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature in 2016. The efforts include developing a giant panda milk formula and other neonatal conservation techniques that dramatically increased the survival of nursery-reared cubs from less than 10% to over 90%, as well as advanced reproductive techniques and the contribution of valuable expertise to efforts led by Chinese scientists to track wild giant pandas at the Foping National Nature Reserve using GPS technology. The ongoing collaboration aims to further enhance the health and resilience of giant panda populations, especially the most vulnerable and isolated groups.\n\nStarting today, there are three ways to experience giant pandas at the San Diego Zoo. Visitors can obtain a complimentary Giant Panda Timed Ticket upon their arrival at the Zoo to skip the wait, join the standby line at Panda Ridge, or make reservations for an exclusive, Early Morning with Pandas walking tour. Advance reservations are currently being accepted for the walking tour. More information about Yun Chuan and Xin Bao, as well as how to experience them, is available at sdzwa.org/giantpandas.\n\nSan Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance wants to thank our donors for their continued support, especially Kenneth C. Griffin and Peng Zhao. We are grateful for their lead gifts, which inspire others to join them in supporting panda conservation in San Diego and around the globe. In recognition of their donations, we are pleased to name one of the habitats within Panda Ridge in their honor.\n\nAbout San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSan Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, a nonprofit conservation leader, inspires passion for nature and collaboration for a healthier world.

Atkins, California state senator; Gavin Newsom, governor of California; His Excellency Xie Feng, Chinese ambassador to the United States; Paul Baribault, president and CEO of San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance; Si Ping, deputy secretary general of China Wildlife Conservation Association; and Todd Gloria, mayor of San Diego at Panda Ridge ribbon ceremony at San Diego Zoo.\n\nPanda Ridge, the New Home for Yun Chuan and Xin Bao , Opens\n\nFollowing Celebration Attended by US and Chinese Dignitaries\n\nSAN DIEGO , Aug. 8, 2024 /CNW/ -- Yun Chuan (yoon chu-an) and Xin Bao (sing bao), the first pandas to enter the United States in 21 years, made their public debut at the San Diego Zoo today following an opening ceremony for the Zoo's much-anticipated new Panda Ridge habitat.\n\nThe ceremony was attended by Gavin Newsom , governor of California ; His Excellency Xie Feng, Chinese ambassador to the United States ; Toni G. Atkins , California state senator; Si Ping, deputy secretary general of China Wildlife Conservation Association; Todd Gloria , mayor of San Diego ; and other U.S. and Chinese dignitaries and civic leaders. The event included a special Chinese musical and artistic performance and the reveal of an original Shepard Fairey artwork created to celebrate the occasion.\n\n\"We are delighted to introduce Yun Chuan and Xin Bao to the world,\" said Paul Baribault , president and CEO of San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance. \"Guests will have an opportunity to visit with these remarkable giant pandas, be inspired by their importance, learn about all we do to help conserve them alongside our trusted Chinese partners, and join us to help protect their future.\"\n\n\"Last November, President Xi Jinping announced in San Francisco that China is ready to continue cooperation with the U.S. on panda conservation,\" said His Excellency Xie Feng, Chinese ambassador to the United States . \"The arrival of Yun Chuan and Xin Bao in San Diego as we celebrate the 45th anniversary of our diplomatic ties has sent a clear and important message: China-U.S. cooperation on panda conservation will not cease, our people-to-people exchanges and subnational cooperation will not stop, and, once opened, the door of China-U.S. friendship will not be shut again.\"\n\n\"Welcoming these national treasures to the San Diego Zoo is a proud moment for California that reflects our strong foundation of partnership with China on a host of issues, from climate action to economic development,\" said Governor Gavin Newsom . \"Working together with our international partners to protect this iconic wildlife species, we can achieve remarkable outcomes for conservation and cultural exchange, benefiting our communities and the planet.\"\n\nYun Chuan is a five-year-old male, identifiable by his long, slightly pointed nose. His mother, Zhen Zhen (jen jen), was born at the San Diego Zoo in 2007. Xin Bao is a four-year-old female, best recognized by her large, round face and big, fluffy ears.\n\nSince arriving in late June, the pair have been acclimating to their new home in the reimagined Panda Ridge. Four times larger than the previous panda habitat, the newly refreshed and expanded Panda Ridge takes inspiration from the breathtaking, lush landscapes in and around giant pandas' native habitats in Sichuan , Gansu and Shaanxi provinces in China .\n\nAn original portrait commemorating the significance of giant pandas coming to San Diego was created by California -based artist Shepard Fairey, best known for creating former President Barack Obama's iconic \"Hope\" campaign poster in 2008, and unveiled at the event. Titled \"Friendship Across the Earth,\" the portrait features Bai Yun -- the beloved panda who lived at the San Diego Zoo for more than 20 years -- with the words Majesty, Respect and Conservation alongside graphic representations, the globe and patterns of bamboo and flowers. Bai Yun was selected to celebrate the importance of her legacy to giant panda conservation and represent a bridge to the next generation.\n\nThis year marks the 30th anniversary of the conservation partnership between San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance and China Wildlife Conservation Association. The collaboration has greatly advanced giant panda conservation, leading to the downgrading of the giant panda's status from Endangered to Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature in 2016. The efforts include developing a giant panda milk formula and other neonatal conservation techniques that dramatically increased the survival of nursery-reared cubs from less than 10% to over 90%, as well as advanced reproductive techniques and the contribution of valuable expertise to efforts led by Chinese scientists to track wild giant pandas at the Foping National Nature Reserve using GPS technology. The ongoing collaboration aims to further enhance the health and resilience of giant panda populations, especially the most vulnerable and isolated groups.\n\nStarting today, there are three ways to experience giant pandas at the San Diego Zoo. Visitors can obtain a complimentary Giant Panda Timed Ticket upon their arrival at the Zoo to skip the wait, join the standby line at Panda Ridge, or make reservations for an exclusive, Early Morning with Pandas walking tour. Advance reservations are currently being accepted for the walking tour. More information about Yun Chuan and Xin Bao , as well as how to experience them, is available at sdzwa.org/giantpandas .\n\nSan Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance wants to thank our donors for their continued support, especially Kenneth C. Griffin and Peng Zhao . We are grateful for their lead gifts, which inspire others to join them in supporting panda conservation in San Diego and around the globe. In recognition of their donations, we are pleased to name one of the habitats within Panda Ridge in their honor.\n\nAbout San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance\n\nSan Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, a nonprofit conservation leader, inspires passion for nature and collaboration for a healthier world.

Here's what it means and why it's so important.\n\nAfter a month and a half of settling into their new home at San Diego Zoo, two giant pandas - Yun Chuan and Xin Bao - are receiving their first visits from the public.\n\nTheir arrival in the United States at the end of June 2024 marked the latest twist in China's use of its charismatic, bamboo-munching black-and-white bears as part of its international relations.\n\nThis \"panda diplomacy\" has a long history, that dates perhaps as far as the Tang Dynasty, which ruled from 618 through 907 CE. The movement of the animals around the world offers some insights into the ebb and flow of China's relationships with other nations.\n\nThe arrival of Yun Chuan and Zin Bao follows the recent recall of three giant pandas that had been living at the National Zoo in Washington DC and one living at the Memphis Zoo in Tennessee. Until June 2024, it left only four pandas in the US, all at the zoo in Atlanta, Georgia. Similarly, in the UK, two giant pandas that had lived at Edinburgh Zoo since 2011 were recalled in 2023.\n\nThose decisions arrived at a time when relations between Beijing and the West reached a particularly rocky phase. China and the US, for example, were navigating some decidedly tense security, humanitarian and economic challenges, according to an article about animal diplomacy from Georgetown University's Barbara Bodine, a distinguished professor of diplomacy and director of Georgetown's Institute for the Study of Diplomacy.\n\nFollowing the agreement to send the pandas to San Diego Zoo, Chinese Premier Li Qiang also offered to send pandas to Australia as the two countries restored relations following a diplomatic dispute over agricultural and mineral exports.\n\nThe renewed flurry of panda diplomacy may be part of China's pursuit of \"soft power\", explains Susan Brownell, a professor of anthropology at the University of Missouri-St. Louis and a member of the National Committee on US-China Relations, which works to promote understanding and cooperation between the two countries. Researchers at the University of Oxford have even gone so far as to chart the trajectory of China's \"soft cuddly power\" through its use of pandas in an academic paper published in 2013.\n\nSince it was founded in 1949, the People's Republic of China has used giant pandas as a gesture of goodwill towards its international allies and competitors.\n\nThe animals are native to the high, bamboo-covered mountain slopes in south-central China but now only exist in the wild in six isolated valleys within protected nature reserves, where their numbers have dwindled to just 33 populations.\n\nChinese Communist Party leader Mao Zedong sent his first \"panda ambassadors\" as gifts to the Soviet Union in 1957 when he gifted the Ping Ping and Qi Qi to the USSR to mark the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution in Russia. He also gifted pandas to other socialist allies such as North Korea, in an effort to strengthen ties.\n\nA major diplomatic milestone was reached, however, in 1972 - just two months after US President Richard Nixon made his historic journey to China in an attempt to end more than two decades of frosty relations between the two countries - when an 18-month-old pair of pandas arrived in the US as a gift. The pair, named Hsing-Hsing and Ling Ling, remained in the US until they died. Ling Ling suffered heart failure in 1992. while Hsing-Hising lived to be 28 years old before he was put to sleep due to failing health in 1999.\n\nBut Hsing-Hsing and Ling Ling were far from the first pandas to be gifted to the US. In 1941, two pandas were sent to the US as a \"thank you\" gift from China by Chiang Kai-Shek for assisting Chinese refugees during the country's war with Japan.\n\nIt wasn't until 1972 that China gifted Japan two pandas - Kang Kang and Lan Lan - when the two countries normalised diplomatic ties. Then in 1984 the \"gifts\" changed to \"loans\" where zoos would pay substantial fees towards panda conservation projects in China. It can cost zoos up to $1m (\u00a3790,000) a year to host a pair of pandas, plus the costs of housing the animals, keeping them in fresh bamboo and in good health.\n\nMore recently, panda loan deals have coincided with lucrative trade agreements - something the Oxford University academics associated with the Chinese concept of \"guanxi\", which is the development of deep relationships and networks of influence built on trust, loyalty and reciprocity.\n\nAustralia, for example, was loaned pandas in 2009, while Canada and France received pandas in 2012. The timing appeared to coincide follow lucrative uranium deals and contracts between China and these countries, suggests Kathleen Buckingham and colleagues at the Oxford University in their paper. The loan of two pandas \u00ad- Tian Tian and Yang Guang - to Edinburgh Zoo in Scotland was agreed during negotiations over contracts to supply salmon meat, Land Rover vehicles and energy technology to China.\n\nThis flurry of panda loans followed the devastating earthquake in 2008 in China's Sichuan Province, which badly damaged the Wolong Nature Reserve and Breeding Centre, meaning the animals living there needed to be rehomed.\n\nBut there are still examples where pandas are used as a way of repairing strains between China and its global neighbours. Following the March 2014 disappearance of Malaysian Airlines Flight 370, relations between China and Malaysia became fraught. The arrival of two pandas that same year in Malaysia was seen as a peace offering.\n\nChina also seems happy to use its pandas to signal displeasure too - what it gives, it can take away. In 2010, two US-born panda cubs were on an aircraft back to China two days after Chinese officials warned President Barack Obama ahead of a planned meeting between Obama and the Dalia Lama that they could take \"corresponding action\". The pandas were due to be returned to China two years earlier but stayed in the US due to their popularity with visitors.\n\nThe arrival of San Diego's new pandas - Yun Chuan and Xin Bao - makes them the first of the Chinese bears to enter the US in 21 years. They are expected to be followed by another pair of two-year-old pandas - Boa Li and Qing Bao - who are to be housed at the Smithsonian's National Zoo in Washington DC, around a year after the zoo returned three of its pandas to China. The loan agreement formed part of a 10-year research and breeding cooperation agreement.\n\nAs for what the pandas may be promising today, Brownell suggests China is hoping to broaden its influence around the world. \"They know very well that their growing economic and military strength is viewed as a threat, particularly by the political leadership of the US,\" says Brownell. \"They also understand that a big factor [of US] influence in the world comes from the appeal of its cultural products, whether it's Hollywood movies or NBA stars.\n\n\"Their use of the lovable pandas, as well as the state promotion of Olympic sports, is part of their effort to develop that kind of appeal and influence in the world.\"\n\nSan Diego Zoo's newest residents will be in the US for 10 years under the loan agreement, which will help to support conservation breeding efforts in China. The male - Yun Chuan - is the son of Zhen Zhen, a cub born at San Diego Zoo in 2007 before being returned to China in 2010, and is due to turn five years old later this year. The new female panda at San Diego Zoo, whose name Xin Bao means \"previous treasure of prosperity and abundance\", is due to turn four years old.\n\nSince arriving in the US in June, the pair have spent their first weeks away from public view, settling into their new enclosure, which features trees for climbing and rolling \"hillsides\" inspired by the mountains and canyons of China's native panda habitats. Veterinary experts from the US and China have been tracking the pandas' health after their long flight to San Diego, regularly measuring their weight, appetite and blood samples. They have also been having regular ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) scans in an effort to pick up on any health problems early.\n\nVisitors to the zoo were able to get their first look at the two pandas on 8 August when they made their public debut.\n\nSan Diego Zoo was previously home to giant pandas from 1996 until their departure in 2019 and during that time a total of six pandas were born. Bai Yun and Shi Shi gave birth to the first panda cub to survive in captivity in the US, and later Bi Yung and Gao Gao gave birth to five more cubs. There was also a substantial body of research published as a result of the breeding programme.\n\n\"There was a steady flow back and forth [between San Diego and China] of researchers, scientists and graduate students coming here and going there,\" according to Greg Vicino, vice president of wildlife care at the San Diego Zoo. \"That collaboration - when you look at the list of publications that came out of that - is overwhelming. It was a big win for conservation.\"\n\nAnd ultimately, says Vicino, conservation boils down to relationships. \"I can tell you from my own experience, having worked in this field for over 20 years now, that I naively thought conservation was about saving habitats and saving species. But I immediately found out it is about forming relationships.\" Joking that diplomacy is something he'll \"leave to the pros\", Vicino adds: \"This is really about one-on-one contact between true conservationists from different countries.\"\n\n* This article was originally published on 26 February 2024.

The event included a special Chinese musical and artistic performance and the reveal of an original artwork by Shepard Fairey created to celebrate the occasion.\n\n\"We are delighted to introduce you Yun Chuan And Xin Bao to the world,\" said Paul BaribaultPresident and CEO of the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance. \"Visitors will have the opportunity to visit these remarkable giant pandas, be inspired by their importance, learn about all we are doing to conserve them alongside our trusted Chinese partners, and join us in helping protect their future.\"\n\n\"Last November, President Xi Jinping announced in San Francisco that China \"China stands ready to continue cooperation with the United States on panda conservation,\" said His Excellency Xie Feng, Chinese Ambassador to Washington. the united states. \"The arrival of Yun Chuan And Xin Bao In San Diego \"As we celebrate the 45th anniversary of our diplomatic relations, a clear and important message has been sent: China-US cooperation on panda conservation will not cease, our people-to-people exchanges and subnational cooperation will not stop, and once the door of China-US friendship is opened, it will not close.\"\n\n\"Welcoming these national treasures to the San Diego Zoo is a proud moment for California which reflects our strong partnership base with China \"on a multitude of issues, from climate action to economic development,\" the governor said Gavin Newsom\"By working with our international partners to protect this iconic wildlife, we can achieve remarkable results in conservation and cultural exchange, benefiting our communities and the planet.\"\n\nYun Chuan is a five-year-old male, identifiable by his long, slightly pointed nose. His mother, ZhenZhen (jen jen), was born at the San Diego Zoo in 2007. Xin Bao is a four-year-old female, most recognizable by her large, round face and large, fluffy ears.\n\nSince their arrival in late June, the two partners have been acclimating to their new home, the redeveloped Panda Ridge. Four times the size of the pandas' previous habitat, the newly renovated and expanded Panda Ridge is inspired by the breathtaking, lush landscapes in and around the giant pandas' natural habitats. Sichuan, Gansu And Shaanxi provinces in China.\n\nAn original portrait commemorating the importance of the arrival of the giant pandas San Diego was created by CaliforniaShepard Fairey, a London-based artist best known for creating the former president Barack Obama The iconic poster from the 2008 \"Hope\" campaign was unveiled at the event. Entitled \"Friendship Across the Earth,\" the portrait features Bai Yun, the beloved panda who has lived at the San Diego Zoo for more than 20 years, with the words Majesty, Respect and Conservation alongside graphic representations of the globe and motifs of bamboo and flowers. Bai Yun was chosen to celebrate the importance of her legacy in giant panda conservation and to represent a bridge to the next generation.\n\nThis year marks the 30th anniversary of the conservation partnership between the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance and the China Wildlife Conservation Association. This collaboration has significantly advanced giant panda conservation, leading to the species' downlisting from endangered to vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature in 2016. Efforts include the development of a giant panda milk formula and other neonatal conservation techniques that have dramatically increased nursery-raised cub survival from less than 10 percent to more than 90 percent, as well as advanced breeding techniques and the contribution of valuable expertise to efforts by Chinese scientists to track wild giant pandas in the Foping National Nature Reserve using GPS technology. The ongoing collaboration aims to further improve the health and resilience of giant panda populations, particularly the most vulnerable and isolated groups.\n\nStarting today, there are three ways to experience giant pandas at the San Diego Zoo. Visitors can get a complimentary timed giant panda ticket upon arrival at the zoo to skip the line, join the line at Panda Ridge, or make reservations for an exclusive, early morning panda walking tour. Advance reservations are currently being accepted for the walking tour.

China owns and leases all giant pandas in U.S. zoos and for decades has lent out the animals as a sign of friendship or to strengthen national ties, a practice known as \"panda diplomacy.\"\n\nSingle-day passes cost $74 for visitors 12 and older and $64 for children ages 3 to 11. On \"value days\" designated by the zoo, those prices change to $70 and $60.\n\nWhere are they in the zoo?\n\nThe bears are in a new habitat called Panda Ridge that's four times bigger than the zoo's previous panda space. It features pools and misters to keep the bears cool and boasts rock outcroppings, lush trees and bushes inspired by Chinese forests where wild pandas roam.\n\nHow can visitors get in line to see them?\n\nZoo officials say visitors have several ways they can see the pandas.\n\nOne is to obtain a complimentary timed ticket, which can be obtained day-of at the ticket booth when admission tickets are purchased or at various locations in the main plaza. The free timed tickets are set for every 15 minutes between 9:30 a.m. and 3 p.m. The tickets are on first come, first served. The zoo said \"thousands\" of timed tickets would be issued each day.\n\nAnother less sure way is to join a standby line in person. But the zoo notes on its website that standby does not guarantee \"giant panda habitat access.\"\n\nThose wanting more time with the pandas, and the ability to reserve a sure thing, can book an exclusive, 60-minute early morning walking tour.\n\nAre there additional fees for the pandas?\n\nThe timed day-of tickets and standby line are free, but the walking tours are a new option for panda watchers and will cost you. While zoo gates typically open at 9 a.m., the tours begin at 8:15 and 8:30. Tickets are $92 to $115 per person, depending on the day, and can be booked online or by calling (619) 718-3000.\n\nAre large crowds expected at the zoo?\n\nAhead of the panda debut on Aug. 8, the city of San Diego issued a traffic alert for the area around Balboa Park and the zoo, telling locals to expect extra traffic through Aug. 11 and on weekends throughout August.\n\nWhat are the options for traveling to the zoo?\n\nDrivers can park in a lot in front of the zoo or at Inspiration Point -- with a shuttle service -- for free. For public transportation, visitors can use Rapid 215 and Route 7 MTS buses to be dropped off in front of the zoo. These bus routes are accessible from some trolley stations, including Santa Fe Depot and City College.

Atkins, California state senator; Si Ping, deputy secretary general of China Wildlife Conservation Association; Todd Gloria, mayor of San Diego; and other U.S. and Chinese dignitaries and civic leaders. The event included a special Chinese musical and artistic performance and the reveal of an original Shepard Fairey artwork created to celebrate the occasion.\n\n\"We are delighted to introduce Yun Chuan and Xin Bao to the world,\" said Paul Baribault, president and CEO of San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance. \"Guests will have an opportunity to visit with these remarkable giant pandas, be inspired by their importance, learn about all we do to help conserve them alongside our trusted Chinese partners, and join us to help protect their future.\"\n\n\"Last November, President Xi Jinping announced in San Francisco that China is ready to continue cooperation with the U.S. on panda conservation,\" said His Excellency Xie Feng, Chinese ambassador to the United States. \"The arrival of Yun Chuan and Xin Bao in San Diego as we celebrate the 45th anniversary of our diplomatic ties has sent a clear and important message: China-U.S. cooperation on panda conservation will not cease, our people-to-people exchanges and subnational cooperation will not stop, and, once opened, the door of China-U.S. friendship will not be shut again.\"\n\n\"Welcoming these national treasures to the San Diego Zoo is a proud moment for California that reflects our strong foundation of partnership with China on a host of issues, from climate action to economic development,\" said Governor Gavin Newsom. \"Working together with our international partners to protect this iconic wildlife species, we can achieve remarkable outcomes for conservation and cultural exchange, benefiting our communities and the planet.\"\n\nYun Chuan is a five-year-old male, identifiable by his long, slightly pointed nose. His mother, Zhen Zhen (jen jen), was born at the San Diego Zoo in 2007. Xin Bao is a four-year-old female, best recognized by her large, round face and big, fluffy ears.\n\nSince arriving in late June, the pair have been acclimating to their new home in the reimagined Panda Ridge. Four times larger than the previous panda habitat, the newly refreshed and expanded Panda Ridge takes inspiration from the breathtaking, lush landscapes in and around giant pandas' native habitats in Sichuan, Gansu and Shaanxi provinces in China.\n\nAn original portrait commemorating the significance of giant pandas coming to San Diego was created by California-based artist Shepard Fairey, best known for creating former President Barack Obama's iconic \"Hope\" campaign poster in 2008, and unveiled at the event. Titled \"Friendship Across the Earth,\" the portrait features Bai Yun -- the beloved panda who lived at the San Diego Zoo for more than 20 years -- with the words Majesty, Respect and Conservation alongside graphic representations, the globe and patterns of bamboo and flowers. Bai Yun was selected to celebrate the importance of her legacy to giant panda conservation and represent a bridge to the next generation.\n\nThis year marks the 30th anniversary of the conservation partnership between San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance and China Wildlife Conservation Association. The collaboration has greatly advanced giant panda conservation, leading to the downgrading of the giant panda's status from Endangered to Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature in 2016. The efforts include developing a giant panda milk formula and other neonatal conservation techniques that dramatically increased the survival of nursery-reared cubs from less than 10% to over 90%, as well as advanced reproductive techniques and the contribution of valuable expertise to efforts led by Chinese scientists to track wild giant pandas at the Foping National Nature Reserve using GPS technology. The ongoing collaboration aims to further enhance the health and resilience of giant panda populations, especially the most vulnerable and isolated groups.\n\nStarting today, there are three ways to experience giant pandas at the San Diego Zoo. Visitors can obtain a complimentary Giant Panda Timed Ticket upon their arrival at the Zoo to skip the wait, join the standby line at Panda Ridge, or make reservations for an exclusive, Early Morning with Pandas walking tour. Advance reservations are currently being accepted for the walking tour. More information about Yun Chuan and Xin Bao, as well as how to experience them, is available at sdzwa.org/giantpandas.\n\nSan Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance wants to thank our donors for their continued support, especially Kenneth C. Griffin and Peng Zhao. We are grateful for their lead gifts, which inspire others to join them in supporting panda conservation in San Diego and around the globe. In recognition of their donations, we are pleased to name one of the habitats within Panda Ridge in their honor.\n\nAbout San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance\n\nSan Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, a nonprofit conservation leader, inspires passion for nature and collaboration for a healthier world.

There are four other giant pandas in the U.S. that live at Zoo Atlanta, though they are expected to return to China later this year.\n\nPandas have been used by China for \"major political and diplomatic\" needs and have featured in relations with the U.S. since President Richard Nixon visited China in 1972. Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai gifted two pandas to the U.S., Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing, after First Lady Patricia Nixon mentioned her love of the animals. The two pandas arrived at Washington D.C.'s National Zoo in 1972 and had five cubs over the next 20 years, though none survived into adulthood. After Ling-Ling died in 1992, the zoo was without pandas until a second pair arrived in late 2000, as the zoo paid the Chinese government $10 million in exchange for 10 years of keeping the pandas. The zoo announced in November the three pandas remaining at the zoo, 26-year-old Tian Tian, 25-year-old Mei Xiang and their 3-year-old cub Xiao Qi, would return to the China Wildlife Conservation Association in Chengdu.

Yun Chuan is the son of Zhen Zhen, a female panda born at the San Diego Zoo in 2007, and the grandchild of Bai Yun and Gao Gao, who lived at the San Diego Zoo in the early 2000s.\n\nGovernor Newsom and First Partner Siebel Newsom at Panda Ridge\n\nYun Chuan and Xin Bao at their new home in San Diego Zoo\n\nThis year marks the 30th anniversary of the conservation partnership between San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance and China Wildlife Conservation Association. The collaboration has greatly advanced giant panda conservation, leading to the downgrading of the giant panda's status from Endangered to Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature in 2016. This cooperation helps further the broader collaboration between California and Chinese partners on protecting biodiversity and advancing 30\u00d730 efforts worldwide.\n\n\"We are delighted to introduce Yun Chuan and Xin Bao to the world,\" said Paul Baribault, President and CEO of San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance. \"Guests will have an opportunity to visit with these remarkable giant pandas, be inspired by their importance, learn about all we do to help conserve them alongside our trusted Chinese partners, and join us to help protect their future.\"\n\nThe state hopes that this conservation collaboration will lead to further exchanges and cooperation between California and China, which have a strong foundation of partnership built by Governors Schwarzenegger and Brown and the late Senator Dianne Feinstein, as well as Governor Newsom while serving as Mayor of San Francisco.\n\nThe celebration today included the unveiling of an original portrait by California-based artist Shepard Fairey depicting Bai Yun, Yun Chuan's maternal grandmother who lived at the San Diego Zoo for more than 20 years.\n\nLearn more about the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance's innovative

It's science!", "body": "SAN DIEGO -- The new giant pandas make their public debut Thursday at the San Diego Zoo and police are anticipating such huge crowds that they've issued a traffic alert for the area.\n\nSo what is it about pandas that makes us love them so much? Turns out, the answer involves science.\n\n\"They have something about them that really draws people in and there's a certain term that I think of, sometimes called neoteny,\" said Marco Wendt with the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance. Neoteny is the retention of juvenile features in the adult animal.\n\nFor example, one of our new pandas, Yun Chuan, is almost 5 years old but he still has baby-like qualities and that triggers something in our brains that makes us want to cuddle and protect him.\n\n\"There's been a study that shows that babies have bigger eyes and those ears and makes us more connected,\" Wendt said. \"You want to protect that baby.\"\n\nYun Chuan's patches make his eyes look bigger, his ridiculously cute ears stick out and, like a human baby, he has a roly-poly body. So it's not your fault you love Pandas, it's Mother Nature's!\n\nAnd pandas aren't the only animals that get you this way.\n\n\"There's another very popular animal here called an axolotl, or ajolote depending on how you want to pronounce it, that also is in that neotenic state,\" Wendt said. \"And so they have big eyes, they have fringes sort of a childlike feature that that I think humans really gravitate towards.\"\n\nDomesticated dogs are another example.\n\n\"Eventually through the years of domestication, the wolf started developing larger ears, you know, bigger eyes, a big nose, started waging a tail,\" Wendt said. \"So all these certain features that we invariably have bred into this particular animal because we connect with it.\"\n\nAll of that said, pandas, despite their cuteness, do not make great pets. They can attack when threatened and have sharp claws and teeth.\n\n\"The pressure of a giant panda's jaw is so powerful that there is some bamboo in the world that they eat that has the fibrous strength of low grade steel... to give you an idea of how powerful the panda can really be,\" Wendt added.\n\nYun Chuan and his Panda Ridge pal Xin Bao are so popular, the zoo is recommending guests secure a timed ticket as soon as you arrive. There is also a standby line, but your wait could be several hours.\n\nWATCH RELATED: Pandas settle in at San Diego Zoo after journey from China", "source": {"uri": "cbs8.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "cbs8.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoteny", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Neoteny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_panda", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Giant panda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Zoo", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Zoo"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axolotl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Axolotl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Domestication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wolf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamboo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bamboo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Claw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tooth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Animals", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.cbs8.com/assets/KFMB/images/c159d6c7-1003-4f1f-b87d-601ebfab7239/20240808T003353/c159d6c7-1003-4f1f-b87d-601ebfab7239_1140x641.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796530", "eventUri": "eng-9796530", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Now They Have to Leave.", "body": "The Port of San Diego is preparing to take action to force out several migrant families who settled in a Barrio Logan park in the absence of other options.\n\nVoice of San Diego contributor Kate Morrissey reports that police warned the asylum-seeking families early Wednesday that they'd need to move or face arrest.\n\nThe families say they settled in the park because they weren't sure where else to go. Migrant shelters can't accommodate families indefinitely if they don't have sponsors who can receive them in the United States and homeless shelters are full.\n\nThe Port says it's trying to approach community concerns about the families' makeshift homes with \"compassion and humanity\" but also must preserve park access for others. It's unclear when the agency might crack down.\n\nFor now, Morrissey reports, the families are staying in a hotel with support from a local organization but it's unclear how long they can remain - and where else they might go when they must leave.\n\nRead the full story.\n\nSan Diego City Council President Sean Elo-Rivera ended his effort to cut-out the hours that Covid-era virtual public comment sometimes adds to government meetings.\n\nHe announced Thursday he'd no longer be pursuing those changes after constituents in his district and other stakeholders decried the move, according to Fox 5 San Diego. Those in favor of virtual comment periods argued last month when the change was before the council's Rules Committee that it brought more public participation and therefore transparency and accountability.\n\nThe birth of virtual public comment periods began during Covid-19 when the city shifted most of its operations online to prevent spread of the illness. But the city never ended the option after Covid restrictions lifted and life went back to normal.\n\nElo-Rivera said it's caused delays and protracted meetings as well as a rise in profanity and hate-based comments that often come from the anonymity of virtually commenting, instead of the traditional way of showing up in the flesh at a public meeting to voice concerns.\n\nNowhere has the civil discourse grown more profane than before the San Diego County Board of Supervisors, according to an analysis of incivility during these periods since the pandemic. The shift in civil to profane discourse at meetings shifted around 2021 as the county became the face of Covid restrictions. Some of the remarks were so extreme, San Diego commenters drew national attention from late-night talk shows.\n\nIn case you haven't heard, which is unlikely, China returned a pair of giant pandas to the San Diego Zoo and their exhibit is now open (take the bus there if you can). Gov. Gavin Newsom subsequently declared Aug. 8 as California Panda Day.\n\nThe exchange of pandas between China and the U.S. is known as \"panda diplomacy\" and symbolizes friendship between the two nations. China took back its pandas from San Diego in 2019 when a loan agreement ended, also signaling a souring of diplomatic relations.\n\nSouthwestern China is home to these pandas' only natural habitat (though they used to roam Myanmar and northern Vietnam) and therefore the country owns most of the giant pandas in the world, according to the Washington Post. The roots of panda diplomacy date back to as early as 685 A.D. when Empress Wu Zetian of the Tang Dynasty presented two pandas as a gift to the Japanese emperor. China stopped giving bears away in 1984, substituting renewable, years-long contracts for bears instead. Yet only about 1,864 pandas live in the wild today. They subsist mainly on bamboo shoots and leaves.\n\nThere.

Their older brother, Tian Bao, will accompany them on the journey.\n\nPairi Daiza, which has been home to giant pandas since 2014, has emerged as a major global attraction, partly due to its involvement in China's giant panda conservation program.\n\nCentral to this initiative are Xing Hui and Hao Hao, a panda pair on loan from China, whose offspring - Bao Mei and Bao Di - were born on Aug. 8, 2019. The twins have captivated thousands of visitors from both Belgium and abroad, contributing to the park's status as one of Europe's most visited zoos, drawing millions each year.\n\nChina's conservation efforts, in collaboration with institutions like Pairi Daiza, have played a crucial role in boosting the wild panda population from just 1,200 in the 1980s to 1,864 today. Pairi Daiza has further supported these efforts by aiding in the establishment of a 27,000 square-kilometer nature reserve across the Gansu, Shaanxi, and Sichuan provinces, dedicated to enhancing the genetic diversity of giant pandas.\n\nAccording to the agreement governing the pandas' stay in Belgium, all offspring must be returned to China by a certain age to contribute to species conservation. The farewell celebration at the park was an emotional event, with the pandas enjoying specially prepared treats from their keepers while visitors captured lasting memories at a photo booth near the park's entrance. \u25a0", "source": {"uri": "english.news.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "english.news.cn"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pairi_Daiza", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pairi Daiza"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_panda", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Giant panda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_biology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservation biology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinhua_News_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xinhua News Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brugelette", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brugelette"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brugelette"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_diversity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genetic diversity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nature reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Province"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gansu", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gansu"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gansu"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaanxi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shaanxi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shaanxi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sichuan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sichuan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Individual_Parks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Individual Parks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Defunct", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Defunct", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Water_Parks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Water Parks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 78}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796530", "eventUri": "eng-9796530", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 10, "textEnd": 16}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-08-08", "textStart": 631, "textEnd": 643}], "sentiment": 0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

It's about celebrating the things that bind us together.\"\n\nUntil recently, the loan of the two pandas seemed an unlikely dream.\n\nWith fierce trade competition, and disagreements over Taiwan and human rights, tensions between China and the United States have been rising for several years -- to the point that Beijing's traditional \"panda diplomacy\" seemed to have frozen.\n\nIn recent years, pandas at zoos in Washington DC, Atlanta and Memphis were all returned to Beijing, after loan agreements were not renewed.\n\nHowever, at a key summit between US President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping in November, the latter announced that Beijing would continue the program in the United States.\n\nChina's loaning of pandas around the world is both a diplomatic symbol and a way to help the survival of a vulnerable species.\n\nIn addition to San Diego, pandas are expected to return to zoos in Washington and San Francisco by 2025.\n\n- 'Our shared future' -\n\nChina first offered its pandas to the United States in 1972 under US President Richard Nixon.\n\nSince then, the country has used its loan of the black-and-white bears to send diplomatic messages.\n\nFor instance, after President Barack Obama met with the Dalai Lama in 2010, who is seen as a rebel by Beijing, China recalled two of its pandas.\n\nThe San Diego Zoo has enjoyed a decades-long partnership with Chinese authorities, having received two pandas in 1996 that gave birth to six cubs in captivity.\n\nAll of the pandas were returned to China in 2019, in line with earlier agreements.\n\nThe return of the pandas is not only a boon for the zoo, where their presence attracts thousands of visitors a year, but also supports the propagation of the species, which is notoriously difficult in the wild.\n\nZoo officials described four-year-old Yun Chuan as a \"mild-mannered, gentle and lovable\" male, who was named after his grandmother, Bai Yun, one of the initial two pandas loaned to San Diego.\n\nThe other panda, three-year-old female Xin Bao, is a \"gentle and witty introvert,\" zoo officials said. Her name means a \"new treasure of prosperity and abundance.\"\n\n\"We hope she will bring you good luck to California, to San Diego,\" China's ambassador to the United States Xie Feng said.",

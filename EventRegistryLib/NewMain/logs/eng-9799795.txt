It was recently revealed that Carlson had been diagnosed with prostate cancer and was needing support for his medical bills.\n\nKarlson was dining at a restaurant in Brisbane in 1991 when police entered the premises and dragged him from his seat and into a police car.\n\nKarlson was filmed delivering a range of Shakespearean-like lines protesting police officers' actions during the famous arrest, which resurfaced and went viral in 2009.\n\nAs he was being hauled into the police car, he turned to the news camera: \"Gentlemen, this is democracy manifest. Have a look at the headlock here,\" he said as the police manhandled him against the car.\n\n\"Get your hand off my penis! This is the bloke who got me on the penis, people.\"\n\nAsking the police officers why they'd arrested him, he declared: \"What is the charge? Eating a meal? A succulent Chinese meal?\n\n\"That's a nice headlock, Sir. Ah, I see that you know your judo well,\" Karlson told police.\n\nJack Karlson told news viewers during his arrest: \"Gentlemen, this is democracy manifest!\"\n\nTo make matters worse, Karlson's 1991 arrest turned out to be a case of mistaken identity.\n\nPolice believed Karlson was an international criminal from Hungary who used to rob restaurants.\n\nThe video blew up online nearly two decades after it happened and remains one of the most iconic memes of the internet's early days, with multiple uploads and edits collectively pulling hundreds of millions of views.\n\nSeven Network reporter Chris Reason remembers reporting on the mishap, recently sharing how he was given a tip that one of Queensland's most wanted men had used a stolen credit card to pay for his meal. Reason had rushed to the venue to see it unfold.\n\nKim Edwards, the niece of the man who went viral for his controversial arrest, had started a Gofundme in June with the hope of raising funds for her uncle's treatment.\n\n\"My name is Kim and I am the niece of Jack Karlson. You might know him as the man who ate a Succulent Chinese Meal or Mr Democracy Manifest,\" she wrote on Gofundme.\n\n\"He has recently been diagnosed with prostate cancer and is also in need a surgery on his cataracts.\n\n\"I know Jack's video has given a lot of people joy and he has inspired many memes, T-shirts and other things over the years, but Jack himself is doing it quite tough.\n\n\"He has never had much money but has always been generous to family and friends. He lives week-to-week in regional Queensland with the help of a voluntary carer.\n\n\"Hoping people can dig deep - I think he's worth at least a beer, maybe even a six-pack.\"\n\nEdwards said the donations would go towards paying for his medical bills and transport to and from the doctor, as well as other general living costs while he fought cancer.", "source": {"uri": "newstalkzb.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewstalkZB"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nz_herald@newstalkzb.co.nz", "name": "Nz Herald", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brisbane"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brisbane"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_cuisine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chinese cuisine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prostate cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Australian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Australian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet meme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Judo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Manifest", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy Manifest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Reason", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Reason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reason (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Network", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seven Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cataract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shirt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T-shirt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoFundMe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GoFundMe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surgery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Queensland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Queensland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/media/142ntksu/jack-karlson.jpg?rmode=crop&rnd=133675954589200000&height=395&width=635&quality=95&scale=both", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799795", "eventUri": "eng-9799795", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2941176470588235, "wgt": 227, "relevance": 1}

He was 82.\n\nKarlson rose to fame by virtue of his vocal objection to being arrested outside the China Sea Restaurant in Brisbane, Queensland in the early '90s. In the viral video shot by 7NEWS, Karlson dramatically resisted several police officers' efforts to escort him into a car. Rather than go quietly, Karlson theatrically declared that what is happening to him is a demonstration of democracy in action, and demanded to know the reason for his arrest.\n\n\"Gentlemen, this is democracy manifest,\" Karlson announced. \"What is the charge? Eating a meal? A succulent Chinese meal?\"\n\nHe also shouted at the police to \"get your hand off my penis,\" and complimented them on their headlock, saying, \"I see that you know your judo well.\" Karlson is not seen in a headlock during the video, and later admitted that nobody had touched his genitals.\n\nWhile Karlson's arrest was filmed on Oct. 11, 1991, it didn't make its way online until almost two decades later. Uploaded to YouTube in 2009, the short clip eventually permeated the public consciousness, becoming a viral meme enjoyed across the globe. The clip is now so well-known that it was even referenced in Netflix's Australian series Heartbreak High.\n\nDespite the video going viral, Karlson's identity remained a mystery until 2020, when he publicly stepped forward as the man in the clip. His later years were spent on art, with Karlson attempting to earn money by painting scenes from his famous arrest.\n\nKarlson had been battling prostate cancer at the time of his passing. He died in hospital, surrounded by loved ones.\n\nTributes have poured in on social media, with many stating their intention to enjoy a succulent Chinese meal in his honour.\n\nAmong those paying their respects is 7NEWS senior reporter Chris Reason, whose work as a junior reporter brought us the meme. Karlson and Reason recently met for the first time in June, when 7NEWS reunited them and Stoll Watt, one of the arresting officers. The men shared a succulent Chinese meal at the China Sea, which had relocated to Milton in the intervening years and still has the same owner.\n\nThe reunion was sparked by a documentary about Karlson's life that is currently in production, with The Man Who Ate A Succulent Chinese Meal currently scheduled for release in March next year.\n\nBorn as Cecil George Edwards, Karlson already had an interesting history prior to his famous arrest, Australia's ABC News reports. A criminal, actor, and serial prison escapee, Karlson survived childhood abuse and spent much of his life in various homes, institutions, and prisons.\n\nKarlson's first prison break reportedly took place in 1966 when, charged with stealing, he slipped his handcuffs and jumped from a train, taking him from jail to court. Subsequently incarcerated at an island prison farm for another theft, Karlson's second escape reportedly occurred in 1968 when he persuaded a local fisherman to take him to Australia's mainland.\n\nHe was arrested yet again just three months after that escape, caught with safe-cracking tools in a stolen car. This time Karlson impersonated a police detective and simply walked out of his cell in the court shortly before his trial, an escape he later said he was \"pretty proud of.\"\n\nAfter he was finally caught for good, Karlson was sentenced to eight years in prison. However he was eventually released after only four, thanks to his work with his cellmate Jim McNeal. McNeal discovered a talent for writing, eventually becoming a celebrated playwright whose works were staged across Australia. Meanwhile, Karlson discovered an affinity for acting, performing in his cellmate's plays while the two were behind bars.\n\nThey remained good friends after their release, with Karlson even naming his son after McNeal. Though legal issues prevented him from attending McNeal's funeral in 1982, Karlson claimed he used a fake identity to buy \"hundreds and hundreds of dollars worth of flowers and wreaths.\"\n\nKarlson also continued to act, appearing on crime shows such as Homicide and Matlock Police. However, his theatrical ambitions were brought to a halt when he reportedly went underground after his 1991 arrest.\n\nThough speculation has long persisted that the \"democracy manifest\" man was a prolific dine-and-dasher, Karlson always maintained he was having a perfectly legal lunch when he was arrested.\n\nOn that fateful day in October 1991, Karlson and a friend had been enjoying said \"succulent Chinese meal\" at one of his favourite restaurants when the police showed up to arrest him. Due to a call from a private fraud investigator, the authorities believed Karlson had been paying for his meals with stolen credit cards -- and was one of Queensland's most wanted criminals.\n\n\"He was happy to go with us. Well, as happy as you can be, to be arrested,\" Adam Firman, another police officer involved, told the ABC. \"Until he saw all the media. And that's when he just went berserk.\"\n\nKarlson successfully made bail after his arrest, despite being wanted for questioning for fraud in another state. He then disappeared, keeping a low profile for decades. To this day, it's still unclear whether he was the dine-and-dasher the police had been searching for, or if he had been wrongly accused.\n\nHe also gave varying accounts as to why he behaved as he did on the day of his arrest. When he was first identified as the viral video's star in 2020, Karlson stated that he had wanted the police to think he was mentally unwell.\n\n\"I wanted them to think I was... a lunatic so they'd send me to a lunatic asylum so I could escape from there,\" said Karlson, per The Sydney Morning Herald.\n\nThen in a 7NEWS Brisbane interview in 2022, the viral star claimed it was an effort to demonstrate his innocence -- as well as a result of the wine he'd drunk.\n\n\"I thought, 'Here's an opportunity to prove my innocence, because they've dragged me out, thinking I was some sort of international gangster, when I knew that I wasn't,\" Karlson explained to the broadcaster. \"Here's a chance, the camera, for the people of Australia and to let democracy manifest itself gloriously. That's why I carried on like that. Of course, I was somewhat influenced by the juice of the red grape.\"\n\nHowever, he told ABC News earlier this year that he couldn't remember why he made such declarations. Whatever the reason, his words will now live forever as one of the most prolific memes in Australian culture.\n\n\"It was a great line, I think he should have gotten the Academy Award,\" Watt said of Karlson's false claim that the former had touched his penis. \"I think he would have been a great actor.\"", "source": {"uri": "mashable.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mashable"}, "authors": [],

In the footage, he flamboyantly resisted arrest while dining at a Brisbane restaurant, delivering several memorable lines.\n\nPolice entered the restaurant and dragged Karlson from his seat, suspecting him of being an international criminal who robbed restaurants. The mistaken identity led to a dramatic scene captured on camera. As he was being taken to a police car, Karlson turned to the news camera and exclaimed, \"Gentlemen, this is democracy manifest. Have a look at the headlock here.\"\n\nAnother memorable line from the incident was, \"Get your hand off my penis! This is the bloke who got me on the penis, people.\" Karlson continued questioning the police officers and famously asked, \"What is the charge? Eating a meal? A succulent Chinese meal?\" He also remarked, \"That's a nice headlock, Sir. Ah, I see that you know your judo well.\"\n\nKarlson's arrest became one of the most iconic memes of the early internet era after the video resurfaced nearly two decades later. Multiple uploads and edits of the video have collectively garnered hundreds of millions of views.\n\nSeven Network reporter Chris Reason, who reported on the incident, recently recounted how he was tipped off that one of Queensland's most wanted men had used a stolen credit card to pay for his meal. Reason hurried to the venue to witness the arrest unfold.\n\nKim Edwards, Karlson's niece, launched a GoFundMe campaign in June to raise funds for her uncle's treatment. On the page, she wrote, \"My name is Kim and I am the niece of Jack Karlson. You might know him as the man who ate a Succulent Chinese Meal or Mr Democracy Manifest.\"\n\nShe further explained, \"He has recently been diagnosed with prostate cancer and is also in need of surgery on his cataracts. I know Jack's video has given a lot of people joy and he has inspired many memes, T-shirts and other things over the years, but Jack himself is doing it quite tough. He has never had much money but has always been generous to family and friends. He lives week-to-week in regional Queensland with the help of a voluntary carer. Hoping people can dig deep, I think he's worth at least a beer, maybe even a six-pack.\"\n\nEdwards stated that the donations would be used to cover medical bills, transport to and from the doctor, and general living costs while Karlson fought cancer. The campaign's goal was set at AU$50,000 ($54,362), and as of August 8, it had raised over $8572 for Karlson.\n\nLast week his niece said Karlson wasn't doing well in an update to the fundraiser.\n\nShe wrote, \"He has been in Hospital for two weeks now. He has had multiple procedures but things are not looking good. One thing that did lift his spirits was that the GoFundMe was taking off. He has been really appreciative of the donations and the comments.\"\n\nA documentary about Karlson, The Man Who Ate a Succulent Chinese Meal, is set for release in 2025.\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

He was 82.\n\nIt was in 1991 in Brisbane's Fortitude Valley, outside China Sea Restaurant, that Karlson bellowed the words that would etch him into viral history.\n\nWATCH THE VIDEO ABOVE: 7NEWS interviews Mr Democacy Manifest, Jack Karlson.\n\n\"What is the charge? Eating a meal, a succulent Chinese meal?\"\n\nWhile the footage of the famous arrest featured on the evening's news, technology at time dictated the tape would sit shelved in news archive rooms.\n\nIt wasn't until 2009 that the footage was uploaded to the internet. By whom isn't entirely clear.\n\nIt went viral. Massively.\n\nMultiple postings have racked up hundreds of millions of views, while there have been countless reaction videos, spoofs and re-cuts.\n\nOver time, it morphed into a borderline cultural phenomenon.\n\nKarlson and his words featured on clothing, wine bottles, tattoos, in a music video -- the list goes on. A racehorse was called Democracy Manifest.\n\nSo who was the \"Democracy Manifest\" and/or \"Succulent Chinese Meal\" man?\n\nSpeculation abounded as the footage emerged, including that Karlson was a Hungarian chess player wanted for his habit of dine-and-dashing.\n\nTurns out, police at the time weren't entirely sure either.\n\nReports at the time suggested Karlson, then known as Cecil George Edwards, had been arrested on suspicion of being a criminal high on Queensland police's wanted list.\n\nBut Karlson, despite having a criminal history himself, was the wrong man.\n\nDuring an interview with 7NEWS Brisbane in 2022, Karlson recalled that a man inside the restaurant appeared to be watching him while he was dining.\n\n\"We were enjoying a succulent meal, with many glasses of the grape juice, of course, the red grape,\" Karlson told 7NEWS.\n\n\"There was a suspicious-looking character a couple of tables away looking at us, and every time I'd turn, he'd put his head down and pop a dim-sim into his gob.\n\n\"The police fell on the place, come running in. One of them had a gun in his hand. I said, 'what the devil is going on here? What do you want?'.\"\n\nKarlson said police accused him of being an \"international criminal\", to which he claims to have responded, \"I'm just a poor, struggling artist\".\n\n\"They took me out and there was all these TV cameras outside and there it is, that's what you see on the internet now,\" he said.\n\nSo how did Karlson improvise a performance so poetic, so theatrical and so amusing?\n\nWell, for one, he was tipsy.\n\n\"I thought, 'Here's an opportunity to prove my innocence, because they've dragged me out, thinking I was some sort of international gangster, when I knew that I wasn't,\" he said.\n\n\"Here's a chance, the camera, for the people of Australia and to let democracy manifest itself gloriously.\n\n\"That's why I carried on like that.\n\n\"Of course, I was somewhat influenced by the juice of the red grape.\n\n\"We're supposed to be living in a democracy, and here they are dragging me out of a restaurant while enjoying, halfway through a succulent Chinese meal -- that's what I thought, 'Well, gentlemen, this is democracy manifest',\" he said.\n\nKarlson spent the latter years of his life at his home in rural Queensland, \"trying to make a quid\" from his fame by painting portraits of his arrest and getting his face on other merchandise.\n\nHe died surrounded by loved ones in hospital after being diagnosed with prostate cancer this year.\n\nAs Karlson himself said in the video, \"Tata and farewell\".", "source": {"uri": "7news.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "7NEWS.com.au"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He was 82.\n\nNews.com.au reported that Karlson died Wednesday surrounded by family after battling pancreatic cancer. He also had many other health conditions, including systemic inflammatory response syndrome.\n\n\"He walked a full and colorful path and despite the troubles thrown at him, he lived by his motto - to keep on laughing,\" the family said in a statement to news.com.au.\n\nThough the original incident which made Karlson famous, and much loved, occurred in 1991, it wasn't until footage of his arrest was uploaded to internet video sites in 2009 that he gained worldwide notoriety. The surreal clip captured Karlson's booming voice, his dexterous and vivid use of language, his natural theatricality as well as his love of succulent Chinese food, instantly making him a cult hero, and immensely quotable figure.\n\nIn the clip of the incident that occurred in Oct. 1991, Karlson is seen being led out of the China Sea Restaurant in Brisbane by a quite ludicrous number of police officers. Karlson was accused of using a stolen credit card, although ultimately it was a case of mistaken identity, things escalated as police tried to arrest him. Waiting outside the restaurant is a gaggle of press as they witness first hand Karlson verbally spar with authorities.\n\n\"You just assured me I could speak,\" says Karlson as he exits the restaurant. As six police officers attempt to put him inside a car, they tell him he is under arrest.\n\n\"I'm under what? Gentlemen, this is democracy manifest!\" an indignant Karlson booms to the watching press.\n\nThings begin to get testy. \"Have a look at the headlock here,\" says Karlson as the police try to man handle him. \"See that chap over.... get your hand off my penis! This is the bloke who got me on the penis, people,\" he cries, although it is difficult to see what is happening from the clip.\n\n\"Why did you do this to me?\" pleads Karlson.\n\n\"Get in the car,\" says a police officer, seemingly frustrated with the situation. \"For what reason?\" replies Karlson. He adds, \"What is the charge? Eating a meal? A succulent Chinese meal?\"\n\nThings begin to escalate. \"Oh that's a nice headlock, sir,\" Karlson says as the police step up their attempts to put him in a car. \"Oh! Ah I see that you know your judo well. Good one.\"\n\nNoticing a police officer waiting for him inside the car, Karlson inquires, \"And you sir, are you waiting to receive my limp penis?\"\n\n\"How dare you?!\" screams Karlson as he is finally overpowered. \"Get your hands off me.\"\n\nDefeated, Karlson bids adieu to the crowds. \"Tata! And farewell!\"\n\nIn a May 2021 interview with 7News, Karlson spoke about the incident, saying that \"we're supposed to be living in a democracy, and here they are dragging me out of a restaurant, halfway through a succulent Chinese meal. Well I thought, 'Gentleman, this is democracy manifest.\"\n\nHe added that when he saw the cameras outside the restaurant, he saw it as a chance to proclaim his innocence to the world. \"I thought, 'well here's an opportunity to prove my innocence. Because they've dragged me out, thinking I was some sort of international gangster, when I knew that I wasn't.\"\n\n\"So here's a chance, for the camera, for the people of Australia, to let democracy manifest itself gloriously, and that's why I carried on like that. Of course, I had been somewhat influenced by the juice of the great grape,\" Karlson said.\n\nKarlson, who has dabbled in acting but was also a professional painter, rarely spoke about the incident until it went viral on the internet. He told 7News that he didn't realize how famous he was until someone approached him with a business idea. \"It took me many years for someone to show me it was up there on the internet. Until someone approached me and said can we put it up, and sell bottles of wine with your face. The wine incidentally is called Get Your Hands Off My Pinot Noir.

See that chap over there? Get your hand off my penis! Get your hand off my penis,' he roared with gusto.\n\nThough he is famous for getting arrested in 1991 - video of which has been going viral for years - the late Jack Karlson (pictured) always maintained that all was not as it seemed\n\nJack Karlson, who died on Wednesday surrounded by family, is pictured with his niece Kim Edwards\n\nRead More The incredible untold story of the man behind the viral 'Succulent Chinese Meal' arrest video\n\n'This is the bloke who got me on the penis before. Why did you do this to me? For what reason? What is the charge? Eating a meal? A succulent Chinese meal?'\n\nIn his later years, Mr Karlson suffered from many health conditions, including systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and cancer.\n\nKarlson died on Wednesday surrounded by loved ones.\n\n'He walked a full and colourful path and despite the troubles thrown at him, he lived by his motto - to keep on laughing,' a family statement read.\n\n'Jack leaves daughter Heidi, his son Erik, his nieces Kim, Kelly and Kerry, and nephew Karl, grandchildren Terri-Lace and Nec and many grand nieces and nephews behind, along with countless others whose lives he touched. He will be sorely missed.'\n\nHis niece Kim Edwards revealed that Karlson had spent the last few weeks of his life in hospital.\n\nAnd just as he had done while in custody decades ago, he tried to free himself from the hospital too.\n\n'He had a few attempts to escape and pulled his cords out a couple of times and asked us many time to sneak in his pipe,' Ms Edwards said.\n\n'He was battling many ailments but what got him in the end was SIRS.'\n\nA fundraiser was set up for Karlson after he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and needed surgery for cataracts, and has so far generated more than $8,500 in funds.\n\n'He was very thankful for the positive response to his GoFundMe and everyone who donated,' Ms Edwards said.\n\n'This money will now go towards his funeral.\n\n'As a final send off we gave uncle a last taste of red wine through his drip just before it was removed.\n\n'We are still deciding what we want to do in regards to the funeral. We will post updates on the GoFundMe page.'\n\nMs Edwards previously said she hoped people could 'dig deep' to support her uncle.\n\n'I know Jack's video has given a lot of people joy and he has inspired many memes, t-shirts and other things over the years but Jack himself is doing it quite tough,' she wrote.\n\n'He has never had much money but has always been generous to family and friends. He lives week to week in regional QLD with the help of a voluntary carer.\n\n'Hoping people can dig deep - I think he's worth at least a beer, maybe even a 6-pack.'\n\nLast week his niece said Karlson wasn't doing well in an update to the fundraiser.\n\n'He has been in hospital for two weeks now,' she wrote. 'He has had multiple procedures but things are not looking good.\n\n'One thing that did lift his spirits was that the GoFundMe was taking off. He has been really appreciative of the donations and the comments.'\n\nA documentary about Karlson, The Man who Ate a Succulent Chinese Meal, is set for release next year.\n\nDirector Heath Davis said the crew is 'heartbroken' with the news of Karlson's death, calling him an 'icon'.\n\n'Jack lived a life unlike any other. In fact, he's such a larger than life figure who's survived such adversity, it's hard to believe he's left us,' he said.\n\n'Jack's inherent ability to always see the bright side of life despite the insurmountable hardship is something I'll carry forward with me in my own life.\n\n'There really is only one Jack Karlson and he truly was Australia's last larrikin.'\n\nKarlson (pictured centre) always claimed his 1991 arrest was a case of mistaken identity\n\nMr Davis said Australia has 'lost an icon'.\n\n'Our thoughts and prayers go out to his beloved family today especially his daughter Heidi, niece Kim and nephew Karl,' he said.\n\n'Jack's spark will forever live on much like his infamous viral video.\n\n'I'll be having a beer and a succulent Chinese meal in his honour tonight. You can finally rest in peace, mate.'\n\nHe said telling Karlson's story was an 'honour and privilege' and confirmed the team remains committed to bringing the documentary to the big screen.\n\n'Collaborating with Jack has been one of the most rewarding and fascinating creative journeys to date.'\n\nOutside of the famous arrest, Karlson was known for several prison escapes throughout his life.\n\nKarlson told ABC's Earshot how he had escaped from Boggo Road Gaol in 1996 by jumping off a train on the way to a court hearing for breaking, entering and stealing.\n\nHe added on a separate occasion he had walked out of his court cell and impersonated a detective after he was arrested in a stolen car in the western Sydney suburb of Parramatta.", "source": {"uri":

This is the bloke who got me on the penis, people.\"\n\n\"And you sir, are you waiting to receive my limp penis?\" he asked a police officer waiting for him in the police car - another iconic line that went on to inspire memes as well as several remixes, featuring Batman and Obi-Wan Kenobi.\n\nKarlson spoke about the arrest in an interview in May 2021, explaining what was behind the \"democracy manifest\" line.\n\n\"We're supposed to be living in a democracy, and here they are dragging me out of a restaurant, halfway through a succulent Chinese meal. Well I thought, 'Gentleman, this is democracy manifest,'\" he told 7News.\n\n\"I thought, 'well here's an opportunity to prove my innocence. Because they've dragged me out, thinking I was some sort of international gangster, when I knew that I wasn't,\" on seeing the cameras and press waiting outside.\n\n\"So here's a chance, for the camera, for the people of Australia, to let democracy manifest itself gloriously, and that's why I carried on like that. Of course, I had been somewhat influenced by the juice of the great grape.\"\n\nA documentary on Karlson, titled The Man who Ate a Succulent Chinese Meal, is currently in production. It is being directed by Heath Davis and is set for an early 2025 release.\n\nDavis has said he believes Karlson's name was really Cecil George Edwards, and that he has managed to find stories about how Karlson managed to escape prison; his methods include picking the lock that had him cuffed to a sleeping police officer, jumping off a moving train, and swimming away from a prison island and being rescued by someone out fishing.\n\nHe told ABC news that the escape he was \"pretty proud of\" was when he impersonated a detective and walked out of his court cell before trial.\n\nKarlson, who was a part-time actor, spent a childhood in and out of institutions, homes, and prisons.\n\n\"A regular person who experienced his life would have passed away years ago,\" Davis said, reported The Guardian.\n\n\"But Jack just had this zest for life that made you go: this guy is made of mercury...he might just live forever\".\n\nA biography on Karlson's life titled Carnage: A Succulent Chinese Meal, Mr. Rent-a-Kill and the Australian Manson Murders and written by true crime author Mark Dapin was published in 2023.\n\nKarlson has said he had no idea how famous he was on the Internet until someone came to him, saying they wanted to sell bottles of wine with his face.\n\n\"It took me many years for someone to show me it was up there on the internet. Until someone approached me and said can we put it up, and sell bottles of wine with your face,\" he said.\n\n\"The wine incidentally is called Get Your Hands Off My Pinot Noir. And I said 'Go ahead, as long as I get a cut out of it.'\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_cuisine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chinese cuisine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succulent_plant", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Succulent plant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Penis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Internet meme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motto", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prostate cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brisbane"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brisbane"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortitude_Valley,_Queensland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fortitude Valley, Queensland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fortitude Valley, Queensland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obi-Wan_Kenobi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Obi-Wan Kenobi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seven News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batman (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangster", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gangster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Manson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charles Manson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "True crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinot_noir", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pinot noir"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grape", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/87bd1821795fc90340421fa7d8b7527d", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799795", "eventUri": "eng-9799795", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "1991-10-", "textStart": 870, "textEnd": 882}], "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

Karlson is being remembered as a 'cultural icon' after his brush with police in 1991 reached viral status, thanks to his profound resistance and claims of innocence.\n\nAt the time he was enjoying a meal at Brisbane's China Sea Restaurant when he was dramatically pulled away by authorities, resulting in his iconic outburst which, some 30 years later, has become a meme sensation.\n\n\"Gentlemen, this is democracy manifest,\" he's seen and heard exclaiming as a news crew filmed the arrest. \"What is the charge? Eating a meal, a succulent Chinese meal?\" he continued before famously requesting for the arresting officer to \"get your hand off my penis\".\n\nSince then Karlson has maintained his innocence, blaming the arrest on a case of mistaken identity. The 82-year-old's family not long ago announced he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer.\n\nLeading the tributes online was Seven Network reporter Chris Reason who first reported on the arrest in 1991. The journalist reunited with Karlson earlier this year some 33 years after the incident.\n\nTaking to X on Thursday morning following the news of his death, Reason confirmed the \"sad news\".\n\n\"Mr Democracy Manifest has died. The cultural icon, whose arrest inspired a thousand t-shirts and millions of downloads, had advanced cancer. His immortal words will echo thru generations: \"What is the charge..eating a meal, a succulent Chinese meal?!!\" Vale Jack Karlson,\" he wrote.\n\nOthers agreed he offered \"many laughs\" for people across the country and the world, thanks to the memorable moment caught on camera.\n\nIn a GoFundMe fundraiser set up by Karlson's niece in June, following the news of his cancer, he was described as being \"generous\" to his friends and family. Last week it was updated to say \"things aren't looking good\".\n\n\"I know Jack's video has given a lot of people joy and he has inspired many memes, T-shirts and other things over the years but Jack himself is doing it quite tough,\" his niece wrote.\n\n\"He has never had much money but has always been generous to family and friends. He lives week to week in regional QLD with the help of a voluntary carer.\n\n\"Hoping people can dig deep - I think he's worth at least a beer, maybe even a 6-pack.\"", "source": {"uri": "au.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!7 News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_cuisine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chinese cuisine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_icon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cultural icon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brisbane"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brisbane"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Manifest", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy Manifest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Reason", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris Reason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reason (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Network", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seven Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prostate cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet meme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immortality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shirt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T-shirt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoFundMe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GoFundMe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Queensland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Queensland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/fazShLLzurx3KvMhUdWC4Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NDY7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-08/9cedd6e0-551d-11ef-83fa-25cda1e32032", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799795", "eventUri": "eng-9799795", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

'Get your hand off my penis!\n\n'What is the charge? Eating a meal? A succulent Chinese meal? Ooh, that's a nice headlock, sir. Ah yes, I see that you know your judo well.'\n\nKarlson's arrest was a case of mistaken identity, but the minute-long clip has since become the subject of countless memes and even its own line of merchandise.\n\nHis death come just weeks after his family announced he was suffering from prostate cancer.\n\nKarlson's story was told in the book Carnage: A Succulent Chinese Meal, Mr Rent-a-Kill and the Australian Manson Murders by journalist Mark Dapin.\n\nThe one-time stage and television actor and occasional painter is also set to appear in an upcoming documentary titled The Man Who Ate A Succulent Chinese Meal.\n\nTo publicise that film, Karlson was recently reunited with one of the officers who apprehended him at the China Sea diner in Fortitude Valley all those years ago.\n\nSeven Network reporter Chris Reason had rushed to the restaurant that day after a tip-off one of Queensland's most wanted men had used a stolen credit card to pay for his meal.\n\nKarlson was not the suspect police had originally thought but his arrest was so colourful it made great television and has taken on a life of its own.\n\nOne of the arresting officers, Stoll Watt, appeared on ABC News Breakfast alongside Karlson in June when the men were asked what they remembered of their encounter.\n\n'There's a lot of different versions of the events,' Watt told host Michael Rowland.\n\n'A lot of mysteries and misperceptions about the whole thing. But the main thing is Jack should have got an Academy Award and he's a good mate.'\n\nRowland asked Karlson's if one of his best-known lines from the video, 'Get your hands off my penis!', referred to something which actually happened or was made up on the spot.\n\n'Probably made up,' Karlson said. 'Can't remember.'\n\nSunrise also aired a segment on the forthcoming documentary in which presenter Monique Wright read out a text from Reason about the Karlson video.\n\n'I've been doing this job more than three decades now,' Reason wrote.\n\n'Covered Mandela, Bosnia, Ukraine, 9/11, all anyone wants to talk to me about is bloody Mr Democracy Manifest!'\n\nDespite being wrongfully arrested back in 1991, Karlson - who is aged in his early eighties - has a long history being on the wrong side of the law.\n\nHe is known to have had associations with some of Australia's most notorious crooks from the '70s to '90s, such as Sydney gangster Neddy Smith and Melbourne standover man Mark 'Chopper' Read.\n\nOver the decades he was locked up in prisons in Brisbane (Boggo Road), Sydney (Parramatta, Long Bay) and Melbourne (Pentridge), and escaped from custody three times.\n\nIn the 1970s, he appeared as an extra in classic Australian television dramas Homicide, Division 4 and Matlock Police, and in 2020 he starred in a music video for punk rock band The Chats.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [],

I'm under what?' Karlson booms theatrically as he resists the arresting officers. 'What is the charge? Eating a meal? A succulent Chinese meal?'\n\n'Gentlemen, this is democracy manifest' he declares- before bellowing at an officer to 'get your hands off my penis' moments later.\n\nChris Reason, the Channel Seven journalist who reported Karlson's arrest 33 years ago, paid tribute to him on Twitter, announcing that 'Mr Democracy Manifest has died'.\n\nKarlson died at 6.31pm on Wednesday, in a hospital bed surrounded by his family.\n\nIn a statement, his niece Kim Edwards said Karlson spent the last few weeks of his life in hospital, where he 'had a few attempts to escape and pulled his cords out a couple of times and asked us many time to sneak in his pipe'.\n\nEdwards said her uncle was 'battling many ailments but what got him in the end was [systemic inflammatory response syndrome]'.\n\n'As a final send off, we gave uncle a last taste of red wine through his drip just before it was removed,' she said.\n\nKarlson died the day after his 82nd birthday- or so it is believed. He had gone by a series of pseudonyms throughout the course of his life, 'Jack Karlson' merely being the latest one, and had changed his date of birth on several occasions.\n\nHeath Davis, a filmmaker who is producing a documentary on Karlson's life, said he expects 'huge amounts' of information about his identity and exploits to surface following news of his death.\n\nAmong the stories already uncovered of Karlson's prison escapes include fantastical tales of him picking the lock cuffing him to a sleeping officer and leaping from a moving train and swimming off a prison island before being rescued by a benevolent fisher.\n\n'A regular person who experienced his life would have passed away years ago,' Davis said.\n\n'But Jack just had this zest for life that made you go: this guy is made of mercury ... he might just live forever'.\n\nStoll Watt, the police officer who arrested Karlson back in 1991, said there are many different versions of the story floating around out there.\n\nSpeaking to Davis during the making of his documentary, Watt said Karlson was 'some sort of trained actor, he learned that in prison, but he was also a natural showman,'\n\n'He bluffed his way out of a court in Sydney, said he was a detective, and to do that he must have been a very confident showman ... and a bit of a conman as well'.\n\n'He said to me that I was the only copper he never hated,' Watt added. 'He called me \"comrade\" and he said \"come up and spend the night with me and we'll have a few\", he calls it, \"the juice of the red grapes\".'\n\nDavis described Karlson as a 'wordsmith' who could've been a millionaire if he'd found a way to trademark the many phrases which have become everyday parts of the Australian lexicon.\n\nYet despite his viral fame, Karlson was not tech-savvy and shunned the internet, never truly understanding the true impact of his role in popular culture.", "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Metro"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_sanders@metro.co.uk", "name": "Tom Sanders", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_cuisine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chinese cuisine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudonym", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pseudonym"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Australia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "History of Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet meme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brisbane"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brisbane"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Manifest", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy Manifest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Reason", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris Reason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_inflammatory_response_syndrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Systemic inflammatory response syndrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Network", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seven Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Filmmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lexicon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grape", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisherman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fisherman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Confidence trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_culture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Popular culture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Watt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Watt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/SEC_216439185-9f27.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799795", "eventUri": "eng-9799795", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

He had a few attempts to escape and pulled his cords out a couple of times and asked us many times to sneak in his pipe.\"\n\n\"He was very thankful for the positive response to his Go Fund Me and everyone who donated. This money will now go towards his funeral. As a final send off we gave Uncle a last taste of red wine through his drip just before it was removed. We are still deciding what we want to do in regards to the funeral. We will post updates on the GofundMe page.\"\n\nKarlson is to be the subject of a documentary, The Man Who Ate A Succulent Chinese Meal, which is set for release next year.\n\nDirector Heath Davis also paid tribute to him, saying: \"We are heartbroken to learn of the passing of our friend Jack Karlson. It's been an honour and privilege telling his story and we remain committed to bringing his remarkable story to the big screen.\n\n\"Collaborating with Jack has been one of the most rewarding and fascinating creative journey's to date. Jack lived a life unlike any other. In fact, he's such a larger than life figure who's survived such adversity it's hard to believe he's left us. Jack's inherent ability to always see the bright side of life despite the insurmountable hardship is something I'll carry forward with me in my own life. There really is only one Jack Karlson and he truly was Australia's last larrikin.\n\n\"We've lost an icon today. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his beloved family today especially his daughter Heidi, niece Kim and nephew Karl. Jack's spark will forever live on much like his infamous viral video. I'll be having a beer and a succulent Chinese meal in his honour tonight. You can finally rest in peace, mate.\"\n\nThe documentary tells the story of his infamous arrest and coverage as well as his colourful life.\n\nAs per The Guardian, Karlson - who went under many aliases - escaped from prison multiple times and spent his life growing up in several notorious Australian institutions.The documentary about his life is planned for release in the spring of 2025.\n\nOn social media there have been many tributes to Karlson - you can see some of them here:", "source": {"uri": "nme.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NME Music News, Reviews, Videos, Galleries, Tickets and Blogs | NME.COM"}, "authors": [{"uri": "elizabeth_aubrey@nme.com", "name": "Elizabeth Aubrey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chinese language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_inflammatory_response_syndrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Systemic inflammatory response syndrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_cuisine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chinese cuisine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brisbane"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brisbane"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortitude_Valley,_Queensland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fortitude Valley, Queensland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fortitude Valley, Queensland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motto", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Motto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoFundMe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "GoFundMe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kerry", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Kerry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoughts_and_prayers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thoughts and prayers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudonym", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pseudonym"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Virtual_Reality/Multi-User_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Virtual Reality/Multi-User Systems", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Life", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Life", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle_Choices/Voluntary_Simplicity", "label": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle Choices/Voluntary Simplicity", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Prepared_Meals", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Prepared Meals", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life_Expectancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life Expectancy", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Jack-Karlson-A-Succulent-Chinese-Meal.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799795", "eventUri": "eng-9799795", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 519, "textEnd": 527}], "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

His legacy spans far beyond a mere internet clip; he is celebrated for introducing unforgettable phrases that have permeated Australian culture.\n\nJack Karlson, a known petty criminal and prison escapee, became an internet sensation in 2009 when a clip capturing his arrest outside a Brisbane restaurant in 1991 was circulated online. This dramatic encounter showcased Karlson resisting arrest while making theatrical remarks, including, \"What is the charge? Eating a meal? A succulent Chinese meal.\"\n\nOther famous lines from this memorable moment include, \"Gentlemen, this is democracy manifest\" and the notorious \"get your hand off my penis.\" These quotes have since been immortalized in memes, remixes, and various forms of media.\n\nThe impact of Karlson's incident extended beyond internet fame. His catchphrases inspired countless memes, musical reimaginings, and even tattoos dedicated to \"Democracy Manifest,\" which also serves as the name of a racehorse in Australia.\n\nIn his later years, while battling prostate cancer, he made headlines again in June when he met with one of the arresting officers, Stoll Watt, to promote a documentary about his unconventional life. Despite his criminal past, Karlson maintained that the events of 1991 resulted from a misunderstanding, stating, \"They thought I was some international gangster.\"\n\nThroughout his life, Karlson experienced multiple jail breaks, encounters with law enforcement, and was even known for his dining escapades, reportedly skipping bills at Brisbane restaurants. Yet, those close to him noted a childhood filled with hardship, likening it to a Dickensian tale marred by care homes and governmental oversight.\n\nNews of Karlson's passing has led to an outpouring of tributes on social media. Chris Reason, a reporter who previously covered Karlson's story, tweeted, \"Sad news: Mr. Democracy Manifest has died. The cultural icon, whose arrest inspired a thousand t-shirts and millions of downloads, had advanced cancer. His immortal words will echo through generations.\"\n\nStoll Watt, the police officer involved in the iconic incident, recalled his friend Karlson, describing him as \"larger than life\" and possessing a \"big heart.\" He mourned the loss, stating, \"It's a sad day for Australia.

The only crime he has committed, he wryly declares, is that of 'enjoying a succulent Chinese meal.'\n\nKarlson, who was accused of using a fraudulent credit card to pay for his Chinese, even shouts at a police officer to 'get off my penis' in one particularly strange moment.\n\nThe clip is from 1991, but started doing the rounds on social media in 2009.\n\nTragically, the video's star, a man supposedly called Jack Karlson, has now passed away, aged 82.\n\nA wild life\n\nJack Karlson, if that even is his real name, grew up in tricky conditions in rural Australia, finding himself involved in petty crime from a young age.\n\nKarlson, believed to have been born as Cecil Edwards, went by a number of pseudonyms during his career as a petty criminal. The deep-voiced showman was known to be a talented lock-pick, making a number of daring escapes from prison in his life.\n\nIncredibly, following famous arrest, which has been watched by millions online, Karlson became lifelong friends with Stoll Watt, the officer who he accused of grabbing his manhood.\n\nWatt told interviewers that he spent many nights drinking wine with his former captive, which Karlson jokingly referred to as 'the juice of the red grapes'.\n\nTragically, Karlson is believed to have suffered abuse as a young boy when housed in a juvenile detention centre.\n\nFilmmaker Heath Davis, who is making a movie about Karlson's life and spent lots of time with him, told reporters the following:\n\n'A regular person who experienced his life would have passed away years ago, but Jack just had this zest for life that made you go: this guy is made of mercury'.\n\nA 'succulent' end surrounded by family\n\nReports from Jack's family reveal that the man behind the meme died surrounded by those he loved.\n\nIn a statement released following his passing, the 82-year-old's relatives said \"He walked a full and colourful path and, despite the troubles thrown at him, he lived by his motto - to keep on laughing.\"\n\nKarlson's niece and nephew admitted that their uncle was something of a trouble maker in his last days, saying that he would constantly try and persuade them to sneak in his pipe.\n\nIt is also believed that Karlson got to taste his beloved 'juice of the red grapes' one more time, being served red wine through his drip just before he passed away.'", "source": {"uri": "dailystar.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "edward_easton@dailystar.co.uk", "name": "Edward Easton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_cuisine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chinese cuisine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_people", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chinese people"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_wall", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fourth wall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William Shakespeare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martyr", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Martyr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misdemeanor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Misdemeanor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudonym", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pseudonym"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_detention_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Youth detention center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motto", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Motto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grape", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Filmmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interview"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet meme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mercury (element)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33420908.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Image.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799795", "eventUri": "eng-9799795", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

Unfortunately for everyone who loved and celebrated this meme worthy moment in history, Jack Karlson passed away yesterday at the age of 82.\n\nThe Guardian reported this morning that Jack died surrounded by family at 6:31pm on Wednesday evening, following a battle with prostate cancer.\n\nJack went viral for the first time back in 2009 when a decades old clip of his arrest in Brisbane back was uploaded to the internet.\n\nIt is also unknown whether Jack Karlson is actually the real name of this Australian icon - it is believed that he was a small time crook who operated under multiple aliases. He had been mistakenly identified as one of Australia's most-wanted criminals, which led to him being wrongly arrested for alleged credit card fraud by Queensland Police Station.\n\nIn the video from 1991, Jack is famously led out of a restaurant by police and responds to officers who notify him he is under arrest by saying: \"I'm under what? Gentleman, this is democracy manifest.\"\n\nAs police tussle to get him into cuffs, he breaks the fourth wall, looking down the barrel of a camera filming him and says: \"Have a look at the headlock here. See that chap over there, he - get your hand off my penis! This is the bloke who got me on the penis people.\"\n\nThen in famous words we can probably all recite from memory, Jack adds: \"Why did you do this for me? For what reason? What is the charge? Eating a meal? Eating a succulent Chinese meal?\".\n\nIt seems that being falsely arrested didn't affect his humour, as Jack jibes at officers who attempted to fold his large frame into the police car saying: \"Ah yes, I see that you know your judo well.\"\n\nDenying that the incident was a case of mistaken identity, Jack said after the arrest: \"They thought I was some international gangster.\n\n\"Typical police grabbing you - if they can put something on you, they'll do it\".\n\nBut don't worry, this is not the end of Jack's legacy. A documentary on his life and legend, titled The Man Who Ate A Succulent Chinese Meal, is set to release in March 2o25. Be warned, I will be fighting each and every one of you for front row seats to watch Jack revisit the restaurant he was so famously arrested at.\n\nTributes to Jack have rolled in across social media, while his family spoke of the joy he brought to their lives, saying: \"He walked a full and colourful path and despite the troubles thrown at him, he lived by his motto - to keep on laughing.\"\n\nOne of the most fitting tributes released so far was by one of the arresting police officers, Stoll Watt, who told ABC News: \"It's a sad day for Australia. We've lost a true colourful character\".\n\nIf there has ever been an excuse to enable a Chinese takeaway, tonight is absolutely the day to do it in Jack's honour.\n\nRest in peace, Jack Karlson - thank you for providing myself and the world with hours of entertainment while growing up from your incredible and unforgettable outburst.\n\nFor more like this look back at Jack Karlson, the succulent Chinese meal man and all the latest news, drops, quizzes and memes, like The Tab on Facebook.\n\n* A rundown of all we know about the planned Taylor Swift Eras Tour terror attack in Austria", "source": {"uri": "thetab.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tab"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Penis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Internet meme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Manifest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy Manifest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_icon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cultural icon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_cuisine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chinese cuisine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succulent_plant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Succulent plant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prostate cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudonym", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pseudonym"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brisbane"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brisbane"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Police_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Queensland Police Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_wall", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fourth wall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Credit card fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tab", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Tab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motto", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Motto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangster", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gangster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Judo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://media.thetab.com/blogs.dir/90/files/2024/08/local.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799795", "eventUri": "eng-9799795", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Eating a meal? A succulent Chinese meal?\" Mr Karlson theatrically boomed as his bear-like frame resisted a string of police officers.\n\nChris Reason, the Channel Seven journalist who reported Mr Karlson's arrest 33 years ago, paid tribute to Mr Karlson on social media site X, tweeting that \"Mr Democracy Manifest has died\".\n\nMr Karlson died surrounded by family at 6.31pm on Wednesday.\n\n\"He walked a full and colourful path and, despite the troubles thrown at him, he lived by his motto -- to keep on laughing,\" his family said in statement.\n\nNiece Kim Edwards said Mr Karlson spent the last few weeks of his life in hospital, where he \"had a few attempts to escape and pulled his cords out a couple of times and asked us many time to sneak in his pipe\".\n\nMs Edwards said her uncle was \"battling many ailments but what got him in the end was [systemic inflammatory response syndrome]\".\n\n\"As a final send off, we gave uncle a last taste of red wine through his drip just before it was removed,\" she said.\n\nMr Karlson died the day after his 82nd birthday. Or, at least, it was the most recent of the birthdates he claimed to film-maker Heath Davis, who is making a documentary on Mr Karlson's life.\n\n\"This is the legit one,\" Mr Davis said. \"Or so I'm told.\"\n\nMr Davis said he also learned the most recent alias Mr Karlson -- who he believes was really Cecil George Edwards -- was going by in the last years of his life. And though he is not currently at liberty to reveal it, Mr Davis said it was not Jack Karlson.\n\n\"Let's just say: 'John',\" Mr Davis said.\n\nThe film-maker is expecting \"huge amounts\" of other information about Mr Karlson's life to be revealed, and it won't just be about names and dates. He and authors including Mark Dapin had already uncovered stories of Mr Karlson's prison escapes that are said to include picking the lock cuffing him to a sleeping officer and leaping from a moving train and swimming off a prison island before being rescued by a benevolent fisher.\n\nBut Mr Karlson's life was far from just a rollick. His boyhood was spent in institutions rife with sexual predators and bullies, and his varied stints in Australia's most notorious jails included time in the \"Black Peter\" solitary confinement of Boggo Road jail - the cruelty of which was medieval - when he was still a teenager.\n\n\"A regular person who experienced his life would have passed away years ago,\" Mr Davis said.\n\n\"But Jack just had this zest for life that made you go: this guy is made of mercury ... he might just live forever\".\n\nJack Karlson 'is folklore and doesn't even know it'\n\nAmong old friends and foes reunited with Mr Karlson in the making of Mr Davis' documentary was Stoll Watt, a senior sergeant in the then Special Weapons and Operations Squad who happened to be driving through the Valley on the now famous day in 1991 when the call came through for support in an arrest.\n\nMr Watt said there are many different versions of what occurred that day -- his own is detailed in a yet-to-be-published book. One thing Mr Watt does not deny, though, is Mr Karlson's charisma.\n\n\"He was some sort of trained actor, he learned that in prison, but he was also a natural showman,\" Mr Watt said. \"He bluffed his way out of a court in Sydney, said he was a detective, and to do that he must have been a very confident showman ... and a bit of a conman as well\".\n\nAmong Mr Karlson's cons, Mr Watt said, was the now infamous line he roared during the arrest when he declared: \"Get your hands off my penis!\".\n\n\"All it was, was, I was assisting him out of the restaurant and there was a step and he tripped a little bit and, to help him up, my hand grabbed him lower down on the thigh,\" Mr Watt said. \"He said I grabbed him by 'the thing' - but I was nowhere near it.\"\n\nStill, Mr Watt bears Mr Karlson no ill will and enjoyed meeting him once again last year at Mr Karlson's hideout near Esk somewhere in the mountains of south-east Queensland.\n\n\"He said to me that I was the only copper he never hated,\" Mr Watt said. \"He called me 'comrade' and he said 'come up and spend the night with me and we'll have a few', he calls it, 'the juice of the red grapes'.\"\n\nMr Karlson was \"a very good wordsmith\", Mr Watt said, adding the man he once arrested would have been a millionaire had he been able to trademark the phrases he coined that have now entered the modern Australian lexicon.\n\nYet it is through these words that Jack Karlson, or Cecil George Edwards, or John X, will live in posterity. Though Mr Davis said the subject of his film -- for all his sins, hardly a tech savvy man -- was for a long time naive to his online renown and, perhaps, never fully appreciated it.\n\n\"He is folklore and doesn't even know it,\" Mr Davis said.", "source": {"uri": "irishexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Examiner"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Watt", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "James Watt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Manifest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy Manifest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Reason", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chris Reason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_inflammatory_response_syndrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Systemic inflammatory response syndrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_cuisine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chinese cuisine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Network", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seven Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motto", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Edwards_(naturalist)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Edwards (naturalist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Dapin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mark Dapin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitary_confinement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Solitary confinement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisherman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fisherman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Predation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle Ages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mercury (element)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lexicon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charisma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charisma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thigh", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thigh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grape", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Queensland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Queensland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/8478/4239406_3_articlelarge_succulent.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799795", "eventUri": "eng-9799795", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

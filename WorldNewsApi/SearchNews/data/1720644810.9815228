{"id": 231430646, "title": "WATCH: Little Miss Goatee raises cash for lifeboat", "text": "It may not have been the best possible conditions, but rain has failed to stop the Lerwick lifeboat open day from being a huge success. The day has featured live music, stalls, the Guizer Jarl\u2019s Squad \u2013 and plenty more. But one of the main attractions has been a young goat, going by the name of Little Miss Goatee. The three-month-old goat has been helping the fundraising effort get off to a flying start, with a little bit of help from owner Tom Jeromson, a West Side crofter from Gruting at Bridge of Walls. \u201cI\u2019ve been down with the goat to support the lifeboat,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s been raising money for three weeks now for the RNLI. So far she\u2019s raised over \u00a31,000 in two weeks. The effort is a remarkable achievement for Little Miss Goatee, who was bottle-fed by Mr Jeromson after she was rejected by her mother. Little Miss Goatee is not the only one of Mr Jeromson\u2019s animals to raise funds for the good causes. She is a niece of Connor the goat, a one-time local celebrity who raised money for the lifeboat \u2013 and helped Santa lead the town\u2019s Christmas light parade. Deep in the lifeboat\u2019s engine room, coxswain Stephen Manson was delighted to see the day go ahead \u2013 even if the rainy weather was far from what had been hoped for. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame about the weather, but it\u2019s good to see folk still turning up. It\u2019s nice to see, and hopefully the weather turns for the better, too. \u201cI think it\u2019s good for the community to see the event, see what we can do \u2013 and just come along and support us in general.\u201d He said planning the day, with all its various attractions, had taken six months. As a fundraiser, he said, it was \u201cvery important\u201d. The day comes just a week after the Aith lifeboat open day raised over \u00a37,000 for the RNLI. \u201cIt\u2019s really good especially to see that folk really are supporting the lifeboat. \u201cThere are a lot of people who come down for a look, and they all have good comments.\u201d Among those with good comments was Up-Helly-A\u2019 Guizer Jarl Richard Moar. \u201cIt\u2019s good. The organisers asked us if we would be able to pop along. We\u2019re more than happy to show support for an important cause, and give ourselves out amongst the community.\u201d Of course, no lifeboat day is complete without the tempting smell of burgers coming from the food stalls. Overseeing the cooking was Cathy Mann, who works as a regional support worker for the RNLI. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame about the weather,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite quiet at the moment, but as always there\u2019s still a good turnout, and the lifeboat is always well supported.\u201d Best seller of the day was the saucermaet roll, with quite a few tourists asking about it. But lentil soup was doing a treat as well.", "summary": "<p>It may not have been the best possible conditions, but rain has failed to stop the Lerwick lifeboat open day from being a huge success....</p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.shetlandtimes.co.uk/2024/06/08/little-miss-goatee-raises-cash-for-lifeboat\">WATCH: Little Miss Goatee raises cash for lifeboat</a></p>", "url": "https://www.shetlandtimes.co.uk/2024/06/08/little-miss-goatee-raises-cash-for-lifeboat", "image": "https://www.shetlandtimes.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_0510-scaled.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 14:33:12", "author": "Ryan Taylor", "authors": ["Ryan Taylor"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.032}

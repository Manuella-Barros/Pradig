Three months later, Kate announced to the world her cancer diagnosis.\n\nBut the royal's parents have returned to the spotlight recently for the summer social scene after spending months at their daughter's side.\n\nBoth Kate and King Charles III have thanked the public for their support after going public with their illnesses, with Kate saying she had been 'blown away' by the 'kind messages' that had made a 'world of difference to William and me and has helped us both through some of the harder times'.\n\nKate was initially admitted to hospital for abdominal surgery on January 16 and at the time her condition was thought to be non-cancerous, but cancer was found following the successful operation.\n\nCharles was admitted to hospital just days after Kate, also for a procedure deemed unrelated to cancer.\n\nIn February, Buckingham Palace confirmed that he had been diagnosed with a form of cancer, which is not prostate cancer, that was discovered while the King was being treated at the private London Clinic for an enlarged prostate.\n\nCharles initially postponed public-facing duties but resumed at the end of April, speaking of his 'shock' at being diagnosed with cancer as he met patients during a visit to University College Hospital Macmillan Cancer Centre in central London.\n\nElsewhere at Wimbledon this month, other recognisable faces have appeared in the Royal Box during the two-week event this year, including the Duchess of Gloucester, former Prime Minister Theresa May, and star athlete Maria Sharapova.\n\nMeanwhile, CEOs and entrepreneurs enjoyed taking in the sport from the coveted seats yesterday.\n\nAnd on the court today, British number one Katie Boulter has lost to Harriet Dart after a nail-biting tie breaker.\n\nIt was the Battle of the Brits at Wimbledon on Thursday as wildcard Jacob Fearnley broke Novak Djokovic and tennis legend Andy Murray steps onto the double's court alongside his brother Jamie to begin his farewell to SW19.\n\nFearnley, who was ranked outside the world's top 500 ahead of the tournament, fought his back in his match against seven-time world champion Djokovic.\n\nThe 22-year-old Scot only qualified for the Nottingham Open at the start of last month, admitted that 'it was getting in [his] head a little bit' that he was going to have take on the Serbian legend.\n\nThis afternoon, more British athletes will face each other on court, with 22-year-old Jack Draper will take on South African born Brit Cameron Norrie to battle it out to get a place in the third round.\n\nBoth 27 years old, Boulter and Dart have spent over two decades in one another's orbit, both growing up so emmeshed in the tennis world that their mothers - Sue Boulter and Susie Dart - had even met as players during their own early careers.\n\nThe pair are friends - and Boulter has spoken about how 'awful' it can be to play her Billie Jean King Cup team-mate.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType":

Carole sat in the stands alongside her husband Michael Middleton.\n\nThe British businesswoman donned a pair of suede pumps in a neutral hue. Carole's footwear featured textural tan suede uppers, sharp triangular toes and 2 to 3-inch block heels, offering the public figure a subtle and walkable boost in height. The textural addition to Carole's footwear acted to update the otherwise simplistic silhouette.\n\nA multitude of women of the royal family often gravitate towards suede footwear including Kate Middleton, Meghan Markle, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, just to name a few. These royal women, Carole Middleton included, often procure their suede styles from brands like Aquazzura, Gianvito Rossi, Jimmy Choo, Zara and Stuart Weitzman, among others.\n\nIn classic Wimbledon fashion, Carole wore a floral maxi dress. The blooming style featured a floral print in shades of green, pink, white and blue, along with a high button-up neckline and a ruched waist. The London native layered a tailored cream blazer overtop her floral digs. The wool blazer was fixed with contrasting black buttons.\n\nCarole is the mother of Kate Middleton, who is married to Prince William, first in line to the British throne. Carole's fashion sense is known for being timeless and elegant, with a preference for tailored dresses and coats that exude sophistication.\n\nThe 2024 Wimbledon Championships started on July 1 and will conclude on July 14. The event is one of the biggest tennis competitions of the year and will feature appearances from big names like David Beckham, Poppy Delevingne, Rebel Wilson, Dave Grohl, Princess Olympia, James Blake and Pink Pantheress, among many others.

Michael Middleton 2. Carole Middleton 3. Seb Coe 4. Shara Grylls 5. Bear Grylls 6. Pat Cummins\n\nCarole and Michael Middleton\n\nThe Princess of Wales's mother and father - Carole and Michael Middleton - attended day four of Wimbledon in their second public appearance since their daughter's cancer diagnosis.\n\nThe beaming couple, dressed in all their finery, looked in good spirits as they sat in the Royal Box side-by-side for the prestigious event in London.\n\nIt follows their cheerful appearance at Royal Ascot last month, when they joined members of the Royal Family, including their son-in-law Prince William, at the lavish occasion.\n\nCarole Middleton cut an elegant figure as she arrived at the tennis event in a floral dress alongside her husband, Michael Middleton\n\nThe Princess of Wales' parents took their seats on the front row of the Royal Box at Wimbledon day four\n\nCarole, 69, and Michael, 75, appeared cheerful as they watched the tennis tournament from the Royal Box\n\nCarole, 69, cut an elegant figure in a floral dress with a cropped white blazer as she watched the live action, while her husband, 75, sat beside her and looked equally dapper in a navy suit.\n\nThe Middletons, who live in Berkshire, typically attend several days of Wimbledon but are usually only invited to sit in the Royal Box once per tournament.\n\nIt marks a well-deserved day out for Carole and Michael, who have reportedly been supporting her daughter through her cancer treatment at her home in Windsor.\n\nBear and Shara Grylls\n\nBritish adventurer Bear Grylls swapped treacherous and remote conditions for the comfort of the Royal Box today.\n\nGrylls, 50, is an Eton College alumnus - the same school attended by Prince William and Prince Harry. However, being eight years older than William, Bear did not share classes with either of the princes.\n\nDespite this, Grylls is said to be close friends with the Prince of Wales and has collaborated with him and Prince Harry on various wildlife conservation projects throughout the years.\n\nBritish adventurer Bear Grylls took his seat in the prestigious Royal Box alongside his wife Shara Grylls\n\nThe 50-year-old, who is said to be close friends with the Prince of Wales, looked dapper in a navy suit and crisp white shirt for the occasion\n\nBear donned a pair of sporty sunglasses as he read the programme for day four of the sports event\n\nHe sat alongside his author wife, Shara Grylls, 50, with whom he shares three children.\n\nThe pair tied the knot in 2000 after a whirlwind romance, having known each other for about two years.\n\nThe adventurer has previously revealed he and Shara entered marriage counselling at the beginning of their union as a preventative measure to guide them through married life.\n\nShara has written two books since the marriage, the first of which - Marriage Matters - was released in 2009.\n\nPat and Becky Cummins\n\nAustralia men's cricket captain Pat Cummins took his seat in the Royal Box for the fourth day of Wimbledon alongside his wife, Becky.\n\nThe 31-year-old cricketer was once a prodigious teenager, famously mentored by the great Australian cricketer Dennis Lillee.\n\nHe has since broken his master's records, reaching 250 Test wickets with a superior average and strike rate - while captaining his country.\n\nAustralian cricketer Pat Cummins was smart in a grey suit in the Royal Box of Wimbledon day four\n\nThe 31-year-old sat next to his glamorous wife, Becky, who donned a white blazer with statement gold buttons for the event\n\nAmong Australian pace bowlers, only Lillee and Glenn McGrath (55) have gotten to the 250-wicket mark in fewer Tests than Cummins' 57 (Mitchell Johnson also achieved the milestone in 57 Tests).\n\nHe is the 10th bowler from Australia to reach the mark, joining teammates Mitchell Starc (342 Test wickets) and Nathan Lyon (505) on the coveted list.\n\nThe sportsman attended Wimbledon with glamorous wife, Becky Cummins. Becky married the Australian cricket captain Pat in a lavish ceremony in Byron Bay in July 2022.\n\nThe pair, who share a son, Albie, tied the knot in the French-inspired Chateau Du Soleil, surrounded by family and friends.\n\nThey welcomed Albie in October 2021, with Pat tweeting at the time he was 'beyond besotted' with the baby boy.\n\nBill and Cynthia Bryson\n\nTravel writer Bill Bryson travelled to SW19 with his wife Cynthia to observe the fourth day of Wimbledon today.\n\nThe esteemed writer came to the UK while backpacking across Europe in his early 20s. He landed a job in a psychiatric hospital where he met a fellow nurse, Cynthia Billen, whom he went on to marry, and the pair had four children together.\n\nHe and Cynthia moved back to Des Moines, Iowa, in 1975 so Bryson could finish his degree, but the pair settled in the UK in 1977 and currently live in Hampshire.\n\nBryson began his writing career in the late 1970s as a journalist for the Bournemouth Evening Echo and eventually became chief copy editor of the business section of The Times and deputy national news editor of the business section of The Independent.\n\nEsteemed travel writer Bill Bryson watched the tennis with his wife Cynthia Bryson from the Royal Box\n\nThe author of A Short History of Nearly Everything looked animated as he watched the action today\n\nHe wrote his first book -The Palace under the Alps and Over 200 Other Unusual, Unspoiled and Infrequently Visited Spots in 16 European Countries - in 1985.\n\nBut the famed writer, who was awarded an OBE in 2006, holds A Short History of Nearly Everything, published in 2003, as his most treasured book.\n\nBill was born in Iowa but has predominantly lived in the UK since the 1970s. In 2020, the Notes from a Small Island writer, 72, announced his retirement, saying he has decided to 'indulge himself rather than explore new territory'.\n\nAt the time, the author said he has been 'treating retirement as an experiment so far this year but it has been successful'.\n\nSebastian and Harry Coe\n\nThey were the father-son duo of the Royal Box as they took to the fourth day of Wimbledon.\n\nLord Coe won gold in the 1500m at the Olympics in 1980 and 1984, was a Tory MP for five years, and masterminded the London 2012 Games.\n\nNow the President of the International Association of Athletics Federations, Sebastian splits his time between Monaco and London.\n\nresident of the International Association of Athletics Federations, Sebastian Coe, was all smiles in the Royal Box\n\nLord Coe, who won gold in the 1500m at the Olympics in 1980 and 1984, enjoyed a conversation with the Princess of Wales' parents\n\nThe former Conservative MP, who has four children, was accompanied by his eldest son Harry for the event.\n\nHarry has previously spoken out about his desire to follow in his father's footsteps into the world of sport.\n\nSebastian recently made headlines after declaring that female Olympians would never win a gold medal again if they had to compete against transgender athletes.\n\nLord Coe suggested in an interview that the gap is so large that females competing at the Olympics wouldn't stand a chance against trans women.\n\nThe president of the sport's governing body - who last year announced a ban on trans women from female competitions - says the matter is 'very clear cut'.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

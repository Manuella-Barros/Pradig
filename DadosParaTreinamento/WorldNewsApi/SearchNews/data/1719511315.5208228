At the end of 2020, I was over 31 stone and struggling to get around. If I did anything at all, I would get out of breath. Getting clothes was a nightmare, I was in 8XL shirts and 54 inch waist trousers. Everything was so hard to do. \"I was in my parents house having a typical Irish conversation about funerals, and they were talking about their wishes and all of that. I had terrible thoughts, I was thinking about my own funeral and how six men would carry me in the coffin to the church - it would be around six stone each of dead weight.\" This was a wakeup call for Jason, who began looking into weight loss surgery after it was mentioned to him by a friend. He decided to get a gastric sleeve in Turkey in 2021 and the process went smoothly for him. In the time since, he has dropped around half his body weight, shedding over 15 stone. Now he feels like a brand new man. \"I'm literally a new person,\" he gushed. \"I am full of energy, I can breathe, I can do stuff with my kids, I go hillwalking. I can do anything. \"It's not a bother to me now, whereas before I would drive everywhere on purpose, even if it was only 100 yards down the road because I physically wouldn't be able to walk it. I was a beast, like I was absolutely humungous.\" At his heaviest, Jason was on a number of medications to battle conditions like high cholesterol and high blood pressure - since his weight loss, he is now medication free. For anyone considering weight loss surgery, Jason urges them to do their research properly and not to be afraid of making that leap if you think it is the right thing for you.

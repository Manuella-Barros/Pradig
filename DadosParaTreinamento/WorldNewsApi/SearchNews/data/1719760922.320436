{"id": 225358888, "title": "\u2018They\u2019ve hidden the past from us\u2019: New bill in Honduras seeks to rectify 1980s human rights violations - The World from PRX", "text": "In June 1981, Oliva was three months pregnant and had only been married for four months when she witnessed the kidnapping of her husband by the country\u2019s death squad. \u201cI was there when they took him away from me,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cI am a witness to the brutality. I am a survivor of that moment.\u201d Back then, Honduras \u2014 unlike its neighbors \u2014 wasn\u2019t immersed in war, but its government was authoritarian and violent. The United States fueled that violence by using the country as the staging ground for military operations in the region. The US founded and trained the country\u2019s notorious death squad, Battalion 3-16, which took action against students and radical leftist organizers. Oliva, alongside other family members of the nearly 200 detained and disappeared, started the Committee of the Family Members of the Detained and Disappeared in Honduras, or COFADEH, the year after her husband\u2019s kidnapping. Outside of Congress, on a square referred to as the \u2018Plaza of the Disappeared\u2019, COFADEH held monthly rallies seeking justice for the victims. Today, there\u2019s a chance they may finally see reparations. The activists helped draft an unprecedented bill that Congress began debating in early April, which seeks justice for the victims of the state\u2019s violations of human rights during the 1980s. Lawmaker Oved Lopez Rodriguez, a member of the governing leftist Libre Party, has endorsed the bill. \u201cMany countries in Latin America have already advanced with this type of legislation. Many countries have already done justice. Not us,\u201d Lopez Rodriguez said. \u201cWe still have these conservative sectors that don\u2019t want us to debate this issue here,\u201d Lopez Rodriguez added. All of the lawmakers who spoke on the day the bill was delivered, echoed Lopez Rodriguez\u2019s sentiments. But the bill has opponents \u2014 both inside and outside of Congress who believe that the country should just move on and leave the past in the past. A window of opportunity German Perez was just 4 years old when his father disappeared in 1982. \u201cWe are just in front of Congress where they\u2019re holding important meetings for a law to create the necessary policies to look for justice,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s late, but it\u2019s important for those of us who have long been fighting for this,\u201d Perez added. Felix Molina is an independent Honduran journalist who today lives in Canada. He fled the country in 2016 after an attack on his life. Molina said that there is a window of opportunity for the bill to pass under President Xiomara Castro\u2019s government. \u201cThis initiative to compensate the victims includes the principles of transitional justice, which is greatly absent in the Honduran scenario, which is why the historic wounds of the evils caused by the State remain open,\u201d Molina said. This is important. If approved, the law wouldn\u2019t just compensate victims but would create public policies to remember the past and ensure it is never repeated. This is something COFADEH has been working on independently for years. \u2018We want them back alive\u2019 At COFADEH headquarters, located in a two-story, colonial-style building near the Merced Plaza, the walls are covered with black-and-white pictures of many of the people who disappeared in Honduras in the 1980s. Among the victims are US citizens like Rev. James Carney. At the top of the wall written in Spanish, it says: \u201cYou took them alive. We want them back alive.\u201d \u201cThis place is sacred,\u201d Oliva said. \u201cWhen I\u2019m feeling tired or weak, I come here and I find strength. I communicate with them.\u201d Last December, COFADEH inaugurated a new museum north of Tegucigalpa. It\u2019s called the Museum Against Forgetting. It\u2019s in a former clandestine detention center where people were held, tortured, executed, and disappeared. In a video made for the inauguration, Oliva sits along a white wall with tiny marks along it. Oliva said that when they tested the walls, they found traces of blood stains. \u201cThey\u2019ve hidden the past from us,\u201d she says in the video, adding, \u201cAnd now, it\u2019s like we are opening the windows to the past.\u201d And that is what her group hopes Congress will do, as well.

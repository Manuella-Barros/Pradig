That age feels really specific \u2014 but it makes sense because that\u2019s when most of us begin to have more responsibilities and less free time. Maybe we\u2019ve found a romantic relationship or a career or we have children and that limits our ability to invest in friendships in ways we could when we were younger and more carefree. Regardless of why it happens, the idea that our friendships become less of a priority as we age is pretty bleak, especially since we know how important they are to our overall health and happiness. There has to be a way to preserve the magic with our besties, right? That\u2019s why we \u2014 Raj Punjabi and Noah Michelson, hosts of HuffPost\u2019s Am I Doing It Wrong? podcast \u2014 turned to journalist and friendship expert Anna Goldfarb for tips and tricks to keep our friendships strong. Listen to the full episode by pressing play on the player: Goldfarb confirmed that keeping solid friendships as an adult can be challenging, largely because life gets extremely real \u2014 especially in situations where one party goes through something overwhelming and life-changing. She went through this herself when her sister had kids and suddenly had less time and attention to offer Goldfarb. \u201cI\u2019m not feeling the love. She\u2019s not reaching out to me,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m doing so much for her, but I don\u2019t feel like she can match the energy I\u2019m putting in and a lot of resentment was building up.\u201d Goldfarb, the author of Modern Friendship: How to Nurture Our Most Valued Connections, discovered that when new responsibilities strain a friendship, strong and coherent communication is key. In these situations, she advises us to verbalise our commitment to our friends with these four words: \u201c\u2019I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d These words are clear and concise and can be very comforting. \u201cIt\u2019s very powerful and it knocks away uncertainty,\u201d Goldfarb said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s the gift of getting rid of uncertainty because uncertainty creates anxiety. And we don\u2019t want our friends to question or wonder, like, is this friendship still important?\u201d She also urged us to tell our friend that we love them and that we understand they may need time and space to adjust to these big changes. But the \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere\u201d is powerful because it can remove stress and expectations. Once our friend knows that we understand what they are going through, we won\u2019t abandon them, and they have our support, we can also inquire about how we might be able to offer help. \u201cWhat that looked like for me was going over every week to watch [my sister\u2019s] kid so she could take a nap,\u201d Goldfarb told us. \u201cIt\u2019s like, you know what you need? You need sleep. I\u2019m going to come over and help. And then pockets would open up after she\u2019s well-rested, after she\u2019s had something to eat, then she\u2019ll be like, \u2018What\u2019s going on with you?\u2019\u201d After she did that, Goldfarb said, their relationship got stronger. \u201cOur love grew, and then I did get what I wanted,\u201d she said. \u201cI did get her excited about my life and invested. But it had to start with me sharing my life and showing up and saying, \u2018I\u2019m here to help you.\u2019 And that\u2019s what\u2019s required in your 30s. And that is a new dynamic.\u201d Of course, this effort is reserved for what Goldfarb refers to as our \u201celite\u201d friends, or the ones whose friendships mean a lot to us. We can\u2019t give everyone our all, but there are certainly friendships that are worth it. On this week\u2019s episode, we also chatted about the friendship \u201cabout,\u201d why you need to organise your friend circle into tiers, and what being someone\u2019s best friend can do for your health.

Patrons ...\n\nYears ago, some people would spend hours at Starbucks. Today, it's a takeout counter. At many Starbucks locations, you're lucky to find anyone sitting down.\n\nUnder Howard Schultz, Starbucks' longtime leader, cafes were positioned as a \"third place\" between work and home, where people could linger for hours on plush purple armchairs, socialize and connect.\n\n\"If you look at the landscape of retail and restaurants in America, there is such a fracturing of places where people meet,\" Schultz said in a 1995 profile of Starbucks for an industry publication. \"There's nowhere for people to go. So we created a place where people can feel comfortable.\"\n\nThe idea of Starbucks as a third place became part of its corporate mythology. Starbucks aimed to create a welcoming environment for coffee drinkers and employees with comfortable seating, jazz music and the aroma of freshly brewed coffee. Employees who brewed and served Starbucks coffee, whom Starbucks called baristas, hand-wrote customers' names on their drink orders.\n\nBy the time Michelle Eisen joined Starbucks in 2010 as an employee in Buffalo, New York, her store was always packed during the holidays with people meeting friends and family. She witnessed first dates and helped a customer's propose to his spouse, writing \"will you marry me?\" on a cup.\n\n\"It was a cheerful, amazing thing to be part of it,\" she said of working at Starbucks and forming close relationships with customers. \"It's why so many employees stayed for so long.\"\n\nEisen has helped lead Starbucks Workers United, a group unionizing company stores.\n\nBut Starbucks' business has transformed, and it has struggled to maintain its identity as that third place along the way.\n\nMobile ordering and drive-thru\n\nMobile app and drive-thru orders make up more than 70% of Starbucks' sales at its approximately 9,500 company-operated stores in the United States. In some stores, customers complained online that Starbucks pulled out comfortable chairs and replaced them with hard wooden stools. Starbucks has also built pickup-only stores without seating. Machines that print customers' names have replaced baristas' handwriting on cups.\n\n\"Third place is a broader definition,\" current Starbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan said last year. The \"classic definition of third place -- it's a box where I go to meet someone -- it's frankly not relevant anymore in this context.\"\n\nStarbucks' sales in its home North America market dropped 3% last quarter. Schultz, who stepped down as Starbucks' CEO (for a third time) and retired from Starbucks' board of directors last year, wrote a lengthy message on LinkedIn in May about the company's issues.\n\n\"U.S. operations are the primary reason for the company's fall from grace. The stores require a maniacal focus on the customer experience,\" he said. The company needs to \"focus on being experiential, not transactional.\"\n\nStarbucks' changes to its sit-down business model came in response to several trends -- demand from customers for ordering coffee from their cars in drive-thru lanes or on their smartphones. The shift from a business serving hot coffee to one in which cold coffees, teas and lemonades make up more than half of sales. The Covid-19 pandemic, which forced cafes to shut indoor seating.\n\nStarbucks shifted to meet Wall Street's demands, too. Starbucks found it could reduce labor costs and increase order volume by running a mostly drive-thru and take-away coffee business. Starbucks also found difficulties with being America's third place and did not want to become the public space and bathroom for everyone, including people coming into stores who were homeless or struggling with mental health challenges on city streets. Starbucks has closed some stores and restricted bathroom access over safety concerns.\n\nBut by prioritizing speed -- \"throughput\" in corporate parlance -- Starbucks hurt the appeal of sitting down for coffee in stores, some critics say.\n\n\"Their success has not enabled them to retain what people originally found so attractive about the brand,\" said Tom Cook, a principal at restaurant consultancy King-Casey who has worked with Starbucks. \"It's turned into a transaction business that has very little interpersonal interaction and engagement.\"\n\nMany Starbucks' stores feel more like a fast-food restaurant than a coffee shop, Cook said. \"They had this unique image and personality. That doesn't exist anymore.\"\n\n'Just another commodity product'\n\nStarbucks' shift from a sit-down shop to a primarily drive-thru and mobile pickup business has been gradual.\n\nThe company was hesitant to build out drive-thru stores during the 1990s, fearing they would take away from the third place appeal.\n\n\"We don't want to become just another commodity product,\" Starbucks finance chief Michael Casey said in the 1995 profile of the company. \"The drive-thrus are a way for the converted to get their coffee a little quicker. It's not the way we want people to discover the Starbucks experience.\"\n\nBut Starbucks warmed to the option, finding that many customers preferred the convenience of drive-thrus on their way to work. By 2005, nearly 15% of Starbucks' roughly 7,300 stores were drive-thru locations. For the first time that year, more than half of new Starbucks stores were drive-thru locations. Today, 70% of Starbucks locations have a drive-thru option.\n\nMobile ordering was another major step in Starbucks' road to becoming primarily a take-away business.\n\nIn 2014, Starbucks debuted its mobile ordering system, which allowed customers to place pickup orders from their smartphones without having to interact with an employee. Mobile ordering also gave the company more data on consumers and helped push them to Starbucks' loyalty program, benefiting Starbucks because loyalty members are its most profitable customers.\n\nMobile ordering surged during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, when Starbucks was required to temporarily close seating areas inside to customers to prevent the virus' spread. Mobile orders jumped from 17% of sales in early 2020 to 26% the following year.\n\nAlthough mobile ordering has been popular with busy customers and investors, growing to more than 30% of sales today, it has taken away from the sit-down experience, analysts say.\n\nStarbucks baristas have complained about the crush of additional orders coming in from mobile orders and struggles to keep up with demand. People enter and exit stores more frequently, opening and closing the door and letting in the cold or heat.\n\nMobile ordering \"commoditized\" Starbucks by leading it to focus on order volume and efficiency, said Joe Pine, the co-founder of consultancy Strategic Horizons who wrote a recent article about Starbucks' struggles in Harvard Business Review.\n\nStarbucks' menu changes also had an impact on this shift. Starbucks is less of a coffee shop today and more of an iced tea, coffee, energy drink and lemonade store, especially in the summer, when nearly 80% of the drinks are cold. Customers are less interested in lingering in an air-conditioned store sipping iced coffee, analysts say.\n\n'Reimagining the third place'\n\nStarbucks says that it's evolving its third place model from being a physical store to a feeling.\n\nIn 2022, Starbucks said it was \"reimagining the third place\" by investing $450 million in stores with new coffee-making equipment to improve efficiency for employees and improving Starbucks' mobile ordering system. One of these improvements is called the Siren System, which is designed to cut down the amount of time it takes to make cold drinks.\n\nStarbucks also is opening 2,000 new stores, including traditional Starbucks locations, pick-up stores, delivery-only stores and drive thru-only locations.\n\nEisen, the Starbucks employee in Buffalo, said Starbucks has tried to balance competing demands from customers who want to grab their orders and go and others who want to sit down.\n\nThe best way Starbucks can preserve the third place in the digital age is to improve ordering on the mobile app for both customers and workers, she said.\n\nThat means reducing wait times for customers and easing the burden on Starbucks workers so they have enough time to prepare drinks and acknowledge customers when they come in to pick up their orders.\n\n\"If the worker feels less stressed, they are able to greet the customer,\" she said. \"That allows the Starbucks worker and the customer to have that connection.\"\n\nIn-person socialization is alive in these states -- here's where people are the most social\n\nIn-person socialization is alive in these states -- here's where people are

Starbucks is less of a coffee shop today and more of an iced tea, coffee, energy drink and lemonade store, especially in the summer, when nearly 80% of the drinks are cold. Customers are less interested in lingering in an air-conditioned store sipping iced coffee, analysts say.\n\n'Reimagining the third place'\n\nStarbucks says that it's evolving its third place model from being a physical store to a feeling.\n\nIn 2022, Starbucks said it was \"reimagining the third place\" by investing $450 million in stores with new coffee-making equipment to improve efficiency for employees and improving Starbucks' mobile ordering system. One of these improvements is called the Siren System, which is designed to cut down the amount of time it takes to make cold drinks.\n\nStarbucks also is opening 2,000 new stores, including traditional Starbucks locations, pick-up stores, delivery-only stores and drive thru-only locations.\n\nEisen, the Starbucks employee in Buffalo, said Starbucks has tried to balance competing demands from customers who want to grab their orders and go and others who want to sit down.\n\nThe best way Starbucks can preserve the third place in the digital age is to improve ordering on the mobile app for both customers and workers, she said.\n\nThat means reducing wait times for customers and easing the burden on Starbucks workers so they have enough time to prepare drinks and acknowledge customers when they come in to pick up their orders.\n\n\"If the worker feels less stressed, they are able to greet the customer,\" she said. \"That allows the Starbucks worker and the customer to have that connection.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Patrons ...\n\nYears ago, some people would spend hours at Starbucks. Today, it's a takeout counter. At many Starbucks locations, you're lucky to find anyone sitting down.\n\nUnder Howard Schultz, Starbucks' longtime leader, cafes were positioned as a \"third place\" between work and home, where people could linger for hours on plush purple armchairs, socialize and connect.\n\n\"If you look at the landscape of retail and restaurants in America, there is such a fracturing of places where people meet,\" Schultz said in a 1995 profile of Starbucks for an industry publication. \"There's nowhere for people to go. So we created a place where people can feel comfortable.\"\n\nThe idea of Starbucks as a third place became part of its corporate mythology. Starbucks aimed to create a welcoming environment for coffee drinkers and employees with comfortable seating, jazz music and the aroma of freshly brewed coffee. Employees who brewed and served Starbucks coffee, whom Starbucks called baristas, hand-wrote customers' names on their drink orders.\n\nPeople are also reading...

She witnessed first dates and helped a customer's propose to his spouse, writing \"will you marry me?\" on a cup.\n\n\"It was a cheerful, amazing thing to be part of it,\" she said of working at Starbucks and forming close relationships with customers. \"It's why so many employees stayed for so long.\"\n\nEisen has helped lead Starbucks Workers United, a group unionizing company stores.\n\nBut Starbucks' business has transformed, and it has struggled to maintain its identity as that third place along the way.\n\nMobile ordering and drive-thru\n\nMobile app and drive-thru orders make up more than 70% of Starbucks' sales at its approximately 9,500 company-operated stores in the United States. In some stores, customers complained online that Starbucks pulled out comfortable chairs and replaced them with hard wooden stools. Starbucks has also built pickup-only stores without seating. Machines that print customers' names have replaced baristas' handwriting on cups.\n\n\"Third place is a broader definition,\" current Starbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan said last year. The \"classic definition of third place -- it's a box where I go to meet someone -- it's frankly not relevant anymore in this context.\"\n\nStarbucks' sales in its home North America market dropped 3% last quarter. Schultz, who stepped down as Starbucks' CEO (for a third time) and retired from Starbucks' board of directors last year, wrote a lengthy message on LinkedIn in May about the company's issues.\n\n\"U.S. operations are the primary reason for the company's fall from grace. The stores require a maniacal focus on the customer experience,\" he said. The company needs to \"focus on being experiential, not transactional.\"\n\nStarbucks' changes to its sit-down business model came in response to several trends -- demand from customers for ordering coffee from their cars in drive-thru lanes or on their smartphones. The shift from a business serving hot coffee to one in which cold coffees, teas and lemonades make up more than half of sales. The Covid-19 pandemic, which forced cafes to shut indoor seating.\n\nStarbucks shifted to meet Wall Street's demands, too. Starbucks found it could reduce labor costs and increase order volume by running a mostly drive-thru and take-away coffee business. Starbucks also found difficulties with being America's third place and did not want to become the public space and bathroom for everyone, including people coming into stores who were homeless or struggling with mental health challenges on city streets. Starbucks has closed some stores and restricted bathroom access over safety concerns.\n\nBut by prioritizing speed -- \"throughput\" in corporate parlance -- Starbucks hurt the appeal of sitting down for coffee in stores, some critics say.\n\n\"Their success has not enabled them to retain what people originally found so attractive about the brand,\" said Tom Cook, a principal at restaurant consultancy King-Casey who has worked with Starbucks. \"It's turned into a transaction business that has very little interpersonal interaction and engagement.\"\n\nMany Starbucks' stores feel more like a fast-food restaurant than a coffee shop, Cook said. \"They had this unique image and personality. That doesn't exist anymore.\"\n\n'Just another commodity product'\n\nStarbucks' shift from a sit-down shop to a primarily drive-thru and mobile pickup business has been gradual.\n\nThe company was hesitant to build out drive-thru stores during the 1990s, fearing they would take away from the third place appeal.\n\n\"We don't want to become just another commodity product,\" Starbucks finance chief Michael Casey said in the 1995 profile of the company. \"The drive-thrus are a way for the converted to get their coffee a little quicker. It's not the way we want people to discover the Starbucks experience.\"\n\nBut Starbucks warmed to the option, finding that many customers preferred the convenience of drive-thrus on their way to work. By 2005, nearly 15% of Starbucks' roughly 7,300 stores were drive-thru locations. For the first time that year, more than half of new Starbucks stores were drive-thru locations. Today, 70% of Starbucks locations have a drive-thru option.\n\nMobile ordering was another major step in Starbucks' road to becoming primarily a take-away business.\n\nIn 2014, Starbucks debuted its mobile ordering system, which allowed customers to place pickup orders from their smartphones without having to interact with an employee. Mobile ordering also gave the company more data on consumers and helped push them to Starbucks' loyalty program, benefiting Starbucks because loyalty members are its most profitable customers.\n\nMobile ordering surged during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, when Starbucks was required to temporarily close seating areas inside to customers to prevent the virus' spread. Mobile orders jumped from 17% of sales in early 2020 to 26% the following year.\n\nAlthough mobile ordering has been popular with busy customers and investors, growing to more than 30% of sales today, it has taken away from the sit-down experience, analysts say.\n\nStarbucks baristas have complained about the crush of additional orders coming in from mobile orders and struggles to keep up with demand. People enter and exit stores more frequently, opening and closing the door and letting in the cold or heat.\n\nMobile ordering \"commoditized\" Starbucks by leading it to focus on order volume and efficiency, said Joe Pine, the co-founder of consultancy Strategic Horizons who wrote a recent article about Starbucks' struggles in Harvard Business Review.\n\nStarbucks' menu changes also had an impact on this shift. Starbucks is less of a coffee shop today and more of an iced tea, coffee, energy drink and lemonade store, especially in the summer, when nearly 80% of the drinks are cold. Customers are less interested in lingering in an air-conditioned store sipping iced coffee, analysts say.\n\n'Reimagining the third place'\n\nStarbucks says that it's evolving its third place model from being a physical store to a feeling.\n\nIn 2022, Starbucks said it was \"reimagining the third place\" by investing $450 million in stores with new coffee-making equipment to improve efficiency for employees and improving Starbucks' mobile ordering system. One of these improvements is called the Siren System, which is designed to cut down the amount of time it takes to make cold drinks.\n\nStarbucks also is opening 2,000 new stores, including traditional Starbucks locations, pick-up stores, delivery-only stores and drive thru-only locations.\n\nEisen, the Starbucks employee in Buffalo, said Starbucks has tried to balance competing demands from customers who want to grab their orders and go and others who want to sit down.\n\nThe best way Starbucks can preserve the third place in the digital age is to improve ordering on the mobile app for both customers and workers, she said.\n\nThat means reducing wait times for customers and easing the burden on Starbucks workers so they have enough time to prepare drinks and acknowledge customers when they come in to pick up their orders.\n\n\"If the worker feels less stressed, they are able to greet the customer,\" she said. \"That allows the Starbucks worker and the customer to have that connection.\"\n\nIn-person socialization is alive in these states -- here's where people are the most social In-person socialization is alive in these states -- here's where people are the most social Rhode Island spends the most time socializing In-person socialization is alive in these states -- here's where people are the most social Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "scnow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SCNow"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Schultz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Howard Schultz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive-through", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drive-through"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starbucks", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Starbucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coffee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florence"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florence"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barista", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Barista"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take-out", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Take-out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mobile, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mobile, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Schultz, who stepped down as Starbucks' CEO (for a third time) and retired from Starbucks' board of directors last year, wrote a lengthy message on LinkedIn in May about the company's issues.\n\n\"U.S. operations are the primary reason for the company's fall from grace. The stores require a maniacal focus on the customer experience,\" he said. The company needs to \"focus on being experiential, not transactional.\"\n\nStarbucks' changes to its sit-down business model came in response to several trends -- demand from customers for ordering coffee from their cars in drive-thru lanes or on their smartphones. The shift from a business serving hot coffee to one in which cold coffees, teas and lemonades make up more than half of sales. The Covid-19 pandemic, which forced cafes to shut indoor seating.\n\nStarbucks shifted to meet Wall Street's demands, too. Starbucks found it could reduce labor costs and increase order volume by running a mostly drive-thru and take-away coffee business. Starbucks also found difficulties with being America's third place and did not want to become the public space and bathroom for everyone, including people coming into stores who were homeless or struggling with mental health challenges on city streets. Starbucks has closed some stores and restricted bathroom access over safety concerns.\n\nBut by prioritizing speed -- \"throughput\" in corporate parlance -- Starbucks hurt the appeal of sitting down for coffee in stores, some critics say.\n\n\"Their success has not enabled them to retain what people originally found so attractive about the brand,\" said Tom Cook, a principal at restaurant consultancy King-Casey who has worked with Starbucks. \"It's turned into a transaction business that has very little interpersonal interaction and engagement.\"\n\nMany Starbucks' stores feel more like a fast-food restaurant than a coffee shop, Cook said. \"They had this unique image and personality. That doesn't exist anymore.\"\n\n'Just another commodity product'\n\nStarbucks' shift from a sit-down shop to a primarily drive-thru and mobile pickup business has been gradual.\n\nThe company was hesitant to build out drive-thru stores during the 1990s, fearing they would take away from the third place appeal.\n\n\"We don't want to become just another commodity product,\" Starbucks finance chief Michael Casey said in the 1995 profile of the company. \"The drive-thrus are a way for the converted to get their coffee a little quicker. It's not the way we want people to discover the Starbucks experience.\"\n\nBut Starbucks warmed to the option, finding that many customers preferred the convenience of drive-thrus on their way to work. By 2005, nearly 15% of Starbucks' roughly 7,300 stores were drive-thru locations. For the first time that year, more than half of new Starbucks stores were drive-thru locations. Today, 70% of Starbucks locations have a drive-thru option.\n\nMobile ordering was another major step in Starbucks' road to becoming primarily a take-away business.\n\nIn 2014, Starbucks debuted its mobile ordering system, which allowed customers to place pickup orders from their smartphones without having to interact with an employee. Mobile ordering also gave the company more data on consumers and helped push them to Starbucks' loyalty program, benefiting Starbucks because loyalty members are its most profitable customers.\n\nMobile ordering surged during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, when Starbucks was required to temporarily close seating areas inside to customers to prevent the virus' spread. Mobile orders jumped from 17% of sales in early 2020 to 26% the following year.\n\nAlthough mobile ordering has been popular with busy customers and investors, growing to more than 30% of sales today, it has taken away from the sit-down experience, analysts say.\n\nStarbucks baristas have complained about the crush of additional orders coming in from mobile orders and struggles to keep up with demand. People enter and exit stores more frequently, opening and closing the door and letting in the cold or heat.\n\nMobile ordering \"commoditized\" Starbucks by leading it to focus on order volume and efficiency, said Joe Pine, the co-founder of consultancy Strategic Horizons who wrote a recent article about Starbucks' struggles in Harvard Business Review.\n\nStarbucks' menu changes also had an impact on this shift. Starbucks is less of a coffee shop today and more of an iced tea, coffee, energy drink and lemonade store, especially in the summer, when nearly 80% of the drinks are cold. Customers are less interested in lingering in an air-conditioned store sipping iced coffee, analysts say.\n\n'Reimagining the third place'\n\nStarbucks says that it's evolving its third place model from being a physical store to a feeling.\n\nIn 2022, Starbucks said it was \"reimagining the third place\" by investing $450 million in stores with new coffee-making equipment to improve efficiency for employees and improving Starbucks' mobile ordering system. One of these improvements is called the Siren System, which is designed to cut down the amount of time it takes to make cold drinks.\n\nStarbucks also is opening 2,000 new stores, including traditional Starbucks locations, pick-up stores, delivery-only stores and drive thru-only locations.\n\nEisen, the Starbucks employee in Buffalo, said Starbucks has tried to balance competing demands from customers who want to grab their orders and go and others who want to sit down.\n\nThe best way Starbucks can preserve the third place in the digital age is to improve ordering on the mobile app for both customers and workers, she said.\n\nThat means reducing wait times for customers and easing the burden on Starbucks workers so they have enough time to prepare drinks and acknowledge customers when they come in to pick up their orders.\n\n\"If the worker feels less stressed, they are able to greet the customer,\" she said. \"That allows the Starbucks worker and the customer to have that connection.\"\n\nIn-person socialization is alive in these states -- here's where people are the most social In-person socialization is alive in these states -- here's where people are the most social Rhode Island spends the most time socializing In-person socialization is alive in these states -- here's where people are the most social Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "nptelegraph.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "North Platte Nebraska's Newspaper"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Schultz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Howard Schultz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive-through", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drive-through"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starbucks", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Starbucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coffee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barista", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Barista"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take-out", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Take-out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Platte,_Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "North Platte, Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Platte, Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mobile, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mobile, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Recognizing the essential role of breakfast and the widespread love for coffee, the renowned coffee chain has introduced a tempting new pairings menu. Patrons ...\n\nYears ago, some people would spend hours at Starbucks. Today, it's a takeout counter. At many Starbucks locations, you're lucky to find anyone sitting down.\n\nUnder Howard Schultz, Starbucks' longtime leader, cafes were positioned as a \"third place\" between work and home, where people could linger for hours on plush purple armchairs, socialize and connect.\n\n\"If you look at the landscape of retail and restaurants in America, there is such a fracturing of places where people meet,\" Schultz said in a 1995 profile of Starbucks for an industry publication. \"There's nowhere for people to go. So we created a place where people can feel comfortable.\"\n\nThe idea of Starbucks as a third place became part of its corporate mythology. Starbucks aimed to create a welcoming environment for coffee drinkers and employees with comfortable seating, jazz music and the aroma of freshly brewed coffee. Employees who brewed and served Starbucks coffee, whom Starbucks called baristas, hand-wrote customers' names on their drink orders.\n\nPeople are also reading...

She witnessed first dates and helped a customer's propose to his spouse, writing \"will you marry me?\" on a cup.\n\n\"It was a cheerful, amazing thing to be part of it,\" she said of working at Starbucks and forming close relationships with customers. \"It's why so many employees stayed for so long.\"\n\nEisen has helped lead Starbucks Workers United, a group unionizing company stores.\n\nBut Starbucks' business has transformed, and it has struggled to maintain its identity as that third place along the way.\n\nMobile ordering and drive-thru\n\nMobile app and drive-thru orders make up more than 70% of Starbucks' sales at its approximately 9,500 company-operated stores in the United States. In some stores, customers complained online that Starbucks pulled out comfortable chairs and replaced them with hard wooden stools. Starbucks has also built pickup-only stores without seating. Machines that print customers' names have replaced baristas' handwriting on cups.\n\n\"Third place is a broader definition,\" current Starbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan said last year. The \"classic definition of third place -- it's a box where I go to meet someone -- it's frankly not relevant anymore in this context.\"\n\nStarbucks' sales in its home North America market dropped 3% last quarter.

Recognizing the essential role of breakfast and the widespread love for coffee, the renowned coffee chain has introduced a tempting new pairings menu. Patrons ...\n\nYears ago, some people would spend hours at Starbucks. Today, it's a takeout counter. At many Starbucks locations, you're lucky to find anyone sitting down.\n\nUnder Howard Schultz, Starbucks' longtime leader, cafes were positioned as a \"third place\" between work and home, where people could linger for hours on plush purple armchairs, socialize and connect.\n\n\"If you look at the landscape of retail and restaurants in America, there is such a fracturing of places where people meet,\" Schultz said in a 1995 profile of Starbucks for an industry publication. \"There's nowhere for people to go. So we created a place where people can feel comfortable.\"\n\nThe idea of Starbucks as a third place became part of its corporate mythology. Starbucks aimed to create a welcoming environment for coffee drinkers and employees with comfortable seating, jazz music and the aroma of freshly brewed coffee. Employees who brewed and served Starbucks coffee, whom Starbucks called baristas, hand-wrote customers' names on their drink orders.\n\nPeople are also reading...

She witnessed first dates and helped a customer's propose to his spouse, writing \"will you marry me?\" on a cup.\n\n\"It was a cheerful, amazing thing to be part of it,\" she said of working at Starbucks and forming close relationships with customers. \"It's why so many employees stayed for so long.\"\n\nEisen has helped lead Starbucks Workers United, a group unionizing company stores.\n\nBut Starbucks' business has transformed, and it has struggled to maintain its identity as that third place along the way.\n\nMobile ordering and drive-thru\n\nMobile app and drive-thru orders make up more than 70% of Starbucks' sales at its approximately 9,500 company-operated stores in the United States. In some stores, customers complained online that Starbucks pulled out comfortable chairs and replaced them with hard wooden stools. Starbucks has also built pickup-only stores without seating. Machines that print customers' names have replaced baristas' handwriting on cups.\n\n\"Third place is a broader definition,\" current Starbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan said last year. The \"classic definition of third place -- it's a box where I go to meet someone -- it's frankly not relevant anymore in this context.\"\n\nStarbucks' sales in its home North America market dropped 3% last quarter. Schultz, who stepped down as Starbucks' CEO (for a third time) and retired from Starbucks' board of directors last year, wrote a lengthy message on LinkedIn in May about the company's issues.\n\n\"U.S. operations are the primary reason for the company's fall from grace. The stores require a maniacal focus on the customer experience,\" he said. The company needs to \"focus on being experiential, not transactional.\"\n\nStarbucks' changes to its sit-down business model came in response to several trends -- demand from customers for ordering coffee from their cars in drive-thru lanes or on their smartphones. The shift from a business serving hot coffee to one in which cold coffees, teas and lemonades make up more than half of sales. The Covid-19 pandemic, which forced cafes to shut indoor seating.\n\nStarbucks shifted to meet Wall Street's demands, too. Starbucks found it could reduce labor costs and increase order volume by running a mostly drive-thru and take-away coffee business. Starbucks also found difficulties with being America's third place and did not want to become the public space and bathroom for everyone, including people coming into stores who were homeless or struggling with mental health challenges on city streets. Starbucks has closed some stores and restricted bathroom access over safety concerns.\n\nBut by prioritizing speed -- \"throughput\" in corporate parlance -- Starbucks hurt the appeal of sitting down for coffee in stores, some critics say.\n\n\"Their success has not enabled them to retain what people originally found so attractive about the brand,\" said Tom Cook, a principal at restaurant consultancy King-Casey who has worked with Starbucks. \"It's turned into a transaction business that has very little interpersonal interaction and engagement.\"\n\nMany Starbucks' stores feel more like a fast-food restaurant than a coffee shop, Cook said. \"They had this unique image and personality. That doesn't exist anymore.\"\n\n'Just another commodity product'\n\nStarbucks' shift from a sit-down shop to a primarily drive-thru and mobile pickup business has been gradual.\n\nThe company was hesitant to build out drive-thru stores during the 1990s, fearing they would take away from the third place appeal.\n\n\"We don't want to become just another commodity product,\" Starbucks finance chief Michael Casey said in the 1995 profile of the company. \"The drive-thrus are a way for the converted to get their coffee a little quicker. It's not the way we want people to discover the Starbucks experience.\"\n\nBut Starbucks warmed to the option, finding that many customers preferred the convenience of drive-thrus on their way to work. By 2005, nearly 15% of Starbucks' roughly 7,300 stores were drive-thru locations. For the first time that year, more than half of new Starbucks stores were drive-thru locations. Today, 70% of Starbucks locations have a drive-thru option.\n\nMobile ordering was another major step in Starbucks' road to becoming primarily a take-away business.\n\nIn 2014, Starbucks debuted its mobile ordering system, which allowed customers to place pickup orders from their smartphones without having to interact with an employee. Mobile ordering also gave the company more data on consumers and helped push them to Starbucks' loyalty program, benefiting Starbucks because loyalty members are its most profitable customers.\n\nMobile ordering surged during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, when Starbucks was required to temporarily close seating areas inside to customers to prevent the virus' spread. Mobile orders jumped from 17% of sales in early 2020 to 26% the following year.\n\nAlthough mobile ordering has been popular with busy customers and investors, growing to more than 30% of sales today, it has taken away from the sit-down experience, analysts say.\n\nStarbucks baristas have complained about the crush of additional orders coming in from mobile orders and struggles to keep up with demand. People enter and exit stores more frequently, opening and closing the door and letting in the cold or heat.\n\nMobile ordering \"commoditized\" Starbucks by leading it to focus on order volume and efficiency, said Joe Pine, the co-founder of consultancy Strategic Horizons who wrote a recent article about Starbucks' struggles in Harvard Business Review.\n\nStarbucks' menu changes also had an impact on this shift. Starbucks is less of a coffee shop today and more of an iced tea, coffee, energy drink and lemonade store, especially in the summer, when nearly 80% of the drinks are cold. Customers are less interested in lingering in an air-conditioned store sipping iced coffee, analysts say.\n\n'Reimagining the third place'\n\nStarbucks says that it's evolving its third place model from being a physical store to a feeling.\n\nIn 2022, Starbucks said it was \"reimagining the third place\" by investing $450 million in stores with new coffee-making equipment to improve efficiency for employees and improving Starbucks' mobile ordering system. One of these improvements is called the Siren System, which is designed to cut down the amount of time it takes to make cold drinks.\n\nStarbucks also is opening 2,000 new stores, including traditional Starbucks locations, pick-up stores, delivery-only stores and drive thru-only locations.\n\nEisen, the Starbucks employee in Buffalo, said Starbucks has tried to balance competing demands from customers who want to grab their orders and go and others who want to sit down.\n\nThe best way Starbucks can preserve the third place in the digital age is to improve ordering on the mobile app for both customers and workers, she said.\n\nThat means reducing wait times for customers and easing the burden on Starbucks workers so they have enough time to prepare drinks and acknowledge customers when they come in to pick up their orders.\n\n\"If the worker feels less stressed, they are able to greet the customer,\" she said. \"That allows the Starbucks worker and the customer to have that connection.\"\n\nIn-person socialization is alive in these states -- here's where people are the most social In-person socialization is alive in these states -- here's where people are the

One of these improvements is called the Siren System, which is designed to cut down the amount of time it takes to make cold drinks.\n\nStarbucks also is opening 2,000 new stores, including traditional Starbucks locations, pick-up stores, delivery-only stores and drive thru-only locations.\n\nEisen, the Starbucks employee in Buffalo, said Starbucks has tried to balance competing demands from customers who want to grab their orders and go and others who want to sit down.\n\nThe best way Starbucks can preserve the third place in the digital age is to improve ordering on the mobile app for both customers and workers, she said.\n\nThat means reducing wait times for customers and easing the burden on Starbucks workers so they have enough time to prepare drinks and acknowledge customers when they come in to pick up their orders.\n\n\"If the worker feels less stressed, they are able to greet the customer,\" she said. \"That allows the Starbucks worker and the customer to have that connection.\"\n\nIn-person socialization is alive in these states -- here's where people are the most social\n\nIn-person socialization is alive in these states -- here's where people are the most social\n\nRhode Island spends the most time socializing\n\nIn-person socialization is alive in these states -- here's where people are the most social\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "journalstar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "JournalStar.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nathaniel_meyersohn@journalstar.com", "name": "Nathaniel Meyersohn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Schultz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Howard Schultz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive-through", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drive-through"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starbucks", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Starbucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coffee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln,_Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lincoln, Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lincoln, Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barista", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Barista"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take-out", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Take-out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mobile, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mobile, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Sasse", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ben Sasse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Patrons ...\n\nYears ago, some people would spend hours at Starbucks. Today, it's a takeout counter. At many Starbucks locations, you're lucky to find anyone sitting down.\n\nUnder Howard Schultz, Starbucks' longtime leader, cafes were positioned as a \"third place\" between work and home, where people could linger for hours on plush purple armchairs, socialize and connect.\n\n\"If you look at the landscape of retail and restaurants in America, there is such a fracturing of places where people meet,\" Schultz said in a 1995 profile of Starbucks for an industry publication. \"There's nowhere for people to go. So we created a place where people can feel comfortable.\"\n\nThe idea of Starbucks as a third place became part of its corporate mythology. Starbucks aimed to create a welcoming environment for coffee drinkers and employees with comfortable seating, jazz music and the aroma of freshly brewed coffee. Employees who brewed and served Starbucks coffee, whom Starbucks called baristas, hand-wrote customers' names on their drink orders.\n\nPeople are also reading...

She witnessed first dates and helped a customer's propose to his spouse, writing \"will you marry me?\" on a cup.\n\n\"It was a cheerful, amazing thing to be part of it,\" she said of working at Starbucks and forming close relationships with customers. \"It's why so many employees stayed for so long.\"\n\nEisen has helped lead Starbucks Workers United, a group unionizing company stores.\n\nBut Starbucks' business has transformed, and it has struggled to maintain its identity as that third place along the way.\n\nMobile ordering and drive-thru\n\nMobile app and drive-thru orders make up more than 70% of Starbucks' sales at its approximately 9,500 company-operated stores in the United States. In some stores, customers complained online that Starbucks pulled out comfortable chairs and replaced them with hard wooden stools. Starbucks has also built pickup-only stores without seating. Machines that print customers' names have replaced baristas' handwriting on cups.\n\n\"Third place is a broader definition,\" current Starbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan said last year. The \"classic definition of third place -- it's a box where I go to meet someone -- it's frankly not relevant anymore in this context.\"\n\nStarbucks' sales in its home North America market dropped 3% last quarter. Schultz, who stepped down as Starbucks' CEO (for a third time) and retired from Starbucks' board of directors last year, wrote a lengthy message on LinkedIn in May about the company's issues.\n\n\"U.S. operations are the primary reason for the company's fall from grace. The stores require a maniacal focus on the customer experience,\" he said. The company needs to \"focus on being experiential, not transactional.\"\n\nStarbucks' changes to its sit-down business model came in response to several trends -- demand from customers for ordering coffee from their cars in drive-thru lanes or on their smartphones. The shift from a business serving hot coffee to one in which cold coffees, teas and lemonades make up more than half of sales. The Covid-19 pandemic, which forced cafes to shut indoor seating.\n\nStarbucks shifted to meet Wall Street's demands, too. Starbucks found it could reduce labor costs and increase order volume by running a mostly drive-thru and take-away coffee business. Starbucks also found difficulties with being America's third place and did not want to become the public space and bathroom for everyone, including people coming into stores who were homeless or struggling with mental health challenges on city streets. Starbucks has closed some stores and restricted bathroom access over safety concerns.\n\nBut by prioritizing speed -- \"throughput\" in corporate parlance -- Starbucks hurt the appeal of sitting down for coffee in stores, some critics say.\n\n\"Their success has not enabled them to retain what people originally found so attractive about the brand,\" said Tom Cook, a principal at restaurant consultancy King-Casey who has worked with Starbucks. \"It's turned into a transaction business that has very little interpersonal interaction and engagement.\"\n\nMany Starbucks' stores feel more like a fast-food restaurant than a coffee shop, Cook said. \"They had this unique image and personality. That doesn't exist anymore.\"\n\n'Just another commodity product'\n\nStarbucks' shift from a sit-down shop to a primarily drive-thru and mobile pickup business has been gradual.\n\nThe company was hesitant to build out drive-thru stores during the 1990s, fearing they would take away from the third place appeal.\n\n\"We don't want to become just another commodity product,\" Starbucks finance chief Michael Casey said in the 1995 profile of the company. \"The drive-thrus are a way for the converted to get their coffee a little quicker. It's not the way we want people to discover the Starbucks experience.\"\n\nBut Starbucks warmed to the option, finding that many customers preferred the convenience of drive-thrus on their way to work. By 2005, nearly 15% of Starbucks' roughly 7,300 stores were drive-thru locations. For the first time that year, more than half of new Starbucks stores were drive-thru locations. Today, 70% of Starbucks locations have a drive-thru option.\n\nMobile ordering was another major step in Starbucks' road to becoming primarily a take-away business.\n\nIn 2014, Starbucks debuted its mobile ordering system, which allowed customers to place pickup orders from their smartphones without having to interact with an employee. Mobile ordering also gave the company more data on consumers and helped push them to Starbucks' loyalty program, benefiting Starbucks because loyalty members are its most profitable customers.\n\nMobile ordering surged during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, when Starbucks was required to temporarily close seating areas inside to customers to prevent the virus' spread. Mobile orders jumped from 17% of sales in early 2020 to 26% the following year.\n\nAlthough mobile ordering has been popular with busy customers and investors, growing to more than 30% of sales today, it has taken away from the sit-down experience, analysts say.\n\nStarbucks baristas have complained about the crush of additional orders coming in from mobile orders and struggles to keep up with demand. People enter and exit stores more frequently, opening and closing the door and letting in the cold or heat.\n\nMobile ordering \"commoditized\" Starbucks by leading it to focus on order volume and efficiency, said Joe Pine, the co-founder of consultancy Strategic Horizons who wrote a recent article about Starbucks' struggles in Harvard Business Review.\n\nStarbucks' menu changes also had an impact on this shift. Starbucks is less of a coffee shop today and more of an iced tea, coffee, energy drink and lemonade store, especially in the summer, when nearly 80% of the drinks are cold. Customers are less interested in lingering in an air-conditioned store sipping iced coffee, analysts say.\n\n'Reimagining the third place'\n\nStarbucks says that it's evolving its third place model from being a physical store to a feeling.\n\nIn 2022, Starbucks said it was \"reimagining the third place\" by investing $450 million in stores with new coffee-making equipment to improve efficiency for employees and improving Starbucks' mobile ordering system. One of these improvements is called the Siren System, which is designed to cut down the amount of time it takes to make cold drinks.\n\nStarbucks also is opening 2,000 new stores, including traditional Starbucks locations, pick-up stores, delivery-only stores and drive thru-only locations.\n\nEisen, the Starbucks employee in Buffalo, said Starbucks has tried to balance competing demands from customers who want to grab their orders and go and others who want to sit down.\n\nThe best way Starbucks can preserve the third place in the digital age is to improve ordering on the mobile app for both customers and workers, she said.\n\nThat means reducing wait times for customers and easing the burden on Starbucks workers so they have enough time to prepare drinks and acknowledge customers when they come in to pick up their orders.\n\n\"If the worker feels less stressed, they are able to greet the customer,\" she said. \"That allows the Starbucks worker and the customer to have that connection.\"\n\nIn-person socialization is alive in these states -- here's where people are the most social In-person socialization is alive in these states -- here's where people are the

Starbucks aimed to create a welcoming environment for coffee drinkers and employees with comfortable seating, jazz music and the aroma of freshly brewed coffee. Employees who brewed and served Starbucks coffee, whom Starbucks called baristas, hand-wrote customers' names on their drink orders.\n\nPeople are also reading...

She witnessed first dates and helped a customer's propose to his spouse, writing \"will you marry me?\" on a cup.\n\n\"It was a cheerful, amazing thing to be part of it,\" she said of working at Starbucks and forming close relationships with customers. \"It's why so many employees stayed for so long.\"\n\nEisen has helped lead Starbucks Workers United, a group unionizing company stores.\n\nBut Starbucks' business has transformed, and it has struggled to maintain its identity as that third place along the way.\n\nMobile ordering and drive-thru\n\nMobile app and drive-thru orders make up more than 70% of Starbucks' sales at its approximately 9,500 company-operated stores in the United States. In some stores, customers complained online that Starbucks pulled out comfortable chairs and replaced them with hard wooden stools. Starbucks has also built pickup-only stores without seating. Machines that print customers' names have replaced baristas' handwriting on cups.\n\n\"Third place is a broader definition,\" current Starbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan said last year. The \"classic definition of third place -- it's a box where I go to meet someone -- it's frankly not relevant anymore in this context.\"\n\nStarbucks' sales in its home North America market dropped 3% last quarter. Schultz, who stepped down as Starbucks' CEO (for a third time) and retired from Starbucks' board of directors last year, wrote a lengthy message on LinkedIn in May about the company's issues.\n\n\"U.S. operations are the primary reason for the company's fall from grace. The stores require a maniacal focus on the customer experience,\" he said. The company needs to \"focus on being experiential, not transactional.\"\n\nStarbucks' changes to its sit-down business model came in response to several trends -- demand from customers for ordering coffee from their cars in drive-thru lanes or on their smartphones. The shift from a business serving hot coffee to one in which cold coffees, teas and lemonades make up more than half of sales. The Covid-19 pandemic, which forced cafes to shut indoor seating.\n\nStarbucks shifted to meet Wall Street's demands, too. Starbucks found it could reduce labor costs and increase order volume by running a mostly drive-thru and take-away coffee business. Starbucks also found difficulties with being America's third place and did not want to become the public space and bathroom for everyone, including people coming into stores who were homeless or struggling with mental health challenges on city streets. Starbucks has closed some stores and restricted bathroom access over safety concerns.\n\nBut by prioritizing speed -- \"throughput\" in corporate parlance -- Starbucks hurt the appeal of sitting down for coffee in stores, some critics say.\n\n\"Their success has not enabled them to retain what people originally found so attractive about the brand,\" said Tom Cook, a principal at restaurant consultancy King-Casey who has worked with Starbucks. \"It's turned into a transaction business that has very little interpersonal interaction and engagement.\"\n\nMany Starbucks' stores feel more like a fast-food restaurant than a coffee shop, Cook said. \"They had this unique image and personality. That doesn't exist anymore.\"\n\n'Just another commodity product'\n\nStarbucks' shift from a sit-down shop to a primarily drive-thru and mobile pickup business has been gradual.\n\nThe company was hesitant to build out drive-thru stores during the 1990s, fearing they would take away from the third place appeal.\n\n\"We don't want to become just another commodity product,\" Starbucks finance chief Michael Casey said in the 1995 profile of the company. \"The drive-thrus are a way for the converted to get their coffee a little quicker. It's not the way we want people to discover the Starbucks experience.\"\n\nBut Starbucks warmed to the option, finding that many customers preferred the convenience of drive-thrus on their way to work. By 2005, nearly 15% of Starbucks' roughly 7,300 stores were drive-thru locations. For the first time that year, more than half of new Starbucks stores were drive-thru locations. Today, 70% of Starbucks locations have a drive-thru option.\n\nMobile ordering was another major step in Starbucks' road to becoming primarily a take-away business.\n\nIn 2014, Starbucks debuted its mobile ordering system, which allowed customers to place pickup orders from their smartphones without having to interact with an employee. Mobile ordering also gave the company more data on consumers and helped push them to Starbucks' loyalty program, benefiting Starbucks because loyalty members are its most profitable customers.\n\nMobile ordering surged during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, when Starbucks was required to temporarily close seating areas inside to customers to prevent the virus' spread. Mobile orders jumped from 17% of sales in early 2020 to 26% the following year.\n\nAlthough mobile ordering has been popular with busy customers and investors, growing to more than 30% of sales today, it has taken away from the sit-down experience, analysts say.\n\nStarbucks baristas have complained about the crush of additional orders coming in from mobile orders and struggles to keep up with demand. People enter and exit stores more frequently, opening and closing the door and letting in the cold or heat.\n\nMobile ordering \"commoditized\" Starbucks by leading it to focus on order volume and efficiency, said Joe Pine, the co-founder of consultancy Strategic Horizons who wrote a recent article about Starbucks' struggles in Harvard Business Review.\n\nStarbucks' menu changes also had an impact on this shift. Starbucks is less of a coffee shop today and more of an iced tea, coffee, energy drink and lemonade store, especially in the summer, when nearly 80% of the drinks are cold. Customers are less interested in lingering in an air-conditioned store sipping iced coffee, analysts say.\n\n'Reimagining the third place'\n\nStarbucks says that it's evolving its third place model from being a physical store to a feeling.\n\nIn 2022, Starbucks said it was \"reimagining the third place\" by investing $450 million in stores with new coffee-making equipment to improve efficiency for employees and improving Starbucks' mobile ordering system. One of these improvements is called the Siren System, which is designed to cut down the amount of time it takes to make cold drinks.\n\nStarbucks also is opening 2,000 new stores, including traditional Starbucks locations, pick-up stores, delivery-only stores and drive thru-only locations.\n\nEisen, the Starbucks employee in Buffalo, said Starbucks has tried to balance competing demands from customers who want to grab their orders and go and others who want to sit down.\n\nThe best way Starbucks can preserve the third place in the digital age is to improve ordering on the mobile app for both customers and workers, she said.\n\nThat means reducing wait times for customers and easing the burden on Starbucks workers so they have enough time to prepare drinks and acknowledge customers when they come in to pick up their orders.\n\n\"If the worker feels less stressed, they are able to greet the customer,\" she said. \"That allows the Starbucks worker and the customer to have that connection.\"\n\nIn-person socialization is alive in these states -- here's where people are the most social Rhode Island spends the most time socializing In-person socialization is alive in

Today, it's a takeout counter. At many Starbucks locations, you're lucky to find anyone sitting down.\n\nUnder Howard Schultz, Starbucks' longtime leader, cafes were positioned as a \"third place\" between work and home, where people could linger for hours on plush purple armchairs, socialize and connect.\n\n\"If you look at the landscape of retail and restaurants in America, there is such a fracturing of places where people meet,\" Schultz said in a 1995 profile of Starbucks for an industry publication. \"There's nowhere for people to go. So we created a place where people can feel comfortable.\"\n\nThe idea of Starbucks as a third place became part of its corporate mythology. Starbucks aimed to create a welcoming environment for coffee drinkers and employees with comfortable seating, jazz music and the aroma of freshly brewed coffee. Employees who brewed and served Starbucks coffee, whom Starbucks called baristas, hand-wrote customers' names on their drink orders.\n\nFormer St. Louis officials Lewis Reed, John Collins-Muhammad released from federal prison Cardinals closer Ryan Helsley elects not to pitch in All-Star Game, replaced on NL roster New St. Louis Public Schools communications chief also lives in Texas St. Charles teacher sexually abused teen girl for years, police say 'Steal of the draft': Cardinals pounce at No. 7 on collegiate infielder JJ Wetherholt Cardinals TV analyst Jim Edmonds draws controversy with Cubs celebration gripe Trump injured but 'fine' after attempted assassination at rally; shooter and one attendee are dead Grades for Cardinals position players: the good, bad and ugly St. Louis hosts emergency and military training for massive earthquake O'Fallon, Mo., firm to expand, add jobs with millions in federal dollars for semiconductor push MSD's recently retired CEO was paid more than $100,000 for unused vacation, sick time St. Louis Public Schools halts hiring over questions on new administrator from Texas New report says MetroLink expansion in St. Louis would aid economy HOA rules in the St. Louis area can turn into fighting words Lush gardens surround renovated historic Kirkwood home\n\nBy the time Michelle Eisen joined Starbucks in 2010 as an employee in Buffalo, New York, her store was always packed during the holidays with people meeting friends and family. She witnessed first dates and helped a customer's propose to his spouse, writing \"will you marry me?\" on a cup.\n\n\"It was a cheerful, amazing thing to be part of it,\" she said of working at Starbucks and forming close relationships with customers. \"It's why so many employees stayed for so long.\"\n\nEisen has helped lead Starbucks Workers United, a group unionizing company stores.\n\nBut Starbucks' business has transformed, and it has struggled to maintain its identity as that third place along the way.\n\nMobile ordering and drive-thru\n\nMobile app and drive-thru orders make up more than 70% of Starbucks' sales at its approximately 9,500 company-operated stores in the United States. In some stores, customers complained online that Starbucks pulled out comfortable chairs and replaced them with hard wooden stools. Starbucks has also built pickup-only stores without seating. Machines that print customers' names have replaced baristas' handwriting on cups.\n\n\"Third place is a broader definition,\" current Starbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan said last year. The \"classic definition of third place -- it's a box where I go to meet someone -- it's frankly not relevant anymore in this context.\"\n\nStarbucks' sales in its home North America market dropped 3% last quarter. Schultz, who stepped down as Starbucks' CEO (for a third time) and retired from Starbucks' board of directors last year, wrote a lengthy message on LinkedIn in May about the company's issues.\n\n\"U.S. operations are the primary reason for the company's fall from grace. The stores require a maniacal focus on the customer experience,\" he said. The company needs to \"focus on being experiential, not transactional.\"\n\nStarbucks' changes to its sit-down business model came in response to several trends -- demand from customers for ordering coffee from their cars in drive-thru lanes or on their smartphones. The shift from a business serving hot coffee to one in which cold coffees, teas and lemonades make up more than half of sales. The Covid-19 pandemic, which forced cafes to shut indoor seating.\n\nStarbucks shifted to meet Wall Street's demands, too. Starbucks found it could reduce labor costs and increase order volume by running a mostly drive-thru and take-away coffee business. Starbucks also found difficulties with being America's third place and did not want to become the public space and bathroom for everyone, including people coming into stores who were homeless or struggling with mental health challenges on city streets. Starbucks has closed some stores and restricted bathroom access over safety concerns.\n\nBut by prioritizing speed -- \"throughput\" in corporate parlance -- Starbucks hurt the appeal of sitting down for coffee in stores, some critics say.\n\n\"Their success has not enabled them to retain what people originally found so attractive about the brand,\" said Tom Cook, a principal at restaurant consultancy King-Casey who has worked with Starbucks. \"It's turned into a transaction business that has very little interpersonal interaction and engagement.\"\n\nMany Starbucks' stores feel more like a fast-food restaurant than a coffee shop, Cook said. \"They had this unique image and personality. That doesn't exist anymore.\"\n\n'Just another commodity product'\n\nStarbucks' shift from a sit-down shop to a primarily drive-thru and mobile pickup business has been gradual.\n\nThe company was hesitant to build out drive-thru stores during the 1990s, fearing they would take away from the third place appeal.\n\n\"We don't want to become just another commodity product,\" Starbucks finance chief Michael Casey said in the 1995 profile of the company. \"The drive-thrus are a way for the converted to get their coffee a little quicker. It's not the way we want people to discover the Starbucks experience.\"\n\nBut Starbucks warmed to the option, finding that many customers preferred the convenience of drive-thrus on their way to work. By 2005, nearly 15% of Starbucks' roughly 7,300 stores were drive-thru locations. For the first time that year, more than half of new Starbucks stores were drive-thru locations. Today, 70% of Starbucks locations have a drive-thru option.\n\nMobile ordering was another major step in Starbucks' road to becoming primarily a take-away business.\n\nIn 2014, Starbucks debuted its mobile ordering system, which allowed customers to place pickup orders from their smartphones without having to interact with an employee. Mobile ordering also gave the company more data on consumers and helped push them to Starbucks' loyalty program, benefiting Starbucks because loyalty members are its most profitable customers.\n\nMobile ordering surged during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, when Starbucks was required to temporarily close seating areas inside to customers to prevent the virus' spread. Mobile orders jumped from 17% of sales in early 2020 to 26% the following year.\n\nAlthough mobile ordering has been popular with busy customers and investors, growing to more than 30% of sales today, it has taken away from the sit-down experience, analysts say.\n\nStarbucks baristas have complained about the crush of additional orders coming in from mobile orders and struggles to keep up with demand. People enter and exit stores more frequently, opening and closing the door and letting in the cold or heat.\n\nMobile ordering \"commoditized\" Starbucks by leading it to focus on order volume and efficiency, said Joe Pine, the co-founder of consultancy Strategic Horizons who wrote a recent article about Starbucks' struggles in Harvard Business Review.\n\nStarbucks' menu changes also had an impact on this shift. Starbucks is less of a coffee shop today and more of an iced tea, coffee, energy drink and lemonade store, especially in the summer, when nearly 80% of the drinks are cold. Customers are less interested in lingering in an air-conditioned store sipping iced coffee, analysts say.\n\n'Reimagining the third place'\n\nStarbucks says that it's evolving its third place model from being a physical store to a feeling.\n\nIn 2022, Starbucks said it was \"reimagining the third place\" by investing $450 million in stores with new coffee-making equipment to improve efficiency for employees and improving Starbucks' mobile ordering system. One of these improvements is called the Siren System, which is designed to cut down the amount of time it takes to make cold drinks.\n\nStarbucks also is opening 2,000 new stores, including traditional Starbucks locations, pick-up stores, delivery-only stores and drive thru-only locations.\n\nEisen, the Starbucks employee in Buffalo, said Starbucks has tried to balance competing demands from customers who want to grab their orders and go and others who want to sit down.\n\nThe best way Starbucks can preserve the third place in the digital age is to improve ordering on the mobile app for both customers and workers, she said.\n\nThat means reducing wait times for customers and easing the burden on Starbucks workers so they have enough time to prepare drinks and acknowledge customers when they come in to pick up their orders.\n\n\"If the worker feels less stressed, they are able to greet the customer,\" she said. \"That allows the Starbucks worker and the customer to have that connection.\"\n\n0 Comments", "source": {"uri": "stltoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "St. Louis Post-Dispatch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nathaniel_meyersohn@stltoday.com", "name": "Nathaniel Meyersohn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Schultz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Howard Schultz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive-through", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drive-through"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starbucks", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Starbucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coffee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Public_Schools", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Public Schools"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barista", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Barista"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take-out", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Take-out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mobile, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mobile, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Prisons", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Prisons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

People enter and exit stores more frequently, opening and closing the door and letting in the cold or heat.\n\nMobile ordering \"commoditized\" Starbucks by leading it to focus on order volume and efficiency, said Joe Pine, the co-founder of consultancy Strategic Horizons who wrote a recent article about Starbucks' struggles in Harvard Business Review.\n\nStarbucks' menu changes also had an impact on this shift. Starbucks is less of a coffee shop today and more of an iced tea, coffee, energy drink and lemonade store, especially in the summer, when nearly 80% of the drinks are cold. Customers are less interested in lingering in an air-conditioned store sipping iced coffee, analysts say.\n\n'Reimagining the third place'\n\nStarbucks says that it's evolving its third place model from being a physical store to a feeling.\n\nIn 2022, Starbucks said it was \"reimagining the third place\" by investing $450 million in stores with new coffee-making equipment to improve efficiency for employees and improving Starbucks' mobile ordering system. One of these improvements is called the Siren System, which is designed to cut down the amount of time it takes to make cold drinks.\n\nStarbucks also is opening 2,000 new stores, including traditional Starbucks locations, pick-up stores, delivery-only stores and drive thru-only locations.\n\nEisen, the Starbucks employee in Buffalo, said Starbucks has tried to balance competing demands from customers who want to grab their orders and go and others who want to sit down.\n\nThe best way Starbucks can preserve the third place in the digital age is to improve ordering on the mobile app for both customers and workers, she said.\n\nThat means reducing wait times for customers and easing the burden on Starbucks workers so they have enough time to prepare drinks and acknowledge customers when they come in to pick up their orders.\n\n\"If the worker feels less stressed, they are able to greet the customer,\" she said. \"That allows the Starbucks worker and the customer to have that connection.\"\n\nIn-person socialization is alive in these states -- here's where people are the most social In-person socialization is alive in these states -- here's where people are the most social Rhode Island spends the most time socializing In-person socialization is alive in these states -- here's where people are the most social\n\nSubscribe to stay connected to Tucson.

Recognizing the essential role of breakfast and the widespread love for coffee, the renowned coffee chain has introduced a tempting new pairings menu. Patrons ...\n\nYears ago, some people would spend hours at Starbucks. Today, it's a takeout counter. At many Starbucks locations, you're lucky to find anyone sitting down.\n\nUnder Howard Schultz, Starbucks' longtime leader, cafes were positioned as a \"third place\" between work and home, where people could linger for hours on plush purple armchairs, socialize and connect.\n\n\"If you look at the landscape of retail and restaurants in America, there is such a fracturing of places where people meet,\" Schultz said in a 1995 profile of Starbucks for an industry publication. \"There's nowhere for people to go. So we created a place where people can feel comfortable.\"\n\nThe idea of Starbucks as a third place became part of its corporate mythology. Starbucks aimed to create a welcoming environment for coffee drinkers and employees with comfortable seating, jazz music and the aroma of freshly brewed coffee. Employees who brewed and served Starbucks coffee, whom Starbucks called baristas, hand-wrote customers' names on their drink orders.\n\nPeople are also reading...

She witnessed first dates and helped a customer's propose to his spouse, writing \"will you marry me?\" on a cup.\n\n\"It was a cheerful, amazing thing to be part of it,\" she said of working at Starbucks and forming close relationships with customers. \"It's why so many employees stayed for so long.\"\n\nEisen has helped lead Starbucks Workers United, a group unionizing company stores.\n\nBut Starbucks' business has transformed, and it has struggled to maintain its identity as that third place along the way.\n\nMobile ordering and drive-thru\n\nMobile app and drive-thru orders make up more than 70% of Starbucks' sales at its approximately 9,500 company-operated stores in the United States. In some stores, customers complained online that Starbucks pulled out comfortable chairs and replaced them with hard wooden stools. Starbucks has also built pickup-only stores without seating. Machines that print customers' names have replaced baristas' handwriting on cups.\n\n\"Third place is a broader definition,\" current Starbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan said last year. The \"classic definition of third place -- it's a box where I go to meet someone -- it's frankly not relevant anymore in this context.\"\n\nStarbucks' sales in its home North America market dropped 3% last quarter. Schultz, who stepped down as Starbucks' CEO (for a third time) and retired from Starbucks' board of directors last year, wrote a lengthy message on LinkedIn in May about the company's issues.\n\n\"U.S. operations are the primary reason for the company's fall from grace. The stores require a maniacal focus on the customer experience,\" he said. The company needs to \"focus on being experiential, not transactional.\"\n\nStarbucks' changes to its sit-down business model came in response to several trends -- demand from customers for ordering coffee from their cars in drive-thru lanes or on their smartphones. The shift from a business serving hot coffee to one in which cold coffees, teas and lemonades make up more than half of sales. The Covid-19 pandemic, which forced cafes to shut indoor seating.\n\nStarbucks shifted to meet Wall Street's demands, too. Starbucks found it could reduce labor costs and increase order volume by running a mostly drive-thru and take-away coffee business. Starbucks also found difficulties with being America's third place and did not want to become the public space and bathroom for everyone, including people coming into stores who were homeless or struggling with mental health challenges on city streets. Starbucks has closed some stores and restricted bathroom access over safety concerns.\n\nBut by prioritizing speed -- \"throughput\" in corporate parlance -- Starbucks hurt the appeal of sitting down for coffee in stores, some critics say.\n\n\"Their success has not enabled them to retain what people originally found so attractive about the brand,\" said Tom Cook, a principal at restaurant consultancy King-Casey who has worked with Starbucks. \"It's turned into a transaction business that has very little interpersonal interaction and engagement.\"\n\nMany Starbucks' stores feel more like a fast-food restaurant than a coffee shop, Cook said. \"They had this unique image and personality. That doesn't exist anymore.\"\n\n'Just another commodity product'\n\nStarbucks' shift from a sit-down shop to a primarily drive-thru and mobile pickup business has been gradual.\n\nThe company was hesitant to build out drive-thru stores during the 1990s, fearing they would take away from the third place appeal.\n\n\"We don't want to become just another commodity product,\" Starbucks finance chief Michael Casey said in the 1995 profile of the company. \"The drive-thrus are a way for the converted to get their coffee a little quicker. It's not the way we want people to discover the Starbucks experience.\"\n\nBut Starbucks warmed to the option, finding that many customers preferred the convenience of drive-thrus on their way to work. By 2005, nearly 15% of Starbucks' roughly 7,300 stores were drive-thru locations. For the first time that year, more than half of new Starbucks stores were drive-thru locations. Today, 70% of Starbucks locations have a drive-thru option.\n\nMobile ordering was another major step in Starbucks' road to becoming primarily a take-away business.\n\nIn 2014, Starbucks debuted its mobile ordering system, which allowed customers to place pickup orders from their smartphones without having to interact with an employee. Mobile ordering also gave the company more data on consumers and helped push them to Starbucks' loyalty program, benefiting Starbucks because loyalty members are its most profitable customers.\n\nMobile ordering surged during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, when Starbucks was required to temporarily close seating areas inside to customers to prevent the virus' spread. Mobile orders jumped from 17% of sales in early 2020 to 26% the following year.\n\nAlthough mobile ordering has been popular with busy customers and investors, growing to more than 30% of sales today, it has taken away from the sit-down experience, analysts say.\n\nStarbucks baristas have complained about the crush of additional orders coming in from mobile orders and struggles to keep up with demand.

Starbucks is less of a coffee shop today and more of an iced tea, coffee, energy drink and lemonade store, especially in the summer, when nearly 80% of the drinks are cold. Customers are less interested in lingering in an air-conditioned store sipping iced coffee, analysts say.\n\n'Reimagining the third place'\n\nStarbucks says that it's evolving its third place model from being a physical store to a feeling.\n\nIn 2022, Starbucks said it was \"reimagining the third place\" by investing $450 million in stores with new coffee-making equipment to improve efficiency for employees and improving Starbucks' mobile ordering system.

Patrons ...\n\nYears ago, some people would spend hours at Starbucks. Today, it's a takeout counter. At many Starbucks locations, you're lucky to find anyone sitting down.\n\nUnder Howard Schultz, Starbucks' longtime leader, cafes were positioned as a \"third place\" between work and home, where people could linger for hours on plush purple armchairs, socialize and connect.\n\n\"If you look at the landscape of retail and restaurants in America, there is such a fracturing of places where people meet,\" Schultz said in a 1995 profile of Starbucks for an industry publication. \"There's nowhere for people to go. So we created a place where people can feel comfortable.\"\n\nThe idea of Starbucks as a third place became part of its corporate mythology. Starbucks aimed to create a welcoming environment for coffee drinkers and employees with comfortable seating, jazz music and the aroma of freshly brewed coffee. Employees who brewed and served Starbucks coffee, whom Starbucks called baristas, hand-wrote customers' names on their drink orders.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nUPDATE: Cedar Lake woman killed in Monday's storm remembered as 'rock of the family' Ex-Crown Point real estate agents indicted on charges of $5 million in COVID relief fraud after allegedly spending money on Porsche and country club NWI Business Ins and Outs: Coppolillo's Italian Steakhouse, Veleros Mexican Restaurant, New Age Baking Company, Chick-fil-A, Protein Bar & Kitchen, Chipotle, Chippopotamus and Play It Again Sports opening Coroner identifies deceased in Schererville crash Portage mom charged with leaving 4 young children 'to fend for themselves,' cops say Pierogi Fest to return for 30th year, feature Blues Brothers impersonators, bluegrass-playing friars and a new 'Who is Smarter than a University of Chicago Physician' game show Classic car collection lost to fire during power outage National Weather Service issues tornado, severe thunderstorm warnings for Northwest Indiana Davich: Valpo boy pinned under truck to be released from hospital: 'It's a miracle' Trump injured but 'fine' after attempted assassination at rally; shooter and one attendee are dead Milwaukee Brewers draft Lake Central pitcher Griffin Tobias Mug released of area foster mom charged in smothering death of 10-year-old Earlier warnings failed to prevent Valpo sexual assault, charges say Man molested girls, saying he wanted marriage, baby, Portage police say Davich: Parishioners leave churches to follow Jesus' lead: 'A great moment for our churches'\n\nBy the time Michelle Eisen joined Starbucks in 2010 as an employee in Buffalo, New York, her store was always packed during the holidays with people meeting friends and family. She witnessed first dates and helped a customer's propose to his spouse, writing \"will you marry me?\" on a cup.\n\n\"It was a cheerful, amazing thing to be part of it,\" she said of working at Starbucks and forming close relationships with customers. \"It's why so many employees stayed for so long.\"\n\nEisen has helped lead Starbucks Workers United, a group unionizing company stores.\n\nBut Starbucks' business has transformed, and it has struggled to maintain its identity as that third place along the way.\n\nMobile ordering and drive-thru\n\nMobile app and drive-thru orders make up more than 70% of Starbucks' sales at its approximately 9,500 company-operated stores in the United States. In some stores, customers complained online that Starbucks pulled out comfortable chairs and replaced them with hard wooden stools. Starbucks has also built pickup-only stores without seating. Machines that print customers' names have replaced baristas' handwriting on cups.\n\n\"Third place is a broader definition,\" current Starbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan said last year. The \"classic definition of third place -- it's a box where I go to meet someone -- it's frankly not relevant anymore in this context.\"\n\nStarbucks' sales in its home North America market dropped 3% last quarter. Schultz, who stepped down as Starbucks' CEO (for a third time) and retired from Starbucks' board of directors last year, wrote a lengthy message on LinkedIn in May about the company's issues.\n\n\"U.S. operations are the primary reason for the company's fall from grace. The stores require a maniacal focus on the customer experience,\" he said. The company needs to \"focus on being experiential, not transactional.\"\n\nStarbucks' changes to its sit-down business model came in response to several trends -- demand from customers for ordering coffee from their cars in drive-thru lanes or on their smartphones. The shift from a business serving hot coffee to one in which cold coffees, teas and lemonades make up more than half of sales. The Covid-19 pandemic, which forced cafes to shut indoor seating.\n\nStarbucks shifted to meet Wall Street's demands, too. Starbucks found it could reduce labor costs and increase order volume by running a mostly drive-thru and take-away coffee business. Starbucks also found difficulties with being America's third place and did not want to become the public space and bathroom for everyone, including people coming into stores who were homeless or struggling with mental health challenges on city streets. Starbucks has closed some stores and restricted bathroom access over safety concerns.\n\nBut by prioritizing speed -- \"throughput\" in corporate parlance -- Starbucks hurt the appeal of sitting down for coffee in stores, some critics say.\n\n\"Their success has not enabled them to retain what people originally found so attractive about the brand,\" said Tom Cook, a principal at restaurant consultancy King-Casey who has worked with Starbucks. \"It's turned into a transaction business that has very little interpersonal interaction and engagement.\"\n\nMany Starbucks' stores feel more like a fast-food restaurant than a coffee shop, Cook said. \"They had this unique image and personality. That doesn't exist anymore.\"\n\n'Just another commodity product'\n\nStarbucks' shift from a sit-down shop to a primarily drive-thru and mobile pickup business has been gradual.\n\nThe company was hesitant to build out drive-thru stores during the 1990s, fearing they would take away from the third place appeal.\n\n\"We don't want to become just another commodity product,\" Starbucks finance chief Michael Casey said in the 1995 profile of the company. \"The drive-thrus are a way for the converted to get their coffee a little quicker. It's not the way we want people to discover the Starbucks experience.\"\n\nBut Starbucks warmed to the option, finding that many customers preferred the convenience of drive-thrus on their way to work. By 2005, nearly 15% of Starbucks' roughly 7,300 stores were drive-thru locations. For the first time that year, more than half of new Starbucks stores were drive-thru locations. Today, 70% of Starbucks locations have a drive-thru option.\n\nMobile ordering was another major step in Starbucks' road to becoming primarily a take-away business.\n\nIn 2014, Starbucks debuted its mobile ordering system, which allowed customers to place pickup orders from their smartphones without having to interact with an employee. Mobile ordering also gave the company more data on consumers and helped push them to Starbucks' loyalty program, benefiting Starbucks because loyalty members are its most profitable customers.\n\nMobile ordering surged during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, when Starbucks was required to temporarily close seating areas inside to customers to prevent the virus' spread. Mobile orders jumped from 17% of sales in early 2020 to 26% the following year.\n\nAlthough mobile ordering has been popular with busy customers and investors, growing to more than 30% of sales today, it has taken away from the sit-down experience, analysts say.\n\nStarbucks baristas have complained about the crush of additional orders coming in from mobile orders and struggles to keep up with demand. People enter and exit stores more frequently, opening and closing the door and letting in the cold or heat.\n\nMobile ordering \"commoditized\" Starbucks by leading it to focus on order volume and efficiency, said Joe Pine, the co-founder of consultancy Strategic Horizons who wrote a recent article about Starbucks' struggles in Harvard Business Review.\n\nStarbucks' menu changes also had an impact on this shift. Starbucks is less of a coffee shop today and more of an iced tea, coffee, energy drink and lemonade store, especially in the summer, when nearly 80% of the drinks are cold. Customers are less interested in lingering in an air-conditioned store sipping iced coffee, analysts say.\n\n'Reimagining the third place'\n\nStarbucks says that it's evolving its third place model from being a physical store to a feeling.\n\nIn 2022, Starbucks said it was \"reimagining the third place\" by investing $450 million in stores with new coffee-making equipment to improve efficiency for employees and improving Starbucks' mobile ordering system. One of these improvements is called the Siren System, which is designed to cut down the amount of time it takes to make cold drinks.\n\nStarbucks also is opening 2,000 new stores, including traditional Starbucks locations, pick-up stores, delivery-only stores and drive thru-only locations.\n\nEisen, the Starbucks employee in Buffalo, said Starbucks has tried to balance competing demands from customers who want to grab their orders and go and others who want to sit down.\n\nThe best way Starbucks can preserve the third place in the digital age is to improve ordering on the mobile app for both customers and workers, she said.\n\nThat means reducing wait times for customers and easing the burden on Starbucks workers so they have enough time to prepare drinks and acknowledge customers when they come in to pick up their orders.\n\n\"If the worker feels less stressed, they are able to greet the customer,\" she said. \"That allows the Starbucks worker and the customer to have that connection.\"\n\nIn-person socialization is alive in these states -- here's where people are the most social\n\nIn-person socialization is alive in these states -- here's where people are

Starbucks aimed to create a welcoming environment for coffee drinkers and employees with comfortable seating, jazz music and the aroma of freshly brewed coffee. Employees who brewed and served Starbucks coffee, whom Starbucks called baristas, hand-wrote customers' names on their drink orders.\n\nPeople are also reading...

She witnessed first dates and helped a customer's propose to his spouse, writing \"will you marry me?\" on a cup.\n\n\"It was a cheerful, amazing thing to be part of it,\" she said of working at Starbucks and forming close relationships with customers. \"It's why so many employees stayed for so long.\"\n\nEisen has helped lead Starbucks Workers United, a group unionizing company stores.\n\nBut Starbucks' business has transformed, and it has struggled to maintain its identity as that third place along the way.\n\nMobile ordering and drive-thru\n\nMobile app and drive-thru orders make up more than 70% of Starbucks' sales at its approximately 9,500 company-operated stores in the United States. In some stores, customers complained online that Starbucks pulled out comfortable chairs and replaced them with hard wooden stools. Starbucks has also built pickup-only stores without seating. Machines that print customers' names have replaced baristas' handwriting on cups.\n\n\"Third place is a broader definition,\" current Starbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan said last year. The \"classic definition of third place -- it's a box where I go to meet someone -- it's frankly not relevant anymore in this context.\"\n\nStarbucks' sales in its home North America market dropped 3% last quarter. Schultz, who stepped down as Starbucks' CEO (for a third time) and retired from Starbucks' board of directors last year, wrote a lengthy message on LinkedIn in May about the company's issues.\n\n\"U.S. operations are the primary reason for the company's fall from grace. The stores require a maniacal focus on the customer experience,\" he said. The company needs to \"focus on being experiential, not transactional.\"\n\nStarbucks' changes to its sit-down business model came in response to several trends -- demand from customers for ordering coffee from their cars in drive-thru lanes or on their smartphones. The shift from a business serving hot coffee to one in which cold coffees, teas and lemonades make up more than half of sales. The Covid-19 pandemic, which forced cafes to shut indoor seating.\n\nStarbucks shifted to meet Wall Street's demands, too. Starbucks found it could reduce labor costs and increase order volume by running a mostly drive-thru and take-away coffee business. Starbucks also found difficulties with being America's third place and did not want to become the public space and bathroom for everyone, including people coming into stores who were homeless or struggling with mental health challenges on city streets. Starbucks has closed some stores and restricted bathroom access over safety concerns.\n\nBut by prioritizing speed -- \"throughput\" in corporate parlance -- Starbucks hurt the appeal of sitting down for coffee in stores, some critics say.\n\n\"Their success has not enabled them to retain what people originally found so attractive about the brand,\" said Tom Cook, a principal at restaurant consultancy King-Casey who has worked with Starbucks. \"It's turned into a transaction business that has very little interpersonal interaction and engagement.\"\n\nMany Starbucks' stores feel more like a fast-food restaurant than a coffee shop, Cook said. \"They had this unique image and personality. That doesn't exist anymore.\"\n\n'Just another commodity product'\n\nStarbucks' shift from a sit-down shop to a primarily drive-thru and mobile pickup business has been gradual.\n\nThe company was hesitant to build out drive-thru stores during the 1990s, fearing they would take away from the third place appeal.\n\n\"We don't want to become just another commodity product,\" Starbucks finance chief Michael Casey said in the 1995 profile of the company. \"The drive-thrus are a way for the converted to get their coffee a little quicker. It's not the way we want people to discover the Starbucks experience.\"\n\nBut Starbucks warmed to the option, finding that many customers preferred the convenience of drive-thrus on their way to work. By 2005, nearly 15% of Starbucks' roughly 7,300 stores were drive-thru locations. For the first time that year, more than half of new Starbucks stores were drive-thru locations. Today, 70% of Starbucks locations have a drive-thru option.\n\nMobile ordering was another major step in Starbucks' road to becoming primarily a take-away business.\n\nIn 2014, Starbucks debuted its mobile ordering system, which allowed customers to place pickup orders from their smartphones without having to interact with an employee. Mobile ordering also gave the company more data on consumers and helped push them to Starbucks' loyalty program, benefiting Starbucks because loyalty members are its most profitable customers.\n\nMobile ordering surged during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, when Starbucks was required to temporarily close seating areas inside to customers to prevent the virus' spread. Mobile orders jumped from 17% of sales in early 2020 to 26% the following year.\n\nAlthough mobile ordering has been popular with busy customers and investors, growing to more than 30% of sales today, it has taken away from the sit-down experience, analysts say.\n\nStarbucks baristas have complained about the crush of additional orders coming in from mobile orders and struggles to keep up with demand. People enter and exit stores more frequently, opening and closing the door and letting in the cold or heat.\n\nMobile ordering \"commoditized\" Starbucks by leading it to focus on order volume and efficiency, said Joe Pine, the co-founder of consultancy Strategic Horizons who wrote a recent article about Starbucks' struggles in Harvard Business Review.\n\nStarbucks' menu changes also had an impact on this shift. Starbucks is less of a coffee shop today and more of an iced tea, coffee, energy drink and lemonade store, especially in the summer, when nearly 80% of the drinks are cold. Customers are less interested in lingering in an air-conditioned store sipping iced coffee, analysts say.\n\n'Reimagining the third place'\n\nStarbucks says that it's evolving its third place model from being a physical store to a feeling.\n\nIn 2022, Starbucks said it was \"reimagining the third place\" by investing $450 million in stores with new coffee-making equipment to improve efficiency for employees and improving Starbucks' mobile ordering system. One of these improvements is called the Siren System, which is designed to cut down the amount of time it takes to make cold drinks.\n\nStarbucks also is opening 2,000 new stores, including traditional Starbucks locations, pick-up stores, delivery-only stores and drive thru-only locations.\n\nEisen, the Starbucks employee in Buffalo, said Starbucks has tried to balance competing demands from customers who want to grab their orders and go and others who want to sit down.\n\nThe best way Starbucks can preserve the third place in the digital age is to improve ordering on the mobile app for both customers and workers, she said.\n\nThat means reducing wait times for customers and easing the burden on Starbucks workers so they have enough time to prepare drinks and acknowledge customers when they come in to pick up their orders.\n\n\"If the worker feels less stressed, they are able to greet the customer,\" she said. \"That allows the Starbucks worker and the customer to have that connection.\"\n\nIn-person socialization is alive in these states -- here's where people are the most social In-person socialization is alive in these states -- here's where people are the

She witnessed first dates and helped a customer's propose to his spouse, writing \"will you marry me?\" on a cup.\n\n\"It was a cheerful, amazing thing to be part of it,\" she said of working at Starbucks and forming close relationships with customers. \"It's why so many employees stayed for so long.\"\n\nEisen has helped lead Starbucks Workers United, a group unionizing company stores.\n\nBut Starbucks' business has transformed, and it has struggled to maintain its identity as that third place along the way.\n\nMobile ordering and drive-thru\n\nMobile app and drive-thru orders make up more than 70% of Starbucks' sales at its approximately 9,500 company-operated stores in the United States. In some stores, customers complained online that Starbucks pulled out comfortable chairs and replaced them with hard wooden stools. Starbucks has also built pickup-only stores without seating. Machines that print customers' names have replaced baristas' handwriting on cups.\n\n\"Third place is a broader definition,\" current Starbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan said last year. The \"classic definition of third place -- it's a box where I go to meet someone -- it's frankly not relevant anymore in this context.\"\n\nStarbucks' sales in its home North America market dropped 3% last quarter. Schultz, who stepped down as Starbucks' CEO (for a third time) and retired from Starbucks' board of directors last year, wrote a lengthy message on LinkedIn in May about the company's issues.\n\n\"U.S. operations are the primary reason for the company's fall from grace. The stores require a maniacal focus on the customer experience,\" he said. The company needs to \"focus on being experiential, not transactional.\"\n\nStarbucks' changes to its sit-down business model came in response to several trends -- demand from customers for ordering coffee from their cars in drive-thru lanes or on their smartphones. The shift from a business serving hot coffee to one in which cold coffees, teas and lemonades make up more than half of sales. The Covid-19 pandemic, which forced cafes to shut indoor seating.\n\nStarbucks shifted to meet Wall Street's demands, too. Starbucks found it could reduce labor costs and increase order volume by running a mostly drive-thru and take-away coffee business. Starbucks also found difficulties with being America's third place and did not want to become the public space and bathroom for everyone, including people coming into stores who were homeless or struggling with mental health challenges on city streets. Starbucks has closed some stores and restricted bathroom access over safety concerns.\n\nBut by prioritizing speed -- \"throughput\" in corporate parlance -- Starbucks hurt the appeal of sitting down for coffee in stores, some critics say.\n\n\"Their success has not enabled them to retain what people originally found so attractive about the brand,\" said Tom Cook, a principal at restaurant consultancy King-Casey who has worked with Starbucks. \"It's turned into a transaction business that has very little interpersonal interaction and engagement.\"\n\nMany Starbucks' stores feel more like a fast-food restaurant than a coffee shop, Cook said. \"They had this unique image and personality. That doesn't exist anymore.\"\n\n'Just another commodity product'\n\nStarbucks' shift from a sit-down shop to a primarily drive-thru and mobile pickup business has been gradual.\n\nThe company was hesitant to build out drive-thru stores during the 1990s, fearing they would take away from the third place appeal.\n\n\"We don't want to become just another commodity product,\" Starbucks finance chief Michael Casey said in the 1995 profile of the company. \"The drive-thrus are a way for the converted to get their coffee a little quicker. It's not the way we want people to discover the Starbucks experience.\"\n\nBut Starbucks warmed to the option, finding that many customers preferred the convenience of drive-thrus on their way to work. By 2005, nearly 15% of Starbucks' roughly 7,300 stores were drive-thru locations. For the first time that year, more than half of new Starbucks stores were drive-thru locations. Today, 70% of Starbucks locations have a drive-thru option.\n\nMobile ordering was another major step in Starbucks' road to becoming primarily a take-away business.\n\nIn 2014, Starbucks debuted its mobile ordering system, which allowed customers to place pickup orders from their smartphones without having to interact with an employee. Mobile ordering also gave the company more data on consumers and helped push them to Starbucks' loyalty program, benefiting Starbucks because loyalty members are its most profitable customers.\n\nMobile ordering surged during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, when Starbucks was required to temporarily close seating areas inside to customers to prevent the virus' spread. Mobile orders jumped from 17% of sales in early 2020 to 26% the following year.\n\nAlthough mobile ordering has been popular with busy customers and investors, growing to more than 30% of sales today, it has taken away from the sit-down experience, analysts say.\n\nStarbucks baristas have complained about the crush of additional orders coming in from mobile orders and struggles to keep up with demand. People enter and exit stores more frequently, opening and closing the door and letting in the cold or heat.\n\nMobile ordering \"commoditized\" Starbucks by leading it to focus on order volume and efficiency, said Joe Pine, the co-founder of consultancy Strategic Horizons who wrote a recent article about Starbucks' struggles in Harvard Business Review.\n\nStarbucks' menu changes also had an impact on this shift. Starbucks is less of a coffee shop today and more of an iced tea, coffee, energy drink and lemonade store, especially in the summer, when nearly 80% of the drinks are cold. Customers are less interested in lingering in an air-conditioned store sipping iced coffee, analysts say.\n\n'Reimagining the third place'\n\nStarbucks says that it's evolving its third place model from being a physical store to a feeling.\n\nIn 2022, Starbucks said it was \"reimagining the third place\" by investing $450 million in stores with new coffee-making equipment to improve efficiency for employees and improving Starbucks' mobile ordering system. One of these improvements is called the Siren System, which is designed to cut down the amount of time it takes to make cold drinks.\n\nStarbucks also is opening 2,000 new stores, including traditional Starbucks locations, pick-up stores, delivery-only stores and drive thru-only locations.\n\nEisen, the Starbucks employee in Buffalo, said Starbucks has tried to balance competing demands from customers who want to grab their orders and go and others who want to sit down.\n\nThe best way Starbucks can preserve the third place in the digital age is to improve ordering on the mobile app for both customers and workers, she said.\n\nThat means reducing wait times for customers and easing the burden on Starbucks workers so they have enough time to prepare drinks and acknowledge customers when they come in to pick up their orders.\n\n\"If the worker feels less stressed, they are able to greet the customer,\" she said. \"That allows the Starbucks worker and the customer to have that connection.\"\n\nIn-person socialization is alive in these states -- here's where people are the most social In-person socialization is alive in these states -- here's where people are the

Today, it's a takeout counter. At many Starbucks locations, you're lucky to find anyone sitting down.\n\nUnder Howard Schultz, Starbucks' longtime leader, cafes were positioned as a \"third place\" between work and home, where people could linger for hours on plush purple armchairs, socialize and connect.\n\n\"If you look at the landscape of retail and restaurants in America, there is such a fracturing of places where people meet,\" Schultz said in a 1995 profile of Starbucks for an industry publication. \"There's nowhere for people to go. So we created a place where people can feel comfortable.\"\n\nThe idea of Starbucks as a third place became part of its corporate mythology. Starbucks aimed to create a welcoming environment for coffee drinkers and employees with comfortable seating, jazz music and the aroma of freshly brewed coffee. Employees who brewed and served Starbucks coffee, whom Starbucks called baristas, hand-wrote customers' names on their drink orders.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Starbucks aimed to create a welcoming environment for coffee drinkers and employees with comfortable seating, jazz music and the aroma of freshly brewed coffee. Employees who brewed and served Starbucks coffee, whom Starbucks called baristas, hand-wrote customers' names on their drink orders.\n\nPeople are also reading...

She witnessed first dates and helped a customer's propose to his spouse, writing \"will you marry me?\" on a cup.\n\n\"It was a cheerful, amazing thing to be part of it,\" she said of working at Starbucks and forming close relationships with customers. \"It's why so many employees stayed for so long.\"\n\nEisen has helped lead Starbucks Workers United, a group unionizing company stores.\n\nBut Starbucks' business has transformed, and it has struggled to maintain its identity as that third place along the way.\n\nMobile ordering and drive-thru\n\nMobile app and drive-thru orders make up more than 70% of Starbucks' sales at its approximately 9,500 company-operated stores in the United States. In some stores, customers complained online that Starbucks pulled out comfortable chairs and replaced them with hard wooden stools. Starbucks has also built pickup-only stores without seating. Machines that print customers' names have replaced baristas' handwriting on cups.\n\n\"Third place is a broader definition,\" current Starbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan said last year. The \"classic definition of third place -- it's a box where I go to meet someone -- it's frankly not relevant anymore in this context.\"\n\nStarbucks' sales in its home North America market dropped 3% last quarter. Schultz, who stepped down as Starbucks' CEO (for a third time) and retired from Starbucks' board of directors last year, wrote a lengthy message on LinkedIn in May about the company's issues.\n\n\"U.S. operations are the primary reason for the company's fall from grace. The stores require a maniacal focus on the customer experience,\" he said. The company needs to \"focus on being experiential, not transactional.\"\n\nStarbucks' changes to its sit-down business model came in response to several trends -- demand from customers for ordering coffee from their cars in drive-thru lanes or on their smartphones. The shift from a business serving hot coffee to one in which cold coffees, teas and lemonades make up more than half of sales. The Covid-19 pandemic, which forced cafes to shut indoor seating.\n\nStarbucks shifted to meet Wall Street's demands, too. Starbucks found it could reduce labor costs and increase order volume by running a mostly drive-thru and take-away coffee business. Starbucks also found difficulties with being America's third place and did not want to become the public space and bathroom for everyone, including people coming into stores who were homeless or struggling with mental health challenges on city streets. Starbucks has closed some stores and restricted bathroom access over safety concerns.\n\nBut by prioritizing speed -- \"throughput\" in corporate parlance -- Starbucks hurt the appeal of sitting down for coffee in stores, some critics say.\n\n\"Their success has not enabled them to retain what people originally found so attractive about the brand,\" said Tom Cook, a principal at restaurant consultancy King-Casey who has worked with Starbucks. \"It's turned into a transaction business that has very little interpersonal interaction and engagement.\"\n\nMany Starbucks' stores feel more like a fast-food restaurant than a coffee shop, Cook said. \"They had this unique image and personality. That doesn't exist anymore.\"\n\n'Just another commodity product'\n\nStarbucks' shift from a sit-down shop to a primarily drive-thru and mobile pickup business has been gradual.\n\nThe company was hesitant to build out drive-thru stores during the 1990s, fearing they would take away from the third place appeal.\n\n\"We don't want to become just another commodity product,\" Starbucks finance chief Michael Casey said in the 1995 profile of the company. \"The drive-thrus are a way for the converted to get their coffee a little quicker. It's not the way we want people to discover the Starbucks experience.\"\n\nBut Starbucks warmed to the option, finding that many customers preferred the convenience of drive-thrus on their way to work. By 2005, nearly 15% of Starbucks' roughly 7,300 stores were drive-thru locations. For the first time that year, more than half of new Starbucks stores were drive-thru locations. Today, 70% of Starbucks locations have a drive-thru option.\n\nMobile ordering was another major step in Starbucks' road to becoming primarily a take-away business.\n\nIn 2014, Starbucks debuted its mobile ordering system, which allowed customers to place pickup orders from their smartphones without having to interact with an employee. Mobile ordering also gave the company more data on consumers and helped push them to Starbucks' loyalty program, benefiting Starbucks because loyalty members are its most profitable customers.\n\nMobile ordering surged during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, when Starbucks was required to temporarily close seating areas inside to customers to prevent the virus' spread. Mobile orders jumped from 17% of sales in early 2020 to 26% the following year.\n\nAlthough mobile ordering has been popular with busy customers and investors, growing to more than 30% of sales today, it has taken away from the sit-down experience, analysts say.\n\nStarbucks baristas have complained about the crush of additional orders coming in from mobile orders and struggles to keep up with demand. People enter and exit stores more frequently, opening and closing the door and letting in the cold or heat.\n\nMobile ordering \"commoditized\" Starbucks by leading it to focus on order volume and efficiency, said Joe Pine, the co-founder of consultancy Strategic Horizons who wrote a recent article about Starbucks' struggles in Harvard Business Review.\n\nStarbucks' menu changes also had an impact on this shift. Starbucks is less of a coffee shop today and more of an iced tea, coffee, energy drink and lemonade store, especially in the summer, when nearly 80% of the drinks are cold. Customers are less interested in lingering in an air-conditioned store sipping iced coffee, analysts say.\n\n'Reimagining the third place'\n\nStarbucks says that it's evolving its third place model from being a physical store to a feeling.\n\nIn 2022, Starbucks said it was \"reimagining the third place\" by investing $450 million in stores with new coffee-making equipment to improve efficiency for employees and improving Starbucks' mobile ordering system. One of these improvements is called the Siren System, which is designed to cut down the amount of time it takes to make cold drinks.\n\nStarbucks also is opening 2,000 new stores, including traditional Starbucks locations, pick-up stores, delivery-only stores and drive thru-only locations.\n\nEisen, the Starbucks employee in Buffalo, said Starbucks has tried to balance competing demands from customers who want to grab their orders and go and others who want to sit down.\n\nThe best way Starbucks can preserve the third place in the digital age is to improve ordering on the mobile app for both customers and workers, she said.\n\nThat means reducing wait times for customers and easing the burden on Starbucks workers so they have enough time to prepare drinks and acknowledge customers when they come in to pick up their orders.\n\n\"If the worker feels less stressed, they are able to greet the customer,\" she said. \"That allows the Starbucks worker and the customer to have that connection.\"\n\nIn-person socialization is alive in these states -- here's where people are the most social In-person socialization is alive in these states -- here's where people are the

People enter and exit stores more frequently, opening and closing the door and letting in the cold or heat.\n\nMobile ordering \"commoditized\" Starbucks by leading it to focus on order volume and efficiency, said Joe Pine, the co-founder of consultancy Strategic Horizons who wrote a recent article about Starbucks' struggles in Harvard Business Review.\n\nStarbucks' menu changes also had an impact on this shift. Starbucks is less of a coffee shop today and more of an iced tea, coffee, energy drink and lemonade store, especially in the summer, when nearly 80% of the drinks are cold. Customers are less interested in lingering in an air-conditioned store sipping iced coffee, analysts say.\n\n'Reimagining the third place'\n\nStarbucks says that it's evolving its third place model from being a physical store to a feeling.\n\nIn 2022, Starbucks said it was \"reimagining the third place\" by investing $450 million in stores with new coffee-making equipment to improve efficiency for employees and improving Starbucks' mobile ordering system. One of these improvements is called the Siren System, which is designed to cut down the amount of time it takes to make cold drinks.\n\nStarbucks also is opening 2,000 new stores, including traditional Starbucks locations, pick-up stores, delivery-only stores and drive thru-only locations.\n\nEisen, the Starbucks employee in Buffalo, said Starbucks has tried to balance competing demands from customers who want to grab their orders and go and others who want to sit down.\n\nThe best way Starbucks can preserve the third place in the digital age is to improve ordering on the mobile app for both customers and workers, she said.\n\nThat means reducing wait times for customers and easing the burden on Starbucks workers so they have enough time to prepare drinks and acknowledge customers when they come in to pick up their orders.\n\n\"If the worker feels less stressed, they are able to greet the customer,\" she said. \"That allows the Starbucks worker and the customer to have that connection.\"\n\nIn-person socialization is alive in these states -- here's where people are the most social In-person socialization is alive in these states -- here's where people are the

Recognizing the essential role of breakfast and the widespread love for coffee, the renowned coffee chain has introduced a tempting new pairings menu. Patrons ...\n\nYears ago, some people would spend hours at Starbucks. Today, it's a takeout counter. At many Starbucks locations, you're lucky to find anyone sitting down.\n\nUnder Howard Schultz, Starbucks' longtime leader, cafes were positioned as a \"third place\" between work and home, where people could linger for hours on plush purple armchairs, socialize and connect.\n\n\"If you look at the landscape of retail and restaurants in America, there is such a fracturing of places where people meet,\" Schultz said in a 1995 profile of Starbucks for an industry publication. \"There's nowhere for people to go. So we created a place where people can feel comfortable.\"\n\nThe idea of Starbucks as a third place became part of its corporate mythology. Starbucks aimed to create a welcoming environment for coffee drinkers and employees with comfortable seating, jazz music and the aroma of freshly brewed coffee. Employees who brewed and served Starbucks coffee, whom Starbucks called baristas, hand-wrote customers' names on their drink orders.\n\nPeople are also reading...

She witnessed first dates and helped a customer's propose to his spouse, writing \"will you marry me?\" on a cup.\n\n\"It was a cheerful, amazing thing to be part of it,\" she said of working at Starbucks and forming close relationships with customers. \"It's why so many employees stayed for so long.\"\n\nEisen has helped lead Starbucks Workers United, a group unionizing company stores.\n\nBut Starbucks' business has transformed, and it has struggled to maintain its identity as that third place along the way.\n\nMobile ordering and drive-thru\n\nMobile app and drive-thru orders make up more than 70% of Starbucks' sales at its approximately 9,500 company-operated stores in the United States. In some stores, customers complained online that Starbucks pulled out comfortable chairs and replaced them with hard wooden stools. Starbucks has also built pickup-only stores without seating. Machines that print customers' names have replaced baristas' handwriting on cups.\n\n\"Third place is a broader definition,\" current Starbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan said last year. The \"classic definition of third place -- it's a box where I go to meet someone -- it's frankly not relevant anymore in this context.\"\n\nStarbucks' sales in its home North America market dropped 3% last quarter. Schultz, who stepped down as Starbucks' CEO (for a third time) and retired from Starbucks' board of directors last year, wrote a lengthy message on LinkedIn in May about the company's issues.\n\n\"U.S. operations are the primary reason for the company's fall from grace. The stores require a maniacal focus on the customer experience,\" he said. The company needs to \"focus on being experiential, not transactional.\"\n\nStarbucks' changes to its sit-down business model came in response to several trends -- demand from customers for ordering coffee from their cars in drive-thru lanes or on their smartphones. The shift from a business serving hot coffee to one in which cold coffees, teas and lemonades make up more than half of sales. The Covid-19 pandemic, which forced cafes to shut indoor seating.\n\nStarbucks shifted to meet Wall Street's demands, too. Starbucks found it could reduce labor costs and increase order volume by running a mostly drive-thru and take-away coffee business. Starbucks also found difficulties with being America's third place and did not want to become the public space and bathroom for everyone, including people coming into stores who were homeless or struggling with mental health challenges on city streets. Starbucks has closed some stores and restricted bathroom access over safety concerns.\n\nBut by prioritizing speed -- \"throughput\" in corporate parlance -- Starbucks hurt the appeal of sitting down for coffee in stores, some critics say.\n\n\"Their success has not enabled them to retain what people originally found so attractive about the brand,\" said Tom Cook, a principal at restaurant consultancy King-Casey who has worked with Starbucks. \"It's turned into a transaction business that has very little interpersonal interaction and engagement.\"\n\nMany Starbucks' stores feel more like a fast-food restaurant than a coffee shop, Cook said. \"They had this unique image and personality. That doesn't exist anymore.\"\n\n'Just another commodity product'\n\nStarbucks' shift from a sit-down shop to a primarily drive-thru and mobile pickup business has been gradual.\n\nThe company was hesitant to build out drive-thru stores during the 1990s, fearing they would take away from the third place appeal.\n\n\"We don't want to become just another commodity product,\" Starbucks finance chief Michael Casey said in the 1995 profile of the company. \"The drive-thrus are a way for the converted to get their coffee a little quicker. It's not the way we want people to discover the Starbucks experience.\"\n\nBut Starbucks warmed to the option, finding that many customers preferred the convenience of drive-thrus on their way to work. By 2005, nearly 15% of Starbucks' roughly 7,300 stores were drive-thru locations. For the first time that year, more than half of new Starbucks stores were drive-thru locations. Today, 70% of Starbucks locations have a drive-thru option.\n\nMobile ordering was another major step in Starbucks' road to becoming primarily a take-away business.\n\nIn 2014, Starbucks debuted its mobile ordering system, which allowed customers to place pickup orders from their smartphones without having to interact with an employee. Mobile ordering also gave the company more data on consumers and helped push them to Starbucks' loyalty program, benefiting Starbucks because loyalty members are its most profitable customers.\n\nMobile ordering surged during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, when Starbucks was required to temporarily close seating areas inside to customers to prevent the virus' spread. Mobile orders jumped from 17% of sales in early 2020 to 26% the following year.\n\nAlthough mobile ordering has been popular with busy customers and investors, growing to more than 30% of sales today, it has taken away from the sit-down experience, analysts say.\n\nStarbucks baristas have complained about the crush of additional orders coming in from mobile orders and struggles to keep up with demand.

In some stores, customers complained online that Starbucks pulled out comfortable chairs and replaced them with hard wooden stools. Starbucks has also built pickup-only stores without seating. Machines that print customers' names have replaced baristas' handwriting on cups.\n\n\"Third place is a broader definition,\" current Starbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan said last year. The \"classic definition of third place -- it's a box where I go to meet someone -- it's frankly not relevant anymore in this context.\"\n\nStarbucks' sales in its home North America market dropped 3% last quarter. Schultz, who stepped down as Starbucks' CEO (for a third time) and retired from Starbucks' board of directors last year, wrote a lengthy message on LinkedIn in May about the company's issues.\n\n\"U.S. operations are the primary reason for the company's fall from grace. The stores require a maniacal focus on the customer experience,\" he said. The company needs to \"focus on being experiential, not transactional.\"\n\nStarbucks' changes to its sit-down business model came in response to several trends -- demand from customers for ordering coffee from their cars in drive-thru lanes or on their smartphones. The shift from a business serving hot coffee to one in which cold coffees, teas and lemonades make up more than half of sales. The Covid-19 pandemic, which forced cafes to shut indoor seating.\n\nStarbucks built its first drive-thru in 1994.\n\nTim Boyle/Newsmakers/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nStarbucks shifted to meet Wall Street's demands, too. Starbucks found it could reduce labor costs and increase order volume by running a mostly drive-thru and take-away coffee business. Starbucks also found difficulties with being America's third place and did not want to become the public space and bathroom for everyone, including people coming into stores who were homeless or struggling with mental health challenges on city streets. Starbucks has closed some stores and restricted bathroom access over safety concerns.\n\nBut by prioritizing speed -- \"throughput\" in corporate parlance -- Starbucks hurt the appeal of sitting down for coffee in stores, some critics say.\n\n\"Their success has not enabled them to retain what people originally found so attractive about the brand,\" said Tom Cook, a principal at restaurant consultancy King-Casey who has worked with Starbucks. \"It's turned into a transaction business that has very little interpersonal interaction and engagement.\"\n\nMany Starbucks' stores feel more like a fast-food restaurant than a coffee shop, Cook said. \"They had this unique image and personality. That doesn't exist anymore.\"\n\n'Just another commodity product'\n\nStarbucks' shift from a sit-down shop to a primarily drive-thru and mobile pickup business has been gradual.\n\nThe company was hesitant to build out drive-thru stores during the 1990s, fearing they would take away from the third place appeal.\n\n\"We don't want to become just another commodity product,\" Starbucks finance chief Michael Casey said in the 1995 profile of the company. \"The drive-thrus are a way for the converted to get their coffee a little quicker. It's not the way we want people to discover the Starbucks experience.\"\n\nBut Starbucks warmed to the option, finding that many customers preferred the convenience of drive-thrus on their way to work. By 2005, nearly 15% of Starbucks' roughly 7,300 stores were drive-thru locations. For the first time that year, more than half of new Starbucks stores were drive-thru locations. Today, 70% of Starbucks locations have a drive-thru option.\n\nMobile ordering was another major step in Starbucks' road to becoming primarily a take-away business.\n\nIn 2014, Starbucks debuted its mobile ordering system, which allowed customers to place pickup orders from their smartphones without having to interact with an employee. Mobile ordering also gave the company more data on consumers and helped push them to Starbucks' loyalty program, benefiting Starbucks because loyalty members are its most profitable customers.\n\nMore than half of Starbucks' sales are cold drinks.\n\nAlex Wong/Getty Images\n\nMobile ordering surged during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, when Starbucks was required to temporarily close seating areas inside to customers to prevent the virus' spread. Mobile orders jumped from 17% of sales in early 2020 to 26% the following year.\n\nAlthough mobile ordering has been popular with busy customers and investors, growing to more than 30% of sales today, it has taken away from the sit-down experience, analysts say.\n\nStarbucks baristas have complained about the crush of additional orders coming in from mobile orders and struggles to keep up with demand. People enter and exit stores more frequently, opening and closing the door and letting in the cold or heat.\n\nMobile ordering \"commoditized\" Starbucks by leading it to focus on order volume and efficiency, said Joe Pine, the co-founder of consultancy Strategic Horizons who wrote a recent article about Starbucks' struggles in Harvard Business Review.\n\nStarbucks' menu changes also had an impact on this shift. Starbucks is less of a coffee shop today and more of an iced tea, coffee, energy drink and lemonade store, especially in the summer, when nearly 80% of the drinks are cold. Customers are less interested in lingering in an air-conditioned store sipping iced coffee, analysts say.\n\n'Reimagining the third place'\n\nStarbucks says that it's evolving its third place model from being a physical store to a feeling.\n\nIn 2022, Starbucks said it was \"reimagining the third place\" by investing $450 million in stores with new coffee-making equipment to improve efficiency for employees and improving Starbucks' mobile ordering system. One of these improvements is called the Siren System, which is designed to cut down the amount of time it takes to make cold drinks.\n\nStarbucks also is opening 2,000 new stores, including traditional Starbucks locations, pick-up stores, delivery-only stores and drive thru-only locations.\n\nEisen, the Starbucks employee in Buffalo, said Starbucks has tried to balance competing demands from customers who want to grab their orders and go and others who want to sit down.\n\nThe best way Starbucks can preserve the third place in the digital age is to improve ordering on the mobile app for both customers and workers, she said.\n\nThat means reducing wait times for customers and easing the burden on Starbucks workers so they have enough time to prepare drinks and acknowledge customers when they come in to pick up their orders.\n\n\"If the worker feels less stressed, they are able to greet the customer,\" she said. \"That allows the Starbucks worker and the customer to

Starbucks has closed some stores and restricted bathroom access over safety concerns.\n\nBut by prioritizing speed -- \"throughput\" in corporate parlance -- Starbucks hurt the appeal of sitting down for coffee in stores, some critics say.\n\n\"Their success has not enabled them to retain what people originally found so attractive about the brand,\" said Tom Cook, a principal at restaurant consultancy King-Casey who has worked with Starbucks. \"It's turned into a transaction business that has very little interpersonal interaction and engagement.\"\n\nMany Starbucks' stores feel more like a fast-food restaurant than a coffee shop, Cook said. \"They had this unique image and personality. That doesn't exist anymore.\"\n\n'Just another commodity product'\n\nStarbucks' shift from a sit-down shop to a primarily drive-thru and mobile pickup business has been gradual.\n\nThe company was hesitant to build out drive-thru stores during the 1990s, fearing they would take away from the third place appeal.\n\n\"We don't want to become just another commodity product,\" Starbucks finance chief Michael Casey said in the 1995 profile of the company. \"The drive-thrus are a way for the converted to get their coffee a little quicker. It's not the way we want people to discover the Starbucks experience.\"\n\nBut Starbucks warmed to the option, finding that many customers preferred the convenience of drive-thrus on their way to work. By 2005, nearly 15% of Starbucks' roughly 7,300 stores were drive-thru locations. For the first time that year, more than half of new Starbucks stores were drive-thru locations. Today, 70% of Starbucks locations have a drive-thru option.\n\nMobile ordering was another major step in Starbucks' road to becoming primarily a take-away business.\n\nIn 2014, Starbucks debuted its mobile ordering system, which allowed customers to place pickup orders from their smartphones without having to interact with an employee. Mobile ordering also gave the company more data on consumers and helped push them to Starbucks' loyalty program, benefiting Starbucks because loyalty members are its most profitable customers.\n\nMobile ordering surged during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, when Starbucks was required to temporarily close seating areas inside to customers to prevent the virus' spread. Mobile orders jumped from 17% of sales in early 2020 to 26% the following year.\n\nAlthough mobile ordering has been popular with busy customers and investors, growing to more than 30% of sales today, it has taken away from the sit-down experience, analysts say.\n\nStarbucks baristas have complained about the crush of additional orders coming in from mobile orders and struggles to keep up with demand. People enter and exit stores more frequently, opening and closing the door and letting in the cold or heat.\n\nMobile ordering \"commoditized\" Starbucks by leading it to focus on order volume and efficiency, said Joe Pine, the co-founder of consultancy Strategic Horizons who wrote a recent article about Starbucks' struggles in Harvard Business Review.\n\nStarbucks' menu changes also had an impact on this shift. Starbucks is less of a coffee shop today and more of an iced tea, coffee, energy drink and lemonade store, especially in the summer, when nearly 80% of the drinks are cold. Customers are less interested in lingering in an air-conditioned store sipping iced coffee, analysts say.\n\n'Reimagining the third place'\n\nStarbucks says that it's evolving its third place model from being a physical store to a feeling.\n\nIn 2022, Starbucks said it was \"reimagining the third place\" by investing $450 million in stores with new coffee-making equipment to improve efficiency for employees and improving Starbucks' mobile ordering system. One of these improvements is called the Siren System, which is designed to cut down the amount of time it takes to make cold drinks.\n\nStarbucks also is opening 2,000 new stores, including traditional Starbucks locations, pick-up stores, delivery-only stores and drive thru-only locations.\n\nEisen, the Starbucks employee in Buffalo, said Starbucks has tried to balance competing demands from customers who want to grab their orders and go and others who want to sit down.\n\nThe best way Starbucks can preserve the third place in the digital age is to improve ordering on the mobile app for both customers and workers, she said.\n\nThat means reducing wait times for customers and easing the burden on Starbucks workers so they have enough time to prepare drinks and acknowledge customers when they come in to pick up their orders.\n\n\"If the worker feels less stressed, they are able to greet the customer,\" she said. \"That allows the Starbucks worker and the customer to have that connection.\"\n\nIn-person socialization is alive in these states -- here's where people are the most social In-person socialization is alive in these states -- here's where people are the

But this recognition hasn't helped investors out recently. Shares of the coffeehouse chain are down 40% from their record level, which was set in July 2021.\n\nInvestors shouldn't be discouraged, though. There might be a lucrative opportunity right now in Starbucks. Here are four reasons to buy this restaurant stock like there's no tomorrow.\n\nThe restaurant industry is extremely competitive, but what helps Starbucks stand out is its brand moat. One way to gauge the health of a brand is by looking at same-store sales growth. To be clear, Starbucks is struggling in this regard, as comparable sales were down 3% in the U.S. in the fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended March 31).\n\nHowever, over many years and decades, this metric has typically trended in the right direction. Additionally, Starbucks' brand power is clearly demonstrated by how well-known it is on a global level. Of the 38,951 total stores, 57% are outside the U.S.\n\nIt's also important to understand that the key to Starbucks' success has been its proven-pricing power. Coffee products are essentially just commoditized goods, making it difficult to differentiate. But by building up its brand with a premium standing, Starbucks has been able to charge high prices and generate an average gross margin of 28.1% in the past 10 years.\n\nThe next reason to buy shares of Starbucks might be a bit overlooked. But the business is consistently profitable. And this important characteristic is something that long-term investors should look for in the businesses that they own because it reduces financial risk.\n\nIn the past decade, Starbucks' operating margin has averaged a healthy 14.7%. This has been steady, except for during the pandemic. This ongoing profitability leads to solid free-cash-flow generation that helps fund capital returns, which is what shareholders should appreciate.\n\nStarbucks has paid a steadily rising dividend since 2010. As of this writing, it yields 3%. That's more than double the 1.3% yield of the S&P 500. Moreover, Starbucks has repurchased enough shares to shrink its outstanding share count by 9.2% in the past five years.\n\nInvestors are right to assess that Starbucks is a ubiquitous chain, especially since it has nearly 39,000 stores worldwide that raked in $8.6 billion in sales for the company in the most recent quarter. This is easily one of the largest restaurant chains on the face of the planet.\n\nThat could lead you to think that there isn't much growth potential left. But that might be a flawed assumption. As part of management's long-term strategy, the objective is to get to 55,000 stores by 2030. To reach this lofty level, the company will focus heavily on China, while also still expanding in the key U.S. market.\n\nThere's also an increased focus by the leadership team on other areas that can boost Starbucks' financial position, like cost cuts, product innovation, and further digitizing the supply chain and store operations.\n\nThe final reason to buy Starbucks stock has to do with just how beaten down the price has gotten, as it sits 40% off its high. There's no doubt that the market has become increasingly pessimistic about the business, a perspective that was exacerbated by the latest financial update.\n\nBut this presents a buying opportunity. The stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 21.1, the cheapest valuation in the past few years. And this is based on profit projections for fiscal 2024 that were downgraded by the management team. On a more normalized basis, the valuation would look even more compelling.

Today, it's a takeout counter. At many Starbucks locations, you're lucky to find anyone sitting down.\n\nUnder Howard Schultz, Starbucks' longtime leader, cafes were positioned as a \"third place\" between work and home, where people could linger for hours on plush purple armchairs, socialize and connect.\n\n\"If you look at the landscape of retail and restaurants in America, there is such a fracturing of places where people meet,\" Schultz said in a 1995 profile of Starbucks for an industry publication. \"There's nowhere for people to go. So we created a place where people can feel comfortable.\"\n\nThe idea of Starbucks as a third place became part of its corporate mythology. Starbucks aimed to create a welcoming environment for coffee drinkers and employees with comfortable seating, jazz music and the aroma of freshly-brewed coffee. Employees who brewed and served Starbucks coffee, whom Starbucks called baristas, handwrote customers' names on their drink orders.\n\nBy the time Michelle Eisen joined Starbucks in 2010 as an employee in Buffalo, New York, her store was always packed during the holidays with people meeting friends and family. She witnessed first dates and helped a customer's propose to his spouse, writing \"will you marry me?\" on a cup.\n\n\"It was a cheerful, amazing thing to be part of it,\" she said of working at Starbucks and forming close relationships with customers. \"It's why so many employees stayed for so long.\"\n\nEisen has helped lead Starbucks Workers United, a group unionizing company stores.\n\nBut Starbucks' business has transformed, and it has struggled to maintain its identity as that third place along the way.\n\nMobile app and drive-thru orders make up more than 70% of Starbucks' sales at its approximately 9,500 company-operated stores in the United States. In some stores, customers complained online that Starbucks pulled out comfortable chairs and replaced them with hard wooden stools. Starbucks has also built pickup-only stores without seating. Machines that print customers' names have replaced baristas' handwriting on cups.\n\n\"Third place is a broader definition,\" current Starbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan said last year. The \"classic definition of third place -- it's a box where I go to meet someone -- it's frankly not relevant anymore in this context.\"\n\nStarbucks' sales in its home North America market dropped 3% last quarter. Schultz, who stepped down as Starbucks' CEO (for a third time) and retired from Starbucks' board of directors last year, wrote a lengthy message on LinkedIn in May about the company's issues.\n\n\"U.S. operations are the primary reason for the company's fall from grace. The stores require a maniacal focus on the customer experience,\" he said. The company needs to \"focus on being experiential, not transactional.\"\n\nStarbucks' changes to its sit-down business model came in response to several trends -- demand from customers for ordering coffee from their cars in drive-thru lanes or on their smartphones. The shift from a business serving hot coffee to one in which cold coffees, teas and lemonades make up more than half of sales. The Covid-19 pandemic, which forced cafes to shut indoor seating.\n\nStarbucks shifted to meet Wall Street's demands, too. Starbucks found it could reduce labor costs and increase order volume by running a mostly drive-thru and take-away coffee business. Starbucks also found difficulties with being America's third place and did not want to become the public space and bathroom for everyone, including people coming into stores who were homeless or struggling with mental health challenges on city streets. Starbucks has closed some stores and restricted bathroom access over safety concerns.\n\nBut by prioritizing speed -- \"throughput\" in corporate parlance -- Starbucks hurt the appeal of sitting down for coffee in stores, some critics say.\n\n\"Their success has not enabled them to retain what people originally found so attractive about the brand,\" said Tom Cook, a principal at restaurant consultancy King-Casey who has worked with Starbucks. \"It's turned into a transaction business that has very little interpersonal interaction and engagement.\"\n\nMany Starbucks' stores feel more like a fast-food restaurant than a coffee shop, Cook said. \"They had this unique image and personality. That doesn't exist anymore.\"\n\nStarbucks' shift from a sit-down shop to a primarily drive-thru and mobile pickup business has been gradual.\n\nThe company was hesitant to build out drive-thru stores during the 1990s, fearing they would take away from the third place appeal.\n\n\"We don't want to become just another commodity product,\" Starbucks finance chief Michael Casey said in the 1995 profile of the company. \"The drive-thrus are a way for the converted to get their coffee a little quicker. It's not the way we want people to discover the Starbucks experience.\"\n\nBut Starbucks warmed to the option, finding that many customers preferred the convenience of drive-thrus on their way to work. By 2005, nearly 15% of Starbucks' roughly 7,300 stores were drive-thru locations. For the first time that year, more than half of new Starbucks stores were drive-thru locations. Today, 70% of Starbucks locations have a drive-thru option.\n\nMobile ordering was another major step in Starbucks' road to becoming primarily a take-away business.\n\nIn 2014, Starbucks debuted its mobile ordering system, which allowed customers to place pickup orders from their smartphones without having to interact with an employee. Mobile ordering also gave the company more data on consumers and helped push them to Starbucks' loyalty program, benefiting Starbucks because loyalty members are its most profitable customers.\n\nMobile ordering surged during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, when Starbucks was required to temporarily close seating areas inside to customers to prevent the virus' spread. Mobile orders jumped from 17% of sales in early 2020 to 26% the following year.\n\nAlthough mobile ordering has been popular with busy customers and investors, growing to more than 30% of sales today, it has taken away from the sit-down experience, analysts say.\n\nStarbucks baristas have complained about the crush of additional orders coming in from mobile orders and struggles to keep up with demand. People enter and exit stores more frequently, opening and closing the door and letting in the cold or heat.\n\nMobile ordering \"commoditized\" Starbucks by leading it to focus on order volume and efficiency, said Joe Pine, the co-founder of consultancy Strategic Horizons who wrote a recent article about Starbucks' struggles in Harvard Business Review.\n\nStarbucks' menu changes also had an impact on this shift. Starbucks is less of a coffee shop today and more of an iced tea, coffee, energy drink and lemonade store, especially in the summer, when nearly 80% of the drinks are cold. Customers are less interested in lingering in an air-conditioned store sipping iced coffee, analysts say.\n\nStarbucks says that it's evolving its third place model from being a physical store to a feeling.\n\nIn 2022, Starbucks said it was \"reimagining the third place\" by investing $450 million in stores with new coffee-making equipment to improve efficiency for employees and improving Starbucks' mobile ordering system. One of these improvements is called the Siren System, which is designed to cut down the amount of time it takes to make cold drinks.\n\nStarbucks also is opening 2,000 new stores, including traditional Starbucks locations, pick-up stores, delivery-only stores and drive thru-only locations.\n\nEisen, the Starbucks employee in Buffalo, said Starbucks has tried to balance competing demands from customers who want to grab their orders and go and others who want to sit down.\n\nThe best way Starbucks can preserve the third place in the digital age is to improve ordering on the mobile app for both customers and workers, she said.\n\nThat means reducing wait times for customers and easing the burden on Starbucks workers so they have enough time to prepare drinks and acknowledge customers when they come in to pick up their orders.\n\n\"If the worker feels less stressed, they are able to greet the customer,\" she said. \"That allows the Starbucks worker and the customer to have that connection.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

But this recognition hasn't helped investors out recently. Shares of the coffeehouse chain are down 40% from their record level, which was set in July 2021.\n\nInvestors shouldn't be discouraged, though. There might be a lucrative opportunity right now in Starbucks. Here are four reasons to buy this restaurant stock like there's no tomorrow.\n\nThe restaurant industry is extremely competitive, but what helps Starbucks stand out is its brand moat. One way to gauge the health of a brand is by looking at same-store sales growth. To be clear, Starbucks is struggling in this regard, as comparable sales were down 3% in the U.S. in the fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended March 31).\n\nHowever, over many years and decades, this metric has typically trended in the right direction. Additionally, Starbucks' brand power is clearly demonstrated by how well-known it is on a global level. Of the 38,951 total stores, 57% are outside the U.S.\n\nIt's also important to understand that the key to Starbucks' success has been its proven-pricing power. Coffee products are essentially just commoditized goods, making it difficult to differentiate. But by building up its brand with a premium standing, Starbucks has been able to charge high prices and generate an average gross margin of 28.1% in the past 10 years.\n\nThe next reason to buy shares of Starbucks might be a bit overlooked. But the business is consistently profitable. And this important characteristic is something that long-term investors should look for in the businesses that they own because it reduces financial risk.\n\nIn the past decade, Starbucks' operating margin has averaged a healthy 14.7%. This has been steady, except for during the pandemic. This ongoing profitability leads to solid free-cash-flow generation that helps fund capital returns, which is what shareholders should appreciate.\n\nStarbucks has paid a steadily rising dividend since 2010. As of this writing, it yields 3%. That's more than double the 1.3% yield of the S&P 500. Moreover, Starbucks has repurchased enough shares to shrink its outstanding share count by 9.2% in the past five years.\n\nInvestors are right to assess that Starbucks is a ubiquitous chain, especially since it has nearly 39,000 stores worldwide that raked in $8.6 billion in sales for the company in the most recent quarter. This is easily one of the largest restaurant chains on the face of the planet.\n\nThat could lead you to think that there isn't much growth potential left. But that might be a flawed assumption. As part of management's long-term strategy, the objective is to get to 55,000 stores by 2030. To reach this lofty level, the company will focus heavily on China, while also still expanding in the key U.S. market.\n\nThere's also an increased focus by the leadership team on other areas that can boost Starbucks' financial position, like cost cuts, product innovation, and further digitizing the supply chain and store operations.\n\nThe final reason to buy Starbucks stock has to do with just how beaten down the price has gotten, as it sits 40% off its high. There's no doubt that the market has become increasingly pessimistic about the business, a perspective that was exacerbated by the latest financial update.\n\nBut this presents a buying opportunity. The stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 21.1, the cheapest valuation in the past few years. And this is based on profit projections for fiscal 2024 that were downgraded by the management team. On a more normalized basis, the valuation would look even more compelling. This makes now a great time to consider scooping up shares of Starbucks and holding them for the next five years.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Starbucks, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Starbucks wasn't one of them.

Blue / Bloomberg via Getty Images file\n\nAn information technology glitch affecting Microsoft cloud computing services around the world Friday has also halted the ability to order Starbucks through its mobile app.\n\nThe issue has caused chaos for baristas and other Starbucks employees, leading to temporary store closures and frantic posts online seeking assistance.\n\nA new software update to fix the problem was issued Friday morning by CrowdStrike, which provides cybersecurity services for many large companies that use Microsoft, but in the afternoon businesses were still working through technical issues and delays. Starbucks is no exception to the chaos.\n\n\"Starbucks is among those companies experiencing impacts due to a widespread third-party systems outage, resulting in a temporary outage of our mobile order ahead and pay features,\" Starbucks spokesperson Jaci Anderson said in a statement emailed to NBC News. \"We continue to welcome and serve customers in the vast majority of our stores and drive-thrus and are doing everything we can to bring all systems online as quickly as possible. We apologize for any inconvenience.\"\n\nResponding to the IT glitch that affected mobile ordering, early on Friday Starbucks began prompting users on its app that mobile ordering is unavailable.\n\nAn official Starbucks account began responding to social media posts, too, saying that some stores were unavailable to process any transactions and had closed as a result. The account also responded to people who said they placed mobile orders and were then unable to pick them up.\n\n\"Stores may be unable to process transactions and some stores may be closed. Mobile ordering is also currently unavailable. For stores that are open, we invite you to place your order with a barista,\" the official Starbucks account wrote in one reply.\n\nSince 2015, customers have been able to place orders at participating stores through the Starbucks app and pick them up without waiting in line. The mobile order system has become so popular that some Starbucks locations, such as those in some airports, have introduced mobile-only storefronts.\n\nOn the Starbucks subreddit, where customers and employees have both posted about app and in-store technical issues, recent posts described stressful situations and posted photos of mobile order errors.\n\n\"Almost every store in my district except mine closed because they didn't want to deal with the outages,\" one Reddit post from an account labeled as a store supervisor said. \"We are SUFFERING. Mobile orders and deliveries were through the roof, drive thru was wrapped around the building and two accidents in our parking lot.\"\n\nAnother Starbucks employee and Reddit user took to the subreddit to beg for help, seeking creative solutions to working during the outage. \"Please, as a fellow barista, tell me the procedures your store is taking to work during this outage,\" the employee wrote. \"Currently my store is scrambling to keep up, myself and other partners keep offering suggestions (like putting up a sign, or writing on cups) but my store manager isn't being receptive.\"\n\nA barista at a newly renovated Starbucks in Washington, D.C., told CNBC that her store had to manually write out tickets for customer orders as they grappled with computer issues in the early morning. The location has disabled mobile ordering, and the barista said that their point-of-sale came back online around 7:00 a.m.\n\nAt other stores, employees created various handwritten signs for customers, announcing store closures or asking customers to walk up or show an employee a mobile receipt.\n\nOnline, other employees described their stores as being slower than usual, with some customers saying they chose not to go in because they couldn't do a mobile order. When NBC News visited several Starbucks locations in Manhattan on Friday afternoon, lines were short and moved quickly. Four customers said they had no issue ordering in line instead of using the mobile app.\n\nOne of the customers, Linda Muller, said she found out about the issue Friday morning when a friend couldn't place their Starbucks mobile order. But Muller, who was visiting from Switzerland, said she was used to standing in line -- the app isn't available at all back home, she said.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starbucks", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Starbucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Glitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barista", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Barista"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reddit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patch (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrowdStrike", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CrowdStrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_sale", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Point of sale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Home_Based", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Home Based", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Mail_Order", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Mail Order", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-07/240719-starbucks-outage-chaos-se-135p-4e2291.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9746443", "eventUri": "eng-9746443", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Out of 17 eligible voters, 16 cast their ballots -- and an impressive 15 of them said \"yes\" to the union, brewing up a resounding victory for the team.\n\nWith this triumph, there are now two unionized Starbucks locations in Iowa. Last year, the Clinton and Burlington stores in Iowa City also voted to unionize, joining the ranks of over 460 stores across the country as part of Starbucks Workers United. It's safe to say that the union's \"coffee\" cup is running over with success!\n\nThe drive for a union in Davenport was sparked by frustrations over the company's transition from a laid-back caf\u00e9 vibe to a high-pressure, metrics-driven environment. Baristas were feeling the strain of increased responsibilities without any extra support, and it was brewing up a storm of discontent.\n\nThe idea of unionizing first percolated in the fall of 2021 but was put on hold due to shifting managers and the opening of new stores. However, when a particularly challenging interim manager stirred the pot, it reignited the workers' resolve to make a change. Their renewed enthusiasm turned into serious action, and soon enough, they were on their way to creating a historic moment for their store.\n\nOne of the most significant challenges was explaining what exactly a union was to their mostly 20-something colleagues. After a little bit of explaining and a lot of coffee-fueled conversations, the idea took hold, and the support for the union vote was as strong as a double espresso.\n\nThe results of the vote were a sweet success, proving just how united and determined the workers were. The overwhelming approval was a satisfying moment, showing the company just how strong their collective voice could be.\n\nWhat's next for the Davenport Starbucks team? Their next big challenge is negotiating a contract with the company -- a process that is already underway. For those inspired by their success and looking to make a change at their own Starbucks, there are resources available to help you get started or show your support.\n\nWhether you're looking to organize or just want to stand in solidarity with the movement, there's a wealth of support waiting for you.

The coffee chain is grappling with a slowdown in sales, particularly at brick and mortar stores. In the second quarter, Starbucks said its revenue slid by 2 per cent from a year earlier.\n\n\"In a highly challenged environment, this quarter's results do not reflect the power of our brand, our capabilities or the opportunities ahead,\" Starbucks chief executive Laxman Narasimhan said in April.\n\nSpokespeople for Starbucks and Elliott declined to comment.\n\nSchultz, Starbucks' longtime chief, was succeeded last year by Narasimhan, the former CEO of UK-based consumer health and hygiene group Reckitt. Schultz, who returned twice to replace earlier chief executives, has stepped off the board, but this spring criticised Starbucks' stewardship in a post on LinkedIn. Schultz retains a $1.6bn stake in the company, about 2 per cent of its market capitalisation.\n\n\"The company's fix needs to begin at home: US operations are the primary reason for the company's fall from grace,\" Schultz wrote in the open letter. \"Senior leaders -- including board members -- need to spend more time with those who wear the green apron.\"\n\nIn May, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella stepped down from the Starbucks board of directors, saying in a resignation letter that he had \"utmost confidence\" in Narasimhan and the company's leadership team.\n\nStarbucks fended off a proxy fight earlier this year after a labour group critical of Starbucks' union strategy retracted its request for board seats.\n\nElliott, one of the largest and most prolific activist investors, has this year pushed for change at several large-cap companies including Southwest Airlines and Texas-based semiconductor company Texas Instruments.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Schultz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Howard Schultz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starbucks", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Starbucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coffee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laxman_Narasimhan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Laxman Narasimhan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick_and_mortar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brick and mortar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Satya Nadella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_fight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Proxy fight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas Instruments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_letter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Open letter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southwest Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Board of directors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LinkedIn"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Retail_Trade/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Retail Trade/Retailers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2F__origami%2Fservice%2Fimage%2Fv2%2Fimages%2Fraw%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%252Fproduction%252F9f55c8d6-e04f-45a6-8cea-c77803ad5e0b.jpg%3Fsource%3Dnext-article%26fit%3Dscale-down%26quality%3Dhighest%26width%3D700%26dpr%3D1?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9746443", "eventUri": "eng-9746443", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

This seems even more important on a Friday morning, when you're tired from working hard all week, and looking forward to Saturday and Sunday but you need something extra from your best pal, caffeine.\n\nBut... is it true that we can't use the Starbucks mobile order? That sounds like a nightmare, so let's chat...\n\nYes, we're sad to say that on Friday July 19th, 2024, the Starbucks mobile ordering system is down. This is because of the Crowdstrike power outage that is affecting a lot of industries including banks and airlines, according to Restaurant Business Magazine. If you want caffeine today (and of course you do), you can still go to a Starbucks because while some aren't open because of the outage, others are still operating as usual.\n\nAs Masslive.com explained, any app or service that is part of Microsoft 365 is dealing with this issue. And it's all because Crowdstrike planned an update, which then caused this surprising situation. A lot of people shared their experiences with this situation on X this morning, and said the Starbucks location they went to was super packed as people weren't sure what was going on.\n\nOf course, sometimes this does happen, like in May 2022 when Yahoo! reported that people were stunned they had to go into a coffee shop and ask for the drink they wanted instead of the ease of the app. But when the Starbucks mobile app is down, it's usually a technological glitch, not part of a huge outage like it is now.\n\nWe can confidently say that this outage won't last forever (even though a day without ordering coffee through this app might feel like way too long). Easy access to coffee should be back soon... and we'll celebrate with our favorite beverage. We can splurge a little.", "source": {"uri": "wegotthiscovered.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "We Got This Covered"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aya_tsintziras@wegotthiscovered.com", "name": "Aya Tsintziras", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starbucks", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Starbucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Caffeine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrowdStrike", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CrowdStrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_outage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Power outage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffeehouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coffeehouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coffee"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/starbucks_acb1e7.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9746443", "eventUri": "eng-9746443", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Airlines, hospitals, and TV networks were also victims of the breakdown, which shut down programs on the Microsoft platforms used by these companies, according to the New York Times.\n\nThe outage has been linked to a cybersecurity firm called Crowdstrike, which is supposed to protect these companies' computers from hackers. It appears a flawed software update crashed these systems. The programs affected were big and small, including emergency networks like 911 in some areas, and issues at companies like Whole Foods, according to employees.\n\nSome of the biggest identified issues right now seem to be at Starbucks, with customers waking up to discover online ordering had crashed and prevented them from grabbing their favorite Starbucks drinks before work. Baristas and Starbucks employees on Reddit have been trading stories and asking questions, with many reporting long lines as customers and app delivery drivers struggle to understand what's going on. According to one post, online orders are still coming through the Starbucks Rewards app, but employees are unable to see them or print tickets, which has made for some chaotic scenes at stores. Other employees say the situation gotten so bad that their stores may need to close for the day if the issue isn't fixed soon.\n\nRead more: 23 Whole Foods Baked Goods, Ranked\n\nAnother major chain affected is the organic favorite Whole Foods, with employees writing on Reddit that crashes have been taking out some computers but not others. One commentator reported all the registers at their location are down, while another wrote that only half of the registers at their store are not working. Another big issue identified at the grocery chain has been on its Innerview app, which employees use to check schedules. Numerous commenters chimed in to say their schedules have been completely erased and are showing no upcoming shifts. It's not just major retailers either -- smaller stores in places like Louisiana and New York have been unable to open, according to local news sources.\n\nAround the world, other companies are having their own issues, showing exactly how interconnected our digital world is. Bloomberg has reported that McDonald's in Japan is experiencing major issues, with 30% of stores in the country closing because of malfunctioning cash registers. Grocery retailers as far afield as the United Kingdom and Australia have also said some stores have had to close or shift to cash-only transactions, as credit cards aren't working.\n\nThankfully the IT outage is not an industry-wide phenomenon, since other major food retailers like Kroger and Target have not yet noted any issues. Needless to say, it's a rough day for many retail workers, so maybe delay that shopping trip until this is all cleared up.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starbucks", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Starbucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_Foods_Market", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Whole Foods Market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reddit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grocery_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grocery store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrowdStrike", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CrowdStrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_food", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Organic food"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kroger", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kroger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_register", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cash register"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald's", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "McDonald's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Target Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Frugality", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Frugality", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/rM01aOXSETR8zV28ZdPhNw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzQ7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/tasting_table_543/dc8721bf2a786a2872806a43e17e0d40", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9746443", "eventUri": "eng-9746443", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 46, "textEnd": 53}], "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 114, "relevance": 1}

Starbucks is no exception to the chaos.\n\n\"Starbucks is among those companies experiencing impacts due to a widespread third-party systems outage, resulting in a temporary outage of our mobile order ahead and pay features,\" Starbucks spokesperson Jaci Anderson said in a statement emailed to NBC News. \"We continue to welcome and serve customers in the vast majority of our stores and drive-thrus and are doing everything we can to bring all systems online as quickly as possible. We apologize for any inconvenience.\"\n\nResponding to the IT glitch that affected mobile ordering, early on Friday Starbucks began prompting users on its app that mobile ordering is unavailable.\n\nAn official Starbucks account began responding to social media posts, too, saying that some stores were unavailable to process any transactions and had closed as a result. The account also responded to people who said they placed mobile orders and were then unable to pick them up.\n\n\"Stores may be unable to process transactions and some stores may be closed. Mobile ordering is also currently unavailable. For stores that are open, we invite you to place your order with a barista,\" the official Starbucks account wrote in one reply.\n\nSince 2015, customers have been able to place orders at participating stores through the Starbucks app and pick them up without waiting in line. The mobile order system has become so popular that some Starbucks locations, such as those in some airports, have introduced mobile-only storefronts.\n\nOn the Starbucks subreddit, where customers and employees have both posted about app and in-store technical issues, recent posts described stressful situations and posted photos of mobile order errors.\n\n\"Almost every store in my district except mine closed because they didn't want to deal with the outages,\" one Reddit post from an account labeled as a store supervisor said. \"We are SUFFERING. Mobile orders and deliveries were through the roof, drive thru was wrapped around the building and two accidents in our parking lot.\"\n\nAnother Starbucks employee and Reddit user took to the subreddit to beg for help, seeking creative solutions to working during the outage. \"Please, as a fellow barista, tell me the procedures your store is taking to work during this outage,\" the employee wrote. \"Currently my store is scrambling to keep up, myself and other partners keep offering suggestions (like putting up a sign, or writing on cups) but my store manager isn't being receptive.\"\n\nA barista at a newly renovated Starbucks in New York City told CNBC that her store had to manually write out tickets for customer orders as they grappled with computer issues in the early morning. The location has disabled mobile ordering, and the barista said that their point-of-sale came back online around 7:00 a.m.\n\nAt other stores, employees created various handwritten signs for customers, announcing store closures or asking customers to walk up or show an employee a mobile receipt.\n\nOnline, other employees described their stores as being slower than usual, with some customers saying they chose not to go in because they couldn't do a mobile order. When NBC News visited several Starbucks locations in Manhattan on Friday afternoon, lines were short and moved quickly. Four customers said they had no issue ordering in line instead of using the mobile app.\n\nOne of the customers, Linda Muller, said she found out about the issue Friday morning when a friend couldn't place their Starbucks mobile order. But Muller, who was visiting from Switzerland, said she was used to standing in line -- the app isn't available at all back home, she said.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC New York"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starbucks", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Starbucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Glitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reddit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patch (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrowdStrike", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CrowdStrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_sale", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Point of sale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Mail_Order", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Mail Order", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2024/07/STARBUCKS-CROWDSTRIKE-OUTAGE.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9746443", "eventUri": "eng-9746443", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 459117778, "relevance": 2}

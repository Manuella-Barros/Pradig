Pornhub says it won't assume that risk to its viewers.\n\nUsers of the adult video repository with Nebraska Internet protocol addresses are receiving warning messages saying they will lose access to the site on July 15.\n\nThat's when Legislative Bill 1092, introduced by State Sen. Dave Murman of Glenvil, goes into effect. The legislation requires online porn companies to verify users' ages.\n\nThe new law, passed 35-3 in April, creates liability for knowingly or intentionally publishing or distributing material harmful to minors on the internet.\n\nMurman and other advocates of such age-verification laws say the laws are needed to protect children from mental health risks of exposure to pornography.\n\nFirst Amendment advocates and others pushing for freer expression have argued that children today carry the internet in their pockets and will find other ways to access porn.\n\nAylo, Pornhub's parent company, confirmed to the Examiner on Tuesday that it plans to block access to its websites in Nebraska when the new law takes effect.\n\nNebraska would be the latest state where Aylo blocks users based on such laws. The others include Arkansas, Mississippi, Montana, North Carolina, Texas, Utah and Virginia. Idaho, Indiana, Kansas and Kentucky passed similar laws and will see users blocked over the next several weeks.\n\nFlorida's new law goes into effect next year. Aylo hasn't said yet whether its users will be blocked.\n\nA company spokesman who declined to give his name said such laws require adult websites to collect information about users in ways that put personally identifying information at risk.\n\n\"Aylo has publicly supported age verification of users for years, but we believe that any law to this effect must preserve user safety and privacy,\" the spokesman said.\n\nThe group's longer statement mirrored what many of the bill's critics argued during legislative debate: that it addressed a real issue without paying enough attention to unintended consequences.\n\nLB 1092 requires companies to verify the front and back of a user's driver's license or state ID card and then get rid of the data or use a third party to do so.\n\nState Sen. Carol Blood of Bellevue and other critics warned during debate that the state should not require such personal information to be shared with porn websites.\n\nShe said this week the requirement puts users at risk of being embarrassed by bad actors or fleeced financially by having their identity stolen.\n\nBlood said Nebraska needs a data broker registry that would let consumers know who has access to their data, why and what they do with the information the companies gather.\n\n\"It's clear that Nebraska did not talk to people who utilize this type of data,\" she said. \"You shouldn't pass laws without appropriate research just because other states are doing it.\"\n\nMurman, the sponsoring senator, said Nebraska and other states have stepped up to say \"No more\" to the porn industry. He said pornography companies lie about privacy and safety concerns.\n\n\"The reality is that companies like Pornhub rely on the business of streaming endless hours of graphic sexual content to minors and children,\" Murman said.\n\nAylo suggested a better, safer approach to age verification -- requiring it to be checked at the device level, on a phone or computer -- to avoid transmitting personal information.\n\nThe company and other critics of LB 1092 said porn users in the other states where such laws have been passed still seek out what they want.\n\nMany simply use virtual private networks to conceal where they are viewing the material from, or they get the material from darker, more dangerous places online, the spokesman said, adding:\n\n\"We are eager to be part of this solution and ... collaborate with government, civil society and tech partners to arrive at an effective device-based age verification solution.\"", "source": {"uri": "nebraskaexaminer.com", "dataType": "news",

Pornhub says it won't assume that risk to its viewers.\n\nUsers of the adult video repository with Nebraska Internet protocol addresses are receiving warning messages saying they will lose access to the site on July 15.\n\nThat's when Legislative Bill 1092, introduced by State Sen. Dave Murman of Glenvil, goes into effect. The legislation requires online porn companies to verify users' ages.\n\nThe new law, passed 35-3 in April, creates liability for knowingly or intentionally publishing or distributing material harmful to minors on the internet.\n\nMurman and other advocates of such age-verification laws say the laws are needed to protect children from mental health risks of exposure to pornography.\n\nFirst Amendment advocates and others pushing for freer expression have argued that children today carry the internet in their pockets and will find other ways to access porn.\n\nAylo, Pornhub's parent company, confirmed to the Examiner on Tuesday that it plans to block access to its websites in Nebraska when the new law takes effect.\n\nNebraska would be the latest state where Aylo blocks users based on such laws. The others include Arkansas, Mississippi, Montana, North Carolina, Texas, Utah and Virginia. Idaho, Indiana, Kansas and Kentucky passed similar laws and will see users blocked over the next several weeks.\n\nFlorida's new law goes into effect next year. Aylo hasn't said yet whether its users will be blocked.\n\nA company spokesman who declined to give his name said such laws require adult websites to collect information about users in ways that put personally identifying information at risk.\n\n\"Aylo has publicly supported age verification of users for years, but we believe that any law to this effect must preserve user safety and privacy,\" the spokesman said.\n\nThe group's longer statement mirrored what many of the bill's critics argued during legislative debate: that it addressed a real issue without paying enough attention to unintended consequences.\n\nLB 1092 requires companies to verify the front and back of a user's driver's license or state ID card and then get rid of the data or use a third party to do so.\n\nState Sen. Carol Blood of Bellevue and other critics warned during debate that the state should not require such personal information to be shared with porn websites.\n\nShe said this week the requirement puts users at risk of being embarrassed by bad actors or fleeced financially by having their identity stolen.\n\nBlood said Nebraska needs a data broker registry that would let consumers know who has access to their data, why and what they do with the information the companies gather.\n\n\"It's clear that Nebraska did not talk to people who utilize this type of data,\" she said. \"You shouldn't pass laws without appropriate research just because other states are doing it.\"\n\nMurman, the sponsoring senator, said Nebraska and other states have stepped up to say \"No more\" to the porn industry. He said pornography companies lie about privacy and safety concerns.\n\n\"The reality is that companies like Pornhub rely on the business of streaming endless hours of graphic sexual content to minors and children,\" Murman said.\n\nAylo suggested a better, safer approach to age verification -- requiring it to be checked at the device level, on a phone or computer -- to avoid transmitting personal information.\n\nThe company and other critics of LB 1092 said porn users in the other states where such laws have been passed still seek out what they want.\n\nMany simply use virtual private networks to conceal where they are viewing the material from, or they get the material from darker, more dangerous places online, the spokesman said, adding:", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType":

The porn company is intent on blocking access in every state that passes a law intended to prevent children from freely accessing pornography.\n\nThe Verge reports that Pornhub, one of the world's most popular adult websites, has announced plans to cut off access to its platform in five additional states as a response to the implementation of age verification laws. This decision appears to be part of Pornhub's stance against legislation that it views as infringing on user privacy and potentially endangering sensitive data. Effective from June 10 in Kentucky, June 28 in Indiana, Idaho, and Kansas, and July 17 in Nebraska, the blackout will not only affect Pornhub but also more than a dozen other brands owned by its parent company, Aylo.\n\nA spokesperson for Aylo, known only as Ian for \"safety reasons,\" confirmed the company's stringent step, emphasizing that these laws demand adults to upload government-issued identification to verify they are 18 or older. Ian articulated that Aylo's decision stems from substantial privacy concerns inherent in these measures.\n\nThe laws, the porn industry argues, amount to near surveillance, where sensitive user data could easily be misused or stolen, a criticism echoed firmly by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). \"This scheme would lead us further towards an internet where our private data is collected and sold by default,\" EFF wrote last year, highlighting the potential dangers.\n\nAylo has stated that while it supports age verification in principle, the current legislative attempts are perceived as \"ineffective, haphazard, and dangerous.\" The company's experience in Louisiana, where ID-based verification was implemented last year, demonstrated a drastic 80 percent drop in site traffic, indicating users' reluctance to provide such sensitive personal information online. Aylo argues that these policies could inadvertently drive users toward less regulated and potentially more dangerous websites that do not adhere to the laws.\n\nThe spread of age verification laws has been particularly rapid across several states in the U.S. So far, Pornhub access has already been blocked in Texas, North Carolina, Montana, Mississippi, Virginia, Arkansas, and Utah. The debate over these blocks centers around finding a balance between protecting minors from adult content and securing the privacy and data of adult users. Critics of the age verification laws argue that there are better ways to achieve the intended protection without resorting to measures that could create new risks, while those in favor of the blackout claim that these steps are necessary to safeguard children in an increasingly digital world.\n\nRead more at the Verge here.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

As of July 10, you'll be required to prove you are 18 years or older such as by uploading your government ID for every adult content website you'd like to access. We don't want minors accessing our site and think preventing that from happening is a good thing. But putting everybody's privacy at risk won't achieve that.\" It links to a video about device-based verification and an op-ed on the topic by Pornhub's Head of Community and Brand Alexzandra Kekesi.\n\nWhen their time is up, Kentucky and Indiana will join multiple other states where Pornhub has blocked itself in order to remain compliant with age verification laws, including Texas, Montana, North Carolina, Virginia, Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Utah.\n\nIndiana's Senate Enrolled Act 17 will require adult websites to verify users' ages with government ID or another \"reasonable\" method, and is set to go into effect on July 1. Kentucky's law is set to take effect on July 15.\n\nPornhub's parent company Aylo, along with several other porn sites and the industry advocacy group The Free Speech Coalition, recently filed a federal lawsuit against Indiana, arguing that it violates the First Amendment.\n\nOn X, Indiana attorney general Todd Roika wrote that the law is meant to \"protect and shield them from the psychological and emotional consequences associated with viewing porn\" and that he intends to defend the law in court.\n\n\"We will continue to fight for the rights of adults to access the internet free of shame and surveillance,\" Alison Boden, executive director of Free Speech Coalition, said in a press release. \"While they may sound reasonable on their face, laws like SB17 have effectively functioned as state censorship.\"\n\nIn April, Chaturbate was ordered to pay Texas a $675,000 fine as part of a settlement over its violation of the state's age verification law. But these laws aren't spreading and passing across the country with total success: Arizona governor Katie Hobbs vetoed the state's would-be age verification bill, saying, \"The legislation goes against settled case law,\" and \"it should be bipartisan and work within the bounds of the First Amendment, which this bill does not.\"\n\nOnline safety and free speech experts say that the age verification laws spreading across the country are not only unconstitutional but ineffective, and threaten to make the problem of children accessing harmful material worse, while stifling adults' access to porn.\n\n\"To be clear, Aylo has publicly supported age verification of users for years, but we believe that any law to this effect must preserve user safety and privacy, and must effectively protect children from accessing content intended for adults,\" Aylo told Kentucky's Spectrum News 1 in a statement.", "source": {"uri": "404media.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "404

It's because of a new law, requiring porn sites to verify a user's age using a valid ID.\n\nVisitors to Pornhub in Kentucky are now greeted with a pop-up; warning 'you will lose access to Pornhub in 22 days.' Aylo, the parent company of Pornhub and various other porn sites, will cut off access to Kentuckians once the new law goes into effect.\n\n\"Instead of simply putting these protections in place to keep kids safe online, they're just going to shut down and I think that reveals a lot about who this organization is,\" said David Walls, executive director of the Family Foundation.\n\nIn March, the Kentucky General Assembly passed a bill requiring any porn site to verify their users are 18 by having them upload an ID. Walls, said the Family Foundation; which advocated for 'God-honoring' policy, pushed for the passage of this act.\n\n\"Parents are really struggling in the modern technological moment that we're in with easy access to pornography, continued concern about harms on social media for kids so we believe this is a commonsense step forward,\" Walls said.\n\nHouse Bill 278 pertains to sex crimes against children. The age verification provision was added in the Senate. It received unanimous, bi-partisan support in both chambers. Gov. Andy Beshear, D-Ky., signed it into law in April.\n\nHowever, Corey Shapiro, legal director at the ACLU of Kentucky, said the bill has serious personal data concerns.\n\n\"In Louisiana after the age verification and requirements of uploading some form of verification, that resulted quickly in a data breech of those servers, which exposed a huge amount of personal identifying information,\" Shapiro said.\n\nThe bill states any platform that performs the age verification required shall not keep any identifying information once access is granted.\n\nBut, Shapiro said this is an unnecessary hurdle for adults to access content protected under the Constitution.\n\n\"We've seen in other states, the challenges are based on the first amendment in that this law violates the first amendment,\" Shapiro said.\n\nAylo said this will affect all their pornography video sharing websites.\n\nThe company emailed Spectrum News 1 a statement which read:\n\n\"To be clear, Aylo has publicly supported age verification of users for years, but we believe that any law to this effect must preserve user safety and privacy, and must effectively protect children from accessing content intended for adults.\"\n\nThe statement continued with, \"In Louisiana last year, Pornhub was one of the few sites to comply with the new law. Since then, our traffic in Louisiana dropped approximately 80%. These people did not stop looking for porn. They just migrated to darker corners of the internet that don't ask users to verify age, that don't follow the law, that don't take user safety seriously.\"", "source": {"uri": "spectrumnews1.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "spectrumnews1.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_pornography", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Internet pornography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornhub", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pornhub"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pornography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_verification_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Age verification system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop-up_ad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop-up ad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexington,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lexington, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lexington, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Beshear", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andy Beshear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_General_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky General Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Civil Liberties Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_video_platform", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Online video platform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spectrum News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Child_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Child Safety", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Politics_of_Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Politics of Sexuality", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/sex_industry_worker_getty_0617", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666213", "eventUri": "eng-9666213", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lexington, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 149, "textEnd": 156}], "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

Dave Murman of Glenvil, left, meets with State Sen. Carol Blood of Bellevue. April 9, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)\n\nLINCOLN -- Pornhub, one of the busiest websites for sexually explicit videos, is less than a month from going dark in Nebraska.\n\nThe company blames a new Nebraska state law requiring it to check the IDs of people using its site or hire another company to do so. Pornhub says it won't assume that risk to its viewers.\n\nUsers of the adult video repository with Nebraska Internet protocol addresses are receiving warning messages saying they will lose access to the site on July 15.\n\nThat's when Legislative Bill 1092, introduced by State Sen. Dave Murman of Glenvil, goes into effect. The legislation requires online porn companies to verify users' ages.\n\nNew law required age check\n\nThe new law, passed 35-3 in April, creates liability for knowingly or intentionally publishing or distributing material harmful to minors on the internet.\n\nMurman and other advocates of such age-verification laws say the laws are needed to protect children from mental health risks of exposure to pornography.\n\nFirst Amendment advocates and others pushing for freer expression have argued that children today carry the internet in their pockets and will find other ways to access porn.\n\nAylo, Pornhub's parent company, confirmed to the Examiner on Tuesday that it plans to block access to its websites in Nebraska when the new law takes effect.\n\nNebraska would be the latest state where Aylo blocks users based on such laws. The others include Arkansas, Mississippi, Montana, North Carolina, Texas, Utah and Virginia. Idaho, Indiana, Kansas and Kentucky passed similar laws and will see users blocked over the next several weeks.\n\nFlorida's new law goes into effect next year. Aylo hasn't said yet whether its users will be blocked.\n\nA company spokesman who declined to give his name said such laws require adult websites to collect information about users in ways that put personally identifying information at risk.\n\n\"Aylo has publicly supported age verification of users for years, but we believe that any law to this effect must preserve user safety and privacy,\" the spokesman said.\n\nThe group's longer statement mirrored what many of the bill's critics argued during legislative debate: that it addressed a real issue without paying enough attention to unintended consequences.\n\nHow the law works\n\nLB 1092 requires companies to verify the front and back of a user's driver's license or state ID card and then get rid of the data or use a third party to do so.\n\nState Sen. Carol Blood of Bellevue and other critics warned during debate that the state should not require such personal information to be shared with porn websites.\n\nShe said this week the requirement puts users at risk of being embarrassed by bad actors or fleeced financially by having their identity stolen.\n\nBlood said Nebraska needs a data broker registry that would let consumers know who has access to their data, why and what they do with the information the companies gather.\n\n\"It's clear that Nebraska did not talk to people who utilize this type of data,\" she said. \"You shouldn't pass laws without appropriate research just because other states are doing it.\"\n\nPeople find access anyway\n\nMurman, the sponsoring senator, said Nebraska and other states have stepped up to say \"No more\" to the porn industry. He said pornography companies lie about privacy and safety concerns.\n\n\"The reality is that companies like Pornhub rely on the business of streaming endless hours of graphic sexual content to minors and children,\" Murman said.\n\nAylo suggested a better, safer approach to age verification -- requiring it to be checked at the device level, on a phone or computer -- to avoid transmitting personal information.\n\nThe company and other critics of LB 1092 said porn users in the other states where such laws have been passed still seek out what they want.\n\nMany simply use virtual private networks to conceal where they are viewing the material from, or they get the material from darker, more dangerous places online, the spokesman said, adding:\n\n\"We are eager to be part of this solution and ... collaborate with government, civil society and tech partners to arrive at an effective device-based age verification solution.\"\n\nDONATE: SUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST\n\nThe post Pornhub intends to

In March 2024, Pornhub reportedly shut down its services in Texas state in the US over the same reason. The adult entertainment platform will now block its services to five more states, including Idaho, Nebraska, Kansas, Indiana and Kentucky.\n\nThe Verge reported that the Pornhub website had already shut down in over a half dozen states in protest of the 'age verification laws'. The report highlighted that the age-verification laws quickly spread in conservative-leading states. Pornhub will stop its services on June 28, 2024 in Idaho, Indiana and Kansas. After that, the other reports confirmed that the adult entertainment website will block its services to Kentucky on July 10 and will be inaccessible in Nebraska from July 17, 2024. Pornhub Website Disabled in Texas: Adult Entertainment Platform Shuts Down Its Services in US State to Protest Age Verification Law, Say Reports.\n\nThe report highlighted that the spokesperson of Aylo, Pornhub's parent company, who asked to be identified as 'Ian' over safety concerns, said more about the blocking of the website. He emphasised that not only Pornhub but all the adult websites operated by Aylo will face a blackout. Pornhub's parent website has over a dozen other brands. Aylo further said that the new law required adults to upload a valid form of government ID to confirm they are above 18 years old.\n\nOn the other hand, such surveillance systems have been criticised by an international internet civil liberty promoter, Electronic Frontier Foundation, over fears of misuse or theft of data. The California-based non-profit organisation said private data would be collected and sold by default. Ilya Sutskever, Former OpenAI Co-Founder, Starts New AI Company Called 'Superintelligence Inc' After a Month of Leaving ChatGPT-Developer.\n\nAylo said that it would support the age verification to prevent children from accessing adult websites and consuming pornography; however, it described the current laws as \"ineffective, haphazard and dangerous\". The adult entertainment website, Pornhub, is already blocked in the following states - Utah, North Carolina, Texas, Arkansas, Montana, Louisiana and Mississippi.\n\n(The above story first appeared on LatestLY on Jun 20, 2024 11:30 AM IST.

Aylo and other companies providing online adult entertainment on June 10 filed a lawsuit to block an Indiana law taking effect July 1.\n\nThe law signed by Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb in March says the state's attorney general and individuals can bring legal action against a website's operator if material \"harmful to minors\" is accessible to users younger than 18.\n\nIn a statement shared with News 8, Aylo called on governments to require existing technology that verifies the users' ages on devices, rather than encourage people to migrate \"to darker corners of the internet that don't ask users to verify age, that don't follow the law, that don't take user safety seriously, and that often don't even moderate content.\n\n\"In practice, the laws have just made the internet more dangerous for adults and children,\" Aylo's statement says.\n\nIndiana Attorney General Todd Rokita, a defendant in the lawsuit, said June 11 in a post on X that he looks forward to defending the law in court.\n\nA similar Texas law remains in effect as the Supreme Court weighs an appeal from the Free Speech Coalition, one of the groups suing in the Indiana lawsuit. A Utah law was upheld by a federal judge in August, and a federal judge dismissed a challenge against Louisiana's law in October.\n\nHere is the statement Aylo shared Wednesday with News 8.\n\n\"Aylo has publicly supported age verification of users for years, but we believe that any law to this effect must preserve user safety and privacy, and must effectively protect children from accessing content intended for adults.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the way many jurisdictions worldwide have chosen to implement age verification is ineffective, haphazard, and dangerous. Any regulations that require hundreds of thousands of adult sites to collect significant amounts of highly sensitive personal information is putting user safety in jeopardy. Moreover, as experience has demonstrated, unless properly enforced, users will simply access non-compliant sites or find other methods of evading these laws.\n\n\"This is not speculation. We have seen how this scenario plays out in the United States. In Louisiana last year, Pornhub was one of the few sites to comply with the new law. Since then, our traffic in Louisiana dropped approximately 80 percent. These people did not stop looking for porn. They just migrated to darker corners of the internet that don't ask users to verify age, that don't follow the law, that don't take user safety seriously, and that often don't even moderate content. In practice, the laws have just made the internet more dangerous for adults and children.\n\n\"The best solution to make the internet safer, preserve user privacy, and prevent children from accessing adult content is performing age verification at the source: on the device. The technology to accomplish this exists today. What is required is the political and social will to make it happen. We are eager to be part of this solution and are happy to collaborate with government, civil society and tech partners to arrive at an effective device-based age verification solution.\n\n\"In addition, many devices already offer free and easy-to-use parental control features that can prevent children from accessing adult content without risking the disclosure of sensitive user data.\n\n\"The safety of our users is our number one concern. We will always comply with the law, but we hope that governments around the world will implement laws that actually protect the safety and security of users.\"", "source": {"uri": "wishtv.com",

That's \"the best and most effective solution for protecting minors and adults alike,\" Pornhub argued, because the age-verification technology is proven and less PII would be shared.\n\n\"Users would only get verified once, through their operating system, not on each age-restricted site,\" Pornhub's blog said, claiming that \"this dramatically reduces privacy risks and creates a very simple process for regulators to enforce.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Pornhub-owner Aylo told Ars that \"unfortunately, the way many jurisdictions worldwide have chosen to implement age verification is ineffective, haphazard, and dangerous.\"\n\n\"Any regulations that require hundreds of thousands of adult sites to collect significant amounts of highly sensitive personal information is putting user safety in jeopardy,\" Aylo's spokesperson told Ars. \"Moreover, as experience has demonstrated, unless properly enforced, users will simply access non-compliant sites or find other methods of evading these laws.\n\nAge-verification laws are harmful, Pornhub says\n\nPornhub's big complaint with current age-verification laws is that these laws are hard to enforce and seem to make it riskier than ever to visit an adult site.\n\n\"Since age verification software requires users to hand over extremely sensitive information, it opens the door for the risk of data breaches,\" Pornhub's blog said. \"Whether or not your intentions are good, governments have historically struggled to secure this data. It also creates an opportunity for criminals to exploit and extort people through phishing attempts or fake [age verification] processes, an unfortunate and all too common practice.\"\n\nOver the past few years, the risk of identity theft or stolen PII on both widely used and smaller niche adult sites has been well-documented.\n\nHundreds of millions of people were impacted by major leaks exposing PII shared with popular adult sites like Adult Friend Finder and Brazzers in 2016, while likely tens of thousands of users were targeted on eight poorly secured adult sites in 2018. Niche and free sites have also been vulnerable to attacks, including millions collectively exposed through breaches of fetish porn site Luscious in 2019 and MyFreeCams in 2021.\n\nAnd those are just the big breaches that make headlines. In 2019, Kaspersky Lab reported that malware targeting online porn account credentials more than doubled in 2018, and researchers analyzing 22,484 pornography websites estimated that 93 percent were leaking user data to a third party.\n\nThat's why Pornhub argues that, as states have passed age-verification laws requiring ID, they've \"introduced harm\" by redirecting visitors to adult sites that have fewer privacy protections and worse security, allegedly exposing users to more threats.\n\nAs an example, Pornhub reported, traffic to Pornhub in Louisiana \"dropped by approximately 80 percent\" after their age-verification law passed. That allegedly showed not just how few users were willing to show an ID to access their popular platform, but also how \"very easily\" users could simply move to \"pirate, illegal, or other non-compliant sites that don't ask visitors to verify their age.\"\n\nPornhub has continued to argue that states passing laws like Louisiana's cannot effectively enforce the laws and are simply shifting users to make riskier choices when accessing porn.\n\n\"The Louisiana law and other copycat state-level laws have no regulator, only civil liability, which results in a flawed enforcement regime, effectively making it an option for platform operators to comply,\" Pornhub's blog said. As one of the world's most popular adult platforms, Pornhub would surely be targeted for enforcement if found to be non-compliant, while smaller adult sites perhaps plagued by security risks and disincentivized to check IDs would go unregulated, the thinking goes.\n\nAylo's spokesperson shared 2023 Similarweb data with Ars, showing that sites complying with age-verification laws in Virginia, including Pornhub and xHamster, lost substantial traffic while seven non-compliant sites saw a sharp uptick in traffic. Similar trends were observed in Google trends data in Utah and Mississippi, while market shares were seemingly largely maintained in California, a state not yet checking ID to access adult sites.",

Pornhub says it won't assume that risk to its viewers.\n\nUsers of the adult video repository with Nebraska Internet protocol addresses are receiving warning messages saying they will lose access to the site on July 15.\n\nThat's when Legislative Bill 1092, introduced by State Sen. Dave Murman of Glenvil, goes into effect. The legislation requires online porn companies to verify users' ages.\n\nThe new law, passed 35-3 in April, creates liability for knowingly or intentionally publishing or distributing material harmful to minors on the internet.\n\nMurman and other advocates of such age-verification laws say the laws are needed to protect children from mental health risks of exposure to pornography.\n\nFirst Amendment advocates and others pushing for freer expression have argued that children today carry the internet in their pockets and will find other ways to access porn.\n\nAylo, Pornhub's parent company, confirmed to the Examiner on Tuesday that it plans to block access to its websites in Nebraska when the new law takes effect.\n\nNebraska would be the latest state where Aylo blocks users based on such laws. The others include Arkansas, Mississippi, Montana, North Carolina, Texas, Utah and Virginia. Idaho, Indiana, Kansas and Kentucky passed similar laws and will see users blocked over the next several weeks.\n\nFlorida's new law goes into effect next year. Aylo hasn't said yet whether its users will be blocked.\n\nA company spokesman who declined to give his name said such laws require adult websites to collect information about users in ways that put personally identifying information at risk.\n\n\"Aylo has publicly supported age verification of users for years, but we believe that any law to this effect must preserve user safety and privacy,\" the spokesman said.\n\nThe group's longer statement mirrored what many of the bill's critics argued during legislative debate: that it addressed a real issue without paying enough attention to unintended consequences.\n\nLB 1092 requires companies to verify the front and back of a user's driver's license or state ID card and then get rid of the data or use a third party to do so.\n\nState Sen. Carol Blood of Bellevue and other critics warned during debate that the state should not require such personal information to be shared with porn websites.\n\nShe said this week the requirement puts users at risk of being embarrassed by bad actors or fleeced financially by having their identity stolen.\n\nBlood said Nebraska needs a data broker registry that would let consumers know who has access to their data, why and what they do with the information the companies gather.\n\n\"It's clear that Nebraska did not talk to people who utilize this type of data,\" she said. \"You shouldn't pass laws without appropriate research just because other states are doing it.\"\n\nMurman, the sponsoring senator, said Nebraska and other states have stepped up to say \"No more\" to the porn industry. He said pornography companies lie about privacy and safety concerns.\n\n\"The reality is that companies like Pornhub rely on the business of streaming endless hours of graphic sexual content to minors and children,\" Murman said.\n\nAylo suggested a better, safer approach to age verification -- requiring it to be checked at the device level, on a phone or computer -- to avoid transmitting personal information.\n\nThe company and other critics of LB 1092 said porn users in the other states where such laws have been passed still seek out what they want.\n\nMany simply use virtual private networks to conceal where they are viewing the material from, or they get the material from darker, more dangerous places online, the spokesman said, adding:\n\n\"We are eager to be part of this solution and ... collaborate with government, civil society and tech partners to arrive at an effective device-based age verification solution.\"\n\nNebraska Examiner is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

I used to watch a lot of porn, to be honest. I started watching porn when I was, like, 11,\" she said. \"I think it really destroyed my brain and I feel incredibly devastated that I was exposed to so much porn.\"\n\nFor many, Eilish's disclosure was the first time they realized that exposure to pornography affects children as young as grade school. But many lawmakers and policy analysts thought there wasn't anything the government could do about it.\n\n\"The data is clear: This is something that is a problem for America's children,\" Michael Toscano, executive director of the Institute for Family Studies, told the Register. \"What we were finding was so disastrous that we thought, 'We have to do something about it.'\"\n\nFast forward five years and dozens of states have passed strict age verification laws for websites that publish adult content with sweeping bipartisan support. More are considering similar legislation, and courts across the nation have upheld these laws against the onslaught of lawsuits from pornography companies. Pornhub, the largest distributor of adult content, has blocked access to its own site out of protest in many states where these laws have taken effect.\n\nWhat Are Age Verification Laws?\n\nAge verification bills require that companies that sell or promote goods and services that minors are banned from purchasing confirm the customer's age by checking a government-issued ID. Some also utilize biometrics and facial recognition to confirm that the person logging on is who they claim to be.\n\n\"The goal is to replicate that experience of walking into a brick-and-mortar store, where an employee has to determine if the person is of age, and they get really close with the ID scan,\" National Decency Coalition Executive Director Ricky Darr told the Register.\n\nDarr's organization helps legislators enact age verification laws, and tracks bills around the country. He said many websites that sell nicotine products or alcohol use age verification, and now online pornography retailers should be subject to the same rules as their physical counterparts.\n\n\"It's just that pornography has been last on the list to comply,\" Darr said.\n\nSo far 19 states have passed age verification laws, and 14 more are considering legislation. Pornhub blocked users in eight states in protest: Utah, Texas, Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina and Virginia.\n\nWhy It's Important\n\nToscano and his team at the Institute for Family Studies were among the first to look for a legal solution to issues with online dependence -- porn related and otherwise -- they saw afflicting families. He recalled a 2019 talk he gave in Virginia about the importance of instilling in children respect and desire for marriage.\n\n\"Afterward, we were surrounded by about 10 or 12 moms and they said, 'Well, thank you for your message -- it's very, very important, and we agree. But my kids are addicted to their phones,' or, 'My son has a pornography problem,' or, 'My son can't get off of social media. My daughter is depressed because she's on Instagram all day. Can you help us?\" Toscano recalled.\n\nAccording to statistics compiled by Covenant Eyes, an online accountability software, 51% of male students and 32% of female students first viewed pornography before their teenage years. The average age of exposure for males was 12 years old. The American Academy of Pediatrics links early exposure to pornography to poor mental health, low self-esteem and a distorted view of the opposite sex.\n\nState of Play\n\nLouisiana was the first state to pass an age verification law for pornography distributors in 2022. After it took effect in January 2023, Pornhub's parent company, Aylo, released a statement that said the site's traffic took a massive hit.\n\nMany states have copied Louisiana's legislation, with a few like Texas and Tennessee adding stricter enforcement. Several states that passed the bills last year will start enforcing them in just a few weeks -- Kansas, Indiana, and Idaho's laws will take effect on July 1.\n\nThis storm of legislation is spurred by the fact that these bills are popular and successful, and state lawmakers are eager to pass a bill that can break through the bureaucracy. Each bill has passed with broad bipartisan support, and even deep blue states like California are considering their own age verification bills.\n\n\"It has become a bipartisan issue,\" Toscano said. \"Blue states are also pursuing regulations on this issue at the same time as places like Utah, Texas, Florida. What's happening right now is the whole world is waking up to something that I think we all knew in the back of our minds.\"\n\nWhile age verification is a successful legislation topic, there are still states where it has failed. Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbes vetoed an age verification law after it was passed by the state Legislature over privacy concerns. Alaska, Minnesota, West Virginia, New Mexico, New Hampshire and others all either rejected the bills or let them expire with the legislative session.\n\nEnforcement Measures\n\nAs age-verification laws are introduced in dozens of state houses, few states have tacked on stricter enforcement. Most states are relying on private lawsuits and fines to keep pornography distributors accountable, but violating Tennessee's law can result in criminal charges.\n\nEmboldened by the success of the laws, Texas has taken it a step further and gone on the offensive against violators. Attorney General Ken Paxton has a task force dedicated to compliance investigations and suing violators.\n\nJonathan Covey, policy director at Texas Values, helped to advise the government on this strategy.\n\n\"The attorney general's office has done a good job about being proactive, to follow up and make sure that these companies are in compliance, because a lot of them won't do it without some sort of investigation,\" Covey told the Register.\n\nIf online pornography sites are found in violation of the law as a result of the attorney general's probe, they can face $10,000 per violation -- a crippling amount of money for websites with hundreds of thousands of users. This differs from other states which are relying on private lawsuits for enforcement.\n\nTexas won a groundbreaking victory in a Fifth Circuit court of appeals decision in March in a lawsuit brought by the Free Speech Coalition (the name of the trade association of pornography sites). The court applied a standard of rational basis rather than strict scrutiny, under which other age verification laws had been deemed unconstitutional.\n\n\"Applying rational-basis review, the age-verification requirement is rationally related to the government's legitimate interest in preventing minors' access to pornography,\" the court explained. \"Therefore, the age-verification requirement does not violate the First Amendment.\"\n\nIn April, the Supreme Court denied the Free Speech Coalition's appeal to block the law and upheld the Fifth Circuit's decision.\n\nFree Speech?\n\nThe pornography lobby's defense relies on two arguments: free speech and privacy.\n\nThe Free Speech Coalition claims age verification laws are \"ineffective, unconstitutional, and dangerous.\" \"Ineffective\" because they allegedly won't prevent minors from accessing sexually graphic content, which they often encounter on regular social media or can bypass the checks with a virtual private network.\n\nIt's \"unconstitutional\" because it says even content harmnful to minors counts as free speech, and \"dangerous\" because minors instead access shadier websites that \"are not bound by U.S. law.\"\n\nBut those who spoke to Register said the free speech defense is flimsy, especially with the Supreme Court upholding the Fifth Circuit's rational basis legal test. Obscenity is one of the few forms of speech not protected by the First Amendment, and the rational basis standard would classify hardcore pornography as obscenity.\n\n\"They don't have a free speech right to addict children to their pornography,\" Toscano said. \"And we should remember that their aims are not out of a belief and in the right of these kids to access pornography -- the purpose is to secure time on the platform.\"\n\nAs for privacy concerns, Toscano said the third-party age-verification platforms have improved dramatically in recent years. They erase data as soon as the age is verified\n\nSocial Media Platforms\n\nWhile age-verification laws have mainly focused on pornography sites, there's a movement to introduce them to social media platforms, as well. With studies and common sense linking social media consumption to depression and anxiety in teens and tweens, some, including psychologist and author Jonathan Heidt, have floated the idea of banning children under the age of 16 from platforms like Instagram.\n\nThe Free Speech Coalition points out that 18% of teenagers are exposed to adult content on social media.\n\nTo combat this, Utah is considering a law that would require obscenity filters to be automatically switched on for minors' social media accounts, and be difficult to turn off without parental consent.\n\nBut parents, communities, and the Catholic Church need to remain vigilant, and take the lead on educating and protecting children from pornography, Toscano said.\n\n\"I hope that the Church will start speaking on behalf of the rights of families to not be enslaved to these technologies,\" Toscano said. \"The Church should be exhorting their congregants, not only to not give their kids this stuff. But this is going to be more radical. The Church should start exhorting its members to not invest and profit off of the addiction and enslavement of kids to these devices.\n\n\"But all that to say there is no silver bullet,\" he said. \"We need the Church. We need families. The situation is so dire.\"", "source": {"uri": "ncregister.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "National Catholic Register"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Jim Pillen offered a parting shot to the one of the most popular websites in the world Thursday as Pornhub's parent company confirmed that it plans to shut off access to its website to users in Nebraska when a new law takes effect next month.\n\n\"To the news that one of the world's busiest porn traffickers will shut down in Nebraska, I say: 'Good riddance,'\" Pillen said in a statement Thursday.\n\nThe first-term governor's farewell message to Pornhub came hours after its parent company, Aloy, confirmed to the Nebraska Examiner that it plans to block access to its porn websites in Nebraska in mid-July, when the state's new law takes effect requiring pornographic websites and other online distributors of \"material harmful to minors\" to verify the age of website users.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Dave Murman of Glenvill in the Legislature this year, the law requires porn websites, or third-party companies they contract, to verify that users attempting to access the sites are at least 18 years old through a \"reasonable age verification method,\" which could include a photo ID or driver's license or other documentation -- such as a credit card statement -- that could serve as \"a reliable proxy for age.\"\n\nThe law bars websites or third-party contractors from retaining users' personal information and would allow users or their parents the right to sue adult websites that do not comply with the law. The age verification requirement applies only to websites where \"more than one-third of the total material\" published is \"harmful.\"\n\nThe law doesn't tab a state agency to monitor compliance, putting that power into the hands of consumers who could file civil lawsuits against companies that run afoul of the law.\n\nThe legislation closely mirrors laws passed in eight other states over the past two years after Louisiana in 2022 became the first state to require porn sites to verify the age of users.\n\nNebraska lawmakers knew when they sent the bill to Pillen's desk on 35-3 vote in April that Pornhub would likely pull out of the state.\n\nAloy had already blocked access to its sites in seven of the eight states that enacted age verification laws prior to this year. The company announced this week it would cease operations in five more states -- including Nebraska -- over similar laws. And the company pulled out of Texas last week.\n\n\"The Pornhub has actually pulled out, I think I'm correct in saying, it's pulled out of seven states now that have passed this bill,\" Murman said as lawmakers debated his bill in March. \"So, apparently, it's working.\"\n\nAs he advocated for his bill in the Legislature, Murman pointed to academic research that has linked porn consumption to increased rates of depression, anxiety, violent behavior, a distorted view of relationships between men and women, among other negative emotional, psychological and physical health outcomes.\n\nThe bill's opponents, meanwhile, broadly cast Murman's proposal as a well-intended but ineffective route forward, highlighting widely accessible means of circumventing age verification tools while raising questions over privacy, government overreach and how the state might police compliance.\n\nSen. Carol Blood of Bellevue and other opponents noted that teens or even grade-schoolers could utilize free virtual private networks, or VPNs, to access porn sites in Nebraska after the law takes effect.\n\nData published by Google shows that over the last 90 days, internet searches for VPNs ticked up in Nebraska in mid-April, when lawmakers passed the bill, and again this month, when Pornhub began warning users that they would soon be required to verify their identities to access porn sites in the state.\n\nThe recent spikes are not outliers when compared to five-year search trends, the data shows.\n\nThe law's opponents had warned that passing Murman's bill would be \"problematic\" if doing so would \"act effectively as a ban\" on pornography.\n\n\"It has resulted in these companies pulling out of these states, which sounds great,\" Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha said in March. \"You're like, 'Oh, well, the smut peddlers are gone.'\n\n\"But the problem with freedom of speech (and) expression is that we have to protect everyone's right to speak and to express themselves -- even the ones we don't like.\"\n\nBut on Thursday, as Pornhub plotted its exit from to the state, Nebraska's governor celebrated.\n\n\"This is a great development for the protection of our kids, culture and values,\" Pillen said. \"Our kids already face too many threats from Big Tech and the obscene content industry. Having one fewer outlet trying to sexualize their childhood is a good thing for their futures and a good thing for Nebraska.\"\n\nTop Journal Star photos for June 2024\n\nReach the writer at 402-473-7223 or awegley@journalstar.com.

I have no idea what purpose having access to a phone during class even fulfills except to allow students to text their friends who are playing hooky.\n\nNewsom also wants social media platforms to display warning labels. In his book, Haidt goes further. He wants social media companies to restrict the age of their users. Age restricting is possible, but doing so would run up against the problem that Pornhub is experiencing in a growing number of states that require age verification. Users have to provide private information to be age-verified. Teenagers might think little of handing over their personal information in exchange for access to Instagram, but Pornhub users don't want their names associated with that website.\n\nSo, instead of complying with age verification laws, Pornhub is simply leaving the states that enact these laws. In July, they will leave five more states: Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, and Nebraska. The company has already left Texas, Arkansas, Mississippi, Montana, North Carolina, Utah, and Virginia. I doubt that it's difficult to work around these restrictions with VPNs, but Pornhub claims that users are just going to deeper, darker, and less moderated sites.\n\nI have no idea if that's true or not. I also have a kneejerk reaction to anything that feels like censorship, but I understand why parents wouldn't want their 10-year-olds surfing on Pornhub. Then again, that's what parental controls are for. But I suspect most teenagers are sophisticated enough to work around them. Then again, how do they do that, and what can I do to prevent it?\n\nAnd it's not just Pornhub that's the problem. Back to the dangers of social media we were talking about earlier: According to The Wall Street Journal, Instagram is serving sexual content to users who say they are 13 years old. This is not a case where a kid is lying about their age; it's an instance where Instagram doesn't care. Once a teenager stares at a woman in a bikini for half a second longer than they look at a cooking video, the algorithm will slowly start feeding the kid more and more sexual content until they're being recommended explicit material.\n\nPeople posing as 13-year-olds were receiving sexual content -- including \"video after video about anal sex\" -- as soon as three minutes after they created their Instagram accounts. That's not great! Maybe Governor Newsom should ban phones away from school, too.", "source": {"uri": "pajiba.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pajiba"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dustin_rowles@pajiba.com", "name": "Dustin

The law is set to go into effect July 1.\n\nThe law was first signed by Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb in March and lays out the verification needed by users to access the porn website's material. In addition, the law gives the state's Republican attorney general, and other people, the power to sue the websites if minors can access \"harmful\" material.\n\n\"Would you be OK with a child, walking, physically walking, into an adult novelty store, where there's magazines, videos, toys? No,\" Rokita said Thursday. \"You'd at least, if it was questionable, ask for an ID, so why is it any different online?\"\n\nOn June 11, Pornhub's parent company, Aylo, filed a lawsuit aimed at blocking the law. The lawsuit argues the state law interferes with free speech and constitutional rights by violating the 1996 Communications Decency Act.\n\nAylo then announced they would block access to Pornhub in Indiana, claiming they do not take issue with performing age-verification protocol for users, but take issue with the amount of personal information the state wants to require from users.\n\n\"Any regulations that require hundreds of thousands of adult sites to collect significant amounts of highly sensitive personal information is putting user safety in jeopardy,\" part of Aylo's statement to News 8 said. \"Moreover, as experience has demonstrated, unless properly enforced, users will simply access non-compliant sites or find other methods of evading these laws.\"\n\nRokita spoke directly to privacy concerns, saying the law requires porn websites to destroy confidential user material.\n\n\"The General Assembly considered this, and they put the onus on your favorite adult website that you want to go to to erase your data,\" Rokita said.\n\nTo ensure this happens, he will have enforcement authority over that destruction.\n\n\"I think that these porn sites don't want to take the risk of having a data breach,\" Rokita said.\n\nIn addition to his enforcing power, the law gives people the right to take legal action against the site if their private information is compromised.\n\nAylo says the fear of private information leaking simply drives users to different, perhaps more dangerous, sites.\n\n\"These people did not stop looking for porn,\" Aylo's statement said. \"They just migrated to darker corners of the internet that don't ask users to verify age, that don't follow the law, that don't take user safety seriously, and that often don't even moderate content. In practice, the laws have just made the internet more dangerous for adults and children.\"\n\nSimilar laws are in effect in Louisiana, where Aylo has seen this scenario play out. A Texas law is also in effect while the U.S. Supreme Court weighs an appeal from the same free speech group suing in the Indiana lawsuit.\n\nA judge will hear arguments on Monday on whether to allow the law to go into effect July 1, or issue an injunction.\n\nRokita said he plans to defend the law, claiming the porn sites do not want to pay for the correct verification process.\n\n\"What this comes down to is that they don't want to spend the money to protect kids,\" Rokita said. \"Because of that, they are part of the problem, they are part of the problem for why our kids are so corrupted.\"", "source": {"uri": "wishtv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WISH-TV | Indianapolis News | Indiana Weather | Indiana Traffic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kyla_russell@wishtv.com", "name": "Kyla Russell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Rokita", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Todd Rokita"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornhub", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pornhub"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Holcomb", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eric Holcomb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minor (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attorney general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_General_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey General Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_Decency_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Communications Decency Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_right", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitutional right"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injunction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Injunction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 38}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://www.wishtv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/PornHub.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666213", "eventUri": "eng-9666213", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 210, "textEnd": 216, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-11", "textStart": 779, "textEnd": 786}], "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

It's a really nice opportunity,\" he said.\n\n\"It's going to be a big ride tomorrow.\"\n\nIt is the first time Australia have held men's the team pursuit world record in five years and O'Brien said they can go faster, with the record likely to topple again in the final.\n\n\"The plan was just to get the job done, really. Ultimately the goal is to win on the third ... the world record is a massive bonus for us,\" he said.\n\nThe Australian team sprinters recovered from a poor round-one heat ride earlier on Tuesday night that cost them a shot at gold, switching all three riders positions and riding a time that was faster than the silver-medal-winning British trio.\n\nThe Dutch broke their own world record in the final, becoming the first team to go under 41 seconds with their 40.949.\n\nBritain clocked 41.814 and Australia silenced the parochial home crowd with 41.597 to easily beat France in their medal ride-off.\n\nIt is Glaetzer's first medal at his fourth Olympics.\n\n\"It was elation - I was so pumped when I saw that 'three' ... on the scoreboard,\" Glaetzer said.\n\n\"It's very special to finally win an Olympic medal. We were definitely aiming for better - we felt like we could have been in the gold (ride-off).\"\n\nThe bronze and the guarantee of a podium in the men's team pursuit also means Australia has gone better already than the disastrous Tokyo track campaign.\n\nThat was most notable for Alex Porter's snapped handlebar in men's team pursuit qualifying. They recovered to win bronze, the only track medal at the last Olympics.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, Australia set a national record in qualifying sixth-fastest for the women's team pursuit.\n\nThe women's team sprint also featured a world record on Monday and this velodrome is living up to its reputation as a fast track.\n\n\"It's probably the complete opposite of the Olympic pool,\" O'Brien said.\n\nThe British, led by Ethan Hayter, are undoubtedly plotting an team pursuit final ambush. It was notable that while the Australians spoke to the media after their world record, the British riders were ushered past the mixed zone without a word.\n\n\"It's classic Aussie-British, isn't it? It's really exciting,\" said British sprint icon Jason Kenny, now one of their coaches.\n\n\"I don't what the Aussies were expecting, but we were surprised by what they did here.\"", "source": {"uri":

It's a really nice opportunity,\" he said.\n\n\"It's going to be a big ride tomorrow.\"\n\nIt is the first time Australia have held men's the team pursuit world record in five years and O'Brien said they can go faster, with the record likely to topple again in the final.\n\n\"The plan was just to get the job done, really. Ultimately the goal is to win on the third ... the world record is a massive bonus for us,\" he said.\n\nThe Australian team sprinters recovered from a poor round-one heat ride earlier on Tuesday night that cost them a shot at gold, switching all three riders positions and riding a time that was faster than the silver-medal-winning British trio.\n\nThe Dutch broke their own world record in the final, becoming the first team to go under 41 seconds with their 40.949.\n\nBritain clocked 41.814 and Australia silenced the parochial home crowd with 41.597 to easily beat France in their medal ride-off.\n\nIt is Glaetzer's first medal at his fourth Olympics.\n\n\"It was elation - I was so pumped when I saw that 'three' ... on the scoreboard,\" Glaetzer said.\n\n\"It's very special to finally win an Olympic medal. We were definitely aiming for better - we felt like we could have been in the gold (ride-off).\"\n\nThe bronze and the guarantee of a podium in the men's team pursuit also means Australia has gone better already than the disastrous Tokyo track campaign.\n\nThat was most notable for Alex Porter's snapped handlebar in men's team pursuit qualifying. They recovered to win bronze, the only track medal at the last Olympics.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, Australia set a national record in qualifying sixth-fastest for the women's team pursuit.\n\nThe women's team sprint also featured a world record on Monday and this velodrome is living up to its reputation as a fast track.\n\n\"It's probably the complete opposite of the Olympic pool,\" O'Brien said.\n\nThe British, led by Ethan Hayter, are undoubtedly plotting an team pursuit final ambush. It was notable that while the Australians spoke to the media after their world record, the British riders were ushered past the mixed zone without a word.\n\n\"It's classic Aussie-British, isn't it? It's really exciting,\" said British sprint icon Jason Kenny, now one of their coaches.\n\n\"I don't what the Aussies were expecting, but we were surprised by what they did here.\"\n\nGet the latest

Montigny-Le- The American women's pursuit team had twice before raced for the Olympic gold medal, and it had been on the podium all three times the event had been on the program for the Summer Games.\n\nMontigny-Le-Bretonneux (France), Aug 8 (AP) The American women's pursuit team had twice before raced for the Olympic gold medal, and it had been on the podium all three times the event had been on the program for the Summer Games.\n\nSuccessful, to be sure, but also disappointing, because it had never been the top step.\n\nAlso Read | Vinesh Phogat Announces Retirement From Wrestling After Paris Olympics 2024 Disqualification.\n\nOn a steamy Wednesday night at the Olympic velodrome, road race champion Kristen Faulkner, time trial bronze medalist Chloe Dygert, Jennifer Valente and Lilly Williams finally took that last step up. They soared to a big early lead on New Zealand in their head-to-head showdown, then held on through a ragged finish to finally win the gold medal at the Paris Games.\n\n\"We knew we had a strong team coming in,\" Faulkner said with a smile, \"and I feel like the lucky one, because they have won medals before on the track and I haven't. I just wanted to live up to their expectations.\"\n\nAlso Read | Vinesh Phogat Appeals to CAS over Disqualification from Women's 50 Kg Final at Paris Olympics 2024.\n\nDid she ever. Faulkner's relatively recent addition to the squad might have made the difference.\n\n\"It's pretty surreal,\" Williams added. \"I do not think anybody expected this.\"\n\nThe Americans led by more than a second a quarter of the way through the 4,000-meter race, and they stretched the gap at one point to nearly two seconds. When they began to come apart from their single-file, aerodynamic draft with about two laps to go, they had to fight to the finish to hold off Ally Wollaston, Bryony Botha, Emily Shearman and Nicole Shields.\n\n\"There's just a lot of support for this program,\" said Dygert, who has been part of the past three U.S. Olympic pursuit teams, \"and we've been able to bring in really strong riders, and now we were finally able to pull it off.\"\n\nIn the race for bronze, the British team of Elinor Barker, Josie Knight, Anna Morris and Jessica Roberts pulled back more than a second from Italy over the last half of its race to land on the podium for the fourth straight Summer Games.\n\nIn the finals of the men's pursuit, Sam Welsford, Oliver Bleddyn, Conor Leahy and Kelland O'Brien of Australia beat Britain in a close final at the V\u00e9lodrome National de Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines to win gold for the first time in two decades.\n\n\"I think it is a fair way away from sinking in,\" O'Brien said.\n\nThe American women's pursuit program had been chasing gold ever since the 2012 London Games, when it finished second to Britain. It lost a rematch four years later in Rio de Janeiro, and then in Tokyo, the U.S. had to beat Canada for bronze.\n\nThe Americans came to the velodrome outside of Paris with cautious optimism, though, buoyed by a lineup that already had a pair of medals. Dygert picked herself up from a crash and rallied through the rain to capture time trial bronze, and last weekend, Faulkner attacked in the closing kilometers to win the Americans' first Olympic road race in 40 years.\n\nAfter its qualifying time pit the U.S. against Britain in the semifinals, the quartet built a nearly half-second lead on its rival by the midway point of the race, and Dygert went to the front for the final lap to bring it home.\n\nThen it was New Zealand's turn, and the top qualifier brushed aside the Italians in their semifinal by nearly three seconds.\n\nIn the finals, the Americans showed that they were the class of the Paris Games.\n\n\"This has been meticulously put together for over a year, year after year,\" said Valente, who now will team with Williams in the Madison later in the track cycling program before defending her Olympic title in the multidiscipline omnium.\n\n\"I've been part of this pursuit program for a long time, with a lot of different riders,\" Valente said, \"and to be able to pull together a really strong ride, and have it actually pay off -- it's just a really special moment.\"\n\nIn the men's pursuit, Australia roared through qualifying and then took out Olympic champion Italy in the semifinals, setting a world record in the process. Then against Britain, the two teams were separated by less than two-tenths of a second for almost the entire distance, before Daniel Bigham, Ethan Hayter, Charlie Tanfield and Oliver Wood had a problem near the end.\n\nThe Australians were able to cruise to gold, while Britain took silver after a disappointing seventh at the Tokyo Games.\n\n\"It's pretty crazy to call ourselves Olympic champions,\" Welsford said. \"We probably did not have these expectations when we started training together. To come together like we did in the last month was pretty special.\"\n\nThe bronze went to the Italians of Simone Consonni, Filippo Ganna, Francesco Lamon and Jonathan Milan, who rallied in the last 1,000 meters as the Danish team of Tobias Hansen, Niklas Larsen, Carl-Frederik Bevort and Rasmus Pedersen fell apart.\n\n\"We didn't expect the level (to be) so high in these Olympic Games,\" Lamon said.\n\nEarlier on the third day of Olympic track cycling, the men's sprint started with qualifying through a 200-meter flying lap, where riders spend roughly two laps getting up to speed and then cover that distance as quickly as possible.\n\nOn a blazing fast, hot track where records are falling more quickly than medals are being awarded, the world record fell twice. Matthew Richardson of Australia snatched it away from reigning Olympic champion Harrie Lavreysen in 9.091 seconds, only for the Dutch rider -- fresh off his team sprint gold a night earlier -- to claim it back in 9.088 a few minutes later.

beaten fierce rivals Great Britain to win the men's team pursuit gold medal in Olympic track cycling.\n\nIt is Australia's 17th gold medal at the Paris Games.\n\nThe combination of Olympic medallists Sam Welsford and Kelland O'Brien, plus debutants Oliver Bleddyn and Conor Leahy, clocked three minutes 42.067 seconds to win Wednesday night's decider.\n\nIt was a pulsating final, but two of the British riders touched wheels on the last lap and nearly crashed, blowing out the margin as Ethan Hayter, Daniel Bigham, Charlie Tanfield and Oliver Wood clocked 3:44.394.\n\nAustralia broke the world record in Tuesday's first round at the Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines velodrome outside Paris with 3:40.730 after also qualifying fastest.\n\nThe Australian quartet was behind at 1km, but only by .007 of a second, and led for much of the rest of the race.\n\nThis is Australia's first gold medal in Olympic track cycling since Anna Meares, now the team chef de mission, beat her British rival Victoria Pendleton in the sprint at the 2012 London Games.\n\nThe Australian cycling campaign in Paris now boasts three gold medals, the first time they have had multiple Olympic titles since Athens.\n\nIt is also a massive turnaround from Tokyo, when the men's team pursuit bronze was the worst Australian haul at the Olympic velodrome since Moscow 1980.\n\nThe abiding moment of the disastrous track campaign in Tokyo was Alex Porter face-planting at 60km/h in men's team pursuit qualifying when his handlebar snapped off.", "source": {"uri": "au.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

They soared to a big early lead on New Zealand in their head-to-head showdown, then held on through a ragged finish to finally win the gold medal at the Paris Games.\n\n\"We knew we had a strong team coming in,\" Faulkner said with a smile, \"and I feel like the lucky one, because they have won medals before on the track and I haven't. I just wanted to live up to their expectations.\"\n\nDid she ever. Faulkner's relatively recent addition to the squad might have made the difference.\n\n\"It's pretty surreal,\" Williams added. \"I do not think anybody expected this.\"\n\nThe Americans led by more than a second a quarter of the way through the 4,000-meter race, and they stretched the gap at one point to nearly two seconds. When they began to come apart from their single-file, aerodynamic draft with about two laps to go, they had to fight to the finish to hold off Ally Wollaston, Bryony Botha, Emily Shearman and Nicole Shields.\n\n\"There's just a lot of support for this program,\" said Dygert, who has been part of the past three U.S. Olympic pursuit teams, \"and we've been able to bring in really strong riders, and now we were finally able to pull it off.\"\n\nIn the race for bronze, the British team of Elinor Barker, Josie Knight, Anna Morris and Jessica Roberts pulled back more than a second from Italy over the last half of its race to land on the podium for the fourth straight Summer Games.\n\nIn the finals of the men's pursuit, Sam Welsford, Oliver Bleddyn, Conor Leahy and Kelland O'Brien of Australia beat Britain in a close final at the V\u00e9lodrome National de Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines to win gold for the first time in two decades.\n\n\"I think it is a fair way away from sinking in,\" O'Brien said.\n\nThe American women's pursuit program had been chasing gold ever since the 2012 London Games, when it finished second to Britain. It lost a rematch four years later in Rio de Janeiro, and then in Tokyo, the U.S. had to beat Canada for bronze.\n\nThe Americans came to the velodrome outside of Paris with cautious optimism, though, buoyed by a lineup that already had a pair of medals. Dygert picked herself up from a crash and rallied through the rain to capture time trial bronze, and last weekend, Faulkner attacked in the closing kilometers to win the Americans' first Olympic road race in 40 years.\n\nAfter its qualifying time pit the U.S. against Britain in the semifinals, the quartet built a nearly half-second lead on its rival by the midway point of the race, and Dygert went to the front for the final lap to bring it home.\n\nThen it was New Zealand's turn, and the top qualifier brushed aside the Italians in their semifinal by nearly three seconds.\n\nIn the finals, the Americans showed that they were the class of the Paris Games.\n\n\"This has been meticulously put together for over a year, year after year,\" said Valente, who now will team with Williams in the Madison later in the track cycling program before defending her Olympic title in the multidiscipline omnium.\n\n\"I've been part of this pursuit program for a long time, with a lot of different riders,\" Valente said, \"and to be able to pull together a really strong ride, and have it actually pay off -- it's just a really special moment.\"\n\nIn the men's pursuit, Australia roared through qualifying and then took out Olympic champion Italy in the semifinals, setting a world record in the process. Then against Britain, the two teams were separated by less than two-tenths of a second for almost the entire distance, before Daniel Bigham, Ethan Hayter, Charlie Tanfield and Oliver Wood had a problem near the end.\n\nThe Australians were able to cruise to gold, while Britain took silver after a disappointing seventh at the Tokyo Games.\n\n\"It's pretty crazy to call ourselves Olympic champions,\" Welsford said. \"We probably did not have these expectations when we started training together. To come together like we did in the last month was pretty special.\"\n\nThe bronze went to the Italians of Simone Consonni, Filippo Ganna, Francesco Lamon and Jonathan Milan, who rallied in the last 1,000 meters as the Danish team of Tobias Hansen, Niklas Larsen, Carl-Frederik Bevort and Rasmus Pedersen fell apart.\n\n\"We didn't expect the level (to be) so high in these Olympic Games,\" Lamon said.\n\nEarlier on the third day of Olympic track cycling, the men's sprint started with qualifying through a 200-meter flying lap, where riders spend roughly two laps getting up to speed and then cover that distance as quickly as possible.\n\nOn a blazing fast, hot track where records are falling more quickly than medals are being awarded, the world record fell twice. Matthew Richardson of Australia snatched it away from reigning Olympic champion Harrie Lavreysen in 9.091 seconds, only for the Dutch rider -- fresh off his team sprint gold a night earlier -- to claim it back in 9.088 a few minutes later.\n\nLavreysen and Richardson were among the favorites to cruise into the quarterfinals Thursday night.\n\nThe women's keirin, where six riders spend three laps paced behind a motorized bike called a derny before getting turned loose to sprint for three laps, also began with New Zealand favorite Ellesse Andrews, German stars Lea Friedrich and Emma Hinze, and British standout Emma Finucane getting through their opening heats without a problem.\n\nThe medals in the women's keirin along with the men's multidiscipline omnium will be decided Thursday night.\n\n\"It will be a bit the same as in other championships -- fast-paced and the big guns will be there,\" said Fabio van den Bossche of Belgium. \"There will be many candidates for the podium.\"\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri":

They soared to a big early lead on New Zealand in their head-to-head showdown, then held on through a ragged finish to finally win the gold medal at the Paris Games.\"We knew we had a strong team coming in,\" Faulkner said with a smile, \"and I feel like the lucky one, because they have won medals before on the track and I haven't. I just wanted to live up to their expectations.\"Did she ever. Faulkner's relatively recent addition to the squad might have made the difference.\"It's pretty surreal,\" Williams added. \"I do not think anybody expected this.\"The Americans led by more than a second a quarter of the way through the 4,000-meter race, and they stretched the gap at one point to nearly two seconds. When they began to come apart from their single-file, aerodynamic draft with about two laps to go, they had to fight to the finish to hold off Ally Wollaston, Bryony Botha, Emily Shearman and Nicole Shields.\"There's just a lot of support for this program,\" said Dygert, who has been part of the past three U.S. Olympic pursuit teams, \"and we've been able to bring in really strong riders, and now we were finally able to pull it off.\"In the race for bronze, the British team of Elinor Barker, Josie Knight, Anna Morris and Jessica Roberts pulled back more than a second from Italy over the last half of its race to land on the podium for the fourth straight Summer Games.In the finals of the men's pursuit, Sam Welsford, Oliver Bleddyn, Conor Leahy and Kelland O'Brien of Australia beat Britain in a close final at the V\u00e9lodrome National de Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines to win gold for the first time in two decades.\"I think it is a fair way away from sinking in,\" O'Brien said.The American women's pursuit program had been chasing gold ever since the 2012 London Games, when it finished second to Britain. It lost a rematch four years later in Rio de Janeiro, and then in Tokyo, the U.S. had to beat Canada for bronze.The Americans came to the velodrome outside of Paris with cautious optimism, though, buoyed by a lineup that already had a pair of medals. Dygert picked herself up from a crash and rallied through the rain to capture time trial bronze, and last weekend, Faulkner attacked in the closing kilometers to win the Americans' first Olympic road race in 40 years.After its qualifying time pit the U.S. against Britain in the semifinals, the quartet built a nearly half-second lead on its rival by the midway point of the race, and Dygert went to the front for the final lap to bring it home.Then it was New Zealand's turn, and the top qualifier brushed aside the Italians in their semifinal by nearly three seconds.In the finals, the Americans showed that they were the class of the Paris Games.\"This has been meticulously put together for over a year, year after year,\" said Valente, who now will team with Williams in the Madison later in the track cycling program before defending her Olympic title in the multidiscipline omnium.\"I've been part of this pursuit program for a long time, with a lot of different riders,\" Valente said, \"and to be able to pull together a really strong ride, and have it actually pay off -- it's just a really special moment.\"In the men's pursuit, Australia roared through qualifying and then took out Olympic champion Italy in the semifinals, setting a world record in the process. Then against Britain, the two teams were separated by less than two-tenths of a second for almost the entire distance, before Daniel Bigham, Ethan Hayter, Charlie Tanfield and Oliver Wood had a problem near the end.The Australians were able to cruise to gold, while Britain took silver after a disappointing seventh at the Tokyo Games.\"It's pretty crazy to call ourselves Olympic champions,\" Welsford said. \"We probably did not have these expectations when we started training together. To come together like we did in the last month was pretty special.\"The bronze went to the Italians of Simone Consonni, Filippo Ganna, Francesco Lamon and Jonathan Milan, who rallied in the last 1,000 meters as the Danish team of Tobias Hansen, Niklas Larsen, Carl-Frederik Bevort and Rasmus Pedersen fell apart.\"We didn't expect the level (to be) so high in these Olympic Games,\" Lamon said.Earlier on the third day of Olympic track cycling, the men's sprint started with qualifying through a 200-meter flying lap, where riders spend roughly two laps getting up to speed and then cover that distance as quickly as possible.On a blazing fast, hot track where records are falling more quickly than medals are being awarded, the world record fell twice. Matthew Richardson of Australia snatched it away from reigning Olympic champion Harrie Lavreysen in 9.091 seconds, only for the Dutch rider -- fresh off his team sprint gold a night earlier -- to claim it back in 9.088 a few minutes later.Lavreysen and Richardson were among the favorites to cruise into the quarterfinals Thursday night.The women's keirin, where six riders spend three laps paced behind a motorized bike called a derny before getting turned loose to sprint for three laps, also began with New Zealand favorite Ellesse Andrews, German stars Lea Friedrich and Emma Hinze, and British standout Emma Finucane getting through their opening heats without a problem.The medals in the women's keirin along with the men's multidiscipline omnium will be decided Thursday night.\"It will be a bit the same as in other championships -- fast-paced and the big guns will be there,\" said Fabio van den Bossche of Belgium. \"There will be many candidates for the podium.\"\n\nThe American women's pursuit team had twice before raced for the Olympic gold medal, and it had been on the podium all three times the event had been on the program for the Summer Games.\n\nSuccessful, to be sure, but also disappointing, because it had never been the top step.\n\nOn a steamy Wednesday night at the Olympic Velodrome, road race champion Kristen Faulkner, time trial bronze medalist Chloe Dygert, Jennifer Valente and Lilly Williams finally took that last step up.

They soared to a big early lead on New Zealand in their head-to-head showdown, then held on through a ragged finish to finally win the gold medal at the Paris Games.\n\n\"We knew we had a strong team coming in,\" Faulkner said with a smile, \"and I feel like the lucky one, because they have won medals before on the track and I haven't. I just wanted to live up to their expectations.\"\n\nDid she ever. Faulkner's relatively recent addition to the squad might have made the difference.\n\n\"It's pretty surreal,\" Williams added. \"I do not think anybody expected this.\"\n\nThe Americans led by more than a second a quarter of the way through the 4,000-meter race, and they stretched the gap at one point to nearly two seconds. When they began to come apart from their single-file, aerodynamic draft with about two laps to go, they had to fight to the finish to hold off Ally Wollaston, Bryony Botha, Emily Shearman and Nicole Shields.\n\n\"There's just a lot of support for this program,\" said Dygert, who has been part of the past three U.S. Olympic pursuit teams, \"and we've been able to bring in really strong riders, and now we were finally able to pull it off.\"\n\nIn the race for bronze, the British team of Elinor Barker, Josie Knight, Anna Morris and Jessica Roberts pulled back more than a second from Italy over the last half of its race to land on the podium for the fourth straight Summer Games.\n\nIn the finals of the men's pursuit, Sam Welsford, Oliver Bleddyn, Conor Leahy and Kelland O'Brien of Australia beat Britain in a close final at the V\u00e9lodrome National de Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines to win gold for the first time in two decades.\n\n\"I think it is a fair way away from sinking in,\" O'Brien said.\n\nThe American women's pursuit program had been chasing gold ever since the 2012 London Games, when it finished second to Britain. It lost a rematch four years later in Rio de Janeiro, and then in Tokyo, the U.S. had to beat Canada for bronze.\n\nThe Americans came to the velodrome outside of Paris with cautious optimism, though, buoyed by a lineup that already had a pair of medals. Dygert picked herself up from a crash and rallied through the rain to capture time trial bronze, and last weekend, Faulkner attacked in the closing kilometers to win the Americans' first Olympic road race in 40 years.\n\nAfter its qualifying time pit the U.S. against Britain in the semifinals, the quartet built a nearly half-second lead on its rival by the midway point of the race, and Dygert went to the front for the final lap to bring it home.\n\nThen it was New Zealand's turn, and the top qualifier brushed aside the Italians in their semifinal by nearly three seconds.\n\nIn the finals, the Americans showed that they were the class of the Paris Games.\n\n\"This has been meticulously put together for over a year, year after year,\" said Valente, who now will team with Williams in the Madison later in the track cycling program before defending her Olympic title in the multidiscipline omnium.\n\n\"I've been part of this pursuit program for a long time, with a lot of different riders,\" Valente said, \"and to be able to pull together a really strong ride, and have it actually pay off - it's just a really special moment.\"\n\nIn the men's pursuit, Australia roared through qualifying and then took out Olympic champion Italy in the semifinals, setting a world record in the process. Then against Britain, the two teams were separated by less than two-tenths of a second for almost the entire distance, before Daniel Bigham, Ethan Hayter, Charlie Tanfield and Oliver Wood had a problem near the end.\n\nThe Australians were able to cruise to gold, while Britain took silver after a disappointing seventh at the Tokyo Games.\n\n\"It's pretty crazy to call ourselves Olympic champions,\" Welsford said. \"We probably did not have these expectations when we started training together. To come together like we did in the last month was pretty special.\"\n\nThe bronze went to the Italians of Simone Consonni, Filippo Ganna, Francesco Lamon and Jonathan Milan, who rallied in the last 1,000 meters as the Danish team of Tobias Hansen, Niklas Larsen, Carl-Frederik Bevort and Rasmus Pedersen fell apart.\n\n\"We didn't expect the level [to be] so high in these Olympic Games,\" Lamon said.\n\nEarlier on the third day of Olympic track cycling, the men's sprint started with qualifying through a 200-meter flying lap, where riders spend roughly two laps getting up to speed and then cover that distance as quickly as possible.\n\nOn a blazing fast, hot track where records are falling more quickly than medals are being awarded, the world record fell twice. Matthew Richardson of Australia snatched it away from reigning Olympic champion Harrie Lavreysen in 9.091 seconds, only for the Dutch rider -- fresh off his team sprint gold a night earlier - to claim it back in 9.088 a few minutes later.\n\nLavreysen and Richardson were among the favorites to cruise into the quarterfinals Thursday night.\n\nThe women's keirin, where six riders spend three laps paced behind a motorized bike called a derny before getting turned loose to sprint for three laps, also began with New Zealand favorite Ellesse Andrews, German stars Lea Friedrich and Emma Hinze, and British standout Emma Finucane getting through their opening heats without a problem.\n\nThe medals in the women's keirin along with the men's multidiscipline omnium will be decided Thursday night.\n\n\"It will be a bit the same as in other championships -- fast-paced and the big guns will be there,\" said Fabio van den Bossche of Belgium. \"There will be many candidates for the podium.\"", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5,

When Great Britain beat Australia to gold at the 2016 Rio Olympics, the British set a new world record in the final: 3:50.265. But in just eight years, that mark has dropped precipitously.\n\nAustralia took the mark down to 3.49 at the 2018 Commonwealth Games and then shaved off another second at the 2019 world championships. Then Denmark and Italy arrived on the scene. At the 2020 world titles, the Danish team pursuit squad set three new world records in consecutive nights - ending the event with a new best-time of 3:44.6.\n\nThe Danes were considered the team to beat in Tokyo, only to find themselves upstaged by Italy - who twice broke the world record on their way to gold, moving the mark to 3:42.032. Denmark got revenge at the last edition of the world championships, beating Italy to gold.\n\nAll of which meant that heading into Paris, Olympic champions Italy, world champions Denmark and perennial track contenders Great Britain (who had been relegated at the last Games due to an incident in their race with Denmark) were considered the teams to beat. Not Australia.\n\nIn a recent interview with Guardian Australia, team coach Tim Decker admitted as much. \"It's a tough rebuild from [Tokyo],\" he said. \"But not impossible. As Australians we don't shy away from being underdogs.\"\n\nThe Australians are no longer underdogs. That changed over two quick-fire evenings at the Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines Velodrome. On Monday, the Australian squad of Oliver Bleddyn, Sam Welsford, Conor Leahy and Kelland O'Brien, surprised the field to qualify fastest, in a time of 3:42.958 - barely a second away from the world record. Just 24 hours later, in Australia's first round encounter with Italy, the team not only set a new world record, but smashed the old one - finishing in a time of 3:40.730.\n\nIt has been five years since Australia were world champions in the men's team pursuit. It has been two decades since the Australians were last Olympic gold medallists in the discipline, at Athens 2004.\n\nAnd so on Wednesday evening at the velodrome, Australia will race long-time track rivals Great Britain for gold (the British qualified in 3:42.151). The two nations have history in the team pursuit. Britain beat Australia for gold at consecutive Olympics, in 2012 and 2016, before Australia got the edge at the 2018 Commonwealth Games and 2019 world championships.\n\nUntil the recent dominance of continental European nations, Australia and Britain were for a long time considered to have the two leading track cycling programs. AusCycling even poached a former British Cycling staff member to rebuild the Australian program after a disappointing campaign in Rio.\n\nWhatever the outcome on Wednesday, the new world record mark is an astounding achievement. For decades, the four minute barrier was seen as impregnable. It was not until the Sydney 2000 Olympics, when the Germans went three-tenths of a second under that mark, that sub-four minute team pursuits were suddenly possible. In the 24 years that have followed, the limits of what is possible have repeatedly been tested. With Australia now in the 3.40s, it is surely only a matter of time until a nation enters 3.39 territory. Could it even come in the final?\n\nPerhaps this was always inevitable, as track cycling has become an arms race between well-funded national teams and dedicated equipment manufacturers (Australia's track bike retails at nearly $100,000 - although that is largely to comply with rules that require equipment to be commercially available, without allowing other teams to take advantage of the national team's hard work). But for Australia to leapfrog the Danes and Italians, and establish themselves at the forefront of team pursuit again is particularly impressive, only three years on from an ultimately disappointing campaign for the wider track team.\n\nIt promises to be a thrilling race. Great Britain were world champions on this very track two years ago. Australia's time in qualifying and the first round have been a cut above anyone else. If the Australians can return to the top of the Olympic team pursuit podium 20 years after they were last there, it would suggest that following a period in the wilderness, Australian track cycling is very much back.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kieran_pender@theguardian.com", "name": "Kieran Pender", "type": "author",

Great Britain have fumbled at the last moment! Australia are going to win gold!\" Scott McGrory said on commentary for Nine.\n\n\"Really unfortunate for Great Britain to see what happened there. They were neck and neck with the Australians, but a broken bicycle I think it was for the Brits.\n\n\"But it's a gold for Australia.\"\n\nThe Aussies, it seems, surprised everyone except themselves to win the gold medal, gaining sweet redemption over the Brits.\n\nSam Welsford, Kelland O'Brien, Conor Leahy and Oliver Bleddyn won a pulsating, dramatic final at the Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines velodrome outside Paris.\n\nIt comes three years after Alex Porter's horrific face plant in qualifying, when his handlebar snapped off, meant Australia had to settle for bronze at the Tokyo Games.\n\nAustralia's gold is the first in the event for 20 years and comes after losing the gold medal ride to the British at London and Rio.\n\nIt is also Australia's first gold medal in track cycling since Anna Meares, now the team chef de mission, beat her British rival Victoria Pendleton in the sprint final at London.\n\nAustralia also broke the world record in Tuesday's opening round, surprising their rivals.\n\n\"I knew we were in a good spot, obviously breaking the world record yesterday, and it was actually really nice ... being the underdogs,\" Welsford said.\n\n\"A lot of people underestimated what we can do and we used that to our advantage. We all knew we had it in us.\"\n\nWelsford now has the team pursuit medal set, after silver in Rio and bronze in Tokyo.\n\nGiven Australia surprised their rivals, long-time coach Tim Decker was asked if they surprised themselves.\n\nIt was the only time the smile left Decker's face in the wake of their triumph.\n\n\"No. Never. People forget Tokyo and what happened ... we were a very, very strong team there and we got a bronze medal probably with our third-best lineup,\" Decker said, with emphasis.\n\n\"The resilience these boys showed in Tokyo and to actually move forward from that and come back and make this happen, is really high-level history in cycling.\n\n\"We've been to hell and back and for them to make this happen, has been amazing.\"\n\nAfter Australia showed technical perfection to lower the world record to three minutes 40.730 seconds on Tuesday, the final was an old-fashioned dog fight and team pursuiting at its finest.\n\nIt nearly ended in disaster for the British, with designated finisher Ethan Hayter somehow keeping his bike upright without bringing down his teammates when he slipped in his saddle on the final lap.\n\nHayter, Daniel Bigham, Charlie Tanfield and Oliver Wood trailled Australia by two tenths of a second at the start of the last lap and Hayter's mishap blew out the margin.\n\nAustralia clocked 3:42.067 and won by more than two seconds. Italy beat Denmark for the bronze.\n\nBigham revealed post-race that their warmup song is Australian -- Men At Work's Down Under -- and that the winners caught them off-guard.\n\n\"I genuinely feel we underestimated what the Aussies would bring to the party. They have lifted it a huge amount and that cannot be denied - that's seriously impressive,\" he said.\n\nThe Australian cycling campaign in Paris now boasts three gold medals and two bronze, the second-best Olympics for the sport after the six gold at the Athens Games.\n\nIt is also a massive turnaround from Tokyo, especially on the track, when Porter's horrific crash came to symbolise their disastrous campaign.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, Australians Matthew Richardson and Leigh Hoffman made solid starts in the match sprint.\n\nRichardson was second-fastest in qualifying and Hoffman was fourth as Dutch ace Harrie Lavreyson rode a world record 9.088 seconds for the flying 200m.\n\nRichardson has progressed to the quarter-finals, but Hoffman lost his 1/8 round repechage heat and is out.\n\nKristina Clonan won her repechage heat to stay alive in the women's keirin, while Australia finished seventh in the women's team pursuit.\n\nThe United States, coached by Australian Gary

It was not that the endurance squad was considered weak - they had shown remarkable resilience to bounce back from a high-speed equipment malfunction to win a bronze medal in Tokyo. But in recent years, dominant nations on the track had stepped up - and the Australian team had not been able to follow.\n\nThe squad had finished fourth at consecutive world championships. In 2022, the team's qualifying time at the world titles - over 4,000 metres - was 3:50.344. Last year, the team was again above the three minute and 50 second mark.\n\nRelated: Olympic bronze for Australia's track cycling sprinters as pursuit team break world record\n\nThat time was competitive, ground-breaking even, two Olympic cycles ago.

But in just eight years, that mark has dropped precipitously.\n\nAustralia took the mark down to 3.49 at the 2018 Commonwealth Games and then shaved off another second at the 2019 world championships. Then Denmark and Italy arrived on the scene. At the 2020 world titles, the Danish team pursuit squad set three new world records in consecutive nights - ending the event with a new best-time of 3:44.6.\n\nThe Danes were considered the team to beat in Tokyo, only to find themselves upstaged by Italy - who twice broke the world record on their way to gold, moving the mark to 3:42.032. Denmark got revenge at the last edition of the world championships, beating Italy to gold.\n\nAll of which meant that heading into Paris, Olympic champions Italy, world champions Denmark and perennial track contenders Great Britain (who had been relegated at the last Games due to an incident in their race with Denmark) were considered the teams to beat. Not Australia.\n\nIn a recent interview with Guardian Australia, team coach Tim Decker admitted as much. \"It's a tough rebuild from [Tokyo],\" he said. \"But not impossible. As Australians we don't shy away from being underdogs.\"\n\nThe Australians are no longer underdogs. That changed over two quick-fire evenings at the Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines Velodrome. On Monday, the Australian squad of Oliver Bleddyn, Sam Welsford, Conor Leahy and Kelland O'Brien, surprised the field to qualify fastest, in a time of 3:42.958 - barely a second away from the world record. Just 24 hours later, in Australia's first round encounter with Italy, the team not only set a new world record, but smashed the old one - finishing in a time of 3:40.730.\n\nIt has been five years since Australia were world champions in the men's team pursuit. It has been two decades since the Australians were last Olympic gold medallists in the discipline, at Athens 2004.\n\nAnd so on Wednesday evening at the velodrome, Australia will race long-time track rivals Great Britain for gold (the British qualified in 3:42.151). The two nations have history in the team pursuit. Britain beat Australia for gold at consecutive Olympics, in 2012 and 2016, before Australia got the edge at the 2018 Commonwealth Games and 2019 world championships.\n\nUntil the recent dominance of continental European nations, Australia and Britain were for a long time considered to have the two leading track cycling programs.

It was not until the Sydney 2000 Olympics, when the Germans went three-tenths of a second under that mark, that sub-four minute team pursuits were suddenly possible. In the 24 years that have followed, the limits of what is possible have repeatedly been tested. With Australia now in the 3.40s, it is surely only a matter of time until a nation enters 3.39 territory. Could it even come in the final?\n\nRelated: Meet Tim Decker: the inspiring Australian cycling coach who took a hard road to Paris | Kieran Pender\n\nPerhaps this was always inevitable, as track cycling has become an arms race between well-funded national teams and dedicated equipment manufacturers (Australia's track bike retails at nearly $100,000 - although that is largely to comply with rules that require equipment to be commercially available, without allowing other teams to take advantage of the national team's hard work). But for Australia to leapfrog the Danes and Italians, and establish themselves at the forefront of team pursuit again is particularly impressive, only three years on from an ultimately disappointing campaign for the wider track team.\n\nIt promises to be a thrilling race. Great Britain were world champions on this very track two years ago. Australia's time in qualifying and the first round have been a cut above anyone else. If the Australians can return to the top of the Olympic team pursuit podium 20 years after they were last there, it would suggest that following a period in the wilderness, Australian track cycling is very much back.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_UCI_Track_Cycling_World_Championships_\u2013_Men's_team_pursuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "2016 UCI Track Cycling World Championships \u2013 Men's team pursuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Australia national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netball_at_the_2018_Commonwealth_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netball at the 2018 Commonwealth Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_pursuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Team pursuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velodrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Velodrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_cycling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Track cycling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_Leahy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conor Leahy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Welsford", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Welsford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelland_O'Brien", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kelland O'Brien"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Athens"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Athens"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cycle sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Cycling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British Cycling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Europe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Continental Europe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Tent_Pegging", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Tent Pegging", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet/Image_Galleries", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet/Image Galleries", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/16392935aa2fa86d95f5b6c96dcc8fa7", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795726", "eventUri": "eng-9795726", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

But they began to come apart from their single-file, aerodynamic draft with about two laps to go, and they had to hang on to the finish to give their nation its first gold in the event after 12 years of close calls.\n\nAlly Wollaston, Bryony Botha, Emily Shearman and Nicole Shields were left with the silver medal for New Zealand.\n\nIn the race for bronze, the British team of Elinor Barker, Josie Knight, Anna Morris and Jessica Roberts pulled back more than a second from Italy over the last half of its race to land on the podium for the fourth straight Summer Games.\n\nIn the men's pursuit, Sam Welsford, Oliver Bleddyn, Conor Leahy and Kelland O'Brien of Australia beat Britain in a close final at the V\u00e9lodrome National de Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines to win the gold medal for the first time in two decades.\n\nThe American women's pursuit program similarly has been chasing gold ever since the 2012 London Games, when it finished second to Britain. It lost a rematch four years later in Rio de Janeiro, and then in Tokyo, the U.S. had to beat Canada for bronze.\n\nIt came to the velodrome outside of Paris with cautious optimism, though, buoyed by a lineup that already had a pair of medals. Dygert picked herself up from a crash and rallied through the rain to capture bronze in the time trial, and last weekend, Faulkner attacked in the closing kilometers to win the Americans' first Olympic road race in 40 years.\n\nAfter its qualifying time pit the U.S. against Britain in the semifinals, the quartet built a nearly half-second lead on its rival by the midway point of the 4,000-meter race, and Dygert went to the front for the final lap to bring it home.\n\nThen it was New Zealand's turn, and the top qualifier brushed aside the Italians in their semifinal by nearly three seconds.\n\nThe men's pursuit podium was destined for a shakeup after Australia roared through qualifying, then not only defeated Olympic champ Italy in their head-to-head match but snatched away its world record, finishing in 3:40.730 to make the finals.\n\nIts opponent was familiar: Britain. Its streak of three straight Olympic gold medals ended with a seventh-place letdown at the Tokyo Games, but the British had topped the world champions from Denmark to return to the gold-medal race.\n\nThe two teams were separated by less than two-tenths of a second for almost their entire distance, and the Aussies crossed the line in 3:42.067. The British squad of Daniel Bigham, Ethan Hayter, Charlie Tanfield and Oliver Wood had a problem near the end that cost it a couple of seconds, leaving it with the silver medal.\n\nThe bronze went to the Italians of Simone Consonni, Filippo Ganna, Francesco Lamon and Jonathan Milan, who rallied in the last 1,000 meters as the Danish team of Tobias Hansen, Niklas Larsen, Carl-Frederik Bevort and Rasmus Pedersen fell apart.\n\n\"We didn't expect the level (to be) so high in these Olympic Games,\" Lamon said. \"We worked in Italy very, very hard and very, very, well, with very good times, but when we arrived here it was not good enough for the gold.\"\n\nEarlier on the third day of Olympic track cycling, the men's sprint started with qualifying through a 200-meter flying lap, where riders spend roughly two laps getting up to speed and then cover that distance as quickly as possible.\n\nOn a blazing fast, hot track where records are falling more quickly than medals are being awarded, the world record fell twice. Matthew Richardson of Australia snatched it away from reigning Olympic champion Harrie Lavreysen in 9.091 seconds, only for the Dutch rider -- fresh off his team sprint gold a night earlier -- to claim it back in 9.088 a few minutes later.\n\nThe women's keirin, where six riders spend three laps paced behind a motorized bike called a derny before getting turned loose to sprint for three laps, also began with New Zealand favorite Ellesse Andrews, German stars Lea Friedrich and Emma Hinze, and British standout Emma Finucane getting through their opening heats without a problem.\n\nThe medals in the women's keirin along with the men's multidiscipline omnium will be decided Thursday night.\n\n\"It will be a bit the same as in other championships -- fast-paced and the big guns will be there,\" said Fabio van den Bossche of Belgium, pointing to Hayter, Aaron Gate of New Zealand and Olympic bronze medalist Elia Viviani of Italy as omnium favorites. \"There will be many candidates for the podium.\"\n\nDespite a disappointing crash in the time trial, Dygert took home bronze with a time of 41:10.70.", "source": {"uri": "denverpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Denver

They soared to a big early lead on New Zealand in their head-to-head showdown, then held on through a ragged finish to finally win the gold medal at the Paris Games.\n\n\"We knew we had a strong team coming in,\" Faulkner said with a smile, \"and I feel like the lucky one, because they have won medals before on the track and I haven't. I just wanted to live up to their expectations.\"\n\nDid she ever.

It is a race where man and machine combine - with the aerodynamic benefits of equipment as closely scrutinised as individual training plans. It is a race where seconds are measured to the third decimal, to the single millisecond. And it is the race where, at long last, Australia are Olympic champions.\n\nBy the admission of their own coach, the Australian men's team pursuit squad arrived in Paris as underdogs. The nation's track cyclists have endured a turbulent two Olympic cycles, epitomised in Tokyo by the moment Alex Porter's handlebar snapped midway through qualifying in a freak accident. The team recovered to win the bronze medal - Australia's only medal on the track at the last Games - but the symbolism remained.\n\nOn Tuesday, it took only three minutes, 40 seconds and 73 milliseconds to rewrite that narrative and emphatically remove any underdog tag. The Australian squad of Sam Welsford, Conor Leahy, Kelland O'Brien and Oliver Bleddyn broke - no, smashed - Italy's world record from Tokyo. It suddenly made them favourites ahead of a gold medal ride against Great Britain.\n\nIt was to be a duel steeped in track history. Australia have not won the men's team pursuit since the 2004 Olympics in Athens, where an squad that would go on to become cycling greats - Graeme Brown, Brett Lancaster, Brad McGee and Luke Roberts - beat Team GB and a young Bradley Wiggins, in 3:58.233.\n\nThen the drought began. Four years later in Beijing, Australia raced for bronze - and lost. At London 2012, it was an Athens rematch: Great Britain against the Australians. But this time Team GB broke the world record on their way to win gold. It was d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu at Rio 2016: another golden world record for Britain and another silver medal for Australia.\n\nIn the two decades since 2004, the nations have met in six world championship finals. The Australians have won five. But when it mattered most, on the grand Olympic stage, Britain came out on top. Australia has also failed to reach a team pursuit final since their last world title in 2019.\n\nAnd so the track was set on Wednesday - history, narrative, sporting rivalry. \"The Aussies know how to race,\" cyclist Aaron Gate offered after New Zealand's preceding placing race. And so it proved.\n\nAs both nations began flying, the splits were infinitesimally small. Over the first kilometre, the lead swung back and forth. After a quarter of the race, the British led by seven milliseconds - all of 0.007. Australia took the lead soon thereafter, but the British did not back down. At the two and three kilometre marks, the teams were barely separated by more than one-tenth of a second. The Australians were ahead but with such small margins it was impossible to predict a winner. It shaped up as the closest Olympic team pursuit race in history.\n\nThen disaster hit the British. With one lap to go and a deficit of 0.160 seconds to make up, Britain's Ethan Hayter slipped off his saddle. It was unclear whether it was a technical issue or a rider error. Either way, the error would prevent any chance of a British resurgence. Australia finished in 3:42.067, almost on par with Italy's prior world record, but not quite a new best-mark - nor the sub-3.40 mark that suddenly seems in reach.\n\nThe emotion on the face of the riders said it all - this is a victory the Australian track cycling team has targeted for so long, yet all too often had come up short. It was particularly special for Sam Welsford, who won silver in Rio in the loss to Britain, and then bronze in Tokyo. The 28-year-old rounds out his collection with the shiniest medal of all.\n\nVictory in the men's team pursuit on Wednesday is Australia's first track cycling gold since 2012, when Anna Meares famously beat Britain's Victoria Pendleton in the sprint. It has been an unexpectedly long time between appearances on the podium's top step for Australia, an erstwhile track cycling heavyweight which has struggled to fire in recent years.\n\nThat will make the victory all the more special for Australia's endurance quartet and their coach, Tim Decker. Stood in the infield as the group prepared to battle for gold, the riders embraced as Decker offered some final words of wisdom. The next time they embraced, the Australians would be Olympic champions.\n\nAfterwards, O'Brien seemed lost for words. \"I think it is a fair way from sinking in,\" he said. Welsford, with a nod to history, was happy to let the victory wash over him. \"It has been 20 years since Australia won this,\" he added. \"So that will sink in [over] the next week.\"", "source":

We all knew we had it in us.\"\n\nWelsford now has the team pursuit medal set, after silver in Rio and bronze in Tokyo.\n\nGiven Australia surprised their rivals, long-time coach Tim Decker was asked if they surprised themselves.\n\nIt was the only time the smile left Decker's face in the wake of their triumph.\n\n\"No. Never. People forget Tokyo and what happened ... we were a very, very strong team there and we got a bronze medal probably with our third-best lineup,\" Decker said, with emphasis.\n\n\"The resilience these boys showed in Tokyo and to actually move forward from that and come back and make this happen, is really high-level history in cycling.\n\n\"We've been to hell and back and for them to make this happen, has been amazing.\"\n\nAfter Australia showed technical perfection to lower the world record to three minutes 40.730 seconds on Tuesday, the final was an old-fashioned dog fight and team pursuiting at its finest.\n\nIt nearly ended in disaster for the British, with designated finisher Ethan Hayter somehow keeping his bike upright and not bringing down his teammmates when he slipped in his saddle on the final lap.\n\nHayter, Daniel Bigham, Charlie Tanfield and Oliver Wood trailled Australia by two tenths of a second at the start of the last lap and Hayter's mishap blew out the margin.\n\nAustralia clocked 3:42.067 and won by more than two seconds. Italy beat Denmark for the bronze.\n\nBigham revealed post-race that their warmup song is Australian - Men At Work's Down Under - and that the winners took them by surprise.\n\n\"I genuinely feel we underestimated what the Aussies would bring to the party. They have lifted it a huge amount and that cannot be denied - that's seriously impressive,\" he said.\n\nThe Australian cycling campaign in Paris now boasts three gold medals and two bronze, the second-best Olympics for the sport after the six gold at the Athens Games.\n\nIt is also a massive turnaround from Tokyo, especially on the track, when Porter's horrific crash came to symbolise their disastrous campaign.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, Australians Matthew Richardson and Leigh Hoffman made solid starts in the match sprint.\n\nRichardson was second-fastest in qualifying and Hoffman was fourth as Dutch ace Harrie Lavreyson rode a world record 9.088 seconds for the flying 200m.\n\nRichardson has progressed to the quarter-finals, but Hoffman lost his 1/8 round repechage heat and it out.\n\nKristina Clonan won her repechage heat to stay alive in the women's keirin, while Australia finished seventh in the women's team pursuit.\n\nThe United States, coached by Australian Gary Sutton, defended their women's pursuit gold medal.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

But they began to come apart from their single-file, aerodynamic draft with about two laps to go, and they had to hang on to the finish to give their nation its first gold in the event after 12 years of close calls.\n\nAlly Wollaston, Bryony Botha, Emily Shearman and Nicole Shields were left with the silver medal for New Zealand.\n\nIn the race for bronze, the British team of Elinor Barker, Josie Knight, Anna Morris and Jessica Roberts pulled back more than a second from Italy over the last half of its race to land on the podium for the fourth straight Summer Games.\n\nIn the men's pursuit, Sam Welsford, Oliver Bleddyn, Conor Leahy and Kelland O'Brien of Australia beat Britain in a close final at the V\u00e9lodrome National de Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines to win the gold medal for the first time in two decades.\n\nThe American women's pursuit program similarly has been chasing gold ever since the 2012 London Games, when it finished second to Britain. It lost a rematch four years later in Rio de Janeiro, and then in Tokyo, the U.S. had to beat Canada for bronze.\n\nIt came to the velodrome outside of Paris with cautious optimism, though, buoyed by a lineup that already had a pair of medals. Dygert picked herself up from a crash and rallied through the rain to capture bronze in the time trial, and last weekend, Faulkner attacked in the closing kilometers to win the Americans' first Olympic road race in 40 years.\n\nAfter its qualifying time pit the U.S. against Britain in the semifinals, the quartet built a nearly half-second lead on its rival by the midway point of the 4,000-meter race, and Dygert went to the front for the final lap to bring it home.\n\nThen it was New Zealand's turn, and the top qualifier brushed aside the Italians in their semifinal by nearly three seconds.\n\nWhy are world cycling records getting shattered at the Olympic velodrome? Track, technology -- and temperature.\n\nThe men's pursuit podium was destined for a shakeup after Australia roared through qualifying, then not only defeated Olympic champ Italy in their head-to-head match but snatched away its world record, finishing in 3:40.730 to make the finals.\n\nIts opponent was familiar: Britain. Its streak of three straight Olympic gold medals ended with a seventh-place letdown at the Tokyo Games, but the British had topped the world champions from Denmark to return to the gold-medal race.\n\nThe two teams were separated by less than two-tenths of a second for almost their entire distance, and the Aussies crossed the line in 3:42.067. The British squad of Daniel Bigham, Ethan Hayter, Charlie Tanfield and Oliver Wood had a problem near the end that cost it a couple of seconds, leaving it with the silver medal.\n\nThe bronze went to the Italians of Simone Consonni, Filippo Ganna, Francesco Lamon and Jonathan Milan, who rallied in the last 1,000 meters as the Danish team of Tobias Hansen, Niklas Larsen, Carl-Frederik Bevort and Rasmus Pedersen fell apart.\n\n\"We didn't expect the level (to be) so high in these Olympic Games,\" Lamon said. \"We worked in Italy very, very hard and very, very, well, with very good times, but when we arrived here it was not good enough for the gold.\"\n\nEarlier on the third day of Olympic track cycling, the men's sprint started with qualifying through a 200-meter flying lap, where riders spend roughly two laps getting up to speed and then cover that distance as quickly as possible.\n\nOn a blazing fast, hot track where records are falling more quickly than medals are being awarded, the world record fell twice. Matthew Richardson of Australia snatched it away from reigning Olympic champion Harrie Lavreysen in 9.091 seconds, only for the Dutch rider -- fresh off his team sprint gold a night earlier -- to claim it back in 9.088 a few minutes later.\n\nThe women's keirin, where six riders spend three laps paced behind a motorized bike called a derny before getting turned loose to sprint for three laps, also began with New Zealand favorite Ellesse Andrews, German stars Lea Friedrich and Emma Hinze, and British standout Emma Finucane getting through their opening heats without a problem.\n\nThe medals in the women's keirin along with the men's multidiscipline omnium will be decided Thursday night.\n\n\"It will be a bit the same as in other championships -- fast-paced and the big guns will be there,\" said Fabio van den Bossche of Belgium, pointing to Hayter, Aaron Gate of New Zealand and Olympic bronze medalist Elia Viviani of Italy as omnium favorites. \"There will be many candidates for the podium.\"", "source": {"uri": "chicagotribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chicago Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dave_skretta@chicagotribune.com", "name": "Dave Skretta", "type":

I'm just really proud of the team and it's an awesome battle (with) Great Britain obviously - really happy to be on top,\" O'Brien said.\n\nThe British foursome of Ethan Hayter, Daniel Bigham, Charlie Tanfield and Oliver Wood were within around two tenths of a second at the start of the last lap.\n\nTheir race ended in dramatic fashion, nearly crashing on the last lap as they tried to snatch the win.\n\nDesignated finisher Hayter was leading their paceline when he slipped in his saddle and had to swing up the track, somehow avoiding a spill that would have brought down his three teammates.\n\nBritish riders narrowly avoided a touch of wheels, clocking 3:44.394 to finish two seconds behind.\n\nBigham revealed post-race that their warmup song is Australian - and that the winners took them by surprise.\n\n\"Inside scoop - Men at Work, Down Under. It's become a thing,\" he said.\n\n\"We came in thinking our main competition would probably come from Denmark and Italy.\n\n\"I genuinely feel we underestimated what the Aussies would bring to the party. They have lifted it a huge amount and that cannot be denied - that's seriously impressive.\"\n\nBigham confirmed they came close to disaster on the last lap, adding they felt they were where they needed to be before the mishap.\n\n\"That was close ... we knew we were (within) two tenths and that's all you need,\" he said.\n\nAustralia broke the world record in Tuesday's first round at the Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines velodrome outside Paris with 3:40.730 to qualify fastest.\n\nIn the final, the Australian quartet was behind at 1km, but only by .007 of a second, and led for much of the rest of the race.\n\nThis is Australia's first gold medal in Olympic track cycling since Anna Meares, now the team chef de mission, beat her British rival Victoria Pendleton in the sprint at the 2012 London Games.\n\nThe Australian cycling campaign in Paris now boasts three gold medals and two bronze, the second-best Olympics since the six gold won at the Athens Games.\n\nIt is also a massive turnaround from Tokyo, when a sole bronze in the men's team pursuit was the worst Australian haul at the Olympic velodrome since Moscow 1980.\n\nThe abiding moment of the disastrous track campaign in Tokyo was Alex Porter face-planting at 60km/h in men's team pursuit qualifying when his handlebar snapped off.\n\nAustralia's only cycling gold in Tokyo was Logan Martin in BMX freestyle.\n\nBulking out Australia's golden haul in Paris, BMX racer Saya Sakakibara and road time trial specialist Grace Brown also won their event.s\n\nAlso on Wednesday, Australians Matthew Richardson and Leigh Hoffman made solid starts in the match sprint.\n\nRichardson was second-fastest in qualifying and Hoffman was fourth as Dutch ace Harrie Lavreyson rode a world record 9.088 seconds for the flying 200m.\n\nRichardson has progress to the quarter-finals, but Hoffman has an 1/8 round repechage ride.\n\nKristina Clonan won her repechage heat to stay alive in the women's keirin, while Australia finished seventh in the women's team pursuit.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

We probably did not have these expectations when we started training together,\" said Welsford.\n\n\"To come together like we did in the last month was pretty special.\n\n\"It has been 20 years since Australia won this, so that will sink in over the next week,\" he added.\n\nAustralia -- Welsford, Oliver Bleddyn, Conor Leahy and Kelland O'Brien -- carved a huge chunk out of Italy's world record on Tuesday to signal their intent.\n\nThe win was their first in men's pursuit since the Athens Games before Britain won gold four years later in Beijing and repeated the feat in London and Rio.\n\nThe British faced a rebuild after the retirement of Bradley Wiggins and Ed Clancy and slumped to seventh in Tokyo three years ago.\n\n\"We knew we had to be on the line, we had a lot to do, it wasn't out of our grasp,\" said Britain's Charlie Tanfield. \"We didn't funnel in at the end but we're still very proud of what we achieved.\"\n\nFaulkner backed up her road race gold by helping teammates Jennifer Valente, Lily Williams, Chloe Dygert blast past New Zealand in 4:04.306 to win their first Olympic women's pursuit gold.\n\n\"We knew we had a strong team coming in, and I feel like the lucky one because they (her teammates) have won medals before on the track and I haven't,\" said Faulkner. \"I just wanted to live up to their expectations.\"\n\nIt was a rare accomplishment by Faulkner, who outwitted Dutch veteran Marianne Vos and Belgium's Lotte Kopecky to win the road race on Sunday.\n\nBritain, without Katie Archibald who suffered a broken leg in a freak pre-Games accident, took the bronze.\n\nThe British won gold at London in 2012 when the event was first added to the Olympic program and defended their title in Rio.\n\nBut they were edged into silver in Tokyo by world record holders Germany, who only finished sixth in Paris.\n\nDefending gold medallist Lavreysen reinforced his status as heavy favorite in the sprint, unleashing some sensational speed.\n\nThe five-time world champion, who led the Netherlands to the team sprint title on Tuesday, dismantled the world record in qualifying.\n\nHe clocked 9.088 on the heels of Australia's Matthew Richardson becoming the first man ever under 9.100 when he posted 9.091 to smash Nicolas Paul's five-year-old mark.\n\nBoth men returned to safely negotiate the heats and make the quarter-finals.\n\nWith Dutch defending champion Shanne Braspennincx not in Paris, the women's keirin is wide open.\n\nNew Zealand's Tokyo silver medallist and current world champion Ellesse Andrews comfortably progressed to the quarterfinals.\n\nSo did British hope Emma Finucane, who already has one gold in the women's team sprint, along with Germany's Emma Hinze and China's Guo Yufang.\n\n\u00a9 2024 AFP", "source": {"uri":

The previous world record was 3:42.032, set by Italy at the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, Australia won bronze in the men's team sprint, beating France in their ride-off.

But Australia only managed 42.336, while the Dutch broke their own record.\n\nAustralia's water polo Stingers overpowered Greece 9-6 to forge into the semi-finals of the women's tournament and another step closer to their first title since the inaugural event in Sydney 2000.\n\nInspired by five goals from the outstanding Alice Williams, Bec Rippon's surging side, who had suffered when five players contracted Covid-19 in the week the tournament started, are now a win away from making the podium.\n\nThey will face either Hungary or the US in Thursday's semi-final at La D\u00e9fense Arena.\n\nIn sailing, leader Matt Wearn and the rest of the men's dinghy field must wait another day to decide their medals. Their final round was put on hold for the second consecutive day in Marseille because of the conditions.\n\nWearn, the defending Olympic champion and reigning world No 1, is guaranteed a silver medal and is in the box seat for the gold. He has a 14-point lead over Cypriot Pavlos Kontides and seventh or better in the medal race, or Kontides finishing no higher than fourth, will secure Wearn another gold.", "source": {"uri":

It is a race where man and machine combine - with the aerodynamic benefits of equipment as closely scrutinised as individual training plans. It is a race where seconds are measured to the third decimal, to the single millisecond. And it is the race where, at long last, Australia are Olympic champions.\n\nBy the admission of their own coach, the Australian men's team pursuit squad arrived in Paris as underdogs. The nation's track cyclists have endured a turbulent two Olympic cycles, epitomised in Tokyo by the moment Alex Porter's handlebar snapped midway through qualifying in a freak accident. The team recovered to win the bronze medal - Australia's only medal on the track at the last Games - but the symbolism remained.\n\nRelated: Keegan Palmer doubles up for Australia with Olympic skateboard gold at Paris Games\n\nOn Tuesday, it took only three minutes, 40 seconds and 73 milliseconds to rewrite that narrative and emphatically remove any underdog tag. The Australian squad of Sam Welsford, Conor Leahy, Kelland O'Brien and Oliver Bleddyn broke - no, smashed - Italy's world record from Tokyo. It suddenly made them favourites ahead of a gold medal ride against Great Britain.\n\nIt was to be a duel steeped in track history. Australia have not won the men's team pursuit since the 2004 Olympics in Athens, where an squad that would go on to become cycling greats - Graeme Brown, Brett Lancaster, Brad McGee and Luke Roberts - beat Team GB and a young Bradley Wiggins, in 3:58.233.\n\nThen the drought began. Four years later in Beijing, Australia raced for bronze - and lost. At London 2012, it was an Athens rematch: Great Britain against the Australians. But this time Team GB broke the world record on their way to win gold. It was d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu at Rio 2016: another golden world record for Britain and another silver medal for Australia.\n\nIn the two decades since 2004, the nations have met in six world championship finals. The Australians have won five. But when it mattered most, on the grand Olympic stage, Britain came out on top. Australia has also failed to reach a team pursuit final since their last world title in 2019.\n\nAnd so the track was set on Wednesday - history, narrative, sporting rivalry. \"The Aussies know how to race,\" cyclist Aaron Gate offered after New Zealand's preceding placing race. And so it proved.\n\nAs both nations began flying, the splits were infinitesimally small. Over the first kilometre, the lead swung back and forth. After a quarter of the race, the British led by seven milliseconds - all of 0.007. Australia took the lead soon thereafter, but the British did not back down. At the two and three kilometre marks, the teams were barely separated by more than one-tenth of a second. The Australians were ahead but with such small margins it was impossible to predict a winner. It shaped up as the closest Olympic team pursuit race in history.\n\nThen disaster hit the British. With one lap to go and a deficit of 0.160 seconds to make up, Britain's Ethan Hayter slipped off his saddle. It was unclear whether it was a technical issue or a rider error. Either way, the error would prevent any chance of a British resurgence. Australia finished in 3:42.067, almost on par with Italy's prior world record, but not quite a new best-mark - nor the sub-3.40 mark that suddenly seems in reach.\n\nThe emotion on the face of the riders said it all - this is a victory the Australian track cycling team has targeted for so long, yet all too often had come up short. It was particularly special for Sam Welsford, who won silver in Rio in the loss to Britain, and then bronze in Tokyo. The 28-year-old rounds out his collection with the shiniest medal of all.\n\nVictory in the men's team pursuit on Wednesday is Australia's first track cycling gold since 2012, when Anna Meares famously beat Britain's Victoria Pendleton in the sprint. It has been an unexpectedly long time between appearances on the podium's top step for Australia, an erstwhile track cycling heavyweight which has struggled to fire in recent years.\n\nRelated: World record puts Australia back at front of cycling arms race with Olympic glory in sight | Kieran Pender\n\nThat will make the victory all the more special for Australia's endurance quartet and their coach, Tim Decker. Stood in the infield as the group prepared to battle for gold, the riders embraced as Decker offered some final words of wisdom. The next time they embraced, the Australians would be Olympic champions.\n\nAfterwards, O'Brien seemed lost for words. \"I think it is a fair way from sinking in,\" he said. Welsford, with a nod to history, was happy to let the victory wash over him. \"It has been 20 years since Australia won this,\" he added. \"So that will sink in [over] the next week.\"", "source":

Australia squad of Oliver Bleddyn, Sam Welsford, Conor Leahy and Kelland O'Brien, finished over two seconds ahead of Great Britain with a time of 3:42.067 for the gold medal.\n\n\"I'm just so proud of the team I'm a part of,\" O'Brien said after the race. \"It's an absolute honor to share the track with those guys, and even more so when you come away with gold.\"\n\n\"I have so much respect for that [British] team and those guys, so hats off to them for putting on a good show.\"\n\nFULL RESULTS\n\nThe Brits looked poised to win after leading the entire race until disaster struck on the last lap, Ethan Hayter fell out of turn and there wasn't enough time to recover.\n\n\"We were so close and I could see it. It was nearly five laps at the end and I just really gave too much, and my whole body went weak and I really struggled to hold myself on the bike in the end,\" Hayter said.\n\nThe two teams came out very even off the start, but Australia had a slight lead after the first lap. Less than hundreds of a second separated the two teams after 1000m with Great Britain in the lead. At the halfway mark, the Australians had regained the lead for the slight advantage of .140.\n\nThe back half of the race saw Australia in front, but Great Britain threatened. With 1000m to go, the Aussies had just a .183 but Welsford's lead lap helped increase it to two tenths of a second.\n\nWith just 250m to go on the bell lap, Australia had a .168 lead on Great Britain when Hayter wobbled. In a race of inches, it was enough to hand Australia the gold medal.\n\n\"Sorry to the guys but I think we gave everything, and we can be proud of that silver medal.\"\n\nTeammate Charlie Tanfield added: \"He just kind of slid a bit. That was that. He did an amazing job. He did so much for the team.\"\n\nAustralia won its first gold medal in men's team pursuit since 2004, its third ever. The Aussies were perfect in Paris and set a world record against Italy in the first round to make it to the gold medal race. Welsford now has a medal of every color in team pursuit (silver in Rio, bronze in Tokyo), O'Brien wins his second Olympic medal (bronze in Tokyo), while Bleddyn and Leahy leave with their first Olympic medals.\n\nThere is a silver lining for Great Britain.

They lived up to the predictions and the Oceanians regained the dominance they had enjoyed in Athens 2004. They had not been on the top of the podium since. In the women's competition, the US quartet were the favourites and they did not disappoint. It was a narrow victory, but the glory went to the Americans.\n\nTwenty years later, Australia reclaimed the men's golf crown by defeating Great Britain in a thrilling final. Italy secured the bronze medal. In the women's event, the US team emerged victorious over New Zealand in a contest that nearly set a world record. Great Britain finished in third place, taking the bronze.\n\nIn the men's race, Australia reasserted their dominance of the velodrome and took gold, much to the delight of the Australians. Great Britain took silver and Italy bronze.\n\nAustralia faced Great Britain in the final after Italy topped the podium at Tokyo 2020 and after a period in which Denmark took advantage to win major titles such as the World Championships. This is a discipline in which it is very difficult to steal the limelight from the favourites.\n\nAustralia had not won a gold medal since 2004. Great Britain has 16 Olympic medals in the men's team pursuit, winning gold in Beijing, London and Rio. However, they have suffered the loss of Tour de France winner Bradley Wiggins and Ed Clancy. They finished seventh in Tokyo three years ago.\n\nThere was no record in the final, but the Australians beat the British by more than a second with a time of 3.42.067 at almost 65 kilometres per hour. The Australians had set the world and Olympic record the day before, stopping the clock at 3.40.730, and went into the velodrome as favourites.\n\nUp until the middle of the race it was all even, just a tenth of a second ahead of the Australians, but as the Oceanians began to pull away, a mechanical problem on the bike of Briton Ethan Hayanter ended his team's hopes. They were down to three riders. When they were down to two, the gold went to Australia. The Australian Olympic quartet were Oliver Bleddyn, Sam Welsford, Conor Leahy and Kelland O'brien. The British silver medallists were Ethan Edward Hayter, Daniel Bigham, Ethan Vernon and Charlie Tanfield.\n\nMinutes earlier, the bronze medal race had been a one-sided battle between the ever-competitive Danes and the Italians. The latter were defending their Tokyo 2020 title. The Italians gave no quarter and took bronze with the quartet of Simone Consonni, Filippo Ganna, Francesco Lamon and Jonathan Milan.\n\nIn the middle of the race, the power of Filippo Ganna, one of the best time trialists in the professional road cycling peloton, who only ten days ago won the silver medal in the time trial behind Remco Evenepoel, came to the fore. Ganna broke away from the group and made the difference.\n\nSo did Jonathan Milan, who has had a spectacular year for him, after also proving that he is one of the best sprinters on the road. Their long-distance status was never in evidence, and they adapted perfectly to the French velodrome to give their country a bronze medal. Denmark was fourth, the most painful place to be. New Zealand and France were fifth and sixth, and Canada and Belgium were seventh and eighth.\n\nMinutes later, the USA beat New Zealand in the final duel in the women's team pursuit. Just six-hundredths of a second separated the quartets in an exciting and evenly matched final. Great Britain beat Italy more comfortably to complete the women's podium.\n\nThe US quartet finished with a time of 4.04.306, just one hundredth of the world record held by Germany since Tokyo 2021. It was a performance to remember.\n\nThe quartet was made up of Jennifer Valente, Lily Williams, Chloe Dygert and Kristen Faulkner. Two of the quartet, time trial bronze medallist Chlo\u00e9 Dygert and road champion Kristen Faulkner, have already won road medals at Paris 2024. The other top spots went to France and Germany in fifth and sixth, and Australia and Canada in seventh and eighth.\n\nThe day was completed with the classification rounds of the sprint and Keirin disciplines, both in the men's and women's categories. The gold medals in the individual sprint, Keirin and Madison events are still to be decided. There will be track cycling until Sunday, 11 August, the closing day of the Olympic Games.", "source": {"uri": "insidethegames.biz", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.insidethegames.biz"}, "authors":

The boys did a good job of keeping their nerve,\" Welsford said.\n\nIt has been 20 years since Australia last won the event, and Welsford admitted it was \"pretty crazy\" to think they were Olympic champions. \"We probably did not have these expectations when we started training together. To come together like we did in the last month was pretty special,\" he added.\n\nThe times do not tell the full story of dramatic race where gold was in the balance, as the quartets were neck and neck with only 0.150s between them as they went into the last lap, but a touch of wheels saw Hayter forced to slow down, ensuring gold went to Australia, who had previously set a new world record of 3.40.730 on Tuesday.\n\n\"We were so close. I just gave too much and my whole body went weak, and I couldn't stay on the bike anymore. I am sorry for these guys. We are super happy to win a silver though,\" explained Hayter.\n\n\"The dream never died. We have come here and won a silver medal, and these lads can all be proud because they did a great job,\" said his teammate Wood.\n\nItaly, whose team contained Felippo Ganna and Jonathan Milan, produced a strong second half to claim bronze.\n\nIn the women's team pursuit final, the U.S. had a strong start against New Zealand and were able to hold on comfortably as their rivals closed the gap in the closing kilometer.\n\nThe U.S. finished in 4.04.306 to their rivals' 4.04.927 to give American cyclist Kristen Faulkner her second gold medal of the Games, after she had won the women's road race on Sunday.\n\n\"I would have been happy to walk away with one medal, but to have two golds is a dream come true, it is more than I expected,\" said Faulkner in the post-race press conference.\n\nNew Zealand have the consolation of being only the fifth nation to win an Olympic medal in this event.\n\n\"We can be proud of every round we did out there. It was initially disappointing, but if you see the progress we have made, we are really proud with a silver medal around our necks,\" said New Zealand cyclist Ally Wollaston.\n\nBritain beat Italy in the race for third and fourth to take the bronze medal.\n\nThere was early drama in the men's sprint, when first Matthew Richardson of Australia broke the world record to set a fastest-ever time of 9.091 to cover 200 meters, before defending champion Harrie Lavreysen of the Netherlands went even faster with a time of 9.088, at an average speed of 79.225 km/h.\n\nThe duo progressed with few problems to the quarterfinals and are clear medal favorites.\n\nEmma Finucane impressed in the first round of the women's Keirin, showing her speed in reaching the quarterfinals in a heat with Lea Friedrich of Germany.\n\nYuan Liying and Guo Yufang from China also qualified for the quarterfinals with strong rides to finish second in their respective heats.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com.my",

It wasn't until the British quartet of Daniel Bigham, Ethan Hayter, Charlie Tanfield and Oliver Wood appeared to touch wheels at the end that they pulled away.\n\nThe men's pursuit podium was destined for a shakeup after Australia roared through qualifying, then not only defeated Olympic champion Italy but also snatched away its world record, finishing in 3:40.730 to ease into the finals.\n\nIts opponent was a familiar one: Britain. The nation whose streak of three straight Olympic golds ended with a seventh-place letdown at the Tokyo Games beat the world champions from Denmark to return to the gold-medal race.\n\nIn the race for bronze, the Italian team of Simone Consonni, Filippo Ganna, Francesco Lamon and Jonathan Milan rallied over the last 1,000 meters as the Danish team of Tobias Hansen, Niklas Larsen, Carl-Frederik Bevort and Rasmus Pedersen fell apart.\n\nThe finals of the women's pursuit was later Wednesday night, when the U.S. quartet of Kristen Faulkner, Chloe Dygert, Lily Williams and Jennifer Valente were facing off against New Zealand for gold.

But they arrived in Paris with a formidable quartet and broke the\n\n\"I'm just so proud of the team I'm a part of,\" O'Brien told reporters. \"It's an absolute honour to share the track with those guys, and even more so when you come away with gold.\n\n\"I have so much respect for that (British) team and those guys, so hats off to them for putting on a good show.\"\n\nItaly, the champions from Tokyo, beat Denmark to bronze.\n\nBritain were left to rue Hayter's hair-raising late moment that may have cost them gold.\n\n\"We were so close and I could see it,\" Hayter said. \"It was nearly five laps at the end and I just really gave too much, and my whole body went weak and I really struggled to hold myself on the bike in the end.\"\n\nCharlie Tanfield defended his team mate: \"He just kind of slid a bit. That was that. He did an amazing job. He did so much for the team.\"\n\nFAULKNER DOUBLE\n\nThe United States women's team of Jennifer Valente, Lily Williams, Chloe Dygert and Kristen Faulkner were bidding to upgrade to gold after missing out on the title since the discipline was added to the programme in 2012.\n\nAfter building a decent lead they struggled to stay together late on but had enough in the tank to remain ahead.\n\nFor Faulkner it was a second gold of the Games after she won the women's road race -- making her the first American woman to win two titles at the same Olympics in two different disciplines.\n\n\"When I came into the programme in 2016 this was the medal that U.S. Cycling was aiming for more than any other discipline,\" Dygert, who has completed the set of medals, said.\n\n\"Now we've finally pulled

79kph.\n\nAustralian Matthew Richardson initially broke the world record set by Trinidad & Tobago's Paul Nicholas in 2019 with 9.091 but the 27-year-old Lavreysen, fresh from his team sprint gold on

We probably did not have these expectations when we started training together,\" said Welsford.\n\n\"To come together like we did in the last month was pretty special.\n\n\"It has been 20 years since Australia won this, so that will sink in over the next week,\" he added.\n\nAustralia -- Welsford, Oliver Bleddyn, Conor Leahy and Kelland O'Brien -- carved a huge chunk out of Italy's world record on Tuesday to signal their intent.\n\nThe win was their first in men's pursuit since the Athens Games before Britain won gold four years later in Beijing and repeated the feat in London and Rio.\n\nThe British faced a rebuild after the retirement of Bradley Wiggins and Ed Clancy and slumped to seventh in Tokyo three years ago.\n\n\"We knew we had to be on the line, we had a lot to do, it wasn't out of our grasp,\" said Britain's Charlie Tanfield.\n\n\"We didn't funnel in at the end but we're still very proud of what we achieved.\"\n\nExpectations\n\nFaulkner backed up her road race gold by helping teammates Jennifer Valente, Lily Williams, Chloe Dygert blast past New Zealand in 4:04.306 to win their first Olympic women's pursuit gold.\n\n\"We knew we had a strong team coming in, and I feel like the lucky one because they (her teammates) have won medals before on the track and I haven't,\" said Faulkner.\n\n\"I just wanted to live up to their expectations.\"\n\nIt was a rare accomplishment by Faulkner, who outwitted Dutch veteran Marianne Vos and Belgium's Lotte Kopecky to win the road race on Sunday.\n\nBritain, without Katie Archibald who suffered a broken leg in a freak pre-Games accident, took the bronze.\n\nThe British won gold at London in 2012 when the event was first added to the Olympic programme and defended their title in Rio.\n\nBut they were edged into silver in Tokyo by world record holders Germany, who only finished sixth in Paris.\n\nDefending gold medallist Lavreysen reinforced his status as heavy favourite in the sprint, unleashing some sensational speed.\n\nThe five-time world champion, who led the Netherlands to the team sprint title on Tuesday, dismantled the world record in qualifying.\n\nHe clocked 9.088 on the heels of Australia's Matthew Richardson becoming the first man ever under 9.100 when he posted 9.091 to smash Nicolas Paul's five-year-old mark.\n\nBoth men returned to safely negotiate the heats and make the quarter-finals.\n\nWith Dutch defending champion Shanne Braspennincx not in Paris, the women's keirin is wide open.\n\nNew Zealand's Tokyo silver medallist and current world champion Ellesse Andrews comfortably progressed to the quarter-finals.\n\nSo did British hope Emma Finucane, who already has one gold in the women's team sprint, along with Germany's Emma Hinze and China's Guo Yufang.",

However, that did not tell the full story of the drama.\n\n\"It was close, and I knew in the last three laps they would come quicker, and we just tried to match it. The boys did a good job of keeping their nerve,\" said Welsford after the race.\n\nIt has been 20 years since Australia last won the event, and Welsford admitted it was \"pretty crazy\" to think they were Olympic champions.\n\n\"We probably did not have these expectations when we started training together. To come together like we did in the last month was pretty special,\" he added.\n\nThe quartets were neck and neck with only 0.150s between them as they went into the last lap, where Hayter simply ran out of gas.\n\n\"We were so close. I just gave too much and my whole body went weak and I couldn't stay on the bike anymore. I'm sorry for these guys. We're super happy to win a silver though,\" explained Hayter.\n\n\"The dream never died. We have come here and won a silver medal and these lads can all be proud because they did a great job,\" added Wood.\n\nItaly produced a strong second half to claim bronze after Denmark spectacularly fell apart in the closing laps.\n\nThe team pursuit sees teams of four riders start on opposite sides of the 250-meter track before completing 16 circuits as quickly as possible.\n\nIt is a test of strength, speed and organization, as it is vital for the riders to stay as close as possible to each other to cut down on wind resistance.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com.my", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star "}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_Leahy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conor Leahy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethan_Vernon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ethan Vernon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Tanfield", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Tanfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethan_Hayter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ethan Hayter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Wood_(cyclist)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oliver Wood (cyclist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Welsford", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Welsford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelland_O'Brien", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kelland O'Brien"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_pursuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Team pursuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_cycling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Track cycling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_GB", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Team GB"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Races", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Races", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795726", "eventUri": "eng-9795726", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 7, "textEnd": 13}], "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

But they arrived in Paris with a formidable quartet and broke the world record in Tuesday's first round.\n\nALSO READ: Gymnastics: Biles leads US women back to the top, Japanese men shine at Paris Games\n\n\"I'm just so proud of the team I'm a part of,\" O'Brien told reporters. \"It's an absolute honor to share the track with those guys, and even more so when you come away with gold.\n\n\"I have so much respect for that (British) team and those guys, so hats off to them for putting on a good show.\"\n\nItaly, the champions from Tokyo, beat Denmark to bronze.\n\nBritain were left to rue Hayter's hair-raising late moment that may have cost them gold.\n\n\"We were so close and I could see it,\" Hayter said. \"It was nearly five laps at the end and I just really gave too much, and my whole body went weak and I really struggled to hold myself on the bike in the end.\"\n\nCharlie Tanfield defended his team mate: \"He just kind of slid a bit. That was that. He did an amazing job. He did so much for the team.\"\n\nFaulkner double\n\nThe United States women's team of Jennifer Valente, Lily Williams, Chloe Dygert and Kristen Faulkner were bidding to upgrade to gold after missing out on the title since the discipline was added to the programme in 2012.\n\nAfter building a decent lead they struggled to stay together late on but had enough in the tank to remain ahead.\n\nFor Faulkner it was a second gold of the Games after she won the women's road race - making her the first American woman to win two titles at the same Olympics in two different disciplines.\n\n\"When I came into the programme in 2016 this was the medal that US Cycling was aiming for more than any other discipline,\" Dygert, who has completed the set of medals, said.\n\n\"Now we've finally pulled it off.\"\n\nWorld records continued to tumble earlier on day three of track action with Dutchman Harrie Lavreysen blasting around the men's 200 metres flying lap in 9.088, averaging 79kph.\n\nAustralian Matthew Richardson initially broke the world record set by Trinidad & Tobago's Paul Nicholas in 2019 with 9.091 but the 27-year-old Lavreysen, fresh from his team sprint gold on Tuesday, went even quicker.\n\nREAD MORE: Chinese weightlifters retain Olympic golds, artistic swimming team make history\n\nThe start of the women's keirin saw New Zealand's world champion Ellesse Andrews make it

They have lifted it a huge amount and that cannot be denied - that's seriously impressive,\" he said.\n\nCoach Tim Decker never questioned the ability of his team, however, knowing full well their desire for gold particularly after Tokyo.\n\n\"People forget Tokyo and what happened. We were a very, very strong team there and we got a bronze medal and the resilience these boys showed and to move forward from that and come back and make this happen is high level history in track endurance cycling,\" he said.\n\nWith two debutants in Leahy and Bleddyn, O'Brien and Welsford led the team with experience.\n\nSpeaking with Bicycling Australia, St Kilda Cycling Club president Tom Reynolds, where O'Brien is a member, said the 26-year-old showed his dedication and focus.\n\n\"That was a nerve-wracking ride for all of us, with Great Britain leading for the first few laps before the Aussies started to peg them back. Cool heads and experience prevailed,\" he said.\n\n\"Kell is one of the young legends at St Kilda, and we are proud to see him succeed again on the international stage and have redemption for Tokyo.\"\n\nReynolds said this was certainly going to be a highlight in an already exciting and successful cycling career for O'Brien.\n\n\"Winning a gold medal has been one of Kell's dreams since he started his cycling career, and his success on the track and on the road inspires all of us.\n\n\"His gold medal is the highlight of an incredibly busy year for Kell. He's raced in more than a dozen international stage and one-day races this year, with more to come.\"\n\nAustralia's pursuit gold is the first in the event for 20 years and comes after losing the gold medal ride to the British at London and Rio.\n\nIt is also Australia's first gold medal in track cycling since Anna Meares, now the team chef de mission, beat her British rival Victoria Pendleton in the sprint final in 2012.\n\nThe pursuit cycling gold medal was one of four golds to be won by Australia on Wednesday, making it the country's best performance at the Olympics, overtaking the previous best of 17 in Athens 2004.\n\nThe medal tally, as of Thursday 8 August, put Australia third with 18 gold, 12 silver and 11 bronze.", "source": {"uri": "mountevelyn.mailcommunity.com.au", "dataType":

Yep, Great Britain.\n\nWith a nod to our American cousins, in terms of medals won though, both nations are the joint-most successful with a total of 19 each.\n\nPerhaps more telling though is that seven of Great Britain's 10 silver medals have come as a result of being beaten by Australia in that crucial match-up from alternate sides of the oval.\n\nAt the Olympics it's a different story.\n\nSince Australian quartet Graeme Brown, Brett Lancaster, Brad McGee and Luke Roberts broke the world record in 2004, Great Britain won the next three gold medals.\n\nThey beat Australia in the gold medal race in the latter of those three events, in 2012 and 2016.\n\n\"For me there's that redemption from the 2016 Olympics when they beat us by 0.7 in the final,\" Welsford said on Tuesday.\n\n\"So for us to go against them is a really nice opportunity and all the boys are really hungry for it.\"\n\nHaving been the most dominant force throughout the early part of the century, Australia and Great Britain have dropped off slightly.\n\nTeam GB lost their Olympic title in controversial circumstances, when Denmark crashed into a distanced British rider in Tokyo during the semifinals amidst cheating allegations over the use of illegal shin tape by the Danes.\n\nThe Tokyo Games were memorable for all the wrong reasons for the Australian team too, who suffered a dramatic equipment malfunction that saw Alex Porter smash into the pine face-first at 65kph when his handlebars suffered a catastrophic failure.\n\nAusCycling were then forced to remove the handlebars from its track bikes being used in the 1,000m time trial at the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games for a similar reason.\n\nAustralia and Britain have not contested a world championship final together since 2019, although Britain's last world championship victory in the event was in 2022, at this very velodrome, with the Aussies coming fourth.\n\nItaly, featuring Ineos Grenadier's road-cycling time trial specialist Filippo Ganna and Team Lidl-Trek sprinter Jonathan Milan -- who both put in massive turns to help win bronze -- and Denmark have dominated in recent years.\n\nBut the ease at which Australia destroyed defending champions Italy in the first round, smashing the Italian's world record to boot, was a powerful lesson in dominance and underlined just how much the tide has turned back Down Under.\n\n\"Ultimately the goal is to win on the third day,\" O'Brien said.\n\n\"The world record is a massive bonus.\"\n\nO'Brien had spoken about how fast this track is during training ahead of competition.\n\n\"The bends are really wide and straights are really short -- that generally makes it a fast team pursuit track,\" he said.\n\nBut fast track or not, the four men turning the pedals still have to make it work.\n\nAnd that world record bonus came with the best prize of all, an Olympic gold medal and a place back at the top of the sport.", "source": {"uri": "abc.net.au",

Dygert went to the front for the final lap around the track, and the Olympic time trial bronze medalist managed to keep her team ahead to the finish line.\n\nThe U.S. stopped the clock in 4 minutes, 4.629 seconds, while the British team of Elinor Barker, Josie Knight, Anna Morris and Jessica Roberts finished in 4:04.908, sending it into a bronze-medal match against Italy.\n\nThe team from New Zealand of Ally Wollaston, Bryony Botha, Emily Shearman and Nicole Shields that nearly broke the world record in qualifying earlier in the week finished in 4:04.818, beating the Italian team by nearly three seconds.\n\nIn the men's team pursuit finals Wednesday night, the Australian quartet of Sam Welsford, Oliver Bleddyn, Conor Leahy and Kellen O'Brien will try to lower its own world record when it races for gold against the British team of Ethan Hayter, Oliver Wood, Ethan Vernon and Charlie Tanfield.\n\nWorld champion Denmark and reigning Olympic champ Italy will go head to head for the men's pursuit bronze.\n\nAlso on the third day of Olympic track cycling, qualifying took place for the men's sprint, where each rider got about two laps to get up to speed and then tried to cover 200 meters -- just under a full lap of the velodrome -- as quickly as possible.\n\nOn a fast, hot track where records have been falling more quickly than medals are being handed out, the mark was set twice for the 200-meter flying lap. Matthew Richardson of Australia snatched it away from reigning Olympic champion Harrie Lavreysen in 9.091 seconds, only for the Dutch rider to claim it back a few minutes later in 9.088.\n\nThe women's keirin, where six riders spend three laps paced behind a motorized bike called a derny before getting turned loose to sprint for three laps, also began with New Zealand favorite Ellesse Andrews, German stars Lea Friedrich and Emma Hinze, and British standout Emma Finucane getting through their opening heats without a problem.\n\nFinucane's teammate, Katy Marchant, finished third in her heat race and was headed to the repechages.\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley

He was able to get back on the bike, and Australia ended up taking bronze behind champions Italy and silver medallists Denmark.\n\nTriple world champion Porter retired in 2022 but O'Brien and Welsford pushed on to Paris, forming a formidable quartet with Oliver Bleddyn and Conor Leahy.\n\nThe four beat a strong British lineup in the decider at the Saint Quentin-en-Yvelines velodrome on Wednesday to give Australia a first team pursuit gold in 20 years and ease the heartbreak of Tokyo.\n\nA thrilled Welsford draped himself in an Australian flag as he lapped the track on his bike then pulled up to embrace his teammates and loved ones leaning over the rail from the terraces.\n\n\"I think we had a bit of scar tissue there from the last time,\" O'Brien told Reuters.\n\n\"I feel like today sort of confirms to us what form we were in (at Tokyo) - but it was taken away from us a little bit with that unfortunate incident.\n\n\"So, yeah, it's good to get the monkey off our back and hopefully it sets Australia up for the next Olympics.\"\n\nVictory may have been that much sweeter for the Australians given it came over Team Britain who beat Australia for gold at both the 2012 London Games and Rio 2016.\n\nIt also continued a positive start for Australia's track cyclists at the Paris Games, coming a day after the men broke a 24-year medal drought in the team sprint with bronze.\n\nThey are already a medal in front of Australia's tally in Tokyo where that hard-won bronze was the team's sole podium and the handlebar incident seen as symbolic of the nation's decline as a power in Olympic cycling.\n\nAlthough Porter did not share in the gold in Paris, he and the other Tokyo bronze medallists, Leigh Howard and Luke Plapp, helped Australia secure it with advice and encouragement.\n\n\"We had a few pep-talks from the guys back home who were in the previous edition of the team pursuit,\" said 26-year-old O'Brien.\n\n\"The team sent us nice messages over the last couple of days to try

The British, who had their streak of three straight Olympic pursuit titles snapped three years ago, subbed Charlie Tanfield into the lineup along with Ethan Hayter, Oliver Wood and Ethan Vernon to face Denmark in the semi-finals. The quartet trailed by more than a second at one point before rallying to win in 3:42.151 and advance to the gold-medal race that takes place this evening.\n\nHowever, they know they'll have their work cut out if they are to get their hands on the gold with the Australian quartet of Oliver Bleddyn, Sam Welsford, Conor Leahy and Kelland O'Brien setting a new world record on their way to tonight's showdown. They routed reigning Olympic champions Italy in the heats setting a new best-ever mark of 3:40.730, more than a second faster than Italy's winning time at the Tokyo Games.\n\n\"Golly, we knew we were going quick, but I don't think we realized we were going that quick out there,\" Welsford said. \"I think we just really gelled really well. The team out there today, we just really executed.\"\n\nThe women's team pursuit squad, racing here without the injured Katie Archibald, were third fastest in qualifying as Elinor Barker, Josie Knight, Anna Morris and Jessica Roberts set a time of 4:06.710, two seconds off an outstanding time from New Zealand. That means the GB quartet will race off against the US team for the right to be in the gold-medal race.\n\nThat run will come at 12.52, after the first round of the women's kierin, which features GB's Katy Marchant, and the qualifying of the men's sprint which features Carlin and Turnbull, on the back of their silver-medal winning exploits last night.\n\nLater on in the day, the men's team pursuit finals takes place at 5.33, with the the women's team pursuit finals at 5:57, followed by the men's sprint 1/8 round.\n\nStay here for all the action.", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk",

Just three short years later at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, the Aussies are back on top.\n\nThere are fewer races that are a greater test of a nation's might in a velodrome.\n\nPower, endurance and graceful precision from the riders marry with technological innovations that allow those riders to get the best out of their machines.\n\nIt's a discipline where everything can change in the space of just a few short years, for both good and bad.\n\nAnd, three years after the catastrophe in Tokyo, Australia is back on top.\n\nThe team suffered a dramatic equipment malfunction in Tokyo that saw Alex Porter smash into the pine face-first at 65kph when his handlebars suffered a catastrophic failure.\n\nAusCycling were then forced to remove the handlebars from its track bikes being used in the 1,000m time trial at the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games for a similar reason.\n\nFor that reason alone, most people were not giving Australia a chance.\n\n\"I think a lot of people kind of underestimated what we can do,\" newly crowned gold medallist Sam Welsford said.\n\n\"We used that to our advantage here and we kind of kept under the radar.\"\n\nThey were not under the radar after Tuesday's sensational world record.\n\n\"I think we all knew that we had it in us,\" Welsford said.\n\n\"You know, I think when we saw 40 up on the board yesterday I think we're all a bit surprised, but then we backed ourselves in and we knew that we could actually do that.\"\n\nAll they had to do then, was back it up, and back it up they did.\n\nLegendary coach Tim Decker, who left the program in 2022, only to return a year later, was emotional after the team received its medals, saying that he \"never\" doubted that this team could get back to the top in track cycling's marquee event.\n\n\"This is such a big moment,\" Dekker said.\n\n\"They deserve this. We've been to hell and back, and for them to make this happen has been amazing.\n\n\"People forget Tokyo and what happened in Tokyo.\n\n\"We were a very, very strong team there and we got a bronze medal, probably with our third best line up, and the resilience the boys showed in Tokyo and to actually move forward from that and come back and make this happen [is inspirational].\"\n\nIn a blur of speed and amid a wildly-pro British crowd, Welsford, Oliver Bleddyn, Conor Leahy and Kelland O'Brien bested their Great British counterparts in the gold medal final on Wednesday to claim the Olympic title for the first time since 2004.\n\nDuring a desperately tight race, with four lead changes in the first four laps, Australia managed to open up a lead of around 0.3 seconds in the third kilometre.\n\nHowever, Great Britain fought back to within a tenth of a second in the final kilometre as the dark-blue line powered back.\n\nAustralia, though, held their form and composure to win a brilliant gold medal.\n\nThe pursuit is an event like no other on the track -- with no discipline more receptive to the rapid advancements in technology in the sport.\n\nSince the event became professionally incorporated at the 1993 UCI World Championships, the world record time has dropped precipitously from over four minutes to 3 minutes and 40.730 seconds, set by Australia on Tuesday.\n\nThis is the event where the synchronisation of rider and bike is at its most beautiful, one of the most aesthetically pleasing events in sport.\n\nFour cyclists riding in perfect harmony at speeds of over 60 kilometres per hour, leaders switching with broad, sweeping rolls up the vertiginous banking before latching back on to the back wheel of the last in line.\n\nThe effortless look of the teamwork, each rider crouched in a tucked streamline, belies the power that is being produced by each and every one of the quartet.\n\nWelsford had described a contest with Britain as \"the biggest rivalry there is,\" after his team broke the world record on Tuesday.\n\nThere's no doubt it is a rivalry like no other.\n\nAustralia has won 13 out of a possible 32 rainbow jerseys in this event -- more than double the next most successful team. Yep, Great Britain.\n\nWith a nod to our American cousins, in terms of medals won though, both nations are the joint-most successful with a total of 19 each.\n\nPerhaps more telling though is that seven of Great Britain's 10 silver medals have come as a result of being beaten by Australia in that crucial match-up from alternate sides of the oval.\n\nAt the Olympics it's a different story.\n\nSince Australian quartet Graeme Brown, Brett Lancaster, Brad McGee and Luke Roberts broke the world record in 2004, Great Britain won the next three gold medals.\n\nThey beat Australia in the gold medal race in the latter of those three events, in 2012 and 2016.\n\n\"There's, yeah, a bit of redemption there,\" O'Brien, who was a part of that team, told Channel 9.\n\n\"They got us in 2016, and it was really close, by 0.7 of a second.\n\n\"So for us to come here today and really nail the whole team pursuit week has been, really special.\"\n\nHaving been the most dominant force throughout the early part of the century, Australia and Great Britain have dropped off slightly.\n\nTeam GB lost their Olympic title in controversial circumstances, when Denmark crashed into a distanced British rider in Tokyo during the semifinals amidst cheating allegations over the use of illegal shin tape by the Danes.\n\nThe equipment malfunction ensured things were hardly a bundle of laughs for the Aussies in Tokyo either.\n\n\"We copped a big blow in Tokyo,\" Welsford said.\n\n\"But I think that also gave us a bit of fire for us to nail it and really get it right and just come together as a team and do all the things that you have to do to win.\n\n\"We just stuck our heads in the sand, got to work and that was probably the most important thing for us.\"\n\nAustralia and Britain have not contested a world championship final together since 2019, although Britain's last world championship victory in the event was in 2022, at this very velodrome, with the Aussies coming fourth.\n\nItaly, featuring Ineos Grenadier's road-cycling time trial specialist Filippo Ganna and Team Lidl-Trek sprinter Jonathan Milan -- who both put in massive turns to help win bronze -- and Denmark have dominated in recent years.\n\nBut the ease at which Australia destroyed defending champions Italy in the first round, smashing the Italian's world record to boot, was a powerful lesson in dominance and underlined just how much the tide has turned back Down Under.\n\nAnd then, the crowning glory, a date with destiny with old foes Britain.\n\n\"It was a heated battle as it always is with Great Britain,\" Welsford said.\n\n\"Hats off to those guys, they rode an amazing race and yeah, we just stuck to our process and nailed it start to finish.\n\n\"I couldn't be more proud of the boys and team for for getting it done.\n\n\"Today is the most important thing, we've said that all along, it's gunna be won on day three and it was won on day three.\"", "source": {"uri":

Except themselves, that is.\n\nThe Australian quartet of Sam Welsford, Kelland O'Brien, Conor Leahy and Oliver Bleddyn won a thrilling final at the Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines velodrome, beating Great Britain for a first gold medal in the event since Athens 2004. It was also Australia's first track gold since current Chef de Mission, Anna Meares, beat her own British opponent Victoria Pendleton on home soil in London 2012.\n\nThe team entered Paris as outsiders, but demolished the world record in the opening round and saw off Australia's traditional cycling nemesis, Britain, in a dramatic final that saw a host of lead changes early on.\n\nThings were tense in the final lap - the Brits entered it just 0.2s behind - only to suffer a near-disaster when their usual finisher Ethan Hayter slipped on his saddle and nearly crashed. He was forced to pull to the side, but was lucky not to wipe out his teammates Daniel Bigham, Charlie Tanfield and Oliver Wood.\n\n\"I genuinely feel we underestimated what the Aussies would bring to the party. They have lifted it a huge amount and that cannot be denied - that's seriously impressive,\" Bigham said.\n\nAussies claim FOUR gold as greatest-ever day confirms all-time Olympic haul -- Wrap\n\nThe Australians were flying under the radar this week, at least until they crushed the world record in an inch-perfect display of team riding.\n\n\"I knew we were in a good spot, obviously breaking the world record yesterday, and it was actually really nice ... being the underdogs,\" Welsford said.\n\n\"A lot of people underestimated what we can do and we used that to our advantage here, and we kind of kept under the radar. We all knew we had it in us.\"\n\nInside the 'hell no' moment and stunning redemption act that sealed Aussie history\n\nBreaking down every remaining medal hope for Australia as record set to get even better\n\nIn London and Rio, Australia lost in the gold medal final to the Brits. Then came Tokyo, and one of Australian cycling's darkest days.\n\nAround 1200 metres into the 4000m of the men's team pursuit qualification, Alex Porter's handlebars suddenly snapped. He crashed to the wooden pine of the velodrome at 65km/h. Porter suffered friction burns to his face, arms, and legs but was lucky not to have been injured more severely - and was lucky the catastrophic equipment failure occurred when he was at the back of the four-man team.\n\n\"At first I thought it was a dream because my brain couldn't work out what was quite happening,\" Porter said at the time. \"And just before I hit the track it kind of clicked that something in the front of my bike had just fallen away and then before I knew it I was sliding.\"\n\nAfter Porter passed a concussion test Australia was given a second attempt at qualifying, but the shock of the scary incident combined with the distance they had already ridden meant they finished fifth in qualification.\n\nTheir gold medal dream was done.\n\n\"I was really angry, I was really frustrated - we had all put in so much hard work,\" said Porter. \"All the sensations I'd had were amazing. I had this feeling before the start that we were going to be able to go out there and do something special.\n\n\"It was purely just frustration and anger at first. But, yeah, then I had to come in and refocus so we could go again.\"\n\nAustralia would go on to win bronze, the highest medal possible after their fifth place in qualifying. It was Australia's only track cycling medal in Tokyo, the team's worst performance since the 1980 Olympics.\n\nAustralia's fall from grace had been ugly - and that single moment summed it up perfectly. Track cycling was undergoing an aerodynamic arms race, with big-spending European nations leading the way.\n\nAfter a six-month review into the crash, AusCycling's findings were damning. The specifications AusCycling had sent to the manufacturer of the custom-built handlebars were inadequate, while the specific part - the titanium base plate - had not been stress-tested nearly enough either.\n\nThe crash was not caused by a dodgy part, but by an organisation with woefully poor processes, including where individuals simply \"made it up as they went along\".\n\n\"We apologise to Alex and his fellow riders, to the broader Australian Olympic team and to the Australian public, all of whom are entitled to expect better,\" AusCycling boss Marne Fechner said.\n\nIn 2022, there was more drama at the Commonwealth Games when AusCycling made a late handlebar change to the track cycling team after ruling that one type of bars \"cannot be used safely\".\n\nAusCycling had searched its soul, had rebuilt itself with the promise of never failing an Aussie athlete in such a humiliating fashion as Porter suffered.\n\nThe team in Paris includes Welsford, part of the pursuit team in Rio and Tokyo. O'Brien, too, was there for the Tokyo heartbreak. Leahy was an alternate for the 2021 Games. This team is a mix of new and old. But there's no doubt that the memory of the Tokyo carnage still burns deeply, pushing the team onwards to victory.\n\nPorter has retired. But in the minutes after their victory, a message from him - watching on from his Adelaide home - popped up on the four phones of Australia's new cycling champions.\n\n\"I'm not crying, you're crying,'' read the WhatsApp message. To be fair, there weren't many dry eyes among the Australian contingent at the velodrome.\n\n\"Porter's been talking to us every minute of the day,'' Welsford said.\n\n\"He just messaged us before and said 'I'm not crying, you're crying' ... he's always been there for us.\n\n\"For him to be so heavily invested after what happened in Tokyo, that means a lot to us.\n\n\"We copped a big blow in Tokyo. \"But I think that also gave us a bit of fire for us to nail it and really get it right, and just come together as a team and do all the things that you have to do to win.\n\n\"We just stuck our heads in the sand, got to work and that was probably the most important thing for us.\"\n\nRevered coach Tim Decker, who himself needed emergency brain surgery after nearly dying in a 2019 crash, said: \"This is such a big moment,\" Dekker said.\n\n\"They deserve this. We've been to hell and back, and for them to make this happen has been amazing.\n\n\"People forget Tokyo and what happened in Tokyo.\n\n\"We were a very, very strong team there and we got a bronze medal, probably with our third-best line up, and the resilience the boys showed in Tokyo and to actually move forward from that and come back and make this happen is really high-level history in cycling.\"\n\nThe Australians entered as underdogs, with all eyes on reigning champions Italy, Tokyo silver medallists Denmark, and the perennially strong Great Britain.\n\nBut Australia demolished Italy in the first round - and their world record too. It was equally fitting that Australia sealed their gold medal with victory over the old enemy GB.\n\n\"There's, yeah, a bit of redemption there,\" O'Brien said of beating the Brits. \"They got us in 2016, and it was really close, by 0.7 of a second.\n\n\"So for us to come here today and really nail the whole team pursuit week has been, really special.\"\n\nThe demons of Tokyo have officially been exorcised.

It wasn't until the British quartet of Daniel Bigham, Ethan Hayter, Charlie Tanfield and Oliver Wood appeared to touch wheels at the end that they pulled away.\n\nThe men's pursuit podium was destined for a shakeup after Australia roared through qualifying, then not only defeated Olympic champion Italy but also snatched away its world record, finishing in 3:40.730 to ease into the finals.\n\nIts opponent was a familiar one: Britain. The nation whose streak of three straight Olympic golds ended with a seventh-place letdown at the Tokyo Games beat the world champions from Denmark to return to the gold-medal race.\n\nIn the race for bronze, the Italian team of Simone Consonni, Filippo Ganna, Francesco Lamon and Jonathan Milan rallied over the last 1,000 meters as the Danish team of Tobias Hansen, Niklas Larsen, Carl-Frederik Bevort and Rasmus Pedersen fell apart.\n\nThe finals of the women's pursuit was later Wednesday night, when the U.S. quartet of Kristen Faulkner, Chloe Dygert, Lily Williams and Jennifer Valente were facing off against New Zealand for gold. The Americans have two silver medals and a bronze in three previous Olympics but have never triumphed in the event.\n\nLatest on SportstarMirabai Chanu LIVE Updates, Weightlifting women's 49kg at

O'Brien helps track pursuit team break record, go for gold", "body": "Australia has broken the Men's Team Pursuit world record in Paris, awakening the sleeping giant of Australian track cycling, with a Lilydale local among the riders.\n\nThe four-man team of Kelland O'Brien, Sam Welsford, Conor Leahy and Oliver Bleddyn stunned the crowd at the Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines National Velodrome when they broke the world mark to storm into the final against arch rival Great Britain.\n\nTheir time of 3:40.730 obliterated the previous benchmark by more than a second as they disposed of reigning Olympic champions Italy to progress to the gold medal ride at 2.33am AEST on 8 August.\n\nThe Men's Team Pursuit has breathed new life into the national track team and has its best shot at an Olympic gold medal in the event since Athens in 2004.\n\nSam was part of the team that lost to Great Britain in the final in Rio in 2016 by a whisker, and both he and Kelland were there in Tokyo three years ago when a broken handlebar and subsequent crash in qualifying robbed them of a shot at gold.\n\n\"I think it will be the biggest rivalry there is (in track cycling) for us to take on the Brits again, and for me there's that redemption from the 2016 Olympics when they beat us by 0.7 in the final,\" Sam told the Australian Olympic Committee (AOC).\n\n\"So for us to go against them is a really nice opportunity and all the boys are really hungry for it.\n\n\"We've shown today we have some good form and know how to produce fast times so I'm really excited for tomorrow.\n\n\"The faster we go the more confident we get.\"\n\nAfter setting the fastest time in qualifying, the quartet came up against defending champions Italy and their time of 3:40.730 lowered the Italians' previous best of 3:42.032.\n\n\"The plan was just to get the job done really and ultimately the goal is to win on the third day which is tomorrow, the world record is a massive bonus for us,\" Kelland said.\n\n\"We were just trying to be ready for whatever it took to win the race and fortunately it was a world record and we're really happy with that so far.\n\n\"The guys on this team have put in a massive amount of work to try to get this.\n\n\"There are probably a couple of things we can do to try and improve one more time for tomorrow, because it's all learning every time you go out, so I'm happy with what we have adjusted since yesterday but there are a few more things to go.\"", "source": {"uri": "mountevelyn.mailcommunity.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mount Evelyn Mail"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Dygert went to the front for the final lap around the track, and the Olympic time trial bronze medalist managed to keep her team ahead to the finish line.\n\nThe U.S. stopped the clock in 4 minutes, 4.629 seconds, while the British team of Elinor Barker, Josie Knight, Anna Morris and Jessica Roberts finished in 4:04.908, sending it into a bronze-medal match against Italy.\n\nThe team from New Zealand of Ally Wollaston, Bryony Botha, Emily Shearman and Nicole Shields that nearly broke the world record in qualifying earlier in the week finished in 4:04.818, beating the Italian team by nearly three seconds.\n\nIn the men\u00b4s team pursuit finals Wednesday night, the Australian quartet of Sam Welsford, Oliver Bleddyn, Conor Leahy and Kellen O\u00b4Brien will try to lower its own world record when it races for gold against the British team of Ethan Hayter, Oliver Wood, Ethan Vernon and Charlie Tanfield.\n\nUnited States' Jennifer Valente, Lily Williams, Chloe Dygert and Kristen Faulkner compete during the women's team pursuit event, at the Summer Olympics, Wednesday, Aug. 7, 2024, in Paris, France. (AP Photo/Thibault Camus)\n\nWorld champion Denmark and reigning Olympic champ Italy will go head to head for the men's pursuit bronze.\n\nAlso on the third day of Olympic track cycling, qualifying took place for the men's sprint, where each rider got about two laps to get up to speed and then tried to cover 200 meters - just under a full lap of the velodrome - as quickly as possible.\n\nOn a fast, hot track where records have been falling more quickly than medals are being handed out, the mark was set twice for the 200-meter flying lap. Matthew Richardson of Australia snatched it away from reigning Olympic champion Harrie Lavreysen in 9.091 seconds, only for the Dutch rider to claim it back a few minutes later in 9.088.\n\nThe women's keirin, where six riders spend three laps paced behind a motorized bike called a derny before getting turned loose to sprint for three laps, also began with New Zealand favorite Ellesse Andrews, German stars Lea Friedrich and Emma Hinze, and British standout Emma Finucane getting through their opening heats without a problem.\n\nFinucane's teammate, Katy Marchant, finished third in her heat race and was headed to the repechages.\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\n\nBritain's Elinor Barker, Josie Knight, Anna Morris and Jessica Roberts compete during the women's team pursuit event, at the Summer Olympics, Wednesday, Aug. 7, 2024, in Paris, France.

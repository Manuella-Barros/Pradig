The law is part of an effort across many states to crack down on high-cost consumer lending.\n\nThe legal question in the case revolves around how to interpret the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980. States can opt out of the federal statute and implement their own rate caps on loans \"made in\" their own states.\n\nColorado argues that the \"made in\" language refers to where both the borrower and bank are based, meaning that if a borrower is in Colorado, that's where the loan was made.\n\nThe plaintiffs -- the American Fintech Council, the National Association of Industrial Bankers and the American Financial Services Association -- argue in their lawsuit that \"made in\" refers to where the lender is located.\n\nOn Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Daniel Domenico agreed with the plaintiffs, issuing a preliminary injunction that prevents Colorado from enforcing the interest rate cap on any of the trade groups' community bank or fintech members that are based out of state. Nationally chartered banks are not subject to the law.\n\n\"In plain parlance, it is the lender who makes a loan; nobody thinks of themselves as 'making a loan' when they borrow money from a family member or put a charge on a credit card,\" Domenico wrote. \"It follows, then, that the answer to the question of where a loan is 'made' depends on the location of the bank.\"\n\nThe Colorado attorney general's office, which is named as a defendant in the suit, declined to comment on \"active litigation.\" The state has the opportunity to appeal the decision.\n\nSupporters of the Colorado law hope to see enhanced scrutiny of high-cost consumer loans, especially those issued by banks with home bases in states with lax interest rate limits.\n\nLauren Saunders, associate director at the National Consumer Law Center, said she thinks the injunction is \"flatly wrong and expects it to be overturned on appeal.\" She said the key point of the statute is where borrowers are based.\n\n\"The judge ignored the whole purpose of the opt-out right and interpreted it in a way that it would be meaningless,\" Saunders said.\n\nShe added that \"most responsible banks, most mainstream fintechs are in compliance with the law.\"\n\nThose firms that oppose the law argue that Colorado would cut off many of its residents' access to credit, and would limit competition between state-chartered banks and those with federal charters, which wouldn't face the same restrictions.\n\nDavid Gossett, a partner at Davis Wright Tremaine and the lead attorney for the plaintiffs, said in a prepared statement that the state's interpretation of the statute conflicts with federal law. He added that the Colorado law would \"take away access to responsible, affordable credit products from people who need it most.\"\n\nPhil Goldfeder, CEO of the American Fintech Council, said the law would curb operations of dozens of the group's community bank and fintech members. He added that it would impact tens of thousands of Colorado residents, who would lose access to hundreds of millions of dollars in potential credit.\n\n\"We're hopeful and optimistic that when the legal proceedings are over, that [Colorado] will continue to work with us to find the balance to ensure access to credit without potentially harming Colorado consumers,\" Goldfeder said.\n\nHe said that he thinks there are better ways to limit predatory lending than by opting out of the 1980 federal statute.\n\nIn a brief filed in April, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. , which was seeking to dismiss the case. The FDIC asserted that loans are made wherever the borrower is located.\n\nAlan Kaplinsky, senior counsel at the law firm Ballard Spahr, submitted a brief on behalf of the American Bankers Association and the Consumer Bankers Association in support of the motion for a preliminary injunction, in part as a response to the FDIC's filing.\n\nKaplinsky said in an interview that if the plaintiffs win their case, the \"ultimate irony\" is that only state-chartered banks in Colorado would be subject to the rate cap.\n\n\"One way to put it is, Colorado has shot themselves in the foot,\" Kaplinsky said. \"If they run the course here, and the industry continues to prevail, then this will turn out not only to be an exercise in futility, but something that boomerangs on them.\"\n\nThe case in Colorado is the first of its kind so far, but Minnesota, Rhode Island and Nevada have proposed similar opt-out laws.", "source": {"uri": "americanbanker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "American

Domenico issued a preliminary injunction applying to members of three banking industry groups, which argued Colorado exceeded its authority by \"exporting\" its own limits on interest rates to banks chartered in other states. Domenico noted he was tasked with interpreting federal law in a novel context, and he repeatedly criticized Congress for using unclear language.\n\nNonetheless, he believed Colorado's authority to regulate excessive interest rates on loans \"made in\" the state was evident enough: the bank is the one that makes the loan, so Colorado's authority extends only to its own state-chartered banks.\n\n\"And the plaintiffs have presented evidence that absent an injunction, they will be forced to stop offering their loan products altogether to certain Colorado consumers, and once gone, those customers -- and their goodwill along with that of the banks' business partners -- may be gone forever,\" Domenico wrote in a June 18 order.\n\nThe Colorado Attorney General's Office declined to comment on the injunction and the plaintiff organizations did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nDuring the debate over House Bill 1229 -- enacted last year but taking effect in July -- the bill's sponsors explained the goal is to prevent out-of-state banks from \"hopping around\" Colorado's consumer lending laws by charging higher interest rates for financial products than Colorado law allows for its institutions.\n\n\"What this means is if a bank in Utah charges an interest rate on a small-dollar loan outside the scope of what is allowable in Colorado, they can still do so here. And Colorado consumers are still vulnerable to that sort of predatory lending,\" Rep. Javier Mabrey, D-Denver, said at a committee hearing.\n\nHB 1229 stems from a decades-old authorization by Congress. Amid rampant inflation in 1980, Congress passed a provision known as Section 521, allowing state-chartered banks to lend at interest rates up to their own state's cap or slightly above the federal interest rate, whichever was higher. The goal was to ensure state-chartered banks in states with low interest rate caps could still afford to lend money.\n\nSign up for free: News Alerts Stay in the know on the stories that affect you the most.\n\nSign Up For Free View all of our newsletters. Success! Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter. View all of our newsletters.\n\nHowever, a second provision, Section 525, granted states the power to opt-out and ensure state-chartered banks charged interest rates in line with their state's law. The opt-out applies to loans \"made in\" the state.\n\nIn March, the National Association of Industrial Bankers, a trade group based in Utah, sued Colorado in conjunction with other industry associations over HB 1229, enacted last year but taking effect in July. The law invokes Colorado's ability to opt-out through Section 525 and apply its own caps on interest rates to consumer transactions \"in this state.\"\n\nThe groups sought to avoid letting Colorado export its own ceilings on interest rates, which are lower than those elsewhere, to banks chartered by other states that lend to Colorado consumers.\n\n\"The harm to my clients without an injunction on July 1 is clear. No one is going to sit around and wait for the first enforcement action against them before they lower their interest rate from 29% to 21%,\" said attorney David M. Gossett at a hearing last month. \"They're either going to stop lending or lose money.\"\n\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, a regulatory agency that insures depositors against financial losses, weighed in on behalf of Colorado. It argued if a bank in one state makes a loan to a consumer in another state, the loan is \"made in\" both states and it is up to the courts to determine which state's law applies on a case-by-case basis.\n\nDomenico rejected that view. While acknowledging Congress \"certainly could have been clearer regarding its intention,\" he noted a loan is made by the bank and not by the borrower. Therefore, the opt-out can only apply to Colorado banks, rather than any bank that lends to a Colorado consumer.\n\nHe blocked the state from enforcing its interest rate ceilings against out-of-state, state-chartered banks included in the plaintiffs' trade associations while the litigation unfolds.\n\nThe case is National Association of Industrial Bankers et al. v.

Weiser, et al., the lawsuit filed by three consumer financial services industry trade groups challenging Colorado's opt-out legislation, has granted the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction. As interpreted by the defendant State officials, Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 5-13-106 (Opt-out Law), ), which is due to take effect on July 1, purports to apply Colorado's interest rate and fee limits to interstate loans made by federally insured out-of-state state-chartered banks to Colorado borrowers. The preliminary injunction provides that Colorado is preliminarily enjoined from enforcing its interest rate and fee limits \"with respect to any loan made by the plaintiffs' members, to the extent the loan is not \"made in\" Colorado and the applicable interest rate in Section 1831d(a) exceeds the rate that would otherwise be permitted.\"\n\nThe law at issue in the case is the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980 (DIDMCA). Section 521 of DIDMCA (codified at 12 U.S.C. Section 1831d(a)) applies to insured state banks and tracks Section 85 of the National Bank Act, the statute establishing interest rate authority for national banks, generally allowing banks to charge interest at the rate allowed in the state of their location or a floating rate that is 1% above a prevailing Federal Reserve discount rate, whichever is higher, and preempts lower state law interest rate limits. In Marquette, a unanimous decision issued just 15 months prior to DIDMCA's enactment, the U.S. Supreme Court held that Section 85 allows national banks to \"export\" the rate authorized in states where they are located on loans made to borrowers in other states. Subsequent case law has construed DIDMCA Section 521 in pari materia with Section 85, thereby granting insured state banks the same rate exportation authority as national banks.\n\nSection 525 of DIDMCA allows states to enact laws opting out of Section 521's preemptive effect with respect to loans \"made in\" the enacting state. The novel question that the Colorado court was asked to decide is what it means for a loan to be \"made in\" in Colorado for purposes of the scope of Colorado's Opt-out Law or, more specifically, where a loan is \"made\" in the case of loans to Colorado residents by insured state banks located in other states. The court stated that \"[t]hese questions have yet to be decided by any court\" and \"have been open questions since the statute's inception.\"\n\nThe plaintiff industry groups contended that, for purposes of Section 525, loans to Colorado residents by insured state banks located in other states should be deemed \"made in\" the bank's home state or the state where key lending functions occur. Colorado argued that, for purposes of Section 525, a loan is \"made in\" both the borrower's state and the state where the lender is located. (The FDIC filed an amicus brief in support of Colorado taking the same position as to where a loan is made.)\n\nIn ruling on the plaintiffs' preliminary injunction motion, the court first rejected Colorado's arguments that the plaintiffs lacked standing, their claims were not ripe, and the plaintiffs' lawsuit could not proceed because there was no private right of action available to them to enforce the rights created by Section 521. The court gave two principal reasons for its conclusion that the plaintiffs had made a strong showing that they are substantially likely to succeed on the merits of their Section 521 claim.\n\nFirst, the court concluded that the plaintiffs' reading of \"loans made in\" Colorado found strong support in the plain language of Section 521 when viewed in the context of the statutory scheme as a whole. Colorado argued that a loan is \"made\" by both the bank and the borrower. The plaintiffs argued that, while a borrower \"obtains\" or \"receives\" a loan, only the bank \"makes\" a loan. The court found that the plaintiffs' view was \"more consistent both with the ordinary colloquial understanding of who 'makes' a loan, and, more importantly, with how the words 'make' and 'made' are used consistently throughout the text of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, including the [DIDMCA] amendments, as well as throughout the rest of Title 12 of the United States Code, which governs 'Banks and Banking' and includes the National Bank Act.\" More specifically, the court found that:\n\nTaken as a whole, the consistent use of \"make\" and \"made\" throughout the statutory text indicates that the plain and ordinary answer to the question of who \"makes\" a loan is the bank, not the borrower. It follows, then, that the answer to the question of where a loan is \"made\" depends on the location of the bank, and where the bank takes certain actions, but not on the location of the borrower who \"obtains\" or \"receives\" the loan. (emphasis included).\n\n*****\n\nThe plain language of Section 1831d's opt-out provision, viewed in the context of the statutory scheme as a whole, indicates that loans are 'made' by the bank, and that where a loan is 'made' does not depend on the location of the borrower.\n\nSecond, while commenting that the policy arguments and persuasive authorities cited by the parties were \"mostly inconclusive or irrelevant and therefore unhelpful,\" to the extent they shed light on the issues, the court found that they nevertheless provided support for the conclusion that loans are \"made\" by the bank and that where a loan is \"made\" depends on where the bank is located and takes various actions but not on the borrower's location. The court found that Colorado's and the FDIC's reliance on certain Dormant Commerce Clause cases was misplaced because \"they address the separate issue of when one state may constitutionally regulate an activity involving conduct that occurs in another state.\"\n\nThe court found that the plaintiffs satisfied the other requirements for a preliminary injunction. It found the plaintiffs had made a strong showing that their members would suffer irreparable harm if an injunction was not granted. The plaintiffs argued that absent an injunction, they would have to stop offering their loan products to certain Colorado customers and once gone, those customers and their goodwill, as well as the goodwill of the banks' business partners, might be gone forever, resulting in a type of intangible damages that may be incalculable and for which a monetary award could not provide adequate compensation.\n\nThe court also found that the balance of harms weighed in the plaintiffs' favor because national banks could continue making loans to Colorado residents with interest rates and fees above Colorado limits. The court concluded that because national banks could continue making such loans, the Opt-out Law would place plaintiffs' members at a disadvantage with respect to national banks while only providing marginally more protection from higher interest rates to Colorado residents. In addition, the court found that the public interest favored enjoining enforcement \"of likely invalid provisions of state law.\"\n\nBy its terms, the preliminary injunction appears to apply only to loans made by members of the three plaintiff trade groups. However, faced with the district court's well-reasoned opinion, we do not expect Colorado to initiate an action to enforce the Opt-out Law against a non-member insured state bank located in a state other than Colorado or for a plaintiff's attorney to initiate a class action on behalf of Colorado borrowers who obtain loans from such a non-member insured state bank. In any event, if an effort is made by other trade groups to have the preliminary injunction extended so that it applies to all insured state banks located in states other than Colorado, we would expect the district court to grant such relief.\n\nWe have previously blogged about bills introduced in several states that are similar to the Opt-out Law and purport to opt-out of Section 521 of DIDMCA. Hopefully, the Colorado opinion will give pause to legislators in those states who will realize that such legislation will only adversely affect state banks that are located in their states.\n\nColorado has 30 days to appeal the district court's decision to the Tenth Circuit.\n\nBallard Spahr, on behalf of the American Bankers Association and the Consumer Bankers Association, submitted an amicus brief in support of the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction.", "source": {"uri": "consumerfinancemonitor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Consumer Finance Monitor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injunction", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Injunction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debtor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Debtor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plaintiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depository_Institutions_Deregulation_and_Monetary_Control_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_12_of_the_United_States_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Title 12 of the United States Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Case law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Bank_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Bank Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codification_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Codification (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_preemption", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal preemption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statutory_interpretation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Statutory interpretation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cause_of_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cause of action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amicus_curiae", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amicus curiae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Deposit_Insurance_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/College_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/College Financing", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://images.bannerbear.com/direct/y0aJ23zRDdqMxX4OGl/requests/000/058/503/814/0eb715rd3zL4k9b5zBPpEmKay/bda57c25c3afb5cea7cbb608163c70555b42204f.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669458", "eventUri": "eng-9669458", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 386, "textEnd": 392}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

Granting plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, U.S. District Judge Daniel D. Domenico found that the trade groups \"have made a strong showing that they are substantially likely to succeed on the merits of their preemption claim.\"\n\nThe new law, HB23-1229, was scheduled to take effect on July 1, 2024. It was enacted as part of a campaign to curb \"predatory\" lending by banks outside Colorado. But as explained in plaintiffs' complaint and injunction motion, the cap on interest rates imposed by the new law applies far more broadly than Congress intended -- to banks outside Colorado -- and is therefore inconsistent with the federal Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980 (DIDMCA) and undermines the competitive position of community banks. It also won't advance the state's goals since, as the decision granting an injunction points out, Colorado's law would not have applied to national banks.\n\nPlaintiffs' members include responsible, ethical state-chartered banks that offer a wide variety of useful, familiar, everyday credit products to Colorado consumers, including personal installment loans, \"buy now, pay later\" (BNPL) loans, vehicle financing, and store-branded credit cards.\n\nThe three trade organizations are represented by a team of lawyers from Davis Wright Tremaine LLP, Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, and Holland & Knight LLP.\n\nAbout American Financial Services Association\n\nFounded in 1916, AFSA is the primary trade association for the consumer credit industry, protecting access to credit and consumer choice.

Though the broader lawsuit will continue, Domenico ruled that Colorado lawmakers' effort to cap interest rates on certain loans made by banks located outside of the state likely violates federal law.\n\nThe Colorado Attorney General's Office, which defended the law, declined to comment Thursday, citing the ongoing litigation.\n\nThe three groups that sued to block provisions of the law -- the National Association of Industrial Bankers, the American Financial Services Association and the American Fintech Council -- called the ruling \"a major victory\" in a statement Thursday. They filed their suit in March.\n\nThe ruling, which is temporary while the rest of the suit proceeds, does not fully block the law. But it prevents the state from enforcing the law's limits on alternative charge loans -- a cousin to payday loans -- that are undertaken by Colorado residents but provided by banks located elsewhere.

{"id": 223668456, "title": "Sky Sports F1 pundit shares \"what we've heard\" about Lewis Hamilton in Monaco", "text": "Jenson Button has claimed Lewis Hamilton agreed to let George Russell have upgrades this weekend, after appearing to complain about the situation after qualifying. Hamilton was seventh quickest on Saturday and will start the Monaco Grand Prix two places behind his Mercedes team-mate. Afterwards, he was quick to point out that Russell was the one with the higher spec car. He said: \"I anticipated it would be difficult to outqualify George because he has the upgraded component, but it's just great to see that we are bringing upgrades. I already know automatically that I'm going to lose two-tenths going into qualifying. That's definitely frustrating. Hamilton, who has only beaten Russell once in Grand Prix qualifying so far this year, also said he expects that trend to continue and added: \"I don't anticipate being ahead of George in qualifying particularly this year, but we've just got to just keep pushing and the races are strong.\" The seven-time F1 champion simply smiled and said: \"We'll see,\" when asked why he believes that will be the case. Some felt he may have been implying some favouritism within the team, given he is leaving for Ferrari at the end of the year. Hamilton's former McLaren team-mate Button, though, does not believe that is the case. Speaking in his role as a pundit for Sky Sports F1, the 2009 drivers' champion explained his understanding of the situation and why Russell was the one to use the new front wing instead of his team-mate. He said: \"From what we've heard, they made the decision between them for who was going to use the front wing. He didn't want to go from qualifying, and possibly damage it, and then have to start at the back with a new front wing for the race which is a different component.\" Whether or not Mercedes have begun to show signs of favouritism, Hamilton's impending exit makes it only natural that Russell will be the focus as the season progresses. And Button's Sky colleague Naomi Schiff pointed that out as she reflected on Hamilton's situation. She said: \"Lewis alluded to it there that [Russell] does have new component on his car which I think is quite an interesting factor. Lewis has been the number one driver at that team for many, many years. He's the most successful driver in Formula 1 at the moment. The psychology behind becoming the driver who is not favoured must be new territory for Lewis that he's probably not used to. \"I think that's probably a tough pill to swallow, although I am sure he is understanding of the situation. But we have to say George, hats off, not just because he has that component on the car but he didn't have a smooth run through practice, issues with the car, he didn't get quite as many laps as the others so to bounce back is a great job done.\"", "summary": "Lewis Hamilton was out-qualified again by Mercedes team-mate George Russell in Monaco and, after the session, pointed to the fact his fellow Briton had an upgraded car", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/formula-1/lewis-hamilton-monaco-mercedes-button-32895930", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32895859.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_F1-Grand-Prix-of-Monaco-Qualifying.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 12:02:39", "author": "Daniel Moxon,Daniel-moxon", "authors": ["Daniel Moxon", "Daniel-moxon"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.18}

The deal will pay him an average annual salary of $1.3 million.\"\n\nThe deal with Xhekaj is the second significant transaction this July for the Canadiens, who also inked forward Juraj Slafkovsk\u00fd to an eight-year contract worth $60.8 million earlier in the month.\n\nXhekaj appeared in 44 games with Montreal in the 2023-24 NHL regular season and recorded three goals to go with seven assists for 10 points. Although he had more goals and assists in the 2022-23 campaign, Xhekaj showed improvement in his second year in the show. For one, he had a plus-6 last season while he was a minus-9 in 2022-23.\n\nMoreover, his even-strength Corsi For percentage (48.7), Fenwick For percentage (48.5), and PDO (102.9) in his second season in the NHL were all better than the ones he recorded in his first campaign in the league.\n\nXhekaj also saw action for 17 games last season with the Laval Rocket of the American Hockey League, recording three goals and 11 points in those contests.\n\nThe Canadiens see potential in Xhekaj, who will be turning 24 years old in January. There is plenty of room to grow for him, and if he takes a big leap in the 2023-24 NHL season, his newest deal could turn out to be among the best bargains in the league.\n\nOne area Xhekaj can definitely improve on is the penalties aspect, as highlighted in this player card from JFresh:\n\n\"Arber Xhekaj, signed 2x$1.3M by MTL, is a physical depth defenceman. He has some sneaky puck skills, making transition plays with possession at very high rates, but also has taken minor penalties at the highest clip in the NHL since entering the league. #GoHabsGo\"\n\nAfter making a move on Xhekaj, the Canadiens are left with a current cap space of $6.602 million, per PuckPedia. They also have one more spot on the active roster.\n\nCanadiens fans, social media react to Arber Xhekaj's new contract\n\n\"Sounds like Xhekaj accepted a 2yr hoping to prove his worth once deal is over. Sounds like we'll be seeing Arber's best efforts for the 2 next seasons. CONGRATS!!\" said @HabsHappy.\n\n\"I will say this again and die on a hill defending it: Arber brings to the Canadiens exactly what Shea Weber was giving to the team in his last 2-3 years. Only difference is, one has personality and is a fan favorite. The other was the GM's dream boy.\" - @TripleX137\n\n\"Wow, what a bargain I would have given him more term- need someone to protect all the stars upcoming\" - @HabsDPA\n\n\"Solid AAV for the next two years, giving Xhekaj ample time to show the organization he's deserving a long-term deal. Got to be honest, I thought this number was going to be closer to $2M, so getting him at $1.3M is quite interesting. Lots of cap space still to play with.\" - @mndamico\n\n\"Nice deal here for Arber. Short term very solid cap hit for a player that will be looking to earn a long-term contract on a crowded blue-line.

Xhekaj and his agent were likely looking for more than the $2.6 million the Canadiens gave them, but his recent injuries were concerning. Xhekaj has gone under the knife two times over the past two seasons. He has trouble with his shoulders, needing to repair his right one in 2022-23 and his left one this past offseason. The injuries caused him to play 95 games out of 164 over the last two seasons.\n\nXhekaj was instantly a fan favorite during his 2022-23 debut, but it wasn't for the points he put on the board. He had a respectable five goals and eight assists in his rookie season but just three goals and seven assists this past year. Xhekaj's value isn't the offensive side. It's his role as the Habs' enforcer on the back end. He won't turn down a fight against any combatant and brings pain to the opposing team with crushing body checks.\n\nThe Canadiens were unsure of their future with Xhekaj, as they have an abundance of defensive depth in their pipeline. The Canadiens have Kaiden Guhle, Jordan Harris, Mike Matheson, Lane Hutson, Adam Engstrom, and Jayden Struble on the left side of their defense. Most of these players will soon be ready to play full-time minutes in the NHL and have plenty of depth on the right side. Mike Matheson likely won't get another contract with Montreal, but there are still a lot of players that Xhekaj has to fend off.\n\nArber Xhekaj relies on a bounceback\n\nIt's admirable that Xhekaj has enough self-belief to bet on himself and take a team-friendly deal. Xhekaj will try to prove to the Canadiens brass that his shoulder issues are a thing of the past and that he will be able to give them a successful season. The issue for Xhekaj is the depth coming behind him could push him out of the Canadiens' lineup if he has one little falter.\n\nThe big question is whether Xhekaj can remain healthy. The injury issues aren't freak accidents. It's due to his bruising style of play. He won't avoid wear and tear on his shoulders with how he plays, as he throws over three hits per game. Pair the high hit totals with his fights, and it's a recipe for re-aggravating his shoulder injuries.\n\nThe good thing for Xhekaj is that even if the Canadiens move on from him in two seasons, there will always be a front office that values what he can bring. Some old-school hockey minds will see a modern-day enforcer and pay him a substantial sum to anchor their backend.\n\nThe Canadiens view Xhekaj as a great fit\n\nThe Canadiens are forming a highly skilled unit in their forward and defense groups. Their drafting of Ivan Demidov and Michael Hage this past offseason improved their offensive outlook on the rebuild. They also have skilled defenders like Lane Hutson and David Reinbacher. All these players will be valuable pieces for the Canadiens, but there isn't much sandpaper in their game.\n\nXhekaj is a valuable player to have patrolling the ice, even if it's in a limited role on the third pair. Opposing players will think twice about physically intimidating some of the Canadiens' stars if they have a player like Xhekaj to answer to. At a certain point, the Canadiens must decide if Xhekaj's inconsistencies with his health are worth keeping him around for the intimidation factor, but for now, he is a good fit.\n\nArber Xhekaj will have suitors\n\nXhekaj was likely comfortable with taking a short-term team-friendly deal because he knows there will be interested teams if the Canadiens move on in two years. If you believe the rumors, plenty of teams asked Kent Hughes about Xhekaj's availability this offseason. However, the contract that Xhekaj signed will still make him a restricted free agent when it expires. The Canadiens will be in full control of Xhekaj's fate, which is the biggest downfall of this contract for the player.\n\nXhekaj and his agent likely wish they could have gotten enough term to take them into his unrestricted free-agent season. Kent Hughes was able to get Xhekaj on a team-friendly deal, and also maintain control of the contract through the renewal season. The contract extension is a big win in the Canadiens' front office. It's no big surprise that Xhekaj did the Canadiens a favor. He seems like a low-maintenance player, happy to be playing in the best league in the world. For a player who worked at Costco during the pandemic without plans for his hockey future, a $2.6 million contract must feel like he broke the bank four years later.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nate_duffett@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Nate Duffett", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arber_Xhekaj", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arber Xhekaj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_Canadiens", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Montreal Canadiens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Matheson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mike Matheson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assist (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lane_Hutson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lane Hutson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcer_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Enforcer (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenceman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defenceman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Harris_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Harris (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiden_Guhle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kaiden Guhle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Montreal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montreal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Reinbacher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Reinbacher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Hughes_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kent Hughes (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restricted_free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Restricted free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forward (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice_Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice Hockey", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/History", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Grading-Arber-Xhekajs-2-year-contract-extension-with-Canadiens.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776367", "eventUri": "eng-9776367", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

He also played 17 games for the Laval Rocket, the Canadiens American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, where he had three goals and eight assists for 11 points.\n\nAt 6-foot-4, 240-pounds, he brings a physical style of play to the Canadiens' blue line that can be seen in some of his other numbers. Despite only playing just over half a season's worth of games with Montreal this season, Xhekaj led the team in penalty minutes (81) and hits (125).\n\nThe Habs lock down a key defenseman as they assemble a quality blue line for future contention. This style of play has been costly at times - his season came to an early end due to a left shoulder surgery. He had a right shoulder injury the season before.

This announcement has been met with enthusiasm from Habs fans, particularly given the uncertainty surrounding Xhekaj's future with the team just a year ago.\n\nBut, does this new extension mean that trade talks will go away? Considering almost every team seems to have a mandate to find their version of Arber Xhekaj, not only will trade talks probably not go away, but they may only intensify.\n\nDuring the 2023-24 campaign, Xhekaj's name surfaced in trade discussions, with reports indicating that the Philadelphia Flyers were interested in acquiring him. NHL insider Elliotte Friedman noted on his \"32 Thoughts\" podcast that the Canadiens had fielded calls about Xhekaj, suggesting that he had garnered attention from multiple teams. However, Montreal opted to retain the young defenseman, and this decision appears to have paid off.\n\nXhekaj burst onto the scene after signing with the Canadiens in October 2021, making a name for himself with his physical style of play and ability to contribute offensively. Despite experiencing a bump in the road in terms of his development, he remains a valuable depth defenseman for the Canadiens. His overall contributions have earned him a reputation as part of the heart and soul of the team, and who doesn't want that? Ask any NHL club if they could use a tough, young, relatively skilled glue guy and they'll ask what you want for him.\n\nXhekaj's new contract is seen as a solid investment for the Canadiens. At $1.3 million per year, it represents a bargain for a player with his potential. The deal not only secures his presence on the roster but also opens up future trade possibilities if the Canadiens choose to explore that route. And, considering where the team is at and what Kent Hughes might have up his sleeve, it's hard to know what moves he's willing to make if there's a potential splash available.\n\nRelated: NHL Rumors: Oilers, Sabres, Jets, Panthers, Canadiens\n\nShould Montreal decide to trade Xhekaj down the line, his manageable contract would make him an attractive asset for other teams. Frankly, no one should be surprised if the Flyers show a renewed interest in an attempt to bolster their defense after recently acquiring young defenseman Jamie Drysdale.\n\nWhile the Canadiens may have chosen not to trade Xhekaj last season, the possibility of future trade discussions cannot be ignored. If his performance continues to improve, other teams may once again come knocking. If the Canadiens see an opportunity to move him while selling high, they may do so. For now, the Canadiens have made the right call by keeping him and securing a team-friendly deal that benefits both parties.\n\nXhekaj's journey to the NHL is remarkable. He's not likely to ever become a Norris Trophy candidate, but to go undrafted, work in a Costco during the shut-down in the Ontario Hockey League (OHL), and then burst onto the scene in the NHL is the kind of story NHL teams love. He defied the odds by carving out a spot with the Canadiens after just one training camp and this unique achievement highlights his determination and talent. This is not a player you bet against, it's someone you bet on.\n\nScouts across the NHL are continually on the lookout for players like Xhekaj. He brings a combination of grit, skill, and character to the ice. His ability to impact a game goes beyond just physicality; he has proven that he can contribute to the team in various ways. His new deal is the kind that can be easily moved in the right circumstances. He lacks trade protection, he's an RFA at the end of the term, and his qualifying offer is only $1.3 million. It's the kind of deal that will inevitably garner trade attention.", "source": {"uri": "thehockeywriters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hockey Writers"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jim_parsons@thehockeywriters.com", "name": "Jim Parsons", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arber_Xhekaj", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arber Xhekaj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenceman", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Defenceman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_Canadiens", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Montreal Canadiens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliotte_Friedman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elliotte Friedman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Flyers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Flyers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Montreal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montreal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Hughes_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kent Hughes (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Drysdale", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Drysdale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Norris_Memorial_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Norris Memorial Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restricted_free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Restricted free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario_Hockey_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ontario Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice_Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice Hockey", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://s3951.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Arber-Xhekaj-Canadiens-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776367", "eventUri": "eng-9776367", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

And two years later, he's signed a two-year, $2.6-milliom contract that will keep him in the Bleu, Blanc, et Rouge for the next couple of seasons.\n\nXhekaj is a force of nature physically, and that's what he will always be known for. There have been ongoing conversations around hockey in the last few years about whether a purely physical presence in the lineup is needed, with players such as Xhekaj and New York Rangers' winger Matt Rempe becoming prominent names in the NHL.\n\nThe logical answer to that question is that having a player like that is great when they can be a functional member of your team and you don't have to worry about whether they are going to get caved in on every shift. (We're looking at you, Ryan Reaves).\n\nXhekaj can be that player for the Canadiens.\n\nHe's shown some ability to be a solid defensive player, using his physicality to close out and kill play along the boards. The brutish blueliner can struggle at times when pivoting and chasing down pucks dumped behind him, but Xhekaj always works to get himself back into the play if he's losing the race. He may not be an elite defender, but he seems to do well in a depth role.\n\nWhen Xhekaj keeps things simple on the breakout, he can get the puck to the young skilled forwards that Montreal's assembling, such as Nick Suzuki, Juraj Slafkovsky and eventually, top prospect Ivan Demidov.\n\nXhekaj has also shown a willingness to get involved as a puck carrier or support skater in transition at times, but it's certainly not a consistent part of his game.\n\nIn the offensive zone, there may be a bit of room for growth. His aggressive nature in all facets of the game may give him the best chance to grow in the attacking end. In his final OHL playoff with the Hamilton Bulldogs, he was nearly a point-per-game player, which was a huge step up from his regular-season production.\n\nWhen he went down to the AHL for the first time in his career this past season, he showed quite a bit more offensively with 11 points in 17 games by simply asserting himself. He didn't quite do that when he returned to the NHL after his AHL stint, but the ability is there.

He is already a useful NHLer who can make plays at both ends of the ice.\n\nEven if he never takes a big step offensively, showing he has that in his bag at times would be a huge win for the Habs.

Shortly after announcing a new contract for defenseman Arber Xhekaj, the team announced another young defender inked a new deal.\n\nThe Canadiens and Justin Barron agreed to a two-year contract, keeping the 22-year-old defenseman in Montreal through the 2025-2026 season. The deal is worth a total $2.3 million, with an average annual. value of $1.15 million. The Canadiens shared the news and contract details in a recent press release.\n\nBarron was originally selected by the Colorado Avalanche in the first round of the 2020 NHL Draft, after a successful run in the QMJHL. The right-handed blueliner was acquired by the Canadiens in exchange for forward Artturi Lekhonen in 2022, and he's been improving slowly but surely in Montreal. 2024 could be the season he plays 82 games in a more prominent role with the Canadiens.\n\nHe played 48 games in the NHL last season, the most time he's spent at the top level as a professional. He began the season with the AHL team, the Laval Rockets, scoring 11 points over 32 games. Once he was recalled to the Habs, he had an even more impressive offensive output. He scored seven goals, added six assists, and averaged over 18 minutes of ice time.\n\nOver his brief career, he's already played 94 NHL games. He has 12 goals and 30 points over parts of four seasons in the league with the Avalanche and Canadiens.\n\nHeading into next season, he could be in line for a larger role with the Habs. He's a strong skater, can log minutes already, and is improving offensively. If the Canadiens are going to improve their place in the league standings, Justin Barron will be a huge part of their ascension.\n\nMake sure you bookmark Breakaway OnSI for the latest news, exclusive interviews, recruiting coverage, and more!", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jacob_punturi@si.com", "name": "Jacob Punturi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenceman", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Defenceman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arber_Xhekaj", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arber Xhekaj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_Canadiens", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Montreal Canadiens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Montreal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montreal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Barron", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Barron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Avalanche", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Avalanche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHL_Entry_Draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NHL Entry Draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forward (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec_Major_Junior_Hockey_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quebec Major Junior Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Hockey_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laval,_Quebec", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laval, Quebec"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3215,h_1808,x_0,y_282/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/breakaway_on_si/01j42am4hf8ean4hg0d2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776367", "eventUri": "eng-9776367", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Meanwhile, before signing with the Carolina Hurricanes, there were trade offers on the table for Martin Necas from both the Buffalo Sabres and Winnipeg Jets. Is Aaron Ekblad a possible trade option out of Florida? Finally, how good a deal did the Montreal Canadiens get on the Arber Xhekaj extension?\n\nMonday afternoon, Bob Stauffer of Oilers Now and the Edmonton Oilers radio broadcast teams said he talked with Mike Liut from Octagon, the agency representing Leon Draisaitl. He indicated that in those conversations, Liut, Andy Scott, and Draisaitl are looking to finalize an eight-year deal. The belief is that the contract will fall between $13 and $13.5 million per season.\n\nAt a minimum, it could be a seven-year extension, but both sides will likely go eight to cap the annual cap hit down. Stauffer drew parallels with the contracts of Patrick Kane and Jonathan Toews, who interestingly both signed their eight-year, $10.5 million deals with then-GM Stan Bowman in Chicago.\n\nBowman said in his introductory media scrum, \"Starting with Leon, I mean, Leon's a star player and he's top priority for me. I mean, I want to, I want Leon to be an Oiler for life.\" If he's looking at an eight-year deal, this will nearly take Draisaitl to the end of his NHL career.\n\nMartin Necas is staying with the Carolina Hurricanes, after signing a two-year extension worth $13 million. Before the new deal, it has emerged that the Hurricanes were close to trading Necas twice this offseason. According to Frank Seravalli, reporting on The Daily Faceoff Podcast, the Winnipeg Jets and Buffalo Sabres both made serious attempts to acquire the 25-year-old forward.\n\nRelated: 4 Reasons the Buffalo Sabres Can Make the Playoffs\n\nThe Jets reportedly offered a package including promising prospects Rutger McGroarty, Cole Perfetti, and a draft pick. McGroarty, currently playing in the NCAA, has been looking for a move elsewhere, while Perfetti, a 22-year-old with 140 NHL games and 38 points this season, has faced inconsistent playing time in Winnipeg. Despite the enticing offer, the trade fell through, potentially due to Necas's reluctance to sign an extension with the Jets.\n\nSimilarly, the Sabres had a trade agreement with Carolina that also collapsed. Seravalli noted that Necas's refusal to sign with Buffalo ultimately killed the deal. With his new contract, Necas will become a UFA in two years, giving him the chance to explore free agency. He could be in line for a massive raise if he plays well in Carolina.\n\nEntering the final season of his contract with a $7.5 million AAV, defenseman Aaron Ekblad could be on the move if GM Bill Zito decides to be proactive before the trade deadline. Adam Proteau of The Hockey News argues that despite being hampered by injuries since 2018-19, the 28-year-old right-shot defenseman still holds considerable trade value. Zito, known for making bold moves, might consider trading Ekblad.\n\nThis isn't the first time Ekblad has been mentioned in trade rumors since early June. However, now that the Panthers are without Brandon Montour and Oliver Ekman-Larsson, it's hard to imagine a scenario where the Panthers trade Ekblad without knowing they have another defenseman or two coming in. Not to mention, even though Ekblad's full no-movement clause converted to a 12-team no-trade list on July 1, he's still going to be tough to trade considering his salary.\n\nThe Montreal Canadiens have signed defenseman Arber Xhekaj to a two-year, $2.6 million contract extension, averaging $1.3 million annually. This deal is highly favorable for the Canadiens. Xhekaj, known for his physical play and sneaky puck skills, excels in making transition plays at high rates. Despite taking minor penalties frequently, his overall contributions make him a valuable depth defenseman. There was a time when Xhekaj was considering an up-and-coming star defenseman. His career got slightly derailed, but he's back on the upswing.\n\nLast season, Xhekaj played 44 games, effectively filling a role on the third pairing. His performance and potential growth make the $1.3 million AAV a bargain for the Canadiens, ensuring they retain a promising player at a reasonable cost.", "source": {"uri": "thehockeywriters.com",

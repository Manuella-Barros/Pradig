This does not say much for these MPs' belief in Conservative values, which perhaps goes to the crux of the problem with the present Government.\n\nJonathan Mann\n\nGunnislake, Cornwall\n\nSIR - When will MPs understand that they are chosen by voters to represent them, and not to grandstand on their own personal views?\n\nChristopher Turner-Hawkes\n\nKingsbridge, Devon\n\nSIR - There is an argument seeking to gain ground that Tory MPs are better qualified to choose the leader of the party than members. Presumably Natalie Elphicke and her like would've preferred Sir Keir Starmer for this post.\n\nSebastian Neville-Clarke\n\nVines Cross, East Sussex\n\nSIR - I would encourage many more of the socialists in the Conservative Party to defect. Then we may actually be left with MPs who are truly conservative.\n\nStephen Lally\n\nBerkhamsted, Hertfordshire\n\nSIR - Penelope Upton (Letters, May 8) blames Boris Johnson for the decline of the Conservative Party.\n\nThis did not begin when he started campaigning to leave the EU, but with David Cameron's half-heartedness over Brexit. That was when the modern Tory party started to diverge from its grassroots supporters, and the process has continued, leading to the situation our Government now finds itself in.\n\nIf anyone deserves blame, it is the man who is now Foreign Secretary.\n\nAndrew Pearce\n\nLondon SE3\n\nSIR - Although Rob Mason (Letters, May 7) is correct in identifying the sacking of Boris Johnson as the start of the collapse in Conservative support, there have been several other milestones along the way.\n\nVirtually all the top Conservative supporters of Brexit - Dominic Raab, Priti Patel, Suella Braverman and others - have fallen by the wayside, most of them victims of smears by a Civil Service that cannot forgive those responsible for taking us out of the EU. Unless and until the public sector, including the judiciary, is returned to taking a neutral stance on all political matters, we are heading for permanent Left-wing government, irrespective of which party is in power.\n\nAfter 50 years of voting Conservative, I'll be voting for Reform UK next time around, because, although it will not gain power or even get more than one or two MPs, it is at least the only party that proposes to tackle the root causes of the nation's decline.\n\nDr Chris Topping\n\nPilling, Lancashire\n\nReligion in schools\n\nSIR - I disagree with Vincent Hearne (Letters, May 7) that religion has no place in schools. In 1978, when I was 10, we had one religious education period a week. Each lesson was dedicated to a specific religion and gave a great insight into other faiths.\n\nWhere I was schooled was not particularly multicultural at the time, but the lessons stood me in good stead to have an understanding of other religions throughout my travels and in our now more diverse country. Do not keep religion in homes and places of worship - it only creates divisions.\n\nRob Williamson\n\nLockerbie, Dumfriesshire\n\nSIR - Nick Kester (Letters, May 4) says religion is private. I'd suggest he walks from Victoria Station in London towards Westminster Cathedral. Further down, almost at the Houses of Parliament - where Disraeli, of Jewish birth, could enter only as a baptised Anglican - he'll see Methodist Central Hall on his left, and Westminster Abbey diagonally opposite.\n\nThese three buildings contain in their walls so much of what is necessary to understand the social history of this country.\n\nJacqueline Castles\n\nLondon W2\n\nSafer van-driving\n\nSIR - Celia Walden (Features, May 7) is right that the law needs to be updated to deal with dangerous cyclists.\n\nThere is another matter that would benefit from re-examination - the fact that multi-drop van drivers of vehicles under 3.5 tons do not get the same work breaks as their HGV counterparts.\n\nThere has been a huge increase in van traffic over the past decade. Many drivers are put under pressure to speed so they can complete their rounds, which often involve more than 100 drops. This is inevitably stressful and can lead to tired drivers making errors of judgment, resulting in serious injuries or deaths. Some might argue that a change in the law would increase costs, but it would lead to safer roads.\n\nGraham Ashen\n\nHorsham, West Sussex\n\nGarrick membership\n\nSIR - It was encouraging that as many as 40 per cent of Garrick Club members voted to maintain its male-only membership (report, May 8). There are other gentlemen's clubs which still value tradition and would welcome such men of distinction.\n\nAlternatively, they could set up their own club to stand as a symbol of defiance against mindless change.\n\nCharles Simon\n\nLeicester\n\nSIR - I see nothing wrong with having clubs that only admit men (or women).\n\nIf the Garrick's decision were in any way influenced by some quasi-moral attachment to a \"woke\" agenda and concern for the opinion of the chattering classes, it is a pity. I have always seen much wisdom in Millwall's (unofficial) apophthegm: \"No one likes us, we don't care\".\n\nAndrew Newcombe KC\n\nCombe Down, Somerset\n\nApostrophe's end\n\nSIR - Apostrophes are to be phased out of street signs in North Yorkshire because they \"negatively affect geographic databases\" (report, May 8).\n\nShould my town - at the northernmost point of the settled Roman Empire, where the steam engine was invented and the Scottish Railway Museum has its home - be alarmed?\n\nDr Andy Ashworth\n\nBo'ness, West Lothian\n\nThe fruits of competitive beard-growing\n\nSIR - To lighten the gloom of the Covid lockdown - and not having to worry about sartorial standards - a beard-growing competition was announced at work (Letters, May 8).\n\nHaving never progressed beyond a five o'clock shadow in 57 years, I was unsure what the result might be. To my surprise, I ended up with a Brian Blessed-sized beard, which, having been tamed, I shall take with me to my grave. It was initially a superb disguise, and, more importantly, saves me hours, if not days, each year thanks to not having to shave.\n\nRoger Wilson\n\nCharter Alley, Hampshire\n\nSIR - I grew a beard in a competition on board HMS Sheffield on the way to the Gulf in 1981. The efforts of the ship's company were judged by the captain on Christmas Day in Oman.\n\nMost participants shaved theirs off as soon as the judging was over, but I elected to retain mine until my wife had seen it.\n\nThe wardroom ran a book on how long my beard would last when she made its acquaintance. Most people were betting in minutes and seconds, but 43 years later it is still with me, albeit considerably more grey.\n\nRobert Rowley\n\nBere Alston, Devon\n\nGardening fashions squeezing out songbirds\n\nSIR - Instead of blaming cats for the disappearance of songbirds (Letters, May 8), Natural England should take more notice of the way gardens are changing. Low-maintenance gardens and artificial grass certainly don't help.\n\nIn my neighbourhood, when properties with front gardens are sold, the new owners invariably make parking space their priority, leaving minimal greenery. Birds need hedges and shrubs as well as clean bowls of water, which not enough of us provide.\n\nDiana R Lord\n\nBarnet, Hertfordshire\n\nSIR - Natural England may wish to reflect on its own recent actions. After a legal challenge, the general licences - under which most of the management of the major pest species in agricultural settings is performed - were made much more restrictive with respect to magpies. The effect of this has been to halt almost all culling of those birds. Where one once saw individuals or pairs of birds, groups of eight or 10 birds are now common.\n\nI have no particular affection or otherwise for magpies, but we can hardly be surprised that songbird populations continue to suffer when the population of magpies has been allowed to increase in this way.\n\nAdam Herrick\n\nSawston, Cambridgeshire\n\nLetters to the Editor\n\nWe accept letters by email and post.

This does not say much for these MPs' belief in Conservative values, which perhaps goes to the crux of the problem with the present Government.\n\nJonathan Mann\n\nGunnislake, Cornwall\n\nSIR - When will MPs understand that they are chosen by voters to represent their constituents, and not to grandstand about their own personal views?\n\nChristopher Turner-Hawkes\n\nKingsbridge, Devon\n\nSIR - There is an argument seeking to gain ground that Tory MPs are better qualified to choose the leader of the party than members. Presumably Natalie Elphicke and her like would've preferred Sir Keir Starmer for this post.\n\nSebastian Neville-Clarke\n\nVines Cross, East Sussex\n\nSIR - I would encourage many more in the Conservative Party to defect. Then we may actually be left with MPs who are truly conservative.\n\nStephen Lally\n\nBerkhamsted, Hertfordshire\n\nSIR - Penelope Upton (Letters, May 8) blames Boris Johnson for the decline of the Conservative Party.\n\nThis did not begin when he started campaigning to leave the EU, but with David Cameron's half-heartedness over Brexit. That was when the modern Tory party started to diverge from its grassroots supporters, and the process has continued, leading to the situation our Government now finds itself in.\n\nIf anyone deserves blame, it is the man who is now Foreign Secretary.\n\nAndrew Pearce\n\nLondon SE3\n\nSIR - Although Rob Mason (Letters, May 7) is correct in identifying the toppling of Boris Johnson as the start of the collapse in Conservative support, there have been several other milestones along the way.\n\nVirtually all the top Conservative supporters of Brexit - Dominic Raab, Priti Patel, Suella Braverman and others - have fallen by the wayside, most of them victims of smears by a Civil Service that cannot forgive those responsible for taking us out of the EU. Unless and until the public sector, including the judiciary, is returned to taking a neutral stance on all political matters, we are heading for permanent Left-wing government, irrespective of which party is in power.\n\nAfter 50 years of voting Conservative, I'll be voting for Reform UK next time around, because, although it will not gain power or even get more than one or two MPs, it is at least the only party that proposes to tackle the root causes of the nation's decline.\n\nDr Chris Topping\n\nPilling, Lancashire\n\nReligion in schools\n\nSIR - I disagree with Vincent Hearne (Letters, May 7) that religion has no place in schools. In 1978, when I was 10, we had one religious education period a week. Each lesson was dedicated to a specific religion and gave a great insight into other faiths.\n\nWhere I was schooled was not particularly multicultural at the time, but the lessons stood me in good stead to have an understanding of other religions throughout my travels and in our now more diverse country. Do not keep religion in homes and places of worship - this only creates divisions.\n\nRob Williamson\n\nLockerbie, Dumfriesshire\n\nSIR - Nick Kester (Letters, May 4) says religion is private. I'd suggest he walks from Victoria Station in London towards Westminster Cathedral. Further down, almost at the Houses of Parliament - where Disraeli, of Jewish birth, could enter only as a baptised Anglican - he'll see Methodist Central Hall on his left, and Westminster Abbey diagonally opposite.\n\nThese three buildings contain in their walls so much of what is necessary to understand the social history of this country.\n\nJacqueline Castles\n\nLondon W2\n\nSafer van-driving\n\nSIR - Celia Walden (Features, May 7) is right that the law needs to be updated to deal with dangerous cyclists.\n\nThere is another matter that would benefit from re-examination - the fact that multi-drop van drivers of vehicles under 3.5 tons do not get the same work breaks as their HGV counterparts.\n\nThere has been a huge increase in van traffic over the past decade. Many drivers are put under pressure to speed so they can complete their rounds, which often involve more than 100 drops. This is inevitably stressful and can lead to tired drivers making errors of judgment, resulting in serious injuries or deaths. Some might argue that a change in the law would increase costs, but it would lead to safer roads.\n\nGraham Ashen\n\nHorsham, West Sussex\n\nGarrick membership\n\nSIR - It was encouraging that as many as 40 per cent of Garrick Club members voted to maintain its male-only membership (report, May 8). There are other gentlemen's clubs which still value tradition and would welcome such men of distinction.\n\nAlternatively, they could set up their own club to stand as a symbol of defiance against mindless change.\n\nCharles Simon\n\nLeicester\n\nSIR - I see nothing wrong with having clubs that only admit men (or women).\n\nIf the Garrick's decision were in any way influenced by some quasi-moral attachment to a \"woke\" agenda and concern for the opinion of the chattering classes, it is a pity. I have always seen much wisdom in Millwall's (unofficial) apophthegm: \"No one likes us, we don't care\".\n\nAndrew Newcombe KC\n\nCombe Down, Somerset\n\nApostrophe's end\n\nSIR - Apostrophes are to be phased out of street signs in North Yorkshire because they \"negatively affect geographic databases\" (report, May 8).\n\nShould my town - at the northernmost point of the settled Roman Empire, where the steam engine was invented and the Scottish Railway Museum has its home - be alarmed?\n\nDr Andy Ashworth\n\nBo'ness, West Lothian\n\nDiversity dividends\n\nSIR - Lucy Burton (\"Why bosses are 'getting nervous' about the corporate diversity drive\", telegraph.co.uk, May 6) highlights worrying evidence that workplace Diversity Equity and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives may be falling out of favour in Britain.\n\nCompanies may understandably feel concerned about saying \"the wrong thing\" when it comes to DEI, so it's no surprise that some have chosen to keep their heads down. However, ignoring DEI only perpetuates the injustice that the corporate world is not as diverse as the society it serves. For example, The Pipeline's annual \"Women Count\" report revealed that only 9 per cent of the FTSE 350 have a female CEO. Moreover, women continue to be paid less than their male peers. Analysis of data from the Office for National Statistics by PwC suggests that it will be decades before the gender pay gap is eliminated.\n\nNow is not the time to step back from DEI. Instead, businesses should focus on programmes that build a strong, inclusive pipeline of talent through their ranks, all the way to the most senior roles. There is a wealth of untapped talent that, with the right support, could reap dividends.\n\nProfessor Geeta Nargund\n\nChair, The Pipeline\n\nLondon W1\n\nGaza war legacy\n\nSIR - You can destroy Hamas militants, but you cannot destroy the ideas that cause Hamas to exist.\n\nSadly, the way Israel is treating Gazans (report, May 8) will ensure that Hamas or a similar organisation will live on and cause further problems.\n\nColonel David P Dunseath\n\nWestbury, Wiltshire\n\nLoan drinker\n\nSIR - Having passed my final dentist's examinations at Guy's Hospital in 1985, I joined a long queue of successful candidates at the local branch of NatWest the next day, in order to secure bank loans.\n\nI was delighted to be offered a whisky (Letters, May 8), and relieved to have my loan request accepted. The whole meeting lasted about 10 minutes.\n\nI was rather less impressed when I received my first bank statement and found that I had been charged \u00a350 to arrange the loan. That was equivalent to one week's grant money.\n\nTo this day, this is the most expensive drink I have ever bought.\n\nPaul Cornish\n\nLeeds, West Yorkshire\n\nThe fruits of competitive beard-growing\n\nSIR - To lighten the gloom of the Covid lockdown - and not having to worry about sartorial standards - a beard-growing competition was announced at work (Letters, May 8).\n\nHaving never progressed beyond a five o'clock shadow in 57 years, I was unsure what the result might be. To my surprise, I ended up with a Brian Blessed-sized beard, which, having been tamed, I shall take with me to my grave. It was initially a superb disguise, and, more importantly, saves me hours, if not days, each year thanks to not having to shave.\n\nRoger Wilson\n\nCharter Alley, Hampshire\n\nSIR - I grew a beard in a competition on board HMS Sheffield on the way to the Gulf in 1981. The efforts of the ship's company were judged by the captain on Christmas Day in Oman.\n\nMost participants shaved theirs off as soon as the judging was over, but I elected to retain mine until my wife had seen it.\n\nThe wardroom ran a book on how long my beard would last when she made its acquaintance. Most people were betting in minutes and seconds, but 43 years later it is still with me, albeit considerably more grey.\n\nRobert Rowley\n\nBere Alston, Devon\n\nGardening fashions squeezing out songbirds\n\nSIR - Instead of blaming cats for the disappearance of songbirds (Letters, May 8), Natural England should take more notice of the way gardens are changing. Low-maintenance gardens and artificial grass certainly don't help.\n\nIn my neighbourhood, when properties with front gardens are sold, the new owners invariably make parking space their priority, leaving minimal greenery. Birds need hedges and shrubs as well as clean bowls of water, which not enough of us provide.\n\nDiana R Lord\n\nBarnet, Hertfordshire\n\nSIR - Natural England may wish to reflect on its own recent actions. After a legal challenge, the general licences - under which most of the management of the major pest species in agricultural settings is performed - were made much more restrictive with respect to magpies. The effect of this has been to halt almost all culling of those birds. Where one once saw individuals or pairs of birds, groups of eight or 10 are now common.\n\nI have no particular affection or otherwise for magpies, but we can hardly be surprised that songbird populations continue to suffer when the population of magpies has been allowed to increase in this way.\n\nAdam Herrick\n\nSawston, Cambridgeshire\n\nLetters to the Editor\n\nWe accept letters by email and post.

How did they get to this after Boris Johnson delivered an 80-seat majority in 2019?\n\nLike it or not, it was Boris as a leader who appealed to voters, but his party chose to ditch him. It is no coincidence that the decline set in then - as they had no replacement with anything like his charisma and ability to get stuff done, despite his chaotic approach. Most Tory voters I know weren't at all concerned by the nonsense of Partygate, which finally did for him.\n\nThe bottom line is that the party has lost its true conservative values and aspirations, shunned its core voters, and, endeavouring to appeal to a wider electorate, has morphed into blue Labour. Now it is paying the price, as we all will under Sir Keir Starmer.\n\nRob Mason\n\nNailsea, Somerset\n\nSIR - In the run up to the 2017 general election, we had to put up with Theresa May's talk of \"strong and stable government\" on the airwaves for seven weeks. I do hope that we won't have to endure Rishi Sunak's \"we have a plan\" (Comment, May 4) for what could be another seven months.\n\nMalcolm Watson\n\nRyde, Isle of Wight\n\nSIR - Lord Frost (Comment, May 6) says that the Conservative Party might improve its public standing if it \"tilted to more attractive mainstream conservative policies\", but adds that many Tory MPs, including most ministers, won't support this approach. What does it say of a PM if he appoints ministers who come with their own agendas and with no intention of presenting a firm, unified approach to governing the country?\n\nAnd what of those MPs who sit under the Conservative banner, yet meddle, argue and oppose as if they were independents rather than party members?\n\nAllan Muirhead\n\nKirkby Lonsdale, Cumbria\n\nSIR - Not long from now, when we all have the magic gift of hindsight, pundit after pundit will try to explain our country's degeneration in these past three years. Allow me to pre-empt.\n\nIt all stems from Covid, but not the virus. The pandemic was the cause of the panic that persuaded a weak Government with a sick premier to hand over the management of our country to an incompetent Civil Service. Since then, failure after failure, botch after botch and fiasco after fiasco can be traced directly to a bloated, self-rewarding bureaucracy, which costs the taxpayer billions and affects every moment of our lives.\n\nWe are no longer a real democracy. The only cure is a radical reduction in red tape and its cost. But that would need political leadership of steely will, not possessed by any major party. We have not seen such steel in high office since Margaret Thatcher, and nothing similar is on any horizon.\n\nFrederick Forsyth\n\nBeaconsfield, Buckinghamshire\n\nEnforced secularism\n\nSIR - Nick Kester (Letters, May 5) argues that Britain should be a \"completely secular society\". What this would mean in practice is difficult to fathom, but it certainly sounds intrusive and authoritarian.\n\nWe have the example of France - a constitutionally secular state that is not notably more progressive or better integrated than Britain. Indeed, its enforcement of secularist law alienates many of its citizens and has often been heavy-handed.\n\nApart from the energy and public-spiritedness of religious bodies that provide education, there is surely value in the transmission of cultural and spiritual traditions. These are intangible goods that may enhance personal identity, and can help foster more social cohesion, not less.\n\nSimon Stark\n\nLeicester\n\nSIR - If people want to follow a religion, that is their business. If they want to impose their religion on me or my children, it is my business.\n\nReligion has no place in schools. Anyone who wants to teach such things to their children should do it at home or in their place of worship - outside school time, so as not interfere with the education of others.\n\nVincent Hearne\n\nChinon, Val de Loire, France\n\nSIR - I would strongly advise Nick Kester to obtain a copy of Geoffrey Woolley's excellent autobiography, Sometimes a Soldier (1963).\n\nHe earned the Victoria Cross at Hill 60 in Belgium during the First World War. Afterwards he was a minister in the Church of England and a master at some of the country's leading schools. During the Second World War, he was a chaplain to the Forces in North Africa. His is a voice that should still be heard on whether schools would be better places if completely secular.\n\nMartin Hurcomb\n\nCaterham, Surrey\n\nMusic on the moors\n\nSIR - I was saddened to read of the death of legendary guitarist Duane Eddy (Obituaries, May 3). It reminded me vividly of 1967 and the first time I tackled the Lyke Wake Walk - a long-distance challenge across the top of the North York Moors.\n\nMuch of the walk at that time was along heather-clad sheep tracks, but there is a section that follows the route of a disused railway for several miles. I took the opportunity to stride out and found myself humming a Duane Eddy song that had just the right rhythm, which boosted my morale.\n\nThe walk is about 40 miles long, so Forty Miles of Bad Road seemed wonderfully appropriate.\n\nFrank Priestnall\n\nSkipton, North Yorkshire\n\nFacial attraction\n\nSIR - Returning from a camping trip more than 30 years ago, I had a short, stubbly beard, and my girlfriend of the time said, \"Hmm, I quite like that\".\n\nWe were married soon afterwards, and since then I have been beardless just once (for medical reasons). My wife was so pleased when I returned to my neatly trimmed but hirsute self, and fortunately I've never been likened to a \"pig's back\" (\"Stubble trouble\", Letters, May 6).\n\nAdrian Waller\n\nWoodsetts, South Yorkshire\n\nSIR - I have had a well-trimmed beard for all of our 50 years of marriage, and my wife continues to be happy to snuggle up to it, describing it as soft and cuddly. Long may that continue.\n\nChris Yates\n\nPeasedown St John, Somerset\n\nScottish wood-burners\n\nSIR - I note that the Stove Industry Association has lodged a petition at Holyrood regarding the Scottish government's ban on wood-burning stoves.\n\nIt calls for the ban to be overturned, and \"to protect the people of Scotland's right to use a wood-burning stove to heat their homes\".\n\nIt will be interesting to see what John Swinney, the new leader of the SNP, intends to do. Will he be his own man, or will Scotland continue to be a country run by a Green minority that would happily see those in rural areas suffer freezing conditions while enduring day-long power cuts?\n\nJane Lax\n\nCraigellachie, Banffshire\n\nPothole patrol\n\nSIR - Our roads are repaired with patches made after holes have been dug, and many potholes occur at the edges of these patches (\"Council warned of potholes months before driver died\", report, May 6).\n\nNotices show that councils permit these holes to be dug, so why do they not insist that anyone permitted to dig a hole must agree to return and re-do any poor work?\n\nMembers of the public could be encouraged to report any developing potholes. This would incentivise diggers to repair the roads properly and discourage them from digging them up over and over again to do the same job - which has happened on my road and on the road into my town.\n\nThis will not solve the pothole problem, but it might save a lot of smashed suspension springs.\n\nW R Gibbings\n\nRetford, Nottinghamshire\n\nFortified customer\n\nSIR - In the early 1950s, aged seven, I accompanied my father to his bank (Letters, May 6).\n\nHe had been summoned because of severe problems with his account, which ultimately led to him becoming bankrupt. As we entered, all of the clerks addressed him by name, ushering us into the manager's office.\n\nOnce we were seated, the manager offered my father a sherry (and me an orange squash) before explaining to him that, regrettably, unless the account was put in order, \"it was out of his hands\".\n\nSadly, things took their course. However, I have held an account with the bank for more than 70 years. Courtesy wins.\n\nShane Marco\n\nEnfield, Middlesex\n\nThe benefits of turning to peat-free compost\n\nSIR - I stopped buying peat-based compost (Letters, May 2) because of the harm that extraction is doing to natural peat bogs, which are very good at storing carbon. A peat bog only grows at about 1mm a year, so replacing them will take a very long time, even with the ban on peat.\n\nThere are alternatives to peat available, some better for seed-sowing, others for multipurpose or more specialised use. Peat-free composts contain a mix of materials to ensure they are suitable. Read the package and choose the one best suited to your needs. If you don't like it, try a different brand, as you would for a peat-based product. They vary, and some hold water better than others. Use the finger test - feel the compost below the surface - and add water if dry. The Royal Horticultural Society can advise on new composts.\n\nIf retailers like Tesco allow their plants to fail (Letters, May 1), then they should train their staff better.\n\nJane Thorn\n\nLetchworth, Hertfordshire\n\nWhy bells won't help birds escape from cats\n\nSIR - I read with interest the proposal from Natural England that domestic cats should wear bells to stop them killing birds (report, May 6).\n\nSome years ago we were concerned that our cats were being a real problem in this regard, so we equipped them with small bells. We got used to the incessant tinkling, but our tomcat - the worst offender - soon realised that, if he tucked his head down as he stalked his prey, he could stop the bell ringing, and so attack as before. To counter this, we attached a small electronic box to his collar that emitted a bleep every second. He instantly became known as the beeping tom.\n\nHe didn't seem to mind the noise, but we found it intolerable and dumped it after a few days. Luckily, advancing age meant he slowed down and the birds could escape.\n\nColin G Parker\n\nThame, Oxfordshire\n\nSIR - Neither of my rescue cats has taken kindly to collars of any description.\n\nBoth immediately tried to remove them, one successfully, and the other became so entangled in it that it couldn't move.\n\nThey were often pursued through the garden by foxes, which have learnt that taking on a cat alone rarely gets them a dinner. The ringing of a bell would likely have the same effect as a dinner gong.\n\nAs for the killing of birds, my cats prefer mice, and on the rare occasion when a bird has been caught, it has soon been dropped alive at my feet with the clear instruction: \"You deal with it.\"\n\nI would politely suggest that Natural England leaves the subject of cats to those who know more about them.\n\nMartin Bastone\n\nEast Grinstead, West Sussex\n\nLetters to the Editor\n\nWe accept letters by email and post.

This does not say much for these MPs' belief in Conservative values, which perhaps goes to the crux of the problem with the present Government.\n\nJonathan Mann\n\nGunnislake, Cornwall\n\nSIR - When will MPs understand that they are chosen by voters to represent them, and not to grandstand on their own personal views?\n\nChristopher Turner-Hawkes\n\nKingsbridge, Devon\n\nSIR - There is an argument seeking to gain ground that Tory MPs are better qualified to choose the leader of the party than members. Presumably Natalie Elphicke and her like would've preferred Sir Keir Starmer for this post.\n\nSebastian Neville-Clarke\n\nVines Cross, East Sussex\n\nSIR - I would encourage many more of the socialists in the Conservative Party to defect. Then we may actually be left with MPs who are truly conservative.\n\nStephen Lally\n\nBerkhamsted, Hertfordshire\n\nSIR - Penelope Upton (Letters, May 8) blames Boris Johnson for the decline of the Conservative Party.\n\nThis did not begin when he started campaigning to leave the EU, but with David Cameron's half-heartedness over Brexit. That was when the modern Tory party started to diverge from its grassroots supporters, and the process has continued, leading to the situation our Government now finds itself in.\n\nIf anyone deserves blame, it is the man who is now Foreign Secretary.\n\nAndrew Pearce\n\nLondon SE3\n\nSIR - Although Rob Mason (Letters, May 7) is correct in identifying the sacking of Boris Johnson as the start of the collapse in Conservative support, there have been several other milestones along the way.\n\nVirtually all the top Conservative supporters of Brexit - Dominic Raab, Priti Patel, Suella Braverman and others - have fallen by the wayside, most of them victims of smears by a Civil Service that cannot forgive those responsible for taking us out of the EU. Unless and until the public sector, including the judiciary, is returned to taking a neutral stance on all political matters, we are heading for permanent Left-wing government, irrespective of which party is in power.\n\nAfter 50 years of voting Conservative, I'll be voting for Reform UK next time around, because, although it will not gain power or even get more than one or two MPs, it is at least the only party that proposes to tackle the root causes of the nation's decline.\n\nDr Chris Topping\n\nPilling, Lancashire\n\nSIR - I disagree with Vincent Hearne (Letters, May 7) that religion has no place in schools. In 1978, when I was 10, we had one religious education period a week. Each lesson was dedicated to a specific religion and gave a great insight into other faiths.\n\nWhere I was schooled was not particularly multicultural at the time, but the lessons stood me in good stead to have an understanding of other religions throughout my travels and in our now more diverse country. Do not keep religion in homes and places of worship - it only creates divisions.\n\nRob Williamson\n\nLockerbie, Dumfriesshire\n\nSIR - Nick Kester (Letters, May 4) says religion is private. I'd suggest he walks from Victoria Station in London towards Westminster Cathedral. Further down, almost at the Houses of Parliament - where Disraeli, of Jewish birth, could enter only as a baptised Anglican - he'll see Methodist Central Hall on his left, and Westminster Abbey diagonally opposite.\n\nThese three buildings contain in their walls so much of what is necessary to understand the social history of this country.\n\nJacqueline Castles\n\nLondon W2\n\nSIR - Celia Walden (Features, May 7) is right that the law needs to be updated to deal with dangerous cyclists.\n\nThere is another matter that would benefit from re-examination - the fact that multi-drop van drivers of vehicles under 3.5 tons do not get the same work breaks as their HGV counterparts.\n\nThere has been a huge increase in van traffic over the past decade. Many drivers are put under pressure to speed so they can complete their rounds, which often involve more than 100 drops. This is inevitably stressful and can lead to tired drivers making errors of judgment, resulting in serious injuries or deaths. Some might argue that a change in the law would increase costs, but it would lead to safer roads.\n\nGraham Ashen\n\nHorsham, West Sussex\n\nSIR - It was encouraging that as many as 40 per cent of Garrick Club members voted to maintain its male-only membership (report, May 8). There are other gentlemen's clubs which still value tradition and would welcome such men of distinction.\n\nAlternatively, they could set up their own club to stand as a symbol of defiance against mindless change.\n\nCharles Simon\n\nLeicester\n\nSIR - I see nothing wrong with having clubs that only admit men (or women).\n\nIf the Garrick's decision were in any way influenced by some quasi-moral attachment to a \"woke\" agenda and concern for the opinion of the chattering classes, it is a pity. I have always seen much wisdom in Millwall's (unofficial) apophthegm: \"No one likes us, we don't care\".\n\nAndrew Newcombe KC\n\nCombe Down, Somerset\n\nSIR - Apostrophes are to be phased out of street signs in North Yorkshire because they \"negatively affect geographic databases\" (report, May 8).\n\nShould my town - at the northernmost point of the settled Roman Empire, where the steam engine was invented and the Scottish Railway Museum has its home - be alarmed?\n\nDr Andy Ashworth\n\nBo'ness, West Lothian\n\nSIR - To lighten the gloom of the Covid lockdown - and not having to worry about sartorial standards - a beard-growing competition was announced at work (Letters, May 8).\n\nHaving never progressed beyond a five o'clock shadow in 57 years, I was unsure what the result might be. To my surprise, I ended up with a Brian Blessed-sized beard, which, having been tamed, I shall take with me to my grave. It was initially a superb disguise, and, more importantly, saves me hours, if not days, each year thanks to not having to shave.\n\nRoger Wilson\n\nCharter Alley, Hampshire\n\nSIR - I grew a beard in a competition on board HMS Sheffield on the way to the Gulf in 1981. The efforts of the ship's company were judged by the captain on Christmas Day in Oman.\n\nMost participants shaved theirs off as soon as the judging was over, but I elected to retain mine until my wife had seen it.\n\nThe wardroom ran a book on how long my beard would last when she made its acquaintance. Most people were betting in minutes and seconds, but 43 years later it is still with me, albeit considerably more grey.\n\nRobert Rowley\n\nBere Alston, Devon\n\nSIR - Instead of blaming cats for the disappearance of songbirds (Letters, May 8), Natural England should take more notice of the way gardens are changing. Low-maintenance gardens and artificial grass certainly don't help.\n\nIn my neighbourhood, when properties with front gardens are sold, the new owners invariably make parking space their priority, leaving minimal greenery. Birds need hedges and shrubs as well as clean bowls of water, which not enough of us provide.\n\nDiana R Lord\n\nBarnet, Hertfordshire\n\nSIR - Natural England may wish to reflect on its own recent actions. After a legal challenge, the general licences - under which most of the management of the major pest species in agricultural settings is performed - were made much more restrictive with respect to magpies. The effect of this has been to halt almost all culling of those birds. Where one once saw individuals or pairs of birds, groups of eight or 10 birds are now common.\n\nI have no particular affection or otherwise for magpies, but we can hardly be surprised that songbird populations continue to suffer when the population of magpies has been allowed to increase in this way.\n\nAdam Herrick\n\nSawston, Cambridgeshire\n\nWe accept letters by email and post.

Voters in Natalie Elphicke's constituency should now be offered the chance to vote for her or another candidate.\n\nIn what other job can you up sticks and work for the competition without resigning?\n\nMike Metcalfe\n\nButleigh, Somerset\n\nSIR - How many more Tory defections and losses of the whip will it take before a general election is called?\n\nMichael McGough\n\nLoughton, Essex\n\nSIR - Natalie Elphicke has lots in common with Sir Keir Starmer: principles that bend in the wind; an apparent lack of scruples; and an obvious love for a pointless stunt.\n\nRoger Cousins\n\nBeaconsfield, Buckinghamshire\n\nSIR - In striking concern and disbelief into the heart of Labour, while simultaneously uniting the Conservatives in disgust at her self-serving betrayal, Natalie Elphicke has arguably done Rishi Sunak a great service.\n\nChris Whitehouse\n\nLondon SE11\n\nSIR - The bizarre defection of Natalie Elphicke to a party that she surely despises - judging by her pronouncements in the recent past - encapsulates the terminal rot at the heart of this nation.\n\nWe have Conservatives who don't conserve; Labour for the workshy; liberals wishing to make views outside their self-righteous bubble illegal to express; Greens more interested in alternative lifestyles than ecology; and Reformers who actually want to regress.\n\nParties are no longer vehicles of principle but teams competing to win power for its own sake by any means necessary. Their purpose is to retain voters whose blind loyalty to a brand dictates their electoral decisions.\n\nDecades ago, there were politicians who had thrown away glittering careers because their sense of duty to the people of this country brought a realisation that their talents would be best deployed in Parliament; building that better tomorrow promised as a just reward for the sacrifices of the Second World War.\n\nSadly this kind of commitment no longer exists, and current members of both Houses of Parliament seem self-serving and hubristic.\n\nMark Boyle\n\nJohnstone, Renfrewshire\n\nSIR - Following Natalie Elphicke's defection to the Labour benches, surely Nigel Farage should represent Reform UK in Dover in the forthcoming general election.\n\nG\u2009E Allard\n\nGillingham, Kent\n\nChurch betrayals\n\nSIR - Madeline Grant's account (Comment, May 8) of the betrayal of our Anglican musical heritage by those who should be promoting it illustrates the depressing parallels between the condition of the Church of England and that of our nation.\n\nIn the Church, as in the state, we see shrinking trust in leaders. We see administrators dismissing the local parish unit, where the Church's main work is done. We see Church members seething because their hands-on experience is ignored by those in charge. We see hard-working priests, and their vital sacramental pastoral ministry, treated as problems by managerial officials. And, as in the country, it is almost impossible to see future leaders who might help us turn the ship around. No doubt they are there, but they are unlikely to be favoured by the mindset presently dominating the Church.\n\nDoes all this sound only too familiar?\n\nRev Dr Barry Orford\n\nLondon NW3\n\nSIR - For 10 years I was the headmistress of Croughton, a voluntary-controlled village school that had Church representatives in the governing body (Letters, May 9).\n\nIt could be argued that, as the school is the only one in the village, it shouldn't be a faith school. However, each year we had more than twice the number of applications as places available. Staff at the local American airbase would fight to send their children to us rather than the secular school. Parents frequently told us that the ambience was noticeable as soon as they walked through the front door.\n\nWhile many secular schools undoubtedly also encourage kindness and respect, our entire ethos was based on our Christian values, and these clearly shone through. No one ever objected.\n\nEve Wilson\n\nHill Head, Hampshire\n\nGP system failure\n\nSIR - I've had a good deal of pain and difficulty in walking for a week because of a swollen foot. I thought the problem would resolve itself with rest, but it didn't. On Wednesday at 10am, I went to my GP's website to complete the form to request an appointment, but I couldn't because it said that no further appointment requests were available that day. I should add that the system does not let anyone complete a form outside practice hours.\n\nI telephoned the practice and explained my problem to the receptionist, and was advised to call NHS 111, which I did. The service was very helpful but it took 20 minutes to explain my symptoms. I was told that I would receive a callback within six hours. Four hours later the call came and I was told that my GP would telephone the next day.\n\nAt least five people became involved in this charade - just because I was not allowed to complete a form online.\n\nJames Woods\n\nFrome, Somerset\n\nThe joy of shaving\n\nSIR - Unlike Robin Bendon (Letters, May 8), I find a wet shave is one of the joys of the day. I use a small, badger-hair brush, which I bought shortly after starting work in the City in the 1970s. It's still going strong, justifying the price at the time. I have any number of shaving creams on the go, in jars, tubes and cans. The jars last for years. After shaving I use an alum block to complete the ritual.\n\nThe only negative aspect of modern shaving is the astronomical price of razor blades.\n\nTim Oldfield\n\nWye, Kent\n\nCameron on defence\n\nSIR - It is all very well Lord Cameron stating that Europe should be \"tougher\" in the face of Russian and Chinese aggression (report, May 9), but we should remember his record when he was prime minister.\n\nHe oversaw significant cuts to Britain's conventional warfighting capabilities, which have left us more vulnerable than we should be. He also delayed the introduction of the next generation of nuclear deterrent submarines and allowed China to fund our civil nuclear power programme.\n\nRear Admiral Philip Mathias (retd)\n\nSouthsea, Hampshire\n\nGreat white bread\n\nSIR - I strongly reject William Sitwell's comments (\"Soft white bread is a con - no matter what the boffins do to it\", telegraph.co.uk, May 3).\n\nTo suggest, without evidence, that white bread causes cancer, diabetes and obesity paints a false impression of one of the nation's favourite staple foods, enjoyed by millions. All British bread, including \"packaged\" and \"supermarket\", contains a wealth of nutrients that play an important part in a healthy, balanced diet - including fibre, calcium, vitamins and iron. White bread offers a convenient and good-value staple food at a time when consumers' budgets are stretched.\n\nAndrew Pyne\n\nChief executive, Federation of Bakers\n\nLondon WC1\n\nSaved by the bank\n\nSIR - In 1978 I was offered a job as a secretary in Dubai. I had no clothes suitable for a hot climate and no money for a new wardrobe, having reached the limit of \u00a3150 on my Barclaycard.\n\nI met the manager of Barclays in Tunbridge Wells (Letters, May 9). He agreed to a \u00a3100 loan, provided I handed over my Barclaycard for him to cut in half. I then went to Dubai, paid off my loan, cleared my card account - and have never been in debt since.\n\nSusan Sang\n\nPetersfield, Hampshire\n\nSIR - During the 1980s I returned from college for the Christmas break and was invited to meet my bank manager.\n\nHe told me I was living beyond my means and asked what plans I had to pay off my overdraft. At the Easter break we had a similar meeting. In the summer we met again. He said: \"If I have to call you in next term I will need to inform your father.\" I stayed in the black for the rest of my course.\n\nMark Lewis\n\nStalbridge, Dorset\n\nWhy wooden toys are a cut above the rest\n\nSIR - William Sitwell (\"Let's get on board with Boris's wooden toys\", Features, May 4) makes a very good argument in favour of these toys over plastic ones. There is also the bonus of longevity.\n\nMy sons, who are now in their 20s, have received many gifts over the years. The plastic ones were gradually donated or re-gifted, while the wooden ones are in the loft awaiting the next generation.\n\nFrances Williams\n\nSwindon, Wiltshire\n\nSIR - William Sitwell's article reminded me of making wooden sledges for all eight of my grandchildren and the first seven great-grandchildren.\n\nHowever, when my eighth great-grandchild was born more than 300 miles away, I was able to buy and have delivered a plastic sledge for less than the price of the wood and runners.\n\nIt all comes down to cost.\n\nDerrick G Smith\n\nBexhill-on-Sea, East Sussex\n\nBritish Gas's plea for mandatory smart meters\n\nSIR - Chris O'Shea, the CEO of British Gas, says every household should be forced to have a smart meter to help hit net-zero targets, despite widespread resistance to the devices (report, May 9). The implication is that he wants to be able to control how much gas we use, the price we pay and the pattern of usage at different times of the day. This is pure socialism - without a vote.\n\nAs a customer, I should be allowed to spend my money as I choose, and, provided I'm prepared to pay the quoted price, should be able to buy as much gas as I want at the time of my choosing. This is the free market.\n\nIt is not possible to believe in both positions simultaneously.\n\nIan Mackenzie\n\nPreston, Lancashire\n\nSIR - Please can Chris O'Shea explain how smart meters will help hit net-zero targets? Without one I know exactly what appliances I am using. A meter will not mean I no longer heat the house, cook or watch television.\n\nAnne Jappie\n\nCheltenham, Gloucestershire\n\nSIR - Before making smart meters mandatory, the Government should ask British Gas to try to fit them in my property as a test case. I live in a large, old, stone-built house, and have been told by my supplier that I can't have a smart gas meter because my current model doesn't have a smart equivalent, and, in any event, is too far away from my electricity meter to transmit the necessary signal to it.\n\nIf British Gas solves these problems and pays for the work to enable the installation, it can have my supply contract for both fuels and my support for its policy. If it fails, it should withdraw the proposal.\n\nDr A\u2009S Hearne\n\nWoodstock, Oxfordshire\n\nLetters to the Editor\n\nWe accept letters by email and post.

Lord Houchen makes promises and then delivers on them. That is why he was re-elected. The Government, on the other hand, makes lots of promises and then delivers nothing. That is why the Tories were trounced in the polls.\n\nIan Coates\n\nDarlington, Co Durham\n\nSIR - In the West Midlands we have seen probably one of the best politicians in the country lose his position for being in the wrong party. During his seven years as mayor, Andy Street saw through a whole range of excellent local projects.\n\nWe now have yet another grey Labour person taking his place. This, in conjunction with the disastrous performance of the Labour-run Birmingham council, doesn't bode well for the area.\n\nHoward Clay\n\nBournville\n\nSIR - Susan Hall put up a good fight against Sadiq Khan to be Mayor of London, but she lost.\n\nWhen selecting the candidate to take on Mr Khan, would it not have been prudent to choose a well-known personality? Boris Johnson won twice, despite London normally having a Labour bias. Surely there was a lesson in this. A well-liked celebrity with a bit of pizzazz would probably have beaten the dour Mr Khan. I hope the powers that be show a bit more political savvy next time.\n\nJohn Twitchen\n\nLeigh-on-Sea, Essex\n\nSIR - Despite the disastrous local election results, Rishi Sunak and his ministers are still not getting the message.\n\nThey appear to believe that their plan will eventually be embraced by the electorate. But it won't: when the general election arrives, Conservative voters will either sit on their hands or give their support to the no-hope Reform UK, which at least has conservative policies.\n\nRichard North\n\nStanford Dingley, Berkshire\n\nSIR - Again and again I hear the warning: \"Vote Reform, get Labour.\"\n\nThe trouble is that if you vote Conservative, you don't get Conservative.\n\nIdris White\n\nSevenoaks, Kent\n\nSIR - Although replacing Rishi Sunak as Conservative leader is unlikely to win the general election for the Tories (Comment, May 4), there is surely a good chance that it would reduce the number of seats they lose.\n\nAlan Hetherington\n\nYork\n\nSIR - Heaping the blame for the local election results on to Rishi Sunak is unjust. He has had to deal with scandals, warring factions and a crashed economy, thanks to Liz Truss.\n\nIt is highly commendable that, in the face of all these challenges, he remains calm and determined. He deserves support, not criticism.\n\nAnthony Haslam\n\nFarnham, Surrey\n\nSIR - People are complaining about voter apathy in the local elections, but I would suggest that our candidates were also apathetic. We received no canvassing, and only one party sent material. No one knocked on the door. If one had ignored the press, the whole event would have gone unnoticed.\n\nJ\u2009L Greenwood\n\nLondon SW18\n\n'Safe' assisted dying\n\nSIR - Lord Falconer (Letters, May 4) has a curious confidence in \"safeguards and oversight\" when it comes to the matter of assisted dying. Nothing works in this country. I sense another scandal in the offing, with no way to \"compensate\" the unwilling dead.\n\nJacqueline Block\n\nLondon NW11\n\nSIR - Lord Falconer fails to controvert my point that \"assisted dying\" is a vague, confusing euphemism - a point illustrated by his own expansive explanation of it in his podcast.\n\nHe claims that the Health and Social Care Committee clearly defined the term, but its definition of \"assisted dying/assisted suicide\" was imprecise, not least because voluntary euthanasia was shoehorned in too. \"Voluntary euthanasia\" and \"physician-assisted suicide\" - which have long been used by scholars and others on both sides of the debate - are tolerably clear. Why should anyone, especially a leading lawyer such as Lord Falconer, prefer a fuzzy neologism that does not properly distinguish between the two and, moreover, risks confusing them with palliative care and the withdrawal of treatment? An opinion poll in 2021 disclosed that over 40 per cent of respondents thought \"assisted dying\" meant the right to refuse treatment, and a further 10 per cent the provision of hospice care.\n\nLord Falconer says the only confusion that arises in public policy discussion comes from those who seek to obfuscate. Obfuscation is precisely what results from the use of this nebulous phrase.\n\nProfessor John Keown\n\nKennedy Institute of Ethics, Georgetown University\n\nWashington DC, United States\n\nSIR - Juliet Buckley (Letters, May 1) takes issue with Mishal Husain's definition of \"euthanasia\", but whether or not it means \"a gentle and easy death\" the fact remains that it involves deliberately ending someone's life.\n\nJohn O'Donnell\n\nWest Mersea, Essex\n\nSIR - I am 102. For the past two years I have been in a private care home.\n\nI am not terminally ill. I am not suffering unbearable pain. I am just bored out of my mind. Why should I sit around playing childish games and singing silly songs until I have a stroke or a heart attack and am carted off to hospital to be kept alive for as long as possible? Why cannot I die now in an organised and comfortable way? Why do other people have the audacity to think they know what's best for me?\n\nKeith Herdman\n\nLondon SE3\n\nReligion in public life\n\nSIR - We need principled people with a strong sense of service and a belief in more than themselves to seek public office (\"Kate Forbes has still won a significant victory - for religion in public life\", Comment, May 2).\n\nThe presence of faith among some of our politicians ought to be embraced. Their belief in a higher power means they are accountable to more than just themselves. Moreover, politicians who adhere to a religious belief system adhere to a moral framework - in contrast with the prevailing trend of leaders leaning towards a purely managerial approach, without an ethical grounding.\n\nSuch politicians are also likely to recognise the potency of faith and other community structures in effecting social progress. If we dismiss politicians solely because of their religious convictions, it reveals a lack of the tolerance that we often pride ourselves on.\n\nZaki Cooper\n\nLondon NW4\n\nSIR - Nick Kester (Letters, May 4) says religion is private. I'm sure the Devil will be pleased to hear that some hold this view, but it couldn't be further from the truth. Religion can never be private, as the whole point is to spread God's word and light, even in the face of prejudice, mockery and disbelief.\n\nAnne Healy\n\nSunderland\n\nScrapping PCCs\n\nSIR - I received no information about the candidates standing for the position of Police and Crime Commissioner (Letters, April 30) in our area on Thursday. Those who voted presumably had little more to go on - yet this is the person who is going to hold the chief constable to account.\n\nWhat a waste of public money. Surely this would be better spent putting more constables on the beat. We all know that the police are restricted by a lack of resources.\n\nTrevor Bunce\n\nSaham Toney, Norfolk\n\nStubble trouble\n\nSIR - Could someone explain why so many men now sport scruffy, quarter-grown beards? It is an awful trend, and the look ages most of them by at least 10 years. They must be distinctly unpleasant to rub up against - a bit like kissing a pig's back, I would imagine.\n\nThank heavens my husband of almost 50 years agrees with me.\n\nLouise Broughton\n\nArnside, Westmorland\n\nThe perfect person to get a piano in tune\n\nSIR - With regard to Ivan Hewett's article (Arts, May 1) about tuning Steinway pianos, when my father was in the Middle East during the war he attended a concert given in an old arena (said to have been built for the Queen of Sheba).\n\nThe place was packed with troops of all nationalities, but when the pianist arrived and sat down to perform, he announced after a couple of notes that the instrument was so out of tune that it was unplayable. Amid great consternation, an American voice shouted: \"We've got a member of the Steinway family here - will he do?\" The man came on stage and rectified things - and the concert went ahead to great success.\n\nJoan Clayton\n\nTwickenham, Middlesex\n\nRounding off business with a bottle of ale\n\nSIR - I once had a meeting at the then Midland Bank in Oxford Circus in the mid-1970s.\n\nOnce business had been concluded (it was around 11\u2009am), the manager - a Mr Muir, as I recall - asked if I would like a coffee. He then said, \"I am going to have a light ale myself,\" and proceeded to reach under his desk and produce a bottle (Letters, May 4).\n\nA lovely man and a proper bank manager, to whom I remained loyal.\n\nTerry Lazenbury\n\nBurnham Green, Hertfordshire\n\nSIR - On one occasion many years ago I needed to consult my bank manager. I arrived a little early and was told that he had not yet returned from lunch. I therefore wandered off into town to do some shopping, which included the purchase of a bottle of good red wine.\n\nWhen I returned I was shown into the manager's office. I put the bottle on a side table and we got down to business. After this was completed and I got up to leave, the manager thanked me for my generous gift. I did not have the courage to disabuse him.\n\nMike Aston\n\nStourbridge, Worcestershire\n\nSIR - Rupert Godfrey (Letters, May 1) recalls a boozy job interview in 1980. Years ago, I was invited to a third interview at a luxury cosmetics company with the European vice-president. It was unclear whether it was meant to be \"formal\" but I dressed for this, and was shown into an office and introduced to a charming Robert Redford lookalike.\n\n\"So,\" he said, casting an eye over my CV, \"I see you like tennis.\"\n\n\"Er, yes,\" I replied.\n\n\"My mixed doubles partner has let me down on Sunday - are you free?\"\n\n\"Er, yes,\" I replied again.\n\nWe played, we won and I got the job. I later learnt that I had already been hired, but the tennis game gave me an insight into his competitive nature. He became my biggest supporter and we had a great working relationship.\n\nLinda J Walton\n\nLondon W14\n\nLetters to the Editor\n\nWe accept letters by email and post.

We have witnessed the inflammatory language of newly elected councillors (report, May 7), intimidation by Leftist and Islamist (but essentially ignorant) students on campuses, and further examples of the by now routine, supine compliance of the police with any demonstrator chanting slogans or carrying banners, no matter how obviously anti-Semitic.\n\nEvery day, we hear another bold statement by a Government minister that such behaviour will not be tolerated (Commentary, May 7). It's now more than two months since the Prime Minister promised action. When can we expect results?\n\nBrian Gedalla\n\nLondon N3\n\nSIR - There is no such thing as a lasting peace in the Middle East, just a ceasefire until the next massacre like that of October 7. Hamas propaganda has exposed to the world the underlying anti-Semitism that festers in all corners of society.\n\nThat an annual Holocaust memorial march at Auschwitz was disrupted by pro-Palestine activists (report, May 7) reveals the depths to which these groups will sink.\n\nBill Todd\n\nWhitton, Middlesex\n\nSIR - For decades, young British Jews have taken a gap year in Israel. Many attend colleges of religious further education; others volunteer on kibbutzim or join programmes organised by youth groups from every side of the political spectrum - but all share a belief in the establishment and continuation of the State of Israel as a way to avoid another Holocaust.\n\nOver the years a few have decided to remain in Israel and become citizens, yet recently things have changed. This year a record number of Jewish youths refused to return to Britain and go to universities because of anti-Semitism. Why come back to the UK and be forced to pay for a university education at an institution that cannot or does not want to give you the support necessary to live a meaningful life where you do not have to hide your identity? Alternatively, you can remain in the country that wants you.\n\nThe activists on the lawns of Oxford and Cambridge fail to understand that being Jewish does not mean that you agree wholeheartedly with the policies of any particular Israeli government, and therefore any attempt to make the lives of Jews uncomfortable is anti-Semitism, pure and simple.\n\nFor hundreds of years British universities have been enhanced beyond measure by the presence of Jewish students and academics. If the numbers dwindle because of hatred directed at them by ill-informed bullies, British society will be far poorer, and that loss will not be made up by the overseas students who will take their place.\n\nGareth Kreike\n\nBury, Lancashire\n\nTory wreckage\n\nSIR - The Conservatives' sharp decline (Letters, May 7) dates back to 2016, not the lockdown in 2020 or Partygate.\n\nIn 2015 David Cameron achieved the first Conservative majority since 1992. He had a mandate to serve as prime minister until 2020. This was wrecked by Boris Johnson's decision to campaign for Leave in the EU referendum.\n\nLord Cameron is an excellent Foreign Secretary. When I see him on the news, I feel dismayed that his premiership was fatally undermined by Mr Johnson's personal ambition. It's too late to salvage the wreckage.\n\nPenelope Upton\n\nLighthorne, Warwickshire\n\nSIR - When I was the Police and Crime Commissioner for the Thames Valley, I had one of the largest Conservative votes in the country. I no longer believe the current Conservative Party represents my views or that of most Conservative voters.\n\nMy very pleasant local MP is a member of the One Nation Conservatives, who seem to represent everything that has gone wrong with the party. This group should be disbanded and proper Conservatives put forward at the next election.\n\nAnthony Stansfeld\n\nKintbury, Berkshire\n\nSIR - The letter from Frederick Forsyth (May 7) hits the nail on the head. In relation to our woeful yet complacent Civil Service, I simply add the words: completely unaccountable.\n\nAny political leader willing and able to tackle this problem gets my vote.\n\nKim Potter\n\nLambourn, Berkshire\n\nKnives out\n\nSIR - Victorinox is to make a Swiss Army knife without the knife (report, May 7). I have a number of the traditional knives and almost always carry one, which I use for everything from DIY to gardening to picnics. I've even unlocked a hotel bathroom door when my children managed to lock themselves in.\n\nThe law of England and Wales allows for foldable pocket knives to be carried, and Lord Hailsham specifically highlighted the Swiss Army knife as an example of what could still be carried under the Criminal Justice Act 1988, when the provision was being debated.\n\nWhile I think it's sensible for Victorinox to adapt its products for changing markets, personally I'm glad I can still carry my pocket knife, which I find more useful than the USB drive on the non-bladed version.\n\nPaul Kelly\n\nChesham, Buckinghamshire\n\nTake it on the chin\n\nSIR - Louise Broughton (Letters, May 6) wants to know why so many men sport scruffy quarter-grown beards, whose texture she likens to \"a pig's back\".\n\nI have always considered daily shaving a gross waste of 10 to 15 minutes. In my teens, I stopped shaving every day and started trimming my beard on a weekly basis.\n\nI admit, though, that my wife of 54 years has been known to call me a \"swine\" on occasion.\n\nRobin Bendon\n\nWrexham, Denbighshire\n\nSIR - Some years ago, after 20 years of sporting a beard, I decided to shave it off. My wife hated the new image and for some time, until the new beard emerged, she referred to me as \"my friend Geoffrey\" when we were out and about.\n\nI haven't shaved since.\n\nPeter McPherson\n\nMerriott, Somerset\n\nAssisted dying law\n\nSIR - Professor John Keown (Letters, May 6) is right that the Health and Social Care Committee's definition of \"assisted dying/assisted suicide\" is somewhat imprecise. Nevertheless, the committee is to be commended for seeking one that includes the words \"assisted suicide\". Such language acknowledges that what is at stake is whether Parliament should maintain or weaken the legal prohibition on \"encouraging or assisting suicide\".\n\nMy concern about Lord Falconer of Thoroton's letter (May 4) comes less from his use of the ambiguous term \"assisted dying\" than his omission of \"assisted suicide\". He refers to the select committee report on \"assisted dying/assisted suicide\", but without telling us its full name. Deliberate omission is also a way to obfuscate.\n\nProfessor David Albert Jones\n\nDirector, Anscombe Bioethics Centre\n\nOxford\n\nSIR - Keith Herdman (Letters, May 6) confirms that many who want assisted dying to be made legal expect an outcome not intended by backers of the current Scottish Bill, which contains \"safeguards\" to deny those who are just fed up with life from receiving help to kill themselves. This is a central problem in the argument: the evidence shows that once the value of life itself is undermined, assisted suicide will happen on demand.\n\nJohn O'Donnell\n\nWest Mersea, Essex\n\nDependable Queen\n\nSIR - In the year since his Coronation, King Charles has done an admirable job, and has become as popular as his much-loved late mother, in spite of the setbacks he's suffered due to ill health.\n\nHowever, in several articles giving him the praise he deserves there has been little mention of Queen Camilla. She has shown herself to be a rock on which he has been able to depend throughout his forced absence from public life. She has carried out duties with such dignity, and treated all those she has met with her usual friendliness and humour, showing that we are truly fortunate to have such a Queen.\n\nElisabeth Darley-Doran\n\nFrome, Somerset\n\nFarage's ride\n\nSIR - Why is Nigel Farage riding around in a BMW rather than a British-built Jaguar (\"Farage's car spotted in disabled parking space for 45 minutes\", report, May 7)?\n\nPhilip Corp\n\nSalisbury, Wiltshire\n\nPinning the crimes of corvids on domestic cats\n\nSIR - Natural England appears to want to blame the domestic cat for the depletion of songbirds (report, May 6). In the past decade I have observed countless songbird nests destroyed by jays and magpies - and not one by a cat.\n\nMight I suggest it has the right cause but the wrong target?\n\nChristopher Donnithorne\n\nGosport, Hampshire\n\nSIR - I haven't seen a robin in our garden for more than two years. The last was in the jaws of a neighbour's cat. It killed two that morning.\n\nRoger Fox\n\nTorquay, Devon\n\nSIR - Many years ago I put a collar with a bell on my cat to stop him catching birds (Letters, May 7).\n\nHe promptly went out and rolled his neck in the flower bed, thus filling the bell with soil so it would not ring.\n\nKathleen Glennon\n\nNewcastle upon Tyne\n\nThe right outfit for meeting the bank manager\n\nSIR - When my new husband and I were buying our first home, we could not afford to furnish it. We made an appointment with the bank manager (Letters, May 7).\n\nMy husband struggled to decide whether to wear his only suit and look a good prospect or his old sports jacket and look as if he needed the money. In the end he chose the suit.\n\nWe walked into the office and, before we could broach the subject of a loan, were met with the words: \"Good morning John, how much do you want?\"\n\nPam Booth\n\nHathersage, Derbyshire\n\nSIR - When I told my first bank manager that my regiment was being posted to Austria, he gave me an overdraft of \u00a3100 on the grounds that, as a young officer, I would need to have some leeway financially. He was caught out by the auditors, so he told me to write a letter saying it was due to \"the exigencies of the service\" and that I would repay it when possible. I should then forget it and carry on as usual.\n\nHe was my post box when I was abroad and I stayed with him for the rest of his career. I never went into the red thereafter. What a shame that banks don't have such managers today.\n\nChristopher Piggins\n\nSalisbury, Wiltshire\n\nSIR - As a student, armed with a BUNAC non-immigrant workers visa, I spent a summer holiday working in Fort Worth, Texas, where I opened a bank account in which to deposit my wages. New account holders were offered a shotgun as a free gift. Fearing problems at the airport, I had to decline, and sadly there was no cash alternative.\n\nRosalind Grimes\n\nHoniton, Devon\n\nLetters to the Editor\n\nWe accept letters by email and post.

Voters in Natalie Elphicke's constituency should now be offered the chance to vote for her or another candidate.\n\nIn what other job can you up sticks and work for the competition without resigning?\n\nMike Metcalfe\n\nButleigh, Somerset\n\nSIR - How many more Tory defections and losses of the whip will it take before a general election is called?\n\nMichael McGough\n\nLoughton, Essex\n\nSIR - Natalie Elphicke has lots in common with Sir Keir Starmer: principles that bend in the wind; an apparent lack of scruples; and an obvious love for a pointless stunt.\n\nRoger Cousins\n\nBeaconsfield, Buckinghamshire\n\nSIR - In striking concern and disbelief into the heart of Labour, while simultaneously uniting the Conservatives in disgust at her self-serving betrayal, Natalie Elphicke has arguably done Rishi Sunak a great service.\n\nChris Whitehouse\n\nLondon SE11\n\nSIR - The bizarre defection of Natalie Elphicke to a party that she surely despises - judging by her pronouncements in the recent past - encapsulates the terminal rot at the heart of this nation.\n\nWe have Conservatives who don't conserve; Labour for the workshy; liberals wishing to make views outside their self-righteous bubble illegal to express; Greens more interested in alternative lifestyles than ecology; and Reformers who actually want to regress.\n\nParties are no longer vehicles of principle but teams competing to win power for its own sake by any means necessary. Their purpose is to retain voters whose blind loyalty to a brand dictates their electoral decisions.\n\nDecades ago, there were politicians who had thrown away glittering careers because their sense of duty to the people of this country brought a realisation that their talents would be best deployed in Parliament; building that better tomorrow promised as a just reward for the sacrifices of the Second World War.\n\nSadly this kind of commitment no longer exists, and current members of both Houses of Parliament seem self-serving and hubristic.\n\nMark Boyle\n\nJohnstone, Renfrewshire\n\nSIR - Following Natalie Elphicke's defection to the Labour benches, surely Nigel Farage should represent Reform UK in Dover in the forthcoming general election.\n\nG E Allard\n\nGillingham, Kent\n\nSIR - Madeline Grant's account (Comment, May 8) of the betrayal of our Anglican musical heritage by those who should be promoting it illustrates the depressing parallels between the condition of the Church of England and that of our nation.\n\nIn the Church, as in the state, we see shrinking trust in leaders. We see administrators dismissing the local parish unit, where the Church's main work is done. We see Church members seething because their hands-on experience is ignored by those in charge. We see hard-working priests, and their vital sacramental pastoral ministry, treated as problems by managerial officials. And, as in the country, it is almost impossible to see future leaders who might help us turn the ship around. No doubt they are there, but they are unlikely to be favoured by the mindset presently dominating the Church.\n\nSIR - For 10 years I was the headmistress of Croughton, a voluntary-controlled village school that had Church representatives in the governing body (Letters, May 9).\n\nIt could be argued that, as the school is the only one in the village, it shouldn't be a faith school. However, each year we had more than twice the number of applications as places available. Staff at the local American airbase would fight to send their children to us rather than the secular school. Parents frequently told us that the ambience was noticeable as soon as they walked through the front door.\n\nWhile many secular schools undoubtedly also encourage kindness and respect, our entire ethos was based on our Christian values, and these clearly shone through. No one ever objected.\n\nEve Wilson\n\nHill Head, Hampshire\n\nSIR - I've had a good deal of pain and difficulty in walking for a week because of a swollen foot. I thought the problem would resolve itself with rest, but it didn't. On Wednesday at 10am, I went to my GP's website to complete the form to request an appointment, but I couldn't because it said that no further appointment requests were available that day. I should add that the system does not let anyone complete a form outside practice hours.\n\nI telephoned the practice and explained my problem to the receptionist, and was advised to call NHS 111, which I did. The service was very helpful but it took 20 minutes to explain my symptoms. I was told that I would receive a callback within six hours. Four hours later the call came and I was told that my GP would telephone the next day.\n\nAt least five people became involved in this charade - just because I was not allowed to complete a form online.\n\nJames Woods\n\nFrome, Somerset\n\nSIR - Unlike Robin Bendon (Letters, May 8), I find a wet shave is one of the joys of the day. I use a small, badger-hair brush, which I bought shortly after starting work in the City in the 1970s. It's still going strong, justifying the price at the time. I have any number of shaving creams on the go, in jars, tubes and cans. The jars last for years. After shaving I use an alum block to complete the ritual.\n\nThe only negative aspect of modern shaving is the astronomical price of razor blades.\n\nTim Oldfield\n\nWye, Kent\n\nSIR - It is all very well Lord Cameron stating that Europe should be \"tougher\" in the face of Russian and Chinese aggression (report, May 9), but we should remember his record when he was prime minister.\n\nHe oversaw significant cuts to Britain's conventional warfighting capabilities, which have left us more vulnerable than we should be. He also delayed the introduction of the next generation of nuclear deterrent submarines and allowed China to fund our civil nuclear power programme.\n\nRear Admiral Philip Mathias (retd)\n\nSouthsea, Hampshire\n\nSIR - I strongly reject William Sitwell's comments (\"Soft white bread is a con - no matter what the boffins do to it\", telegraph.co.uk, May 3).\n\nTo suggest, without evidence, that white bread causes cancer, diabetes and obesity paints a false impression of one of the nation's favourite staple foods, enjoyed by millions. All British bread, including \"packaged\" and \"supermarket\", contains a wealth of nutrients that play an important part in a healthy, balanced diet - including fibre, calcium, vitamins and iron. White bread offers a convenient and good-value staple food at a time when consumers' budgets are stretched.\n\nAndrew Pyne\n\nChief executive, Federation of Bakers\n\nLondon WC1\n\nSIR - In 1978 I was offered a job as a secretary in Dubai. I had no clothes suitable for a hot climate and no money for a new wardrobe, having reached the limit of \u00a3150 on my Barclaycard.\n\nI met the manager of Barclays in Tunbridge Wells (Letters, May 9). He agreed to a \u00a3100 loan, provided I handed over my Barclaycard for him to cut in half. I then went to Dubai, paid off my loan, cleared my card account - and have never been in debt since.\n\nSusan Sang\n\nPetersfield, Hampshire\n\nSIR - During the 1980s I returned from college for the Christmas break and was invited to meet my bank manager.\n\nHe told me I was living beyond my means and asked what plans I had to pay off my overdraft. At the Easter break we had a similar meeting. In the summer we met again. He said: \"If I have to call you in next term I will need to inform your father.\" I stayed in the black for the rest of my course.\n\nMark Lewis\n\nStalbridge, Dorset\n\nSIR - William Sitwell (\"Let's get on board with Boris's wooden toys\", Features, May 4) makes a very good argument in favour of these toys over plastic ones. There is also the bonus of longevity.\n\nMy sons, who are now in their 20s, have received many gifts over the years. The plastic ones were gradually donated or re-gifted, while the wooden ones are in the loft awaiting the next generation.\n\nFrances Williams\n\nSwindon, Wiltshire\n\nSIR - William Sitwell's article reminded me of making wooden sledges for all eight of my grandchildren and the first seven great-grandchildren.\n\nHowever, when my eighth great-grandchild was born more than 300 miles away, I was able to buy and have delivered a plastic sledge for less than the price of the wood and runners.\n\nIt all comes down to cost.\n\nDerrick G Smith\n\nBexhill-on-Sea, East Sussex\n\nSIR - Chris O'Shea, the CEO of British Gas, says every household should be forced to have a smart meter to help hit net-zero targets, despite widespread resistance to the devices (report, May 9). The implication is that he wants to be able to control how much gas we use, the price we pay and the pattern of usage at different times of the day. This is pure socialism - without a vote.\n\nAs a customer, I should be allowed to spend my money as I choose, and, provided I'm prepared to pay the quoted price, should be able to buy as much gas as I want at the time of my choosing. This is the free market.\n\nIt is not possible to believe in both positions simultaneously.\n\nIan Mackenzie\n\nPreston, Lancashire\n\nSIR - Please can Chris O'Shea explain how smart meters will help hit net-zero targets? Without one I know exactly what appliances I am using. A meter will not mean I no longer heat the house, cook or watch television.\n\nAnne Jappie\n\nCheltenham, Gloucestershire\n\nSIR - Before making smart meters mandatory, the Government should ask British Gas to try to fit them in my property as a test case. I live in a large, old, stone-built house, and have been told by my supplier that I can't have a smart gas meter because my current model doesn't have a smart equivalent, and, in any event, is too far away from my electricity meter to transmit the necessary signal to it.\n\nIf British Gas solves these problems and pays for the work to enable the installation, it can have my supply contract for both fuels and my support for its policy. If it fails, it should withdraw the proposal.\n\nDr A S Hearne\n\nWoodstock, Oxfordshire\n\nWe accept letters by email and post. Please include name, address, work and home telephone numbers.\n\nADDRESS: 111 Buckingham Palace Road, London, SW1W 0DT\n\nEMAIL: dtletters@telegraph.co.uk\n\nFOLLOW: Telegraph Letters on Twitter

How did they get there after Boris Johnson secured an 80-seat majority in 2019?\n\nLike it or not, it was Boris as leader who won over voters, but his party chose to abandon him. It is no coincidence that the decline occurred at this time, as nothing could replace his charisma and ability to get things done, despite his chaotic approach. Most conservative voters I know weren't at all concerned about the Partygate nonsense, which ultimately got the better of him.\n\nThe bottom line is that the party lost its true conservative values and aspirations, shunned its core voters and, in an effort to appeal to a wider electorate, transformed itself into a blue Labor Party. Today he is paying the price, as we all will under Sir Keir Starmer.\n\nRob Mason\n\nNailsea, Somerset\n\nSIR In the run-up to the 2017 general election, we had to endure Theresa May's talk of a strong and stable government on the airwaves for seven weeks. I hope we don't have to endure Rishi Sunaks, we have a plan (Comment, May 4) for what could be another seven months.\n\nMalcolm Watson\n\nRyde, Isle of Wight\n\nSIR Lord Frost (Commentary, May 6) argues that the Conservative Party could improve its public reputation if it moved towards more attractive traditional Conservative policies, but adds that many Conservative MPs, including most ministers, will not support not this approach. What does it mean from a Prime Minister if he appoints ministers who come with their own agendas and without the intention of presenting a firm and unified approach to governing the country?\n\nAnd what about those MPs who sit under the Conservative banner, but who mingle, argue and oppose as if they were independent rather than members of a party?\n\nAllan Muirhead\n\nKirkby Lonsdale, Cumbria\n\nSIR In a short time, when we all have the magical gift of hindsight, one expert after another will try to explain the degeneration of our country over the last three years. Let me anticipate.\n\nEverything comes from Covid, but not from the virus. The pandemic was the cause of the panic that persuaded a weak government and an ailing Prime Minister to hand over the management of our country to an incompetent civil service. Since then, failure after failure, failure after failure, and fiasco after fiasco can be directly attributed to a bloated, self-gratifying bureaucracy, costing taxpayers billions and affecting every moment of our lives.\n\nWe are no longer a true democracy. The only remedy is a radical reduction in administrative formalities and their costs. But that would require political leadership with an iron will that no major party possesses.

However, they said, among the formerly injured workers, \"virtually all occupational groups demonstrated increased risks, which was something we weren't expecting to find.\"\n\nThe study was published online on April 24, 2024, in the Canadian Journal of Public Health.\n\nTo estimate incident rates of opioid-related poisonings and mental and behavioral disorders among formerly injured workers and the general population, the researchers linked workers' compensation claimants (1983-2019) in the ODSS to emergency department (ED) and hospitalization records (2006-2020).\n\nMost workers in the ODSS (80.9%) were at least 35 years old and male (66.3%). In contrast, two thirds of the general population were at least 35 years old, and half were male. The researchers calculated standardized incidence ratios (SIRs), adjusting for age, sex, year, and region.\n\nCompared with the rate in the general population, opioid-related poisonings in the ODSS group were higher in both ED (SIR = 2.41) and hospitalization records (SIR = 1.54).\n\nAlmost all occupational groups in the ODSS had higher risks for opioid-related poisonings compared with the general population. As noted earlier, some of the highest SIRs were among those in construction trades (SIR = 3.16), materials handling (SIR = 2.84), processing (mineral, metal, chemical; SIR = 2.72), and machining and related (SIR = 2.61) occupations.\n\nHigher risks were also seen in service, medicine and health, sales, and processing (food, wood, and textile) occupations. Teaching and related occupations, however, had a reduced risk for opioid-related poisonings compared with the general population, based on ED and hospitalization data (SIR = 0.73 and 0.40, respectively).\n\nOpioid-related mental and behavioral disorders were also higher in the ODSS group (ED visits, SIR = 1.86; hospitalizations, SIR = 1.42), and as shown with poisonings, almost all occupational groups had higher risks.\n\nSubgroup analyses showed the risk for opioid-related poisonings among female workers in the ODSS was higher than that among women in the general population in ED (SIR = 2.83) and hospitalization records (SIR = 1.60). Results were similar for males (ED visits, SIR = 2.30; hospitalizations, SIR = 1.52).\n\nLikewise, the risk for opioid-related mental and behavioral disorders was higher among female workers in the ODSS (ED visits, SIR = 1.73; hospitalizations, SIR = 1.33) and males (ED visits, SIR = 1.90; hospitalizations, SIR = 1.46).\n\nAlthough the patterns of findings by occupation and industry among men and women resembled those of the main analysis, in most cases, SIR estimates were higher among women than among men.\n\n\"Findings support the hypothesis that work-related injuries have a role as a preventable risk factor for opioid-related harms,\" wrote the authors. \"Strategies aimed at primary prevention of occupational injuries and secondary prevention of work disability and long-term opioid use are warranted.\"\n\n\"This work is important not only for workers but also their family and friends, employers, the wider community, and the healthcare system, as we are all impacted by this growing public health crisis,\" said Carnide and Sritharan.\n\n\"When a worker does experience an injury, post-injury supports are important,\" they added. \"These may include timely access to medical care and rehabilitation services, the provision of nonopioid pain management, and workplace supports that enable a safe return to work to avoid aggravating the original injury.\"\n\nPrescribing of opioids, when necessary, should follow clinical guidelines, they noted, \"and workers would benefit from education on the potential risks of use.\"\n\nCommenting on the study for Medscape Medical News, Samuel R. Friedman, PhD, research professor at the Center for Opioid Epidemiology and Policy in the Department of Population Health, NYU Grossman School of Medicine in New York City, said, \"This is a well-done study with important findings. The importance of workplaces in public health is frequently underrated. Public health schools and practitioners and research funding bodies should pay more attention to these issues and their upstream causes and solutions.\" Friedman did not participate in the research.\n\n\"Workplace injuries are often the result of economic and cultural pressures that lead employers to speed up work, introduce dangerous innovations, or force workers to work when they are too tired to do so safely,\" said Friedman, who discussed these pressures in an earlier article.\n\nThe current study \"would be more useful if it discussed these issues and also discussed how unions and shop floor rank-and-file groups can take actions to protect worker safety even when employers are opposed,\" he said.\n\nIn addition, he noted, in their discussion of why women seem to be at higher risk for overdose or other opioid-related harms, the authors did not consider \"the stresses created by social subordination (akin to effects of such stressors on mortality rates of racial or ethnic minorities) and by the difficulties of dealing both with employment and inequitable amounts of household duties many women face.\n\n\"It is notable that healthcare occupations have increased rates of opioid-related harms after injury,\" he added. \"Clinicians and hospital administrators should prioritize worker safety more, and clinicians should support the development of strong and effective unions at their workplaces. Further, when injuries occur, they should do everything they can to support the injured, along the lines that this and similar papers have pointed to.\"\n\nThe study was funded by the Public Health Agency of Canada.

Voters in Natalie Elphicke's constituency should now be offered the chance to vote for her or another candidate.\n\nIn what other job can you up sticks and work for the competition without resigning?\n\nMike Metcalfe\n\nButleigh, Somerset\n\nSIR - How many more Tory defections and losses of the whip will it take before a general election is called?\n\nMichael McGough\n\nLoughton, Essex\n\nSIR - Natalie Elphicke has lots in common with Sir Keir Starmer: principles that bend in the wind; an apparent lack of scruples; and an obvious love for a pointless stunt.\n\nRoger Cousins\n\nBeaconsfield, Buckinghamshire\n\nSIR - In striking concern and disbelief into the heart of Labour, while simultaneously uniting the Conservatives in disgust at her self-serving betrayal, Natalie Elphicke has arguably done Rishi Sunak a great service.\n\nChris Whitehouse\n\nLondon SE11\n\nSIR - The bizarre defection of Natalie Elphicke to a party that she surely despises - judging by her pronouncements in the recent past - encapsulates the terminal rot at the heart of this nation.\n\nWe have Conservatives who don't conserve; Labour for the workshy; liberals wishing to make views outside their self-righteous bubble illegal to express; Greens more interested in alternative lifestyles than ecology; and Reformers who actually want to regress.\n\nParties are no longer vehicles of principle but teams competing to win power for its own sake by any means necessary. Their purpose is to retain voters whose blind loyalty to a brand dictates their electoral decisions.\n\nDecades ago, there were politicians who had thrown away glittering careers because their sense of duty to the people of this country brought a realisation that their talents would be best deployed in Parliament; building that better tomorrow promised as a just reward for the sacrifices of the Second World War.\n\nSadly this kind of commitment no longer exists, and current members of both Houses of Parliament seem self-serving and hubristic.\n\nMark Boyle\n\nJohnstone, Renfrewshire\n\nSIR - Following Natalie Elphicke's defection to the Labour benches, surely Nigel Farage should represent Reform UK in Dover in the forthcoming general election.\n\nG\u2009E Allard\n\nGillingham, Kent\n\nChurch betrayals\n\nSIR - Madeline Grant's account (Comment, May 8) of the betrayal of our Anglican musical heritage by those who should be promoting it illustrates the depressing parallels between the condition of the Church of England and that of our nation.\n\nIn the Church, as in the state, we see shrinking trust in leaders. We see administrators dismissing the local parish unit, where the Church's main work is done. We see Church members seething because their hands-on experience is ignored by those in charge. We see hard-working priests, and their vital sacramental pastoral ministry, treated as problems by managerial officials. And, as in the country, it is almost impossible to see future leaders who might help us turn the ship around. No doubt they are there, but they are unlikely to be favoured by the mindset presently dominating the Church.\n\nDoes all this sound only too familiar?\n\nRev Dr Barry Orford\n\nLondon NW3\n\nSIR - For 10 years I was the headmistress of Croughton, a voluntary-controlled village school that had Church representatives in the governing body (Letters, May 9).\n\nIt could be argued that, as the school is the only one in the village, it shouldn't be a faith school. However, each year we had more than twice the number of applications as places available. Staff at the local American airbase would fight to send their children to us rather than the secular school. Parents frequently told us that the ambience was noticeable as soon as they walked through the front door.\n\nWhile many secular schools undoubtedly also encourage kindness and respect, our entire ethos was based on our Christian values, and these clearly shone through. No one ever objected.\n\nEve Wilson\n\nHill Head, Hampshire\n\nGP system failure\n\nSIR - I've had a good deal of pain and difficulty in walking for a week because of a swollen foot. I thought the problem would resolve itself with rest, but it didn't. On Wednesday at 10am, I went to my GP's website to complete the form to request an appointment, but I couldn't because it said that no further appointment requests were available that day. I should add that the system does not let anyone complete a form outside practice hours.\n\nI telephoned the practice and explained my problem to the receptionist, and was advised to call NHS 111, which I did. The service was very helpful but it took 20 minutes to explain my symptoms. I was told that I would receive a callback within six hours. Four hours later the call came and I was told that my GP would telephone the next day.\n\nAt least five people became involved in this charade - just because I was not allowed to complete a form online.\n\nJames Woods\n\nFrome, Somerset\n\nThe joy of shaving\n\nSIR - Unlike Robin Bendon (Letters, May 8), I find a wet shave is one of the joys of the day. I use a small, badger-hair brush, which I bought shortly after starting work in the City in the 1970s. It's still going strong, justifying the price at the time. I have any number of shaving creams on the go, in jars, tubes and cans. The jars last for years. After shaving I use an alum block to complete the ritual.\n\nThe only negative aspect of modern shaving is the astronomical price of razor blades.\n\nTim Oldfield\n\nWye, Kent\n\nCameron on defence\n\nSIR - It is all very well Lord Cameron stating that Europe should be \"tougher\" in the face of Russian and Chinese aggression (report, May 9), but we should remember his record when he was prime minister.\n\nHe oversaw significant cuts to Britain's conventional warfighting capabilities, which have left us more vulnerable than we should be. He also delayed the introduction of the next generation of nuclear deterrent submarines and allowed China to fund our civil nuclear power programme.\n\nRear Admiral Philip Mathias (retd)\n\nSouthsea, Hampshire\n\nGreat white bread\n\nSIR - I strongly reject William Sitwell's comments (\"Soft white bread is a con - no matter what the boffins do to it\", telegraph.co.uk, May 3).\n\nTo suggest, without evidence, that white bread causes cancer, diabetes and obesity paints a false impression of one of the nation's favourite staple foods, enjoyed by millions. All British bread, including \"packaged\" and \"supermarket\", contains a wealth of nutrients that play an important part in a healthy, balanced diet - including fibre, calcium, vitamins and iron. White bread offers a convenient and good-value staple food at a time when consumers' budgets are stretched.\n\nAndrew Pyne\n\nChief executive, Federation of Bakers\n\nLondon WC1\n\nSaved by the bank\n\nSIR - In 1978 I was offered a job as a secretary in Dubai. I had no clothes suitable for a hot climate and no money for a new wardrobe, having reached the limit of \u00a3150 on my Barclaycard.\n\nI met the manager of Barclays in Tunbridge Wells (Letters, May 9). He agreed to a \u00a3100 loan, provided I handed over my Barclaycard for him to cut in half. I then went to Dubai, paid off my loan, cleared my card account - and have never been in debt since.\n\nSusan Sang\n\nPetersfield, Hampshire\n\nSIR - During the 1980s I returned from college for the Christmas break and was invited to meet my bank manager.\n\nHe told me I was living beyond my means and asked what plans I had to pay off my overdraft. At the Easter break we had a similar meeting. In the summer we met again. He said: \"If I have to call you in next term I will need to inform your father.\" I stayed in the black for the rest of my course.\n\nMark Lewis\n\nStalbridge, Dorset\n\nWhy wooden toys are a cut above the rest\n\nSIR - William Sitwell (\"Let's get on board with Boris's wooden toys\", Features, May 4) makes a very good argument in favour of these toys over plastic ones. There is also the bonus of longevity.\n\nMy sons, who are now in their 20s, have received many gifts over the years. The plastic ones were gradually donated or re-gifted, while the wooden ones are in the loft awaiting the next generation.\n\nFrances Williams\n\nSwindon, Wiltshire\n\nSIR - William Sitwell's article reminded me of making wooden sledges for all eight of my grandchildren and the first seven great-grandchildren.\n\nHowever, when my eighth great-grandchild was born more than 300 miles away, I was able to buy and have delivered a plastic sledge for less than the price of the wood and runners.\n\nIt all comes down to cost.\n\nDerrick G Smith\n\nBexhill-on-Sea, East Sussex\n\nBritish Gas's plea for mandatory smart meters\n\nSIR - Chris O'Shea, the CEO of British Gas, says every household should be forced to have a smart meter to help hit net-zero targets, despite widespread resistance to the devices (report, May 9). The implication is that he wants to be able to control how much gas we use, the price we pay and the pattern of usage at different times of the day. This is pure socialism - without a vote.\n\nAs a customer, I should be allowed to spend my money as I choose, and, provided I'm prepared to pay the quoted price, should be able to buy as much gas as I want at the time of my choosing. This is the free market.\n\nIt is not possible to believe in both positions simultaneously.\n\nIan Mackenzie\n\nPreston, Lancashire\n\nSIR - Please can Chris O'Shea explain how smart meters will help hit net-zero targets? Without one I know exactly what appliances I am using. A meter will not mean I no longer heat the house, cook or watch television.\n\nAnne Jappie\n\nCheltenham, Gloucestershire\n\nSIR - Before making smart meters mandatory, the Government should ask British Gas to try to fit them in my property as a test case. I live in a large, old, stone-built house, and have been told by my supplier that I can't have a smart gas meter because my current model doesn't have a smart equivalent, and, in any event, is too far away from my electricity meter to transmit the necessary signal to it.\n\nIf British Gas solves these problems and pays for the work to enable the installation, it can have my supply contract for both fuels and my support for its policy. If it fails, it should withdraw the proposal.\n\nDr A\u2009S Hearne\n\nWoodstock, Oxfordshire\n\nLetters to the Editor\n\nWe accept letters by email and post.

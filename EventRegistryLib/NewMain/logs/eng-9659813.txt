We are also identifying one vessel owned by one of these entities as blocked property.\n\nThe Houthis' attacks against unarmed commercial vessels continue to inhibit navigation in a vital waterway.

The sanctions are targeting individuals and entities believed to be key enablers of the Houthis' revenue generation and acquisition of materials used to manufacture advanced weapons.\n\nThe sanctions come in the wake of a series of attacks launched by the Houthis since November 2023, using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), ballistic missiles, and cruise missiles. These attacks have resulted in the deaths of innocent seafarers, extensive damage to commercial ships, and a significant threat to global freedom of navigation.\n\n\"The Houthis' continued, indiscriminate, and reckless attacks against unarmed commercial vessels are made possible by their access to key components necessary for the production of their missiles and UAVs,\" said Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian E. Nelson. \"The United States remains resolved to use the full range of our tools to halt the flow of military-grade materials and funds from commodities sales that enable these destabilizing terrorist activities.\"\n\nAmong those designated are Ali Abd-al-Wahhab Muhammad al-Wazir and his company, Guangzhou Tasneem Trading Company Limited, due to their affiliation with the Houthis. Activities in Oman were also targeted, with Oman-based International Smart Digital Interface Limited Liability Company (ISDI) and its operator, Muaadh Ahmed Mohammed al-Haifi, also sanctioned for facilitating the transfer of weapons-grade materials into Yemen. Additionally, PRC-based firms Ningbo Beilun Saige Machine Co., Ltd. and Dongguan Yuze Machining Tools Company Limited were sanctioned for supplying critical components to Houthi forces.\n\nThe sanctions also extend to the UAE-based Stellar Wave Marine L.L.C, manager of the Cameroon-flagged OTARIA, and its captain, Vyacheslav Salyga. The vessel was allegedly involved in shipping commodities for Houthi financier Sa'id al-Jamal.\n\nThe recent actions of OFAC follow the sanctions imposed last week on ten individuals, entities, and vessels engaged in illicit oil and commodity transportation, including on behalf of Houthi financial facilitator Sa'id al-Jamal.

Help AGSIW expand its Arabic-language analysis.\n\nOn June 6, the Houthis arrested several United Nations and international nongovernmental organization employees, linking them to what the group called an \"American-Israeli spy cell.\" Six days later, the Houthis claimed their first successful drone boat attack, striking the Greek-owned bulk carrier Tutor off the coast of Yemen in the Red Sea. At the same time, after a dip during Ramadan, Houthi attacks on commercial shipping in and around the Red Sea are again on the rise. U.S. intelligence reports suggest the Houthis are, once again, reaching out to al-Shabaab in Somalia about weapon transfers, and the group continues to look for ways to expand its reach, threatening ships as far away as the Mediterranean. These recent developments indicate the Houthis are escalating and looking to expand their war with the United States.\n\nThis should come as no surprise: This is very much the approach that the Houthis took during their six successive wars against the Yemeni government of President Ali Abdullah Saleh from 2004-10. The Houthis would face a setback, such as the death of their founder in 2004, or the destruction of their farms, and then regroup and reattack. The common denominator to all of this was the simple formula of escalate and expand. The first Houthi war, from June to September 2004, was largely centered on the northern governorate of Saada. By 2005, the fighting had spread into the neighboring governorate of Amran. Then, over the next two years, it crept further south until residents in Sanaa could hear the shelling. Today, of course, the Houthis control much of northern Yemen. But while the group's enemy has changed from Saleh to the United States, its strategy has not. The Houthis are still looking to escalate and expand the war.\n\nThe Houthi's actions in early June indicate exactly how they will attempt to do this. First, the Houthis will look to increase the number of attacks. The more missiles and drones they fire, the more likely it is that they will have a successful strike. Second, as the drone boat indicates, the Houthis will look to utilize new weapons and forms of attacks. In this they will likely be aided by Iran, which may use the Houthis to test out new weapon platforms. Third, as the Houthis have already threatened, they will attempt to broaden their targets beyond the Red Sea and into the Indian Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. The wider their target area, the greater impact they will have. Fourth, and related, the Houthis will look to build on Iran's axis of resistance by partnering with groups that, while not necessarily ideologically aligned, have similar short-term goals, like al-Shabaab. The more threats the Houthis can present the United States within the region, the better their chances of success. But perhaps the most worrying of the five avenues of escalation is what might be called the \"exploit vulnerabilities\" approach. This is what the Houthis did by arresting U.N. and international NGO workers and then linking them to what the group is rather ridiculously calling spy rings. The Houthis can pressure the United States through the U.N. and international aid agencies, essentially raising the stakes of the conflict.\n\nAll of this creates a problem for the United States, which from the beginning has sought to do the least amount possible to mitigate Houthi attacks. Much of this caution, of course, is a result of trying to avoid being sucked into a broader regional war, but it has also put the United States in the unenviable position of reacting to Houthi attacks instead of seizing the initiative.\n\nIn October and November 2023, when the Houthis began attacking commercial ships in the Red Sea, the United States settled on a defense only approach, shooting down Houthis missiles and drones. Then, in January, when it became clear that defense only wasn't sufficient, the United States issued a public warning, and then began carrying out limited strikes on Houthi launching points in Yemen.\n\nOver the last six months, that has largely been the pattern: The Houthis fire missiles or drones at commercial ships, the United States shoots them down and then, every so often, launches offensive counterstrikes against Houthi targets in Yemen. As U.S. Navy commanders recently told the Associated Press, this is the \"most intense running sea battle the Navy has faced since World War II.\" But for all the tactical successes in shooting down Houthi attacks, the United States has not achieved its broader goals of either deterring the Houthis from carrying out attacks or so degrading the group to the point that it becomes incapable of carrying out future attacks.\n\nInstead, the Houthis - like in the past - are escalating and seeking to expand the war. The United States now finds itself in a similar position to the one it was in six months ago: How should it respond to Houthi attacks when its current approach isn't working?\n\nThe defense only approach didn't work, and now the limited military strikes approach isn't working. That leaves the United States with two equally unappealing options. Either continue its approach of defending commercial shipping and conducting periodic strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen and hope that something changes, or escalate to match the Houthis. Unfortunately for the United States, neither option has a high likelihood of success. The current U.S. approach isn't working, and more of the same will neither deter nor degrade the Houthis. Increasing military attacks, on the other hand, is exactly what the Houthis want. The Houthis want a broader more expansive war with the United States - partly because it is good for them domestically and regionally, and partly because the Houthis think they can outlast and withstand more pain than the United States.\n\nAs ever in Yemen, there are no easy or obvious answers for the United States.", "source": {"uri": "agsiw.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arab Gulf

"June 17 (UPI) -- The Biden administration sanctioned Houthi procurement and revenue-generating networks on Monday as the United States continues to target the Iran proxy militia's weapon supplies and funds to thwart its attacks on shipping vessels in the Red Sea.\n\nThe sanctions were imposed by the U.S. Treasury against two people and five companies that make up the procurement network and one person, one company and one shipping vessel for facilitating the shipment of commodities, the sales from which officials said are an important funding stream for the Iran-backed group.\n\nMany of those designated Monday were based in China.\n\n\"The United States remains resolved to use the full range of our tools to halt the flow of military-grade materials and funds from commodities sales that enable these destabilizing terrorist activities,\" Brian Nelson, under secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, said Monday in a statement.\n\nThe Houthis have been attacking vessels transiting the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden from parts of Yemen under their control since November, stating it was doing so in solidarity with the Palestinian people amid Israel's war against Hamas, another Iran proxy militia, in Gaza.\n\nSince taking the Japanese-owned Galaxy Leader shipping vessel and its crew hostage on Nov. 19, the Houthis have launched more than 190 attacks, Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters Monday in a press conference.\n\nThough the majority of the attacks have been intercepted by U.S. and ally military's patrolling the important shipping route, the rebels have hit several ships, including the Rubymar in February, which sank in international waters.\n\nThe Biden administration has been leery of escalating the war, and has responded with sanctions, but has also conducted strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen officials say to hinder the rebels' ability to hit more ships.\n\nThe sanctions on Monday come amid an increase in Houthi attacks, with two cargo ships being struck since last week.\n\nThe United States has rejected the Houthis' claim that the attacks are in support of the Palestinian people, stating they are threatening the ability to transit goods through the region, including those intended for Yemen and Gaza.\n\nU.S. Central Command late Monday said in the last 24 hours it has destroyed four Houthi radars, a maritime drone and an aerial drone.\n\n\"The Houthis' continued, indiscriminate and reckless attacks against unarmed commercial vessels are made possible by their access to key components necessary for the production of their missiles and UAVs,\" Nelson said.\n\nSanctions generally freeze the U.S. asset of those designated while barring U.S. persons from doing business with

The Houthi movement has fought with the internationally recognized Yemeni government for years but has more recently turned its attention to the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. The Houthi movement has claimed solidarity with the Palestinian people and has launched attacks on merchant ships it claims are suspected of associating with Israeli interests and Israel's allies and partners.\n\nOFAC sanctioned Ali Abd-al-Wahhab Muhammad al-Wazir, his PRC-based company Guangzhou Tasneem Trading Company Limited (Guangzhou Tasneem), and the Hong Kong-based parent company Tasneem Trading Company Limited. OFAC alleged Mr. al-Wazir and the Chinese companies have \"procured materials that enable Houthi forces to manufacture advanced conventional weapons inside Yemen.\"\n\nOFAC designated two more PRC-based entities, Ningbo Beilun Saige Machine Co., Ltd. and Dongguan Yuze Machining Tools Company Limited, for sanctions. The Treasury Department office said Ningbo Beilun Saige company has procured materials for manufacturing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and other weapons the Houthis have used to target vessels. OFAC said Houthi-affiliated actors have relied on the Dongguan Yuze company to source tens of thousands of dollars worth of equipment for weapons production efforts inside Yemen.\n\nThe new sanctions also target the United Arab Emirates-based Stellar Wave Marine L.L.C. OFAC said Cameroon-flagged merchant ship M/V Otaria, a crude oil tanker owned by Stellar Wave, loaded and carried unspecified commodities to Singapore on behalf of Sa'id al-Jamal, a suspected Houthi financier previously sanctioned by the United States. OFAC announced it would also sanction Otaria's captain, Vyacheslav Salyga, for his role in transporting the cargo.\n\nThe Houthis severely damaged the Liberian-flagged bulk carrier M/V Tutor in a June 12 attack using an explosive-laden remote-controlled boat known as an unmanned surface vessel (USV).\n\nA day later, Houthis again landed a blow against the Palauan-flagged, Ukrainian-owned, Polish-operated bulk cargo carrier M/V Verbena.\n\nWhite House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby announced at a June 17 White House press briefing that last week's attacks killed a Filipino crewmember on the Tutor and critically wounded a Sri Lankan crew member aboard the Verbena.\n\nMr. Kirby went on to denounce the Houthi claims that its actions are in solidarity with the Palestinian people. He insisted the crews of the Tutor and the Verbena weren't taking weapons to Israel or in any other way taking a side in the ongoing conflict in the Gaza Strip.\n\n\"They were just manning their posts aboard ship trying to earn a paycheck and keep global commerce moving,\" Mr. Kirby said.\n\nThe White House official said the Houthis had struck other non-combatant vessels in past attacks, including ships carrying humanitarian supplies to Sudan as well as to Yemen.\n\n\"The Houthis are causing needless suffering across the entire region, for Gazans, for the Sudanese, for the Yemenis themselves, and as they said, this is pure terrorism,\" Mr. Kirby said. \"There's simply no other word for it. The Houthi claim of supporting Gazans is meritless.\"\n\nThe U.S. government has flip-flopped on whether to consider the Houthis a terrorist group in recent years.\n\nBeginning in 2015, President Barack Obama's administration began providing military logistical and targeting support for a Saudi Arabian-led military coalition backing the internationally recognized Yemeni government in its fight with the Houthis.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration continued U.S. support for the Saudi-led counter-Houthi coalition throughout his presidency and, in his final days in office, moved to designate the Houthis as a specially designated global terrorist group and as a foreign terrorist organization.

Since November 2023, the Houthis have deployed a range of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), ballistic missiles, and cruise missiles to attack merchant vessels and their crews in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, killing innocent civilians, causing severe damage to commercial ships, and threatening global freedom of navigation.\n\nThe Houthis' continued, indiscriminate, and reckless attacks against unarmed commercial vessels are made possible by their access to key components necessary for the production of their missiles and UAVs.\n\n...said Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian E. Nelson.\n\nHouthi procurement activities in the people's republic of China\n\nAli Abd-al-Wahhab Muhammad al-Wazir (al-Wazir) is a PRC-based Houthi-affiliated individual who plays a key role in procuring materials that enable Houthi forces to manufacture advanced conventional weapons inside Yemen. He uses his PRC-based company, Guangzhou Tasneem Trading Company Limited (Guangzhou Tasneem), to obtain these items and ship them to Yemen. Guangzhou Tasneem is a wholly owned subsidiary of Hong Kong-based Tasneem Trading Company Limited.\n\nAl-Wazir is being designated pursuant to E.O. 13224, as amended, for having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Ansarallah. Guangzhou Tasneem is being designated pursuant to E.O. 13224, as amended, for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, Ansarallah.

One such entity, the Oman-based International Smart Digital Interface Limited Liability Company (ISDI), has purchased and facilitated the transfer of cruise missile components, manufacturing equipment, and other dual-use materials into Yemen. ISDI and its operator, Muaadh Ahmed Mohammed al-Haifi (al-Haifi), coordinate with senior Houthi members to complete these procurements. ISDI's and al-Haifi's activities have directly enabled Houthi attacks against U.S. allies in the region. In 2020, for example, Houthi forces struck a Saudi Aramco facility in the region using a Quds-type land attack cruise missile that contained components that ISDI had sourced from a PRC-based supplier.

This is the second ship sunk by the Houthis. They have attacked more than 60 ships and killed four sailors since the beginning of their campaign against Red Sea shipping lanes. This is unacceptable, and decisive action needs to be taken.\n\nThe United States has been combatting Houthi missile strikes since the beginning of their attacks. Starting in January, the U.S. Navy has taken direct action against Houthi military installations in Yemen. But these strikes have failed to deter the Houthis from continuing their campaign against international shipping.\n\nThe Houthis benefit from the status quo. By taking on the U.S. military and supporting Hamas's war against Israel, they have gained sympathy across the Middle East. Consequently, it is harder for Arab opponents of the Houthis, such as Saudi Arabia, to act against them. Reports also suggest some Middle Eastern nations have asked the U.S. not to launch strikes against the Houthis from their soil. Overall, the Houthis have gained prestige across the Middle East through their continuation of this conflict.\n\nThe Houthis would not be able to sustain these operations on their own. The biggest ally of the Houthis, Iran, has supported their campaign with material and financial support. Moreover, Rear Adm. Marc Miguez, commander of the U.S. Navy carrier strike group in the Red Sea, reported, \"We have pretty high confidence that not only is Iran providing financial support, but they're providing intelligence support.\"\n\nThis lengthy campaign is exhausting U.S. forces in the area. The USS Eisenhower has been in combat nearly every day for nine months now, with two extensions having been made to its deployment. Not only is this conflict tiring for personnel, but the costs of U.S. countermeasures to Houthi missiles and drones are quite expensive. The missiles used by the U.S. Navy in this operation often cost anywhere from $1 million to $4 million. Meanwhile, the drones they face cost under $100,000.\n\nThis continuing stalemate in the Red Sea reflects a deeper problem with the Biden administration's approach to international affairs. The White House has demonstrated an inability to decisively take foreign policy action and effectively control the international situation. This passivity has been reflected in its response to Ukraine where, even before Republican legislative obstinacy, the White House was hesitant to commit the resources necessary for Ukraine to win. This is also seen in the administration's hand-wringing over the war in Gaza, attempting an impossible compromise between appeasing pro-Palestinian Democratic voters and supporting a crucial ally against a terrorist group.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nThis prioritization of political ease over decisive action has plagued U.S. foreign policy for decades. This mindset is what led the U.S. to sleepwalk through its wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, not to mention countless other failed interventions. Whatever is needed to change the situation in the Red Sea, whether it be more military resources in the region or an increased number of strikes, the White House's approach to the conflict needs to change.\n\nThere is one basic rule when using military force.

As a result of the Houthis actions, container shipping through the Red Sea channel -- which accounts for 10 to 15% of all maritime trade -- dropped by 90% as of February, according to a U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) report from June 13. (RELATED: Israeli Officials' Latest Comments Indicate Middle East Powder Keg May Be On Verge Of Blowing Up)\n\n\"Despite seeking international legitimacy, Houthi actions have damaged regional security, impeded international humanitarian relief efforts, and put stress on global maritime trade,\" the DIA report reads.\n\nShipping vessels, frequently the victims of Houthi attacks, have sought safer passage via alternative routes to the Red Sea. Some vessels have chosen to sail southbound and loop around Africa, adding 11,000 nautical miles to their journey and racking up $1 million in fuel costs per trip, according to the report.\n\nBulker and tanker vessels have been less affected by the Houthi's actions than container vessels have, according to the report. Even so, vessels are still burdened by additional travel times and costs, and some shipping companies are paying for war risk insurance at premiums 1000% times higher than before the Israel-Hamas war broke out in October.\n\nAttempts to stop the Houthis from attacking have been largely unsuccessful. In December, the Biden administration created a U.S.-allied naval coalition in the Red Sea -- dubbed operation \"Prosperity Guardian\" -- to provide deterrence measures, but the terrorist group continued launching attacks. U.S. and coalition forces have been routinely targeted in Houthi attacks and forced to intercept other strikes aimed at shipping vessels.\n\nOperation Prosperity Guardian is aimed to provide defensive measures, rather than an offensive front.\n\n\"Our goal is not to completely eliminate the capabilities of Houthi forces. Our goal is to disrupt and degrade their ability to conduct these attacks,\" Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters in February. \"This collective action sends a clear message to the Houthis that they will continue to bear further consequences if they do not end their illegal attacks.\"\n\nThe Houthis were re-added to the U.S. terror designation list in January. The administration offered in April to lift the \"terrorist\" label from the Houthis if they stopped launching attacks in the Red Sea.\n\nThe Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The Houthis previously killed three seafarers aboard the MV True Confidence on March 6 and sank the MV Rubymar on March 2, posing a critical threat to Red Sea ecosystems. Houthi attacks continue to hinder vital humanitarian assistance from reaching Yemenis and pose dire risks to economic and humanitarian conditions in countries across the Red Sea region and to the broader global economy.

OFAC is also designating one individual and one company, as well as identifying one vessel, that have facilitated the shipment of commodities, the sale of which provides an important funding stream to the Houthis that aids in their weapons procurement. This action targets key actors who have enabled the Houthis to generate revenue and acquire a range of materials to manufacture the advanced weaponry they are now using to conduct ongoing terrorist attacks against commercial ships. Since November 2023, the Houthis have deployed a range of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), ballistic missiles, and cruise missiles to attack merchant vessels and their crews in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, killing innocent civilians, causing severe damage to commercial ships, and threatening global freedom of navigation.\n\n\"The Houthis' continued, indiscriminate, and reckless attacks against unarmed commercial vessels are made possible by their access to key components necessary for the production of their missiles and UAVs,\" said Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian E. Nelson. \"The United States remains resolved to use the full range of our tools to halt the flow of military-grade materials and funds from commodities sales that enable these destabilizing terrorist activities.\"\n\nToday's action is being taken pursuant to the counterterrorism authority Executive Order (E.O.) 13224, as amended. The U.S. Department of State designated Ansarallah as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist pursuant to E.O. 13224, as amended, effective February 16, 2024, for having committed or attempted to commit, posing a significant risk of committing, or having participated in training to commit acts of terrorism.\n\nAli Abd-al-Wahhab Muhammad al-Wazir (al-Wazir)is a PRC-based Houthi-affiliated individual who plays a key role in procuring materials that enable Houthi forces to manufacture advanced conventional weapons inside Yemen. He uses his PRC-based company, Guangzhou Tasneem Trading Company Limited (Guangzhou Tasneem),to obtain these items and ship them to Yemen. Guangzhou Tasneem is a wholly owned subsidiary of Hong Kong-based Tasneem Trading Company Limited.\n\nAl-Wazir is being designated pursuant to E.O. 13224, as amended, for having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Ansarallah. Guangzhou Tasneem is being designated pursuant to E.O. 13224, as amended, for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, Ansarallah. Tasneem Trading Company Limited is being designated pursuant to E.O. 13224, as amended, for owning or controlling Guangzhou Tasneem.\n\nHouthi leaders transfer weapons-grade materials purchased from PRC-based and other international suppliers into Yemen using import-export firms located in third countries. One such entity, the Oman-based International Smart Digital Interface Limited Liability Company (ISDI), has purchased and facilitated the transfer of cruise missile components, manufacturing equipment, and other dual-use materials into Yemen. ISDI and its operator, Muaadh Ahmed Mohammed al-Haifi (al-Haifi), coordinate with senior Houthi members to complete these procurements. ISDI's and al-Haifi's activities have directly enabled Houthi attacks against U.S. allies in the region. In 2020, for example, Houthi forces struck a Saudi Aramco facility in the region using a Quds-type land attack cruise missile that contained components that ISDI had sourced from a PRC-based supplier. In September 2023, the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security added ISDI and al-Haifi to the Entity List.\n\nISDI is being designated pursuant to E.O. 13224, as amended, for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, Ansarallah. Al-Haifi is being designated pursuant to E.O. 13224, as amended, for having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, ISDI.\n\nThe Houthis have sourced critical components for their forces from PRC-based companies. The Houthis have coordinated with PRC-based firm Ningbo Beilun Saige Machine Co., Ltd. to procure materials critical for manufacturing UAVs and other weapons.\n\nSimilarly, Houthi-affiliated individuals have coordinated with Dongguan Yuze Machining Tools Company Limited to source tens of thousands of dollars' worth of equipment for their domestic weapons production efforts.\n\nNingbo Beilun Saige Machine Co., Ltd. and Dongguan Yuze Machining Tools Company Limited are being designated pursuant to E.O. 13224, as amended, for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, Ansarallah.\n\nThe Cameroon-flagged OTARIA, which is managed by UAE-based Stellar Wave Marine L.L.C and captained by Vyacheslav Salyga, loaded commodities associated with Houthi financier Sa'id al-Jamal in late May 2024 to be discharged in Singapore. The OTARIA is currently carrying a cargo of commodities worth tens of millions of dollars. OFAC designated Sa'id al-Jamal pursuant to E.O. 13224, as amended, on June 10, 2021, for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, the IRGC-QF.\n\nStellar Wave Marine L.L.C and Vyacheslav Salyga are being designated pursuant to E.O. 13224, as amended, for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, Sa'id al-Jamal. The OTARIA is being identified pursuant to E.O. 13224, as amended, as property in which Stellar Wave Marine L.L.C has an interest.\n\nAs a result of today's action, all property and interests in property of the designated persons described above that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked and must be reported to OFAC. In addition, any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, individually or in the aggregate, 50 percent or more by one or more blocked persons are also blocked. Unless authorized by a general or specific license issued by OFAC, or exempt, OFAC's regulations generally prohibit all transactions by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in property of designated or otherwise blocked persons.\n\nIn addition, financial institutions and other persons that engage in certain transactions or activities with the sanctioned entities and individuals may expose themselves to sanctions or be subject to an enforcement action. The prohibitions include the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any designated person, or the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.\n\nThe power and integrity of OFAC sanctions derive not only from OFAC's ability to designate and add persons to the SDN List, but also from its willingness to remove persons from the SDN List consistent with the law.

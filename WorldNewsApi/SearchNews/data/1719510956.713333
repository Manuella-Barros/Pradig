{"id": 223709662, "title": "St Helens star Jonny Lomax opens up on injury issue after Leeds win", "text": "Captain Jonny Lomax admits he was prepared to play on with a suspected broken hand - only to see his St Helens side power on without him. The England stand-off faces tests to see the extent of his injury suffered in the first half of Friday\u2019s emphatic 40-10 win over Leeds. It\u2019s rare the Saints icon ever leaves the field so it was obvious it must be a serious issue when he departed clutching his hand. The hosts, already with a depleted pack and seeing England second-row Joe Batchelor limp off on five minutes, were level 6-6 ahead at that point. But they pressed on regardless to deliver the victory that sent them top of Super League. Lomax, 33, later departed the Totally Wicked Stadium with his hand heavily strapped up. Asked about the extent of the injury, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t really know yet. I\u2019ll go get it scanned and see what the crack is and see what can be done with it moving forward. \u201cIt was in and around that [hand] area. We\u2019ll just have to see what it is. I thought it might be alright. I had it checked. \u201cI got myself [back] on the bench but the way we scored there was no point risking it. I\u2019ll get it checked, see where we\u2019re at and move forward from that.\u201d Losing talismanic Lomax for any length of time would be a blow given the manner in which he controls games for Paul Wellens\u2019 side. On what happened, he explained: \u201cIt was kind of a funny one. I heard something [crack] in the tackle but thought I\u2019d be alright. \u201cI tried to grab my boot off the floor, though, [to test it] and it got a bit stuck so I knew I\u2019d have to get it checked. I could see Moses [Mbye] was about to come on, probably for Belly. [James Bell]. So I said \u2018hold the sub and see if I can get it sorted.\u2019 But then I said he\u2019s better coming on for me.\u201d Mbye slotted in at half-back meaning the brilliant England international Daryl Clark played the entire 80 minutes at hooker. Saints had lost forwards Morgan Knowles, Matt Whitley and Jake Wingfield to surgeries during the week and were already without crocked England prop Alex Walmsley. But they delivered an immense display. Lomax, ever-present this term, enthused: \u201cIt was a great performance for a number of boys who played out there tonight. \u201cIt was great watching from the sideline and seeing how we went after them [Rhinos] in that second half. \u201cIt showed that togetherness that we\u2019ve got. I think that was the biggest thing; we\u2019re prepared to work hard for each other, we\u2019re prepared to keep sacrificing for each other, we\u2019re prepared to keep sacrificing for the team, the club, the organisation, the staff and that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. And that saw us through in the end.\u201d", "summary": "England stand-off, 33, had to depart Saints' emphatic 40-10 success early due to an injury which could sideline him for some time", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/st-helens-jonny-lomax-leeds-32896442", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32895895.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Betfred-Super-League-Round-12-St-Helens-v-Leeds-Rhinos.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 14:02:39", "author": "David Craven,David-craven", "authors": ["David Craven", "David-craven"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.29}

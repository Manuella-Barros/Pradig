And they'll have a good matchup to start the road trip.\n\nSeattle will throw out 2024 All-Star Logan Gilbert (5-5, 2.91 ERA) against struggling rookie Adam Mazur (1-2, 7.51 ERA) in Game 1 of 2 against the Padres.\n\nThe Mariners are coming off a 5-4 extra-inning loss to the Toronto Blue Jays on July 7 where they left 15 runners on base. There seems to be an uptick in the team getting people on base. The struggle has been getting those runners home.\n\nMazur has gone more than five innings in just one of his six starts with San Diego and has allowed 22 earned runs in 26.1 innings pitched and has let up three home runs and a .301 batting average during his six starts. He's allowed five or more hits in four of his last five outings, according to MLB.com.\n\nGilbert, in his 18 starts this season, has allowed an opposing batting average of .199 and has struck out 108 batters in 117.2 innings pitched.\n\nThe Mariners have six games before the All-Star Game to try and figure out the offense and regain some ground in the American League West. If they manage to take advantage of a struggling Mazur, that might be what they need to get things going.\n\nMARINERS PITCHERS DOMINATING: When the Seattle Mariners wrapped up their nine game homestead on Sunday (July 7), they had a 49-43 record and a two-game lead in the American League West.

He's made 18 starts and has usually been able to keep the M's tepid offense in most games.\n\nYou can watch the heartwarming moment in which he found out about the honor below, courtesy of the Mariners on social media:\n\nManager Scott Servais stood up and told the team: \"We do only have one All-Star this year in the group. Logan, you've had an unbelievable first half, congratulations.\"\n\nUpon receiving the All-Star plaque, Gilbert smiled and gave a short speech. He joins Luis Castillo, George Kirby, Mitch Haniger, Julio Rodriguez and Ty France as current Mariners to have made the All-Star team while representing the Mariners. Jorge Polanco previously made the All-Star team while representing the Minnesota Twins.\n\nThe All-Star Game will be played on July 16 at Globe Life Park in Arlington, Texas. Before that though, the M's have to play two more series before the break. They'll take on the San Diego Padres on Tuesday and Wednesday before a four-game set with the Los Angeles Angels to close out the weekend.\n\nSeattle is 49-43 on the season.\n\nWOO COMMENTS ON REHAB: Mariners righty Bryan Woo was in Everett on Saturday night for a rehab start against Vancouver.

And the words seem particularly pertinent for this club right now.\n\nWe can start on an individual level with one Andr\u00e9s Mu\u00f1oz. The Mariners reliever was not among those selected for this year's MLB All-Star Game in Arlington, Texas, prompting legitimate \"snub\" accusations online.\n\nSeattle Sports laid out the facts rather convincingly, pointing out how his 1.7 WAR is far superior to that of the New York Yankees' Clay Holmes (0.5), who appeared to make the ASG based on geography alone.\n\nYes, there was a host of other AL relievers who have had better first halves than Holmes -- Craig Kimbrel, Hunter Gaddis and Kenley Jansen among them. But there's a strong case that Mu\u00f1oz's r\u00e9sum\u00e9 tops all of them.\n\nSo you can come to a couple of conclusions, neither of which is mutually exclusive. 1) MLB should correct this wrong and add Mu\u00f1oz to the team, something it can still do before the game takes place; 2) Maybe Mu\u00f1oz could have been a little better.\n\nThere have been a couple of slips -- a blown save last month in a loss to the Tampa Bay Rays, another loss 11 days earlier vs. the Chicago White Sox.\n\nIt's nitpicking when we're talking about a man with a 1.50 ERA playing for a team clinging to first place almost entirely because of its pitching staff. Mu\u00f1oz was snubbed -- let's be clear about that. But if you want to ensure yourself a place on an All-Star team, you have to leave no doubt.\n\nRight now, doubt is inundating the Mariners fan base. There is no official measurement for this, but it's palpable. Seattle (49-43) just lost its sixth consecutive series after falling short to the Toronto Blue Jays in extra innings Sunday. It is last in MLB in batting average. Even the pitching is sliding a bit, with the M's giving up at least four runs in five of their past eight games -- all of which have resulted in L's.\n\nHey, they are still in first place by two games in the AL West. I've said it before, you take that deal if you're a fan who has watched this club reach the postseason once since 2001. But it doesn't matter right now -- they still have to get better.\n\nIn addition to the 10-game lead the Mariners had in the division a few weeks back, there was some comfort among the AL wild-card teams. That comfort has vanished. In fact, if the Mariners were not first in the division, they would not make the playoffs if the season ended today. The Yankees, Twins and Red Sox -- none of whom is a division leader -- have better records. The Royals' record of 49-43 was identical entering Monday's games.\n\nSix games above .500 is the same no matter how you started the season. But people take notice when that same team was 12 games above .500 three weeks earlier. We'll see what's next for the Mariners.\n\nJulio Rodriguez's MRI on his quad came back clean. He should be back in the lineup the next time the Mariners take the field. Whether the 23-year-old can rediscover his old form is a different question.\n\nStarting pitcher Logan Gilbert made his first All-Star Game, and given his 2.91 ERA and 0.92 WHIP, it's well-deserved. Can the rest of the starters -- which have helped produce the third-best team ERA in MLB -- keep this team in the playoff hunt?\n\nIt's not going to get easier immediately. The Mariners have two games with the San Diego Padres (49-45) but then get four games in Anaheim with the 37-52 Angels. Perhaps that will lead to some relief.\n\nIt wasn't long ago, though, that the Mariners seemed unbeatable in tight ballgames. But two consecutive one-run losses have kept them from separating themselves from Houston, which lurks two games back.\n\nThe pitching is there for this club, and if there are no major health issues, will keep Seattle in contention. The talent is there in the lineup -- it's just that Rodriguez, or J.P. Crawford or Mitch Haniger and a whole host of others haven't found their once-heralded swings.\n\nThe Mariners are a long way from lost, even if they have lost their way for the time being. Doesn't matter. Get better.\n\nASAP.\n\n\u00a92024 The Seattle Times. Visit seattletimes.com.

And the words seem particularly pertinent for this club right now.\n\nWe can start on an individual level with one Andr\u00e9s Mu\u00f1oz. The Mariners reliever was not among those selected for this year's MLB All-Star Game in Arlington, Texas, prompting legitimate \"snub\" accusations online.\n\nSeattle Sports laid out the facts rather convincingly, pointing out how his 1.7 WAR is far superior to that of the Yankees' Clay Holmes (0.5), who appeared to make the ASG based on geography alone.\n\nYes, there was a host of other AL relievers who have had better first halves than Holmes -- Craig Kimbrel, Hunter Gaddis and Kenley Jansen among them. But there's a strong case that Mu\u00f1oz's r\u00e9sum\u00e9 tops all of them.\n\nSo you can come to a couple of conclusions, neither of which is mutually exclusive. 1) MLB should correct this wrong and add Mu\u00f1oz to the team, something it can still do before the game takes place; 2) Maybe Mu\u00f1oz could have been a little better.\n\nThere have been a couple of slips -- a blown save last month in a loss to the Rays, another loss 11 days earlier vs. the White Sox.\n\nIt's nitpicking when we're talking about a man with a 1.50 ERA playing for a team clinging to first place almost entirely because of its pitching staff. Mu\u00f1oz was snubbed -- let's be clear about that. But if you want to ensure yourself a place on an All-Star team, you have to leave no doubt.\n\nRight now, doubt is inundating the Mariners fan base. There is no official measurement for this, but it's palpable. Seattle (49-43) just lost its sixth consecutive series after falling short to the Blue Jays in extra innings Sunday. It is last in MLB in batting average. Even the pitching is sliding a bit, with the M's giving up at least four runs in five of their past eight games -- all of which have resulted in L's.\n\nHey, they are still in first place by two games in the AL West. I've said it before, you take that deal if you're a fan who has watched this club reach the postseason once since 2001. But it doesn't matter right now -- they still have to get better.\n\nIn addition to the 10-game lead the Mariners had in the division a few weeks back, there was some comfort among the AL wild-card teams. That comfort has vanished. In fact, if the Mariners were not first in the division, they would not make the playoffs if the season ended today. The Yankees, Twins and Red Sox -- none of whom is a division leader -- have better records. The Royals' record of 49-43 was identical entering Monday's games.\n\nSix games above .500 is the same no matter how you started the season. But people take notice when that same team was 12 games above .500 three weeks earlier. We'll see what's next for the Mariners.\n\nJulio Rodriguez's MRI on his quad came back clean. He should be back in the lineup the next time the Mariners take the field. Whether the 23-year-old can rediscover his old form is a different question.\n\nStarting pitcher Logan Gilbert made his first All-Star Game, and given his 2.91 ERA and 0.92 WHIP, it's well-deserved. Can the rest of the starters -- which have helped produce the third-best team ERA in MLB -- keep this team in the playoff hunt?\n\nIt's not going to get easier immediately. The Mariners have two games with the Padres (49-45) but then get four games in Anaheim with the 37-52 Angels. Perhaps that will lead to some relief.\n\nIt wasn't long ago, though, that the Mariners seemed unbeatable in tight ballgames. But two consecutive one-run losses have kept them from separating themselves from Houston, which lurks two games back.\n\nThe pitching is there for this club, and if there are no major health issues, will keep Seattle in contention. The talent is there in the lineup -- it's just that Rodriguez, or J.P. Crawford or Mitch Haniger and a whole host of others haven't found their once-heralded swings.\n\nThe Mariners are a long way from lost, even if they have lost their way for the time being. Doesn't matter. Get better.", "source": {"uri": "seattletimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Seattle Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_calkins@seattletimes.com", "name": "Matt Calkins", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr\u00e9s_Mu\u00f1oz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andr\u00e9s Mu\u00f1oz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_Holmes", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay Holmes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Hunter_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Hunter (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenley_Jansen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenley Jansen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wins_Above_Replacement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wins Above Replacement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Kimbrel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Craig Kimbrel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arlington, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arlington, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_West", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American League West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra_innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extra innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Save_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Save (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Blue Jays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Gilbert", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Logan Gilbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._P._Crawford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

While the Mariners are just 10-8 when he's on the bump, the righty has kept them in just about every game in 2024 while striking out 8.3 batters per nine innings. out He'll look to keep that rolling on Tuesday night.\n\nSan Diego Padres\n\nJurickson Profar: With Fernando Tatis Jr. on the injured list, even more pressure is on Jurickson Profar (who leads the NL in on-base percentage) to produce for San Diego. The journeyman has found a home in San Fran, hitting .315 with 14 homers and 59 runs batted in during the 2024 season.\n\nMariners vs. Padres Prediction and Pick\n\nEven though the Mariners have struggled on the road, there are a few reasons why I like them to pull off the win on Tuesday.\n\nIt starts with Gilbert, who has led the Mariners to a 10-8 record in his starts, with Seattle winning four of his last five outings.\n\n10-8 isn't a terrific record, but Gilbert hasn't allowed more than four runs in a start all season, and he's only given up more than three in three of 18 starts.\n\nOn the Padres side, there has to be some concern with Mazur on the bump.\n\nThe rookie has made six starts in 2024, getting through five innings on just two occasions and posting a 7.52 ERA.\n\nOn top of that, San Diego has a bullpen ERA of 4.14 in 2024, so there's no guarantee that it will shut the Mariners down once Mazur exits.\n\nI'll take the AL West leader to get back in the win column tonight.\n\nPick: Mariners Moneyline (-135)\n\nOdds refresh periodically and are subject to change.\n\nIf you or someone you know has a gambling problem and wants help, call

Baltimore Orioles catcher Adley Rutschman (35) stands at right on July 2. / Joe Nicholson-USA TODAY Sports\n\nAfter another tough loss on Sunday afternoon, Seattle Mariners catcher Cal Raleigh took accountability for where things are at with the club's offensive woes.\n\nPer Daniel Kramer of MLB.com:\n\nCal Raleigh on where the Mariners' offense stands:\n\n\"It falls on us, nobody but the players. When we're in the box, it's on us and we've got to find a way to do it. We've got to make adjustments. It's something we have to do. ... We've got to find a way to get it done.\"\n\nThe Mariners enter play on Monday with the worst team batting average in baseball (.217), which is on pace to be the worst batting average in team history. Furthermore, they left 15 men on base in Sunday's loss to the Toronto Blue Jays, including stranding the bases loaded in each of the 8th, 9th and 10th innings. As individual players, the M's offense left 30 runners on the bases.\n\nThe Mariners have had times where they've been able to generate traffic, but they haven't been able to get the big hit. With the most strikeouts in baseball, the M's have struggled to simply get runners over or hit sacrifice flies, forcing them to rely on getting big hits, which are certainly hard to come by for this offense.\n\nThe M's will be off on Monday but will take on the San Diego Padres in a two-game interleague series at Petco Park on Tuesday and Wednesday. They will then take on the Los Angeles Angels for four games to close out the first half.\n\nThe M's are 49-43.\n\nWOO COMMENTS ON REHAB: Mariners righty Bryan Woo was in Everett on Saturday night for a rehab start against Vancouver.

The offense came alive. The Mariners had 13 hits \u00e2\u20ac\" eight of them for extra bases \u00e2\u20ac\" in an 8-3 win over the San Diego Padres on Tuesday (July 9) at Petco Field in San Diego. Seattle also struck out 11 (or more) times for the 13th consecutive game. But eight runs are eight runs and a win is a win.\n\n\"That was a fun game,\" Seattle manager Scott Servais said in a postgame interview July 9. \"... We got the bats going tonight. And (Julio Rodriguez) \u00e2\u20ac\" doing what Julio can do. We saw this coming here at the end of the last home stint before he missed the last couple games with the quad thing.\"\n\nThe Mariners got to Padres starter Adam Mazur early. The rookie hurler let up a run in the top of the first to Rodriguez on an RBI single. He allowed a second score one frame later by way of a Ty France RBI double.\n\nSeattle's early small-ball efforts shook Mazur enough that the offense was able to start going for bigger shots.\n\nThe opening shot came in the top of the third when Cal Raleigh hit the first of two home runs on the day to put the Mariners up 4-0. Rodriguez hit a solo home run two innings later \u00e2\u20ac\" his eighth of the year.\n\nRaleigh wasn't done and he capped off his day with another two-run bomb in the top of the seventh to left field. It was his 17th home run of the season and bolstered Seattle's lead to 7-0.\n\nRaleigh finished the day 3-for-5 at the plate with four RBIs. Rodriguez had a perfect day and went 4-for-4 with a double, home run, two singles and two RBIs of his own.\n\nVictor Robles continued to make his case for more starts in the Mariners' lineup and capped off the scoring with an RBI double in the top of the ninth to give the visitors the eventual final of 8-3.\n\nSan Diego was only able to muster four hits for the game. Two of them were homers \u00e2\u20ac\" a solo-shot to right from Jake Cronenworth in the bottom of the seventh and a two-run shot from Kyle Higashioka one inning later.\n\nBut Seattle's offense built too insurmountable a lead for the Padres to overcome, especially with 2024 All-Star pitcher Logan Gilbert on the mound (he went 7.2 innings and struck out seven).\n\nThere was a little of everything to love from the Mariners on July 9. There was small ball, there was home runs and there was timely situational hits \u00e2\u20ac\" all which have been rarities for Seattle in recent weeks. And reliever Gregory Santos made his first appearance for the team this season. Even Jorge Polanco, who has drawn the ire of many Mariners fans, did well.\n\nPolanco got on base three times on July 9 for Seattle and went 2-for-4 and scored once.\n\nIt is worth to note that five of the Mariners' eight runs came against a struggling rookie.\n\nSeattle will have a chance to prove that Game 1 against San Diego wasn't a fluke when it goes against the much more solid Michael King at 3:40 p.m. PST on July 10.\n\nROBLES MAKES HIS MARK: On Sunday, Victor Robles filled in for an injured Julio Rodriguez at center field. He batted ninth in the lineup and made the most of his opportunity.

I think you are definitely deserving and I feel like you will be added for sure.\"\n\nWe will find out the All-Star replacements later in the week but Munoz certainly has an opportunity to be named to the AL squad, which is managed by Bruce Bochy of the Rangers. Despite dealing with a back issue, he's had an outstanding season, saving 14 games thus far in 36 appearances. He's pitched to a sterling 1.50 ERA, striking out 43 batters in 36.0 innings this year as well.\n\nHe's been the anchor of a bullpen that has lost Matt Brash for the season and has yet to see Gregory Santos pitch because of a lat issue. Furthermore, Gabe Speier has been out for more than a month too. Each of those arms were supposed to supplement Munoz at the back end, but he's had to do it with a different supporting cast of Trent Thornton and Ryne Stanek, among others.\n\nThe All-Star Game will be played on July 16 in Arlington. Before the Mariners get there, they need to finish out the first half of the season. They'll take on the Padres for two games beginning on Tuesday and then will see the Angels on Thursday.\n\nWOO COMMENTS ON REHAB: Mariners righty Bryan Woo was in Everett on Saturday night for a rehab start against Vancouver.

The M's, who currently lead the American League West because of excellent starting pitching, just left 15 runners on base in a disappointing loss against the Toronto Blue Jays on Sunday.\n\nThey've lost six series in a row and now only lead the division by two games over the rival Houston Astros.\n\nThe main contributors to the M's disappointing offensive performance this year has been the inability to get the big hit with runners in scoring position, and the proliferation of strikeouts up-and-down the lineup.\n\nIn fact, according to Mariners' Insider Luke Arkins, the M's are on pace for the highest strikeout percentage ever in a single season.\n\nThe #Mariners are currently on track to have the highest strikeout rate of any team, ever.\n\nAt season's end, I'd be inclined to remove 2020 teams from the list due to small sample size.\n\nArkins also later added that the MLB strikeout rate is 22.2 percent this season. The Mariners have 10 pseudo-regular players that are running a strikeout rate above that number. Jorge Polanco (33.6) and Cal Raleigh (32.9) have been among the most frustrating in that department.\n\nThe Mariners will begin a quick two-game series on Tuesday night against the San Diego Padres. All-Star Logan Gilbert will start for Seattle while Adam Mazur pitches for San Diego. Gilbert is 5-5 with a 2.91 ERA while Mazur is 1-2 with a 7.52.\n\nFirst pitch is 6:40 p.m. PT.\n\nGRIGGS MOVING TO BALTIMORE: After stepping down from her position in the front office last week, Catie Griggs has joined the Baltimore Orioles.

While the Mariners are just 10-8 when he's on the bump, the righty has kept them in just about every game in 2024 while striking out 8.3 batters per nine innings. out He'll look to keep that rolling on Tuesday night.\n\nJurickson Profar: With Fernando Tatis Jr. on the injured list, even more pressure is on Jurickson Profar (who leads the NL in on-base percentage) to produce for San Diego. The journeyman has found a home in San Fran, hitting .315 with 14 homers and 59 runs batted in during the 2024 season.\n\nEven though the Mariners have struggled on the road, there are a few reasons why I like them to pull off the win on Tuesday.\n\nIt starts with Gilbert, who has led the Mariners to a 10-8 record in his starts, with Seattle winning four of his last five outings.\n\n10-8 isn't a terrific record, but Gilbert hasn't allowed more than four runs in a start all season, and he's only given up more than three in three of 18 starts.\n\nOn the Padres side, there has to be some concern with Mazur on the bump.\n\nThe rookie has made six starts in 2024, getting through five innings on just two occasions and posting a 7.52 ERA.\n\nOn top of that, San Diego has a bullpen ERA of 4.14 in 2024, so there's no guarantee that it will shut the Mariners down once Mazur exits.\n\nI'll take the AL West leader to get back in the win column tonight.\n\nPick: Mariners Moneyline (-135)\n\nOdds refresh periodically and are subject to change.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Gilbert", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Logan Gilbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake_Snell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blake Snell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurickson_Profar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jurickson Profar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Soto", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juan Soto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_West", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_West", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American League West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleague_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interleague play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "On-base percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Officiating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3534,h_1987,x_0,y_62/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si/01j2c7xwnbbx4gy4kdck.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716675", "eventUri": "eng-9716675", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Despite being on the road, the Mariners have a strong chance of coming out on top in Tuesday night's game.\n\nLogan Gilbert, Seattle's right-handed starter, brings a solid 5-5 record and an impressive 2.91 ERA to the mound. His consistency and ability to keep runs off the board have been crucial for the Mariners this season. Gilbert's performance has been particularly noteworthy given the competitive nature of the AL West division.\n\nOn the other side, the Padres will send out Adam Mazur, a less experienced right-hander with a 1-2 record. While Mazur has shown potential, his limited major league experience could be a factor against a Mariners lineup that's been finding its rhythm lately.\n\nThe Mariners' recent extra-inning battle against the Blue Jays, although resulting in a loss, demonstrated their resilience and offensive capabilities. This hard-fought game could serve as a motivator for the team as they look to bounce back in San Diego.\n\nGilbert's ability to go deep into games and limit opposing offenses will be crucial in neutralizing the Padres' home-field advantage. His 2.91 ERA suggests he's adept at keeping games close, which could be pivotal in what may turn out to be a low-scoring affair.\n\nMoreover, the Mariners' bullpen, which has been reliable throughout the season, could prove to be the difference-maker in the later innings. If Gilbert can hand over a lead or keep the game close through six or seven innings, Seattle's relief corps should be able to seal the deal.\n\nWhile the Padres will undoubtedly put up a fight on their home turf, the combination of Gilbert's proven track record, the Mariners' recent offensive spark, and their solid bullpen give Seattle the edge in this interleague matchup. Expect a competitive game, but one that the Mariners should be able to win behind Gilbert's strong pitching and timely hitting from their lineup.\n\nWhy The Padres Will Cover The Spread/Win\n\nWhile the Seattle Mariners come to Petco Park with Logan Gilbert on the mound, the San Diego Padres and their young right-hander Adam Mazur are poised to defend their home turf and secure a victory on Tuesday night.\n\nDespite his 1-2 record, Mazur has shown flashes of potential that could translate into a breakout performance against the Mariners. The home crowd at Petco Park will undoubtedly provide a boost to the young pitcher, potentially elevating his game to new heights.\n\nThe Padres, with their 49-45 record, have been playing solid baseball and will look to capitalize on their home-field advantage. San Diego's lineup, known for its power and versatility, could prove challenging for Gilbert, even with his impressive 2.91 ERA.\n\nWhile Gilbert has been consistent for the Mariners, the change of scenery and the pressure of pitching on the road might affect his performance. The Padres' hitters will be eager to exploit any signs of weakness from the visiting starter.\n\nMoreover, the Mariners are coming off a tough extra-inning loss against the Blue Jays, which could have both physical and mental impacts on the team. This fatigue factor might play into the Padres' hands, especially in the later innings of the game.\n\nThe Padres' bullpen, if called upon early, has the depth and talent to keep the Mariners' offense at bay. This could be crucial if Mazur manages to keep the game close through the first few innings.\n\nWhile Gilbert's numbers are impressive, baseball is a game of day-to-day performance, and Mazur has the opportunity to outshine his more experienced counterpart. With the backing of the home crowd and a motivated Padres lineup, Mazur and the Padres have a strong chance of securing a win against the Mariners in this interleague matchup.\n\nFinal Mariners-Padres Prediction & Pick\n\nThis should be a fantastic matchup between the AL West-leading Seattle Marines and the San Diego Padres on this Tuesday night. In this matchup, Logan Gilbert should find his rhythm early, stifling the Padres with his potent fastball-slider combination. The Mariners' offense, fueled by Julio Rodriguez, chips away at San Dego's starter with timely hits and aggressive baserunning. Seattle's bullpen, a strength all season, shuts the door late, securing a close victory.\n\nClick here for more betting news and predictions", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "garrett_kerman@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Garrett Kerman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Gilbert", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Logan Gilbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_West", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American League West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Win\u2013loss_record_(pitching)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Win\u2013loss record (pitching)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petco_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Petco Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleague_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interleague play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra_innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extra innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Blue Jays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julio_Rodr\u00edguez_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Julio Rodr\u00edguez (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Watercraft", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Watercraft", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Oceanography", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Oceanography", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Mariners-vs.-Padres-prediction-odds-pick-how-to-watch.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716675", "eventUri": "eng-9716675", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

The M's are 5-11 over their last 16 games and have lost eight games off that lead.\n\nThe Mariners biggest need is offense, but there aren't expected to be many quality bats available with so many teams in both leagues still on the fringes of the playoff race. On the surface, the Chicago White Sox, Oakland A's, Colorado Rockies, Toronto Blue Jays and Miami Marlins all appear to be sellers, but the competition for players on those rosters will be steep.\n\nThe Mariners don't necessarily need to react to what the Astros do, but they do have a history of being aggressive at the deadline themselves, having acquired Trey Mancini, Christian Vazquez, Justin Verlander and Kendall Graveman at recent deadlines - just to name a few.\n\nThe M's should get an internal bump on the pitching side of things with both Bryan Woo and Gregory Santos expected to return soon.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Mobile_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "T-Mobile Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_West", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American League West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Houston Astros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_Graveman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kendall Graveman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Verlander", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Verlander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oakland Athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Blue Jays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trey_Mancini", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trey Mancini"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3104,h_1746,x_0,y_442/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/inside_the_mariners/01j26sy51c3mr0cfekt1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716675", "eventUri": "eng-9716675", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-09-11", "textStart": 64, "textEnd": 78}, {"amb": false, "date": "2011-09-", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}], "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Gilbert tacked on to that achievement with another on Tuesday.\n\nIn Tuesday's 8-3 win over the San Diego Padres, Gilbert struck out seven -- bringing his career total to 606 in 107 games.\n\nAccording to a tweet from StatsCentre, Gilbert achieved that milestone in the fifth-fewest games in Mariners history.\n\nGilbert is in some elite company with this latest career mark. The names above him are James Paxton, Randy Johnson, Mark Langston and Felix Herandnez. Every pitcher above Gilbert aside from Langston threw a no-hitter for Seattle. Hernandez threw a perfect game on Aug. 15, 2012. Johnson was induced into the Hall of Fame in 2015. Hernandez was put into the team Hall of Fame in 2023.\n\nGilbert this season has a 2.94 ERA and a 6-5 record in 19 starts. He has 115 strikeouts in 125.1 innings pitched.\n\nSince making his debut, he has a career 3.59 ERA.\n\nGilbert has been with Seattle since 2018 when he was drafted in the first round out of Stetson.\n\nMARINERS SWING FOR THE FENCES: Seattle Mariners fans were waiting for it to happen, and it finally did.

For the second this season, he cleared waivers and was returned to Triple-A Tacoma.\n\nIt's been a tough year and a tough situation for Zavala, who was acquired by the Mariners in the offseason trade that shipped Eugenio Suarez to the Arizona Diamondbacks. Though he started the year on the 26-man roster, he played sparingly and eventually gave way to Mitch Garver as the true backup catcher. That's what paved the way for him to be sent to Tacoma the first time. After Garver was hit by a pitch and was injured, Savala came back, but did not appear in a game.\n\nNow, his 40-man roster spot is being taken by reliever Gregory Santos, who was just re-instated from the injured list. He'll make his Mariners debut in his first appearance of the season. He was acquired in a trade from the White Sox this offseason.\n\nThe 30-year-old Savala is hitting .154 this season with one homer and two RBI. He only has 39 at-bats on the season. In Triple-A, he will be able to be of benefit to the Mariners because he can continue to help develop young pitchers - namely Emerson Hancock, who was also sent back to Triple-A.\n\nSavala is a five-year veteran who has played for the Chicago White Sox, Diamondbacks and Mariners. He's a lifetime .205 hitter with 15 homers. He hit seven homers a season ago.\n\nThe Mariners will play the Padres on Tuesday night at 6:40 p.m. ET.\n\nGRIGGS MOVING TO BALTIMORE: After stepping down from her position in the front office last week, Catie Griggs has joined the Baltimore Orioles.

After all, the Mariners have a 2.0 game lead in the American League West and are trying to get to the World Series for the first time in franchise history.\n\nWhen you have that pressure upon you, it makes sense to put some chips into the center of the table. Furthermore, the Mariners have prospect depth, with eight players currently ranked in the Top 100 players by Baseball America. They have the prospect capital to get things done.\n\nWith that said, which Mariners prospect is likely to be dealt? Harry Ford was just moved to left field at Double-A Arkansas, perhaps as a way to showcase his versatility for other teams...\n\nWe discussed this very same topic as part of Episode 1 of the \"Refuse to Lose\" podcast, which comes out each Tuesday and Friday.

The Mariners have a couple other former All-Stars on their staff. One of them is George Kirby -- who's on a historic pace this season.\n\nIn Sunday's 5-4 extra-inning loss against the Toronto Blue Jays, Kirby went six innings and struck out eight batters while walking one. When his outing wrapped up -- his strikeout-per-walk ratio this season stood at 9.91. The best in the league, according to the Mariners' PR.\n\nThe next-highest pitcher after Kirby is the Tampa Bay Rays' Zach Eflin at 9.0.\n\nKirby has struck out seven or more batters in seven of his 19 starts this season and has 12 quality starts this season overall. Kirby has walked more than two batters just once this season. He has a 3.39 ERA this season and has fanned 109 batters.\n\nKirby had a strikeout-to-walk ratio of 10-plus before his start on Sunday. If he can get it back up to double-digits, he would become just the fifth pitcher in league history to accomplish the feat. The Minnesota Twins' Phil Hughes (2014), Seattle/Texas Rangers' Cliff Lee (2010), New York Mets' Bret Saberhagen (1994) and Boston Red Sox' Jim Whitney (1884) are the others, according to Mariners PR.\n\nKirby is no stranger to the MLB record book. He set the record for the most consecutive strikes to start a game with 24 in his rookie season on Aug. 24, 2022, against the Washington Nationals.\n\nIf Kirby were to retire today, he would hold another impressive record.\n\nThe third-year pitcher has a career strikeout-to-walk ratio of 7.96. That's the most in MLB history for hurlers with a minimum of 400 innings pitched. The Rangers' Jacob deGrom would have the highest if he retired today (5.38), according to Baseball Reference.\n\nKirby will likely get one more start before the All-Star break during Game 3 or 4 of the Mariners' series against the Los Angeles Angels on either July 13 or July 14.\n\nMARINERS SQUANDER CHANCES: The Seattle Mariners couldn't take advantage of three bases-loaded chances and dropped a series to the Toronto Blue Jays with a 5-4 extra innings loss on Sunday.

It went 3-6 and averaged 2.78 runs a game while allowing 3.56 runs a game. Simply put, that's not sustainable for a team looking to win the American League West.\n\nSo, what's been the problem? What's been preventing Seattle from getting that ever-elusive run? According to some stats from Baseball Savant, the answer could be multi-layered.\n\nMariners manager Scott Servais mentioned before a July 4 game against the Orioles that the big thing for Seattle was to get the ball in play. A good way to judge how often a team is generating optimal contact is by looking at barrel percentage -- a stat that divides barrels (a ball hit at least 90 miles per hour with a launch angle of 26-to-30 degrees) by balls put in play.\n\nIn one game against the Twins on June 28 -- the Mariners had a barrel percentage of 0%. That was the only game they won with a barrel percentage below 10% They were under 10% in four of their nine recent home games. In their other two wins against Baltimore on July 4 and the Blue Jays on July 5, they had a barrel percentage of 21.1 and 10.0, respectively.\n\nSo from one point of view, when Seattle is generating contact, it isn't optimal. And that's an important note: When it is generating contact.\n\nLooking at some of the Mariners top players, whiff rate is a statistic that really stands out -- and not in a good way. Whiff rate divides swings and misses by total number of swings.\n\nJulio Rodriguez has a whiff rate of 31.1% -- which ranks in the 13th percentile in the league, according to Baseball Savant. Cal Raleigh has a whiff rate of 30.3%, Jorge Polanco is at 31.4%, Ty France clocks in at 23.8% and Luke Raley is at 34.5%,\n\nJosh Rojas is actually one of the few Seattle player well above average in whiff rate and is in the 65th percentile in the league at 21.6%.\n\nThe Mariners aren't generating a lot of optimal contact. Overall hitting needs to improve -- so does situational hitting. Seattle left 10 runners on base per game, according to teamrankings.com, during its season series against Toronto. All of those games were one-run contests.\n\nThe Mariners need to improve recognition at the plate, generate more contact on their swings and take advantage of the runners they get on base.\n\nSeattle will have a chance to start doing just that staring at 6:40 p.m. July 9 against the San Diego Padres.\n\nMARINERS SQUANDER CHANCES: The Seattle Mariners couldn't take advantage of three bases-loaded chances and dropped a series to the Toronto Blue Jays with a 5-4 extra innings loss on Sunday.

He ended 2023 assigned to Seattle's Low-A affiliate Modesto Nuts but impressed enough to start the season in Everett.\n\nGarcia is no stranger to weekly or monthly honors. He was named the Northwest League's Pitcher of the Month back on June 2.\n\nGarcia has made 15 total appearances this season and 13 of those have been starts. He has pitched 73.1 innings and owns an unblemished 6-0 record. He has a 1.72 ERA, 93 strikeouts and a 1.15 WHIP.\n\nThe Mariners have a league-leading eight players in the top 100, according to Baseball America. Seven of those eight are position players. The only pitcher Seattle has on the list is right-hander Logan Evans, who checked in at No. 80 in the latest list released July 3.

With his leg issues hopefully behind him, the hope is that Rodriguez can finally start to gain some consistent traction at the plate. It's been a terribly frustrating year for Rodriguez, who has just eight home runs and failed to make the All-Star Game for the first time in his career. He's hitting just .247 and is running a strikeout rate of nearly 27 percent.\n\nIf the M's are going to hold onto win the American League West this year, they'll need Rodriguez to get going. When he's right, he's an MVP-caliber player that is capable of leading a lineup, but when he's scuffling, the lineup doesn't have many answers to turn to. Seattle needs more out of Cal Raleigh, Luke Raley and JP Crawford, but the situation starts with Rodriguez, who is a two-time Silver Slugger in his young career.\n\nThe Mariners enter play on Tuesday at 49-43 and with a 2.0 game lead in the division. They'll take on the Padres at Petco Park with first pitch coming at 6:40 p.m. PT.

They have also scored two or fewer runs in 31 games.\n\nNo wonder the Mariners lit sage in the clubhouse this past week trying to ward off those evil slumping spirits.\n\nMeanwhile, they are expected to part with at least one of their top prospects who are ranked among the top 50 in Baseball America's rankings for an impact bat.\n\nBy the way, the M's added to that streak on Saturday, striking out 11 times in the 5-4 loss against the Toronto Blue Jays.\n\nAs for the potential trade of a top prospect, it's obviously going to hurt no matter who the M's give up. Teams take great pride in building their farm systems and they don't like to deal from them, but the M's are trying to make a run at the team's first-ever World Series run. This would be the second significant trade deadline deal that the Mariners have made in the last three years after deadling Edwin Arroyo and Noelvi Marte to the Reds in 2022.\n\nThe Mariners have eight prospects in the Baseball America Top 100 right now. For the guys in the top 50? It's Colt Emerson (13), Laz Montes (29), and Cole Young (41).

The Mariners look to duplicate that performance on Wednesday in the finale of a two-game series.\n\nJulio Rodriguez collected four of the Mariners' 13 hits and Cal Raleigh homered from both sides of the plate, going 3-for-5 with four RBIs, as Seattle posted its highest run total since a 9-0 win at Miami on June 22.\n\nFor one night, the Mariners didn't resemble the team that entered play Tuesday with the worst batting average in the majors (.217) and with the fourth-lowest run total. While they mixed in a characteristic 11 strikeouts -- they lead the majors in whiffs and average more than 10 per game -- they at least offset that with their slugging.\n\nServais said, \"Whatever your job is on the club -- some guys we brought in to drive the ball, other guys need to figure a way to get on base -- do your job and if everybody collectively does that, we have a really good ball club.\"\n\nSeattle's pitching, which has held the opposition to an major-league-low .219 average and owns an American League-best 3.54 ERA, was on point Tuesday night. The Mariners gave up only four hits to a team ranked second in the bigs with a .262 average.\n\nBryce Miller (6-7, 3.84 ERA) will try to keep that going on Wednesday.\n\nThe right-hander is coming off a no-decision Thursday in the Mariners' 7-3 win over the Baltimore Orioles, who got to him for eight hits and two runs over 5 2/3 innings. This will be his first career appearance against San Diego.\n\nThe Padres will call on one of their most reliable starters, Michael King (7-5, 3.51 ERA). His latest start was a 3-1 win Thursday at Texas, where he allowed four hits and a run in 5 1/3 innings with two walks and five strikeouts. King has faced Seattle twice in relief, both times while pitching for the New York Yankees last year, and he gave up one run in 2 2/3 innings.\n\nWhile San Diego has lost three consecutive games, it is about to get help for its already-potent lineup. Second baseman Xander Bogaerts, sidelined since fracturing his left shoulder on May 20, took batting practice before the Tuesday night game and was spraying line drives around the field against minor-leaguers.\n\nThe plan is for Bogaerts, who went 2-for-11 in four rehab games for Triple-A El Paso last week, to play in one or two games at Class-A Lake Elsinore. If things go to plan, he could be activated before the Padres' Friday home game against the Atlanta Braves.\n\n\"Feels good,\" he said. \"Getting there, getting close. Hopefully, I'll come around soon.\"\n\nBogaerts is batting .219 with four homers and 14 RBIs in 187 at-bats for San Diego this year, but he was picking up the pace on offense when he got hurt. He was 8-for-25 (.320) in his last seven games.\n\n--Field Level Media", "source": {"uri": "thenewstribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Coming off a three-game sweep of the Rangers at T-Mobile Park, the Mariners had won four in a row and improved to 44-31 and pushed their lead in the division to 10 games over the Astros.\n\nThey weren't just leading their division, but they were up by more games than any other division leader.\n\nAn offense that was largely lifeless and prone to strikeouts seemed to be improving to finally complement a starting rotation that had carried the team for much of the season.\n\nBut Seattle dropped the next two games in Cleveland, losing the series. It was the start of a frustrating trend. They lost two of three to the Marlins, one of the worst teams in baseball, and avoided being swept in Tampa, pulling out a victory in the final game of a 3-6 road trip.\n\nThe struggles carried over to the recent homestand. Despite having so much success at home this season and playing in front of large crowds in all nine games, Seattle went 3-6, dropping series against the Twins, Orioles and Blue Jays. What made the losses at T-Mobile Park so galling was the Mariners' dismal run production, scoring three runs or fewer in six of the nine games.\n\nSince that win in Cleveland, the Mariners are 5-12, dropping six straight series. The offense continues to be a frustrating conundrum.\n\nOver that span of 17 games, Seattle posted a .194/.278/.322 slash line with 54 runs scored, 49 RBI, a 31.3% strikeout rate in 626 combined plate appearances. It was the fewest runs scored by an MLB team during that span with the lowest batting average and slugging percentage and the highest strikeout rate. Of the 72 hits amassed, half of them were singles with 17 doubles, three triples and 16 homers.\n\nAveraging 3.2 runs isn't going to work. Seattle amassed double-digit strikeouts in 14 of those games, including their last 11 games, while stranding a whopping 115 base runners.\n\nYes, 115 runners left on base, including 15 in Sunday's extra-innings loss to the Blue Jays.\n\nThe Mariners' hitting with runners in scoring position during those 17 games was dreadful.\n\nSeattle hitters had 145 plate appearances with runners in scoring position over those 17 games, posting a .165/.245/.331 slash line and scoring just 35 runs. They registered just 21 hits with four triples, four homers with 30 RBI with 12 walks and 46 strikeouts. The batting average was the worst in MLB and almost 30 points lower than the next team and the 31.7% strikeout rate was the second worst.\n\nMeanwhile the Padres, who they are playing over the next two days, posted a .353/.393/.609 slash line in 148 plate appearances with runners in scoring position, scoring 68 runs with 65 RBI and only 24 strikeouts over that same span.\n\nWhile fans continue to blame the hitting coaches, demanding another change since firing offensive coordinator Brant Brown hasn't yielded the expected improvement, Cal Raleigh put the onus on the players and their own personal failures at the plate. But he also wasn't certain how to fix the issues.\n\n\"I really don't have an answer,\" he said. \"I wish I did. I guess what I'm trying to say is I think we all wish that we had the answer. I don't think that anybody here is not trying. I don't think it's that at all, but we've got to find it soon. We've put ourselves in a good spot in the first half. I'm not taking anything away from that at all, but we know who is in our division. We have the defending champs and the Houston Astros are really good and have proven it. We've got to find a way quickly to make those adjustments.\"\n\nThe Mariners' situational hitting has been awful this season. Baseball reference tracks the data.\n\nWith a runner on third and less than two outs, the Mariners have 159 plate appearances and have produced a run 68 times, striking out 41 times. That 42.8% success rate is the worst in MLB. The league average in that situation to score a run is 51.5% of the time.\n\nWith a runner on second and no outs, the Mariners have 129 plate appearances, the base runner advanced just 56 times. That 43.4% success rate is also the worst in MLB with the league average being 51.5%.\n\nThese overall numbers speak to team-wide struggles and failures. As much as some people want to believe, Jorge Polanco isn't the cause for it all and designating him for assignment doesn't fix the team's offense. It seems unlikely that move will happen before the All-Star break but it certainly is looming.\n\nSince he returned from the injured list, Polanco has five hits in 33 plate appearances with a double, an RBI and 16 strikeouts. He's trying to swing his way out of struggles and it's not working. The Mariners would have to eat roughly $4.5 million in owed salary.\n\nUsing FanGraphs' all-encompassing weighted runs created plus measure (wRC+), which is supposed to offer a glimpse into overall offensive contribution, the Mariners have only four players with a wRC+ in triple digits with 100 being considered average -- Luke Raley (111), Dylan Moore (111), Josh Rojas (106) and Ty France (100). The Oakland A's have six players with a wRC+ over 100.\n\nJulio Rodriguez has an 85 wRC+ this season. He finished his rookie season with a 144 wRC+.\n\n\"We've seen guys here who have long track records, guys have shown it before, but it's not showing up right now,\" Raleigh said. \"That's the tough thing about baseball and you'd like to see it come around a little more often, but it's not right now. And it's just frustrating.\"", "source": {"uri": "seattletimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Seattle Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_divish@seattletimes.com", "name": "Ryan Divish",

And the words seem particularly pertinent for this club right now.\n\nWe can start on an individual level with one Andr\u00e9s Mu\u00f1oz. The Mariners reliever was not among those selected for this year's MLB All-Star Game in Arlington, Texas, prompting legitimate \"snub\" accusations online.\n\nSeattle Sports laid out the facts rather convincingly, pointing out how his 1.7 WAR is far superior to that of the New York Yankees' Clay Holmes (0.5), who appeared to make the ASG based on geography alone.\n\nYes, there was a host of other AL relievers who have had better first halves than Holmes -- Craig Kimbrel, Hunter Gaddis and Kenley Jansen among them. But there's a strong case that Mu\u00f1oz's r\u00e9sum\u00e9 tops all of them.\n\nSo you can come to a couple of conclusions, neither of which is mutually exclusive. 1) MLB should correct this wrong and add Mu\u00f1oz to the team, something it can still do before the game takes place; 2) Maybe Mu\u00f1oz could have been a little better.\n\nThere have been a couple of slips -- a blown save last month in a loss to the Tampa Bay Rays, another loss 11 days earlier vs. the Chicago White Sox.\n\nIt's nitpicking when we're talking about a man with a 1.50 ERA playing for a team clinging to first place almost entirely because of its pitching staff. Mu\u00f1oz was snubbed -- let's be clear about that. But if you want to ensure yourself a place on an All-Star team, you have to leave no doubt.\n\nRight now, doubt is inundating the Mariners fan base. There is no official measurement for this, but it's palpable. Seattle (49-43) just lost its sixth consecutive series after falling short to the Toronto Blue Jays in extra innings Sunday. It is last in MLB in batting average. Even the pitching is sliding a bit, with the M's giving up at least four runs in five of their past eight games -- all of which have resulted in L's.\n\n...continued", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr\u00e9s_Mu\u00f1oz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andr\u00e9s Mu\u00f1oz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arlington, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arlington, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_Holmes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clay Holmes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenley_Jansen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kenley Jansen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Kimbrel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Craig Kimbrel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra_innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extra innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Save_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Save (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Blue Jays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Roleplaying", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Roleplaying", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 79}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716675", "eventUri": "eng-9716675", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

Their once-comfortable American League West lead is shrinking almost daily after losing six straight series.\n\nThe skidding Seattle Mariners get another crack at sparking a much-needed turnaround on Tuesday night when they visit the San Diego Padres to open a two-game set and a six-game road trip.\n\nSeattle dropped a 5-4, 10-inning decision Sunday to Toronto, closing out a 3-6 homestand that saw the Mariners average less than three runs per game. The latest loss was frustrating because the team left the bases loaded in the eighth, ninth and 10th innings.\n\n\"Our guys competed their tails off, creating all that traffic out there and putting the pressure on them,\" Seattle manager Scott Servais said \"But you've got to come through. You've got to get the big hit or get the guy in from third.\"\n\nIn the middle of June, the Mariners owned a 10-game lead, leaving the defending World Series champion Texas Rangers and the floundering Houston Astros choking in the exhaust.\n\nNow? As the warning says, objects are closer than they appear in your rear-view mirror. Houston is just two games out and Texas has crawled within six entering Monday's play.\n\nSeattle's offense is averaging less than four runs per game and striking out more than 10 times per game. The Mariners have hit 100 home runs in 92 games so far, but that hasn't been enough to reverse the recent skid.\n\nBut the good news is that right-hander Logan Gilbert (5-5, 2.91 ERA), Seattle's lone All-Star, will take the mound on Tuesday. Gilbert last pitched Wednesday night, shouldering a 4-1 loss to Baltimore despite fanning six over 5 1/3 innings. He allowed all four runs.\n\nGilbert has been stout in four career starts against San Diego, going 3-1 with a 1.11 ERA while allowing only 14 hits in 24 1/3 innings.\n\nMeanwhile, the Padres will send rookie right-hander Adam Mazur (1-2, 7.52) to the mound for his first career start against the Mariners. Mazur earned a no-decision in his previous start Wednesday night in Texas, where he allowed four runs over four innings in San Diego's 6-4 win.\n\nThe biggest problem for Mazur over his first six MLB starts has been a lack of command. He's walking nearly six batters every nine innings and has allowed opponents to hit at a .301 clip.\n\nStarting pitching is the biggest question with the Padres, who currently occupy the last wild-card position in the National League. While it got three quality starts over the weekend against Arizona, the team's top two starters - Yu Darvish and Joe Musgrove - are unlikely to see the mound until August.\n\nHowever, San Diego is in playoff position due to a strong everyday lineup. Four of the Padres' nine starters were named to next week's All-Star Game, including 21-year-old center fielder Jackson Merrill, the youngest player to participate in the game in 11 years.\n\n\"Full excitement,\" Merrill said of the honor. \"The team's happy for us. No matter who's going, who's not, everyone's behind each other, happy for each other.\"\n\n--Field Level Media", "source": {"uri": "sacbee.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sacramento Bee"},

He's struck out 28 batters and let up eight earned runs in 40.2 innings pitched.\n\nThe Mariners have had one of the best starting rotations the entire season.

Sure, the pessimists will point out that it is only one game of production in a season filled with so many games where it was missing.\n\nBut it's not just how or why the Mariners found production that provides hopes for better days ahead, but it is more importantly who provided it and what they mean to this team's overall success moving forward.\n\nTuesday's 8-3 victory over the Padres at Petco Park seemed like more than just a temporary respite from the Mariners' bad baseball. It felt like a reset with opportunity for a return to their previous success.\n\nAfter quad tightness forced him out of a game on Saturday and kept him out of the starting lineup on Sunday, Julio Rodriguez returned to the starting lineup in his customary spot in center field and batting cleanup. He delivered his best game of the year going 4 for 4 with a massive solo homer.\n\nCal Raleigh, who served as spokesman following Sunday's loss in Seattle, leaving little doubt that the players were the root cause of the failures and the only ones who could fix it, backed up his seething self-criticism. Batting behind Rodriguez in the No. 5 spot, Raleigh smashed a pair of two-run homers -- one from each side of the plate -- and added a double.\n\nThe offense provided from the two stalwarts in the Mariners offense overshadowed another strong outing from Logan Gilbert, who was making his first start since being named to the American League All-Star team.\n\nGilbert held the Padres scoreless for the first six innings, allowing just one hit. His second hit allowed was a solo homer in the seventh to Jake Cronenworth. He surrendered a two-run homer in the eighth, which ended his outing much to his displeasure.\n\nBut he still delivered a quality start and improved to 6-5 on the season, setting the tone for the Mariners.", "source": {"uri": "m.arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "m.arcamax.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arcamax_publishing@m.arcamax.com", "name": "ArcaMax Publishing", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cal_Raleigh", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cal Raleigh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julio_Rodr\u00edguez_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Julio Rodr\u00edguez (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petco_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Petco Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Center fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Cronenworth", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jake Cronenworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Gilbert", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Logan Gilbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_start", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quality start"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Watercraft", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Watercraft", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Oceanography", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Oceanography", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Classical_Studies/Greek", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Classical Studies/Greek", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://resources.arcamax.com/newspics/297/29722/2972286.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716675", "eventUri": "eng-9716675", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

He's been particularly effective on the road with a 2.75 ERA, so the Seattle Mariners will hope for him to be at his best yet again to break out of a funk in which they've dropped six of their last eight games.\n\nThe San Diego Padres present a tough test, ranking second in wRC+ (120) and third in wOBA (.331) against right-handed pitching. However, those numbers dip a bit (112 wRC+ and .320 wOBA) when isolated for the last 15 days, and I believe that Gilbert has what it takes to get the better of this matchup.\n\nBookmakers have priced Gilbert's strikeout prop at 4.5 even though he's recorded five or more punchouts in 14 of his 18 starts. How do we arrive at a number so low?\n\nIt's because the Padres have the league's lowest K rate (18.4%) against RHP, but it's not as though they're immune to the punchout. Most recently, Ryne Nelson (5) and Brandon Pfaadt (6) recorded more than 4.5 strikeouts against this lineup.\n\nTeams rarely face a right-handed start as effective as Gilbert, but the Padres have proven that they aren't ironproof against the strikeout when they face an ace. Nathan Eovaldi (6), Aaron Nola (6), and Tyler Glasnow (10) both found success against the Friars, and outside of those three names, San Diego hasn't faced many high-strikeout righties on the year.\n\nGilbert is posting a career-high 14.2% swinging strike rate while effectively pitching deeply into games, tying for the second-most quality starts (14). He avoids walks (5.3% walk rate) and generates a lot of whiffs (82nd percentile whiff rate).\n\nLet's take him to rack up at least five strikeouts at Petco tonight.\n\nOne of the reasons that Seattle is tumbling down the standings is because their lineup simply isn't up to the task. The Mariners own a K rate of 34.5% against RHP pitching across the last 15 days, nearly five percentage points higher than the next-closest team.\n\nThe M's also have the league's worst batting average (.184) and OPS (.587) against RHP in that span, so it's hard to look the other way against those numbers.\n\nPadres hurler Adam Mazur has had a rough start to his career, but his 4.80 xERA at least inspires some hope for positive regression and this is a perfect opportunity to find his groove.", "source": {"uri": "covers.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Covers.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Gilbert", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Logan Gilbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WOBA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "WOBA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ace (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petco_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Petco Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Glasnow", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Glasnow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Nola", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Nola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Eovaldi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nathan Eovaldi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_start", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quality start"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Officiating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://img.covers.com/cms/covers/1ce0f3b2-523e-4822-bb7c-eed9a121a1cf.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716675", "eventUri": "eng-9716675", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

First, Julio Rodriguez missed a few games during a recent series against the Toronto Blue Jays with a quad injury. Now, Dominic Canzone is dealt with his own ailment.\n\nCanzone, usually the right fielder for Seattle, exited the team's Tuesday against the San Diego Padres with a groin injury. Canzone originally suffered the injury on Sunday's 5-4 loss against the Blue Jays but seemed healthy enough to suit up against the Padres.\n\nPer a CBS Sports article via RotoWire staff, Canzone experienced a flare up with the injury in the fifth inning.. Before he was pulled, he registered three at-bats and hit his fifth double of the season.\n\nPer a tweet from the Seattle Times' Ryan Divish, it was once Canzone got on the base paths that the injury flare up happened. He'll receive an MRI on Wednesday to determine his availability for the Mariners' remaining five games before the All-Star break.\n\nCanzone is hitting .211 this season with seven home runs, five doubles and 14 RBIs. Canzone's offensive performance this year hasn't jumped off the page, but he has started to pick things up as of late. His double was his third consecutive game with a base hit after not registering a knock the four games prior.\n\nCanzone had a four-hit game in a 9-0 win against the Miami Marlins on June 22.\n\nMARINERS SWING FOR THE FENCES: Seattle Mariners fans were waiting for it to happen, and it finally did.

Down eight, down five, down four. They have battled from behind to win all sorts of ways.\n\nThey have done so enough that it seems they are almost never out of a game.\n\nTuesday was different. It never felt like they were in the game, trailing from the start and not being anything resembling competitive until it was far too late.\n\nThey were dominated by Mariners right-hander Logan Gilbert in a way they haven't been all season and lost 8-3 in front of a sellout crowd that was largely disinterested by the middle of the fifth inning.\n\nThe crowd stirred to life for a few seconds when Jake Cronenworth sent a pitch into the seats beyond right field with one out in the seventh inning and then grew animated again briefly when Kyle Higashioka hit a two-run homer in the eighth.\n\nThat late surge only served to blur how overpowering Gilbert was for most of the evening.\n\nDavid Peralta's two-out single in the eighth prompted the first stirring all night in the Mariners' bullpen, as left-hander Tayler Saucedo began to warm up and entered the game when Higashioka homered.\n\nGilbert (6-5, 2.94) took 87 pitches to get through 7 \u2154 innings, allowing four hits, walking one and striking out seven.\n\nDonovan Solano's infield single gave the Padres their only baserunner in the first five innings. A double-play grounder after that meant Gilbert had faced the minimum number of batters. He had also thrown just 45 pitches to that point.\n\nAll night, no Padres batter ever saw more than five pitches from Gilbert.\n\nThe Padres actually made him throw 16 pitches in the sixth inning, as the first three batters all saw five pitches, with Higashioka drawing a walk with two outs before Luis Arraez ended the inning with a fly ball to shallow right field on the first pitch he saw.\n\nThe Padres have still won 12 of their past 18 games and hold the final wild-card playoff spot in the National League. But they have lost three straight games, totalling eight hits in the past two.\n\nThe Mariners came to San Diego leading the American League West but having lost 12 of their past 17 games. They also ranked 28th in the major leagues in OPS and runs scored.\n\nThey scored a run in the first inning and another in the second, two in the third and one in the fourth.\n\nThe last of those was on a home run by Julio Rodriguez to the second deck of seats beyond left field. It was Rodriguez's second home run in 19 games.\n\nHe also drove in a run with a first-inning single, which meant he had twice as many RBIs Tuesday as he had in his previous 18 games.\n\nThe 5-0 lead was built against rookie Adam Mazur, who was for Stephen Kolek with two on and two down in the fifth.\n\nMazur (1-3, 7.84) allowed seven hits, walked two and hit two batters.\n\nKolek worked through the sixth inning without issue before Yuki Matsui surrendered a two-run homer to Cal Raleigh in the seventh. Raleigh, who entered the game with a .676 OPS, also hit a two-run homer off Mazur in the third inning.\n\nWandy Peralta departed in the ninth inning with an unknown injury after allowing a two-out double to Raleigh, who entered the game batting .203 on the season. Enyel De Los Santos replaced Peralta and yielded an RBI double to Victor Robles.\n\nOther than Cronenworth's 13th home run of the season, Gilbert had no such issues in winning for the fourth time in five career starts against the Padres. He has a 1.69 ERA in those games and has allowed 18 hits in 32 innings.\n\nThe 27-year-old right-hander, the Mariners' lone All-Star, has been dominant against other teams much of the season.\n\nHe came into Tuesday's game having thrown eight shutout innings in three games this season.

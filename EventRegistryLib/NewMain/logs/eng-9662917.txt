wherever and whenever they play,\" FIFA president Gianni Infantino said upon the announcement of SMPS.\n\nOnce registered, the service hides abusive comments on the social media accounts of players, coaches, officials, and teams, protecting them from various forms of hate speech.\n\nSMPS also prevents followers of players, coaches, and teams from being exposed to abusive, discriminatory, and threatening posts.\n\nThe tool will also be active during upcoming FIFA events such as the Olympic Football Tournaments at the Paris Olympics, the FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup 2024 in Colombia, the FIFA Futsal World Cup 2024 in Uzbekistan, and the FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup 2024 in the Dominican Republic.", "source": {"uri": "dohanews.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "Doha News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mohamed_eltayeb@dohanews.co", "name": "Mohamed Eltayeb", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switched-mode_power_supply", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Switched-mode power supply"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FIFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_Women's_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA Women's World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_Futsal_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA Futsal World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gianni_Infantino", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gianni Infantino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_U-20_Women's_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_qualification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup qualification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_U-17_Women's_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_at_the_Summer_Olympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Football at the Summer Olympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzbekistan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uzbekistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uzbekistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Republic", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dominican Republic"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Dominican Republic"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Psychological_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Psychological Abuse", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Abuse", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Non-FIFA_Nations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Non-FIFA Nations", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://dohanews.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/FiwqpdlWQAAl_W7.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662917", "eventUri": "eng-9662917", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 222, "relevance": 1}

However the discussions have stalled, with FIFA now considering selling the rights to the tournament to regional broadcasters, the people added, asking not to be named discussing private information.\n\nThe New York Times first reported the value of the Apple deal might be about $1 billion, a quarter of the value FIFA was initially targeting.\n\nSince then, some clubs have been contacted by FIFA to assess whether they would play for a lower fee than previously hoped, according to the people.\n\nA spokesperson for Apple declined to comment. A representative for FIFA said there are \"many\" parties interested in media and commercial partnerships, and it's working daily to maximize the opportunity for everyone involved.\n\n\"FIFA is fully confident and convinced of the commercial and sporting success of the new competition,\" the spokesperson said in a statement. \"FIFA is in regular and productive dialogue with the key counterparties involved including prospective venues, media and commercial partners, and of course the clubs themselves.\"\n\nFIFA President Gianni Infantino initially planned to launch the tournament in 2021 in China, but the project stalled because of the pandemic and a drop in interest in the sport in host country.\n\nAccording to FIFA, 29 of the 32 places available for the tournament have now been filled, with some of the biggest teams in Europe such as Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain FC, and Manchester City set to face opposition from teams around the world including Saudi Arabia's Al Hilal SFC. In all, there are 12 teams from Europe, six from South America and then representatives from the rest of the world, including four teams each from Africa and Asia.\n\nThe tournament has also been criticized by the player unions who say that it will put the world's elite footballers under too much physical strain. Their view was backed by Manchester United's co-owner Jim Ratcliffe, who said in a Bloomberg interview that there was a real danger of \"overloading\" footballers with too many high level matches.", "source": {"uri": "swissinfo.ch", "dataType": "news", "title": "SWI swissinfo.ch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "swi_swissinfo_ch@swissinfo.ch", "name": "Swi Swissinfo.Ch", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FIFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_Club_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA Club World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Hilal_SFC", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Al Hilal SFC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gianni_Infantino", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gianni Infantino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/AFC", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/AFC", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Handball/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Handball/Tournaments", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Non-FIFA_Nations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Non-FIFA Nations", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/wp-content/uploads/swissinfo-theme/swi-fallback-featured-image.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662917", "eventUri": "eng-9662917", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

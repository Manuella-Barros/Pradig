{"id": 224999546, "title": "With a glut of listings, and homes selling at a loss, NYC's famed Plaza is losing its luster", "text": "Fittingly, Robert Kraft \u2014 the billionaire owner of the New England Patriots \u2014 has fled Manhattan\u2019s famed Plaza for a home nearby on Billionaires\u2019 Row. He recently sold his Plaza condominium for $22.5 million, decamping to the 70-story skyscraper 220 Central Park South located two blocks west. That purchase was $34 million. Compared with the glitzy, modern towers that punctuate the Manhattan skyline, the Plaza \u2014 dominating the corner of Central Park South and Fifth Avenue with its French-Renaissance grandeur \u2014 is losing its luster. In fact \u2014 since it was converted into a hybrid condominium and hotel in 2008 \u2014 the building never really gained much steam. Currently, according to StreetEasy, nearly a quarter of the Plaza\u2019s condo units are listed for sale. Many have seen big price drops or have been sitting on the market, sometimes languishing there for years. Typically, fewer than 10% of a building\u2019s units are listed for sale at any one time \u2014 the sweet spot is 5 to 7%, said Jonathan Miller, president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel. But these days, \u201cbecause of the spike in mortgage rates, owners are less likely to list,\u201d he said, resulting in an average of 4.4% for buildings near the Plaza. At the Plaza, 38 of its 163 condo units are listed \u2014 a startling 23.3%. The ratio is well above that of competitive buildings, Miller said, \u201cwhich suggests there is a potential issue within the building or a resistance in the market that is causing more listings to appear.\u201d In Kraft\u2019s towering new building, 220 Central Park South, just 3 out of 117 units are listed. That\u2019s a ratio of 2.6%. Why the glut of Plaza listings? \u201cThe first thing that comes to mind is the amenities,\u201d said Bernice Leventhal of the Corcoran Group, who just listed a large one-bedroom there. \u201cThe Plaza has basic amenities compared with these new buildings, which are so highly amenitized.\u201d The Plaza\u2019s amenities include a gym, a spa, a bar and concierge services \u2014 whereas the new towers also boast extras like swimming pools, private restaurants, golf simulators and padel courts. And, of course, the skyline-defining skyscrapers bring the excitement and cachet of something special and state-of-the-art. Their windows are full sheets of glass \u2014 in contrast to the Plaza\u2019s ordinary and comparatively puny windows. People who want the Plaza, Leventhal said, \u201care diehard Plaza people,\u201d who far prefer a historic building over a new development. \u201cYou are choosing between older vs. newer, modern vs. classic.\u201d Her listing, unit 1807, is a huge one-bedroom \u2014 nearly 1,400 square feet \u2014 with an extra half-bath, asking $5.49 million. Monthly charges and taxes are in the low $5,000 range. It was on the market in 2018 for $1 million more, and has more recently been rented out for $11,500 a month. The unit faces Central Park on a high floor. It\u2019s the most expensive of the Plaza\u2019s nine one-bedrooms currently on the market. \u201cThere are not that many one-bedrooms that face the park,\u201d Leventhal said. The Plaza\u2019s interior units overlook a courtyard with a fountain. The hotel units are generally in the back, facing 58th Street. Currently, Charlie Attias of Compass holds around a dozen Plaza listings. (Some units, which can be combined, are double-listed.) One listing advertises two units that can be merged into a duplex. The price for both is $28.7 million, down from $31.4 million a year ago. Today\u2019s Plaza listings \u201care very well priced,\u201d Attias said. \u201cThe Plaza has great deals now. Prices are back to where they were 15 years ago, so there are deals to be made there.\u201d He agrees that many buyers are drawn to the ultra-modern tall towers. \u201cI think there is an oversupply in the Midtown high-end condo luxury market because of all the new construction, and it takes time to get absorbed,\u201d Attias said, adding that \u201cthere is nothing new being built or planned to be built.\u201d What\u2019s more, \u201cthere are fewer international buyers than usual,\u201d he said, \u201cbut they are coming now as the weather gets better, so I expect activity to pick up.\u201d The Plaza dates from 1907, when it started life as an opulent hotel outfitted with gold-rimmed china and crystal chandeliers. Over the years, it has hosted celebrities, luminaries and dignitaries \u2014 even a little girl named Eloise. The building changed hands several times, and the most recent renovation \u2014 the one that turned it into a condo-hotel \u2014 took three years and cost more than $400 million. In some ways, said Miller, the appraiser, \u201cthe Plaza is singular because it came on the market at the same time as 15 Central Park West.\u201d That was about 15 years ago, and both luxury buildings, aimed toward the ultra-rich, were priced equally, he said. \u201cBut 15 CPW has seen prices double or triple. In the Plaza that\u2019s not happening.\u201d A few months ago, Tim and Jenny Smucker, of Smucker\u2019s jam fame, sold their Plaza pied-\u00e0-terre \u2014 a one-bedroom with a terrace \u2014 for $2.5 million at auction. They had paid $2.9 million three years ago. They took the loss \u2014 but they also upgraded to a bigger one-bedroom on a higher floor, paying a discounted $3.7 million on an original price of $4.25 million. In 2023, investment banker Ken Moelis sold his Plaza condo for $10.75 million \u2014 some 16 years after purchasing the three-bedroom spread for a higher $11.23 million. And five years ago, shortly before COVID, fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger sold his Plaza place for a mere $31.25 million \u2014 after it sat on the market for 11 years, once priced at $80 million. The bargain buyer was automotive mogul Terry Taylor. Currently, the Plaza\u2019s most expensive listing is the trophy \u201cdouble penthouse\u201d \u2014 a duplex merged with a triplex, with two private elevators and 10,000 square feet. It was listed last winter and soon saw its price fall from $70 million to $60 million. \u201cThere are so many glass high rises,\u201d the listing reads, \u201cbut there is only one Plaza.\u201d", "summary": "Compared with the glitzy towers piercing the city skyline, the Plaza on Central Park South is struggling to keep up -- and has for many years.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/05/29/real-estate/nycs-famed-plaza-is-losing-its-luster-on-the-market/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/82827101.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:00:00", "author": "Joyce Cohen", "authors": ["Joyce Cohen"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.271}

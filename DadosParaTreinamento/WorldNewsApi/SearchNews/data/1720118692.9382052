In the past week, North Korea floated hundreds of huge balloons to dump rubbish on South Korea, simulated nuclear strikes against its neighbor and allegedly jammed GPS navigation signals in the South in an escalation of animosities between the rivals. South Korea\u2019s national security director Chang Ho-jin said Sunday that top officials at an emergency meeting decided to take \u201cunbearable\u201d measures against North Korea in response to its recent series of provocative acts. The information you need to know, sent directly to you: Download the CTV News App Chang called the North\u2019s balloon campaign and its alleged GPS signal jamming \u201cabsurd, irrational acts of provocation that a normal country can\u2019t imagine.\u201d He accused North Korea of aiming to cause \u201cpublic anxieties and chaos\u201d in South Korea. South Korean officials didn\u2019t say what retaliatory steps they would take. But many observers say South Korea will likely resume front-line loudspeaker broadcasts into North Korea that include criticism of its abysmal human rights situation, world news and K-pop songs. North Korea is extremely sensitive to such broadcasts because most of its 26 million people have no official access to foreign TV and radio programs. Earlier Sunday, South Korea\u2019s military said that more than 700 balloons flown from North Korea were additionally discovered in various parts of South Korea. Tied to the balloons were cigarette butts, scraps of cloth, waste paper and vinyl, but no dangerous substances, according to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It was North Korea\u2019s second balloon activity in less than a week. Between Tuesday and Wednesday, South Korean officials said they had found about 260 North Korean balloons carrying trash and manure. There have been no reports of major damage in South Korea.

North Korea often responds with fury to balloons from South Korea. In 2020, North Korea exploded an empty, South Korean-built liaison office in the North in anger over the South Korean balloon activities. Experts say North Korea\u2019s balloon campaign, reportedly the first of its kind in seven years, is meant to stoke an internal divide in South Korea over its conservative government\u2019s tough policy on the North. They say North Korea is also expected to further ramp up tensions ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November. Since 2022, North Korea has sharply increased a pace of weapons tests to build a bigger nuclear arsenal. Last week, it fired a barrage of nuclear-capable weapons into the sea in a drill simulating a preemptive attack on South Korea.", "summary": "South Korea said Sunday it\u2019ll soon take retaliatory steps against North Korea over its launch of trash-carrying balloons across the border and other provocations.", "url": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/south-korea-vows-unbearable-retaliation-against-north-korea-over-its-launch-of-trash-balloons-1.6910309", "image": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/content/dam/ctvnews/en/images/2024/6/2/north-korea-trash-balloons-1-6910310-1717330757515.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-02 12:20:32", "author": "Hyung-jin Kim", "authors": ["Hyung-jin Kim"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ca", "sentiment": 0.006}

Marathe was the director of Ego Media Pvt Ltd between September 5, 2016 and December 21, 2023. Marathe and Sagar Patil who were arrested on Saturday from Goa were produced before a court, which remanded them to police custody till June 15. While seeking her custody, the SIT produced letters that Marathe had sent to the GRP as director of Ego Media Pvt Ltd. In the letters, she has written that the GRP would stand to gain if Ego Media was given the contract. Later, the then GRP Commissioner had given them the contract. The SIT also mentioned that Patil who was entrusted with the construction work of the hoarding did not ensure quality and that the foundation was deep enough to support a hoarding of the size of 140X120 feet. With the arrests of Marathe and Patil, the total number of arrests in the case has gone upto four. The two arrested earlier include Bhavesh Bhinde, the current owner of Ego Media company, and Manoj Sanghu, the BMC-approved structural engineer who gave a safety certificate for the hoarding. Both are in judicial custody. In its report submitted to the SIT, the Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute (VJTI) said that the foundation of the structure was not strong enough and its capacity to withstand winds was only one-third of the required capacity. Police probe has revealed that the permission for the particular 140X120 feet hoarding was given by the then GRP commissioner after his transfer order had been issued by the government. No tenders had been called for the particular hoarding as well. Police have also found that the GRP misled the BMC by telling them that the civic body\u2019s permission was not needed as it was the railway land. Railway officials recently confirmed to the Mumbai Police SIT that the land does not belong to them. Police also found that the land belongs to the state government and BMC permission should have been taken in the matter. The SIT is in the process of recording the statements of GRP and BMC officials.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/ghatkopar-hoarding-collapse-grp-sit-accused-court-9381741/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/05/DJ22GhatkoparAccidentSite02.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 15:31:37", "author": null, "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.983}

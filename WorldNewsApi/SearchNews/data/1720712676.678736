{"id": 232067826, "title": "Police: Ryan Garcia Hospitalized amid Arrest, Accused of Causing $15K in Damage", "text": "Boxing star Ryan Garcia was arrested on Saturday and charged with felony vandalism by the Beverley Hills Police Department after being accused of causing over $15,000 in damages at the Waldorf Astoria Beverly Hills, per ESPN's Mike Coppinger. He may also be facing a charge of public intoxication. Garcia was transferred to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for \"evaluation and treatment\" after complaining about a medical issue once in jail. Garcia's attorney, Darin Chavez, said the arrest happened at \"an extraordinarily challenging time for Ryan, as he has been grappling with devastating news regarding his mother's health\" and released the following statement: \"Ryan has been open about his struggles with mental health over the years, and at this time he is dealing with an immense emotional burden. The support and understanding from fans and the public are crucial as he navigates these personal challenges. We are working diligently to provide Ryan with the resources he needs. Our team is committed to ensuring that he receives the appropriate help and care to address both his immediate and long-term well-being. We ask for continued support and compassion as Ryan focuses on his family and his health at this time.\" In early June, the 25-year-old Garcia said on social media that his mother was diagnosed with breast cancer, which she confirmed this week. In the ring, Garcia is 25-1 with 20 knockouts and emerged as one of the most promising young fighters in the sport after upsetting Devin Haney back in April. But that contest was mired in controversy, both before and after the fight. Beforehand, Garcia's mental health was a subject of concern given his social media behavior, to the point that the New York State Athletic Commission reportedly wanted him to undergo a mental health evaluation. He then missed weight ahead of the fight, making him ineligible to claim Haney's WBC junior welterweight title. After the fight, Garcia said he drank alcohol with regularity ahead of the fight with Haney. \"I don't give a f--k what people say about me,\" he told reporters. \"I walked through the fire, and still held it down and still beat f--king Devin Haney, and still drank every day and still beat him\u2014I did everything.\" \"I drank every single night, went out on the first Monday and Tuesday, and drank, drank, drank,\" he added. \"What happened? I won. I'm not necessarily proud of it, but I'm just saying. It was a statement to say you guys can't really f--k with me. I can do whatever I want.\" In May, however, Coppinger reported that a Sports Medicine Research and Testing Laboratory report showed an \"adverse finding\" for ostarine, a selective androgen receptor modulator. Garcia denied taking the banned substance and his legal team said in a statement that it believes \"one of the natural supplements Ryan was using in the lead up to the fight will prove to be contaminated.\" He is facing a potential suspension if the New York State Athletic Commission finds that he was indeed taking a banned substance.", "summary": "Boxing star Ryan Garcia was arrested on Saturday and charged with felony vandalism by the Beverley Hills Police Department after allegedly causing over\u2026", "url": "https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10124134-police-ryan-garcia-hospitalized-amid-arrest-accused-of-causing-15k-in-damage", "image": "https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/x_0,y_110,w_1800,h_1197,c_crop/v1717947302/ozru8hhvrqlolltxr39h.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:21:35", "author": "Timothy Rapp", "authors": ["Timothy Rapp"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.309}

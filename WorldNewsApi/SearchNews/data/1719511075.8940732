The Mexican-American rising star performed in Chicago\u2019s Grant Park to a crowd that sang along to his biggest hits, including \u201cLa Diabla\u201d and \u201cLa V\u00edctima,\u201d both Billboard Hot 100 chart entries. By now, the 20-year-old is no stranger to big stages. His Poco a Poco Tour kicked off in March in Mexico City and traveled across major U.S. cities, including Seattle, Las Vegas and Phoenix. But it was his first time performing in Chicago. \u201cFirst of all, I\u2019m super excited because I\u2019ve never been to Chicago,\u201d Xavi tells Billboard a day before his set. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very special and the preparation for a festival isn\u2019t really that different to how I prepared for my tour shows. It\u2019s kind of the same cause everything is in God\u2019s hands. We do this with a lot of love, good vibes, and hoping everyone leaves happy.\u201d Xavi says he wasn\u2019t the type to go to festivals when he was younger but always imagined playing in one. And that finally happened when he took the stage just before 3 p.m. as the crowd settled into the open grass area. Wearing a Chicago Bulls jersey, as a nod to the city\u2019s NBA team, he opened with \u201cPoco A Poco.\u201d \u201cComo estamos Chicago? (How are we doing Chicago?)\u201d he asked fans. Throughout his short but riveting 30-minute set, he sang all the hits, including \u201cModo DND,\u201d \u201cLa V\u00edctima\u201d and closed with the banger \u201cLa Diabla.\u201d Signed to Interscope Records, Xavi\u2019s signature tumbados rom\u00e1nticos catapulted him to the top of the Billboard charts earlier this year. When asked what he thinks has been crucial to his rapid rise in music has been, he adds: \u201cThe key to success was the whole team behind it all, the family, the discipline, living each day as if it were the last.\u201d", "summary": "The Mexican-American artist performed on Saturday, May 25 in Chicago\u2019s Grant Park.", "url": "https://www.billboard.com/music/latin/xavi-makes-united-states-festival-debut-suenos-performance-1235693133/", "image": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/xavi-suenos-festival-2024-billboard-1548.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 14:58:16", "author": "Griselda Flores", "authors": ["Griselda Flores"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.06}

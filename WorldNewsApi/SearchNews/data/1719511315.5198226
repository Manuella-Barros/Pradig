Kohli, who was eliminated by Rajasthan Royals on Wednesday, maintained his iron grip on the top of the standings with his closest competitors not taking advantage of their remaining matches. Rajasthan Royals' Riyan Parag and Sanju Samson did not have a successful outing with the bat against Sunrisers Hyderabad, scoring just 6 and 10 respectively and were eliminated by SRH in Qualifier 2 so they remained on 3rd and 5th respectively. SRH's Travis Head had a golden opportunity to get to the 2nd position but he failed in the latter half of the season, scoring 3 ducks in his last 4 matches which enabled Chennai Super Kings captain Ruturaj Gaikwad to finish runner-up as the Australian languished at 4th.

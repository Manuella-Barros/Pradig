Sindhu is now set to face He Bingjiao from China.India shuttler PV Sindhu marched into the Round of 16 of badminton women's singles event after beating Kristin Kuuba of Estonia in the final Group M match at the ongoing Paris Olympics on Wednesday.\n\nSindhu dominated over Kuuba and won the match 21-5, 21-10 in a 34-minute contest at the La Chapelle Arena.\n\nIn the first game, Sindhu controlled the momentum and clinched a 21-5 win in just 14 minutes. Meanwhile, The Indian shuttler continued her form and won the second game 21-10 in 19 minutes.\n\nPV Sindhu could potentially face the People's Republic of China's He Bingjiao in her upcoming Round of 16 match. Earlier in the Tokyo Olympics, Sindhu beat He Bingjiao to secure her bronze.\n\nEarlier in Sindhu's previous Group M match, the Indian shuttler began her quest for her third Olympic medal with a straightforward win against the Maldives' Fathimath Nabaaha Abdul Razzaq in the women's singles event.\n\nSindhu displayed grit and confidence and restricted her opponent to single digits in both games. She began her campaign with a 21-9, 21-6 win in a game that lasted for 29 minutes.\n\nIn the hunt for her third Olympic medal, Sindhu didn't waste any time in establishing her dominance. She used every inch of the badminton court to her advantage and lured her opponent into playing a loose shot.\n\nThis was the second time Sindhu and Razzaq had faced each other. The Indian shuttler breezed past the Maldives shuttler in their first encounter, and once again, history repeated itself in Paris.\n\nThe first game began with both shuttlers going neck-to-neck against each other. Sindhu took a point lead, and Razzaq fought back to level the scoreline.\n\nThe trend lasted till the scoreboard read 4-4. Sindhu upped her game and went on a spree, which saw her claim ten points in a row.\n\nRazzaq eventually managed to break Sindhu's 10-point spree, but the first game was almost out of her hands.\n\nAn angled flick from Sindhu, showcasing her class, made the scoreline 19-6 in her favour. Razzaq fought back, fighting hard for a late comeback by winning three consecutive points. An exquisite drop shot made the scoreline 19-9.\n\nSindhu eventually sealed the first game in 13 minutes with a scoreline of 21-9.\n\nThe second game was a similar story for the Maldives shuttler. She failed to overcome Sindhu's technical prowess.\n\nWithin a blink of an eye, the Indian shuttler clinched three consecutive points before her shot was stopped by the net. This opened a window of opportunity for Razzaq to make a comeback and she exploited it to its best. She won three consecutive points, making the scoreline 4-3, leaving her just a point behind Sindhu.\n\nHowever, the short-lived rallies didn't do any favour for Razzaq as she eventually started to trail just like in the first set.

She extended her advantage to six points with a net shot followed by a deceptive return that left Kuuba unable to respond. Despite a few points for the Estonian, Sindhu maintained control. Kuuba tried an awkward drive shot but failed to keep it in bounds, conceding another point. Sindhu briefly lost a point due to a delayed return but soon regained her momentum with a cross-court drive, securing a 13-point lead.

Meanwhile, The Indian shuttler continued her form and won the second game 21-10 in 19 minutes.\n\nSindhu could potentially face the China's He Bingjiao in her upcoming Round of 16 match. Earlier in the Tokyo Olympics, Sindhu beat He Bingjiao to secure her bronze.\n\nEarlier in Sindhu's previous Group M match, the Indian shuttler began her quest for her third Olympic medal with a straightforward win against the Maldives' Fathimath Nabaaha Abdul Razzaq in the women's singles event. Sindhu displayed grit and confidence and restricted her opponent to single digits in both games. She began her campaign with a 21-9, 21-6 win in a game that lasted for 29 minutes.\n\nIn the hunt for her third Olympic medal, Sindhu didn't waste any time in establishing her dominance. She used every inch of the badminton court to her advantage and lured her opponent into playing a loose shot.\n\nThis was the second time Sindhu and Razzaq had faced each other. The Indian shuttler breezed past the Maldives shuttler in their first encounter, and once again, history repeated itself in Paris.\n\nThe first game began with both shuttlers going neck-to-neck against each other. Sindhu took a point lead, and Razzaq fought back to level the scoreline.\n\nThe trend lasted till the scoreboard read 4-4. Sindhu upped her game and went on a spree, which saw her claim ten points in a row.\n\nRazzaq eventually managed to break Sindhu's 10-point spree, but the first game was almost out of her hands.\n\nAn angled flick from Sindhu, showcasing her class, made the scoreline 19-6 in her favour. Razzaq fought back, fighting hard for a late comeback by winning three consecutive points. An exquisite drop shot made the scoreline 19-9.\n\nSindhu eventually sealed the first game in 13 minutes with a scoreline of 21-9. The second game was a similar story for the Maldives shuttler. She failed to overcome Sindhu's technical prowess.\n\nWithin a blink of an eye, the Indian shuttler clinched three consecutive points before her shot was stopped by the net. This opened a window of opportunity for Razzaq to make a comeback and she exploited it to its best. She won three consecutive points, making the scoreline 4-3, leaving her just a point behind Sindhu.\n\nHowever, the short-lived rallies didn't do any favour for Razzaq as she eventually started to trail just like in the first set. Razzaq's defence didn't do her any favour, allowing Sindhu to seal the match following a 21-6 win in the second game.\n\nDisappointing loss\n\nStar India shuttler Ashwini Ponnappa announced her retirement from the Olympics after a disappointing loss in their Group C badminton women's team match against Australia's Setyana Mapasa and Angela Yu at the multi-sport event. After the match, Ponnappa said that it takes a lot of emotional and mental strength to go through it. The Indian shuttler added she can't take it anymore.\n\n\"It takes a toll emotionally and mentally, I can't go through this again. It is not easy, you can take all these if you are a little younger. Having played for so long, I can't take it anymore,\" Ponnappa was quoted by Olympics.com as saying.\n\nIn the women's team event, the Indian women's duo of Ashwini Ponnappa and Tanisha Crasto succumbed to their third consecutive defeat in Group C to finish fourth and crash out in the group stage.\n\nThey endured defeat against the Australian duo of Setyana Mapasa and Angela Yu 15-21, 10-21 in straight games on Tuesday. The Indian women's duo struggled throughout their outing against the Australian team.\n\nRankireddy, Shetty enter quarters\n\nMeanwhile, India's star men's duo Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty punched their ticket for the quarter-finals of badminton doubles with a straight-game win over Indonesia's Fajar Alfian and Muhammad Rian Ardianto on Tuesday at the Paris Olympics.\n\nThe Indian pair, which is ranked No 3, reached the knockout stage as the Group C leaders. Satwik and Chirag dominated the All-England winners and clinched 21-13, 21-13 win in a game that lasted 40 minutes.\n\nThe Indian duo worked hard for each point to register a comfortable victory. The Indian duo raced to a 5-3 lead early in the first game but the Indonesian pair bounded back by taking two consecutive points and levelling the scoreline 5-5.\n\nIt became a back-and-forth affair, but the Indian duo upped their game and eventually took a four-point lead, making the scoreline 15-11. The duo didn't look back and raced to a 21-13 win in the first game.\n\nThe second game was a similar story, with both pairs going neck-to-neck for each point. After 11-8, the Indian star duo took six consecutive points to take a step closer to the knockout stage. The relentless, aggressive attack continued as they launched a flurry of shots to seal the game.", "source": {"uri": "gulfnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GULF NEWS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristin_Kuuba", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kristin Kuuba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._V._Sindhu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "P.

This set the tone for the rest of the match, leaving her Estonian rival struggling to find any rhythm.\n\nIn the second game, Sindhu continued her relentless assault, maintaining her superior play throughout.

She quickly took a 4-0 lead, applying pressure on Kuuba with a combination of powerful smashes and accurate net play.\n\nKuuba's errors, including unforced mistakes and inconsistent returns, allowed Sindhu to extend her lead without significant resistance. The Indian shuttler capitalised on these errors, demonstrating her ability to exploit opponent weaknesses.\n\nReaching the mid-game interval with a commanding 11-2 lead, Sindhu's domination in rallies and her ability to capitalise on Kuuba's errors highlighted her superior technical and tactical execution.\n\nThe second game saw a slight improvement from Kuuba, who managed to start with a 2-1 lead. However, Sindhu quickly regained control, demonstrating her adaptability and resilience.\n\nSindhu's smashes were particularly effective, forcing Kuuba into defensive positions and leading to several decisive points. Her movement around the court was fluid, allowing her to maintain pressure and capitalise on Kuuba's lack of precision.\n\nSindhu closed the game with a score of 21-10, utilising a mix of aggressive play and strategic shot placement. Her ability to adapt her playstyle, switching between aggressive smashes and controlled rallies, was crucial in securing the win.\n\nSindhu's shot accuracy was exceptional, with a high percentage of successful smashes and net plays. Her placement of shots was consistently aimed at exploiting Kuuba's weaknesses.\n\nIn contrast, Kuuba's high error rate, including both unforced errors and missed opportunities, significantly contributed to her inability to mount a serious challenge. Sindhu's court coverage was exemplary, allowing her to effectively respond to Kuuba's attempts and control the pace of the game.\n\nSindhu's strategy involved a balanced approach of aggressive play mixed with strategic placement. Her ability to adapt her game based on the flow of the match was evident, particularly in how she adjusted her tactics in the second game to counter Kuuba's slight improvement.\n\nKuuba struggled with consistency and made numerous errors, which Sindhu exploited effectively. Her inability to sustain pressure and her lack of strategic depth were key factors in her defeat.\n\nSindhu's victory over Kuuba highlights her readiness and strategic acumen as she progresses to the round of 16. Her performance was marked by technical precision, effective use of court space, and tactical adaptability.\n\nMoving forward, Sindhu will face a tougher challenge in the round of 16 against China's He Bing Jiao, where her ability to maintain her high level of play and address specific opponent strategies will be crucial for continued success in the Paris Olympics.\n\nUNI BDN ARN", "source": {"uri": "uniindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "http://www.uniindia.com/fadnavis-orders-probe-into-mumbai-pub-fire/states/news/1090400.html"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristin_Kuuba", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kristin Kuuba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._V._Sindhu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "P.

This growth was driven by increases across all revenue streams: net rental revenue rose by 1.8%, media sales by 16.2%, and utilities and other revenue by 30.7%. The revenue boost was supported by a like-for-like occupancy rate increase to 92.5% in Q2-24, up from 91.4% in Q2-23.\n\nAdditionally, the grand opening of U Walk Jeddah on 15 February 2024, with over 80% of spaces pre-let and continued strong demand from new international and local retailers, contributed to the overall revenue growth. Record footfall across the shopping malls attracting 34.4 million customers in Q2-24, a 1.8% increase compared to Q2-23, further supported this growth.\n\nThe reason of the increase (decrease) in the net profit during the current quarter compared to the same quarter of the last year is Net profit increased by 5.0% to SAR 353.8 million in Q2-24 (three months ended 30 June 2024) compared to SAR 337.1 million in Q2-23 (three months ended 30 June 2023). This increase in net profit was mainly driven by:\n\n* Revenue: increased to SAR 586.5 million in Q2-24 compared to SAR 565.3 million in Q2-23.\n\n* Cost of revenue: decreased to SAR 101.1 million in Q2-24 compared to SAR 107.2 million in Q2-23 representing a 5.8% decline mainly due to reduced operating costs and insurance demonstrating the company's focus to implement cost control initiatives across the business.\n\n* Advertisement and promotional expenses: reduced to SAR 0.3 million in Q2-24 compared to SAR 5.2 million in Q2-23.\n\n* General & Administrative expenses: down 16.7% to SAR 67.5 million in Q2-24 compared to SAR 81.0 million in Q2-23 driven by stringent cost control initiatives, including personnel cost optimization, which delivered a 6.1% decrease in salary and benefits, and a 57.9% decline in professional fees.\n\n* Net fair value gain on investment properties: increased to SAR 125.3 million in Q2-24 compared to SAR 72.9 million in Q2-23, primarily due to growth across the existing portfolio, the successful opening of U Walk Jeddah, and the significant construction progress in Jawharat Riyadh and Jawharat Jeddah flagship malls.\n\n* No other operating expenses were recorded in Q2-24 compared to SAR 18.1 million in Q2-23.\n\nThe increase in net profit for Q2-24 compared to Q2-23 was partially offset by the following factors:\n\n* Increase in net finance costs which reached SAR 151.1 million in Q2-24 compared to SAR 78.5 million in Q2-23 driven by the increase in average cost of debt and the increase in total debts considering that the company is in an exceptional investment stage and investing in its two flagship development projects, Jawharat Riyadh and Jawharat Jeddah which are expected to be delivered in H2-25.\n\n* Recording an impairment loss on accounts receivable of SAR 29.0 million, compared to a reversal of impairment of SAR 1.2 million in Q2-23.\n\nThe reason of the increase (decrease) in the sales/ revenues during the current quarter compared to the previous one is Revenue remained steady with a slight increase of 0.1% to SAR 586.5 million in Q2-24 (three months ended 30 June 2024), compared to SAR 585.8 million in Q1-24 (three months ended 31 March 2024). Net rental income and occupancy remained steady whilst the business continues to focus on its proactive tenant strategy to ensure optimum mix which is helping drive record footfall numbers. The reason of the increase (decrease) in the net profit (loss) during the current quarter compared to the previous one is Net profits increased by 90.6% to SAR 353.8 million in Q2-24 (three months ended 30 June 2024) compared to SAR 185.6 million in Q1-24 (three months ended 31 March 2024). Despite a slight increase in cost of revenue and general and administrative expenses, net profit increase was mainly driven by:\n\n* Revenue: increase of 0.1% to SAR 586.5 million in Q2-24 compared to SAR 585.8 million in Q1-24.\n\n* Advertisement and promotional expenses: dropped to SAR 0.3 million in Q2-24 compared\n\nto SAR 11.9 million in Q1-24.\n\n* Impairment loss on accounts receivable: down 70.1% to SAR 29.0 million in Q2-24 compared to SAR 97.1 million in Q1-24.\n\n* Net finance costs: decreased by 12.9% to SAR 151.1 million in Q2-24 compared to SAR 173.4 million in Q1-24 where Q1-24 profits were impacted by the write-off of non-amortized financing cost associated with historical Islamic facility and 2024 Sukuk, totaling SAR 50.6 million.\n\n* Net fair value gain on investment properties: Increased to SAR 125.3 million in Q2-24 compared to SAR 50.7 million in Q1-24, primarily as a result of growth across the existing portfolio and significant construction progress in Jawharat Riyadh and Jawharat Jeddah flagship malls.\n\nThe reason of the increase (decrease) in the sales/ revenues during the current period compared to the same period of the last year is Revenue increased by 2.6% to SAR 1,172.3 million in H1-24 (six months ended 30 June 2024) compared to SAR 1,142.0 million in H1-23 (six months ended 30 June 2023).\n\nThis growth was supported by an improved like-for-like occupancy rate, which increased to 92.5% in H1-24 from 91.4% in H1-23. Additionally, the opening of U Walk Jeddah in Q1-24 and a continued record rise in footfall across the shopping malls, up 2.9 million to 66 million visitors in H1-24 compared to 63.1 million in H1-23, contributed to the overall revenue growth.\n\nThis growth was further driven by increases across all revenue streams, including the net rental revenue. Media sales and other revenue saw significant rises of 18.9% and 39.3%, respectively.\n\nThe reason of the increase (decrease) in the net profit during the current period compared to the same period of the last year is Net profit reached to SAR 539.5 million in H1-24 (six months ended June 2024) compared to SAR 725.1 million in H1-23 (six months ended June 2023) where H1-24 profits were impacted by the write-off of non-amortized financing cost associated with historical Islamic facility and 2024 Sukuk, totaling SAR 50.6 million. In contrast, H1-23 net profit was increased by a SAR 238.7 million gain on the sale of land.\n\nAdjusting for these items, net profits in H1-24 increased to SAR 590.1 million, up 25.6% from SAR 469.7 million in H1-23.\n\nThe H1-24 net profit was additionally impacted by:\n\n* Increase in net finance costs which reached SAR 324.5 million in H1-24 compared to SAR 165.2 million in H1-23, driven by the write-off of non-amortized financing cost associated with historical Islamic facility and 2024 Sukuk, totaling SAR 50.6 million, rise in average cost of debt and the increase in total debts considering that the company is in an exceptional investment stage and investing in its two flagship development projects, Jawharat Riyadh and Jawharat Jeddah which are expected to be delivered in H2-25.\n\n* Increase in impairment loss on accounts receivable which reached SAR 126.1 million in H1-24, compared to SAR 113.4 million in H1-23, due to the reversal of impairment loss in Q2-23 by SAR 1.2 million.\n\nThe decrease in net profit for H1-24 compared to H1-23 was partially offset by the following factors:\n\n* Revenue: increased to 2.6% to SAR 1,172.3 million in H1-24 compared to SAR 1,142.0 million in H1-23.\n\n* General & Administrative expenses: down 25.2% to SAR 127.0 million in H1-24 compared to SAR 169.8 million in H1-23, mainly due to a 70.3% reduction in professional fees and a 10.8% decline in employee salary and benefits.\n\n* Other operating expense, which decreased from SAR 18.1 million in H1-23 to SAR 0.1 million in H1-24.\n\n* Net fair value gain on investment properties: increased to SAR 176.0 million in H1-24 compared to SAR 21.2 million in H1-23 primarily as a result of growth across the existing portfolio, the opening of U Walk Jeddah and significant construction progress in Jawharat Riyadh and Jawharat Jeddah flagship malls.\n\nStatement of the type of external auditor's report Unmodified conclusion Comment mentioned in the external auditor's report, mentioned in any of the following paragraphs (other matter, conservation, notice, disclaimer of opinion, or adverse opinion) N/A Reclassification of Comparison Items Certain comparative figures have been reclassified to conform to the current period's presentation.

H1'24 EBITDA of SAR 791 million up +20% YoY, with margin of 41.5% within range. H1'24 Capex of SAR 919 million up +18% YoY, with accelerated spending in Q2'24, reflecting ongoing deliveries and start-up of the Unconventional Land Rigs. Interim Dividend of SAR 1.35 per Share for H1'24.\n\nAl-Khobar, KSA - Arabian Drilling, or (the \"Company\"), (Tadawul symbol: 2381), one of the largest national onshore and offshore drilling contractor in Saudi Arabia, announced its financial results for Q2'24, highlighting a 20% YoY EBITDA growth and the acceleration of the delivery and start-up of the Unconventional Land Rigs with five out of the ten of the new fleet already active.\n\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\n\nREVENUE\n\nArabian Drilling delivered consolidated revenue of SAR 1,906 million for H1'24, marking a +21% increase compared to SAR 1,570 million in H1'23, mainly driven by the contribution of three offshore rigs added in Q3'23.\n\nThe slight Quarter-on-Quarter (\"QoQ\") revenue decline of -3% from SAR 967 million in Q1'24 to SAR 939 million was mainly due to a SAR 33 million revenue shortfall following the previously announced Offshore rig suspensions. This was partially offset by the earlier than planned startup of four Unconventional Land Rigs during Q2'24, contributing SAR 14 million in revenue.\n\nEBITDA\n\nH1'24 EBITDA reached SAR 791 million, up +20% YoY, in line with the revenue growth. The EBITDA margin saw a slight decrease of 40 basis points, from 41.9% to 41.5%. For the 6 months ended 30 June 2024, EBITDA was affected by approx. 29 million of Unconventional Land Rigs startup. Excluding the startup cost, normalized H1'24 EBITDA would have been at approx. 43%.\n\nQ2'24 EBITDA was -5% lower QoQ (SAR 19 million) mainly due to the impact of the suspension of two Offshore rigs as previously announced. However, this was partially offset by the EBITDA contribution and mobilization cost deferral of the Unconventional Land Rig startups.\n\nNET INCOME\n\nH1'24 Adjusted Net Income of SAR 271 million was -4% lower compared to H1'23. The contribution from the additional Offshore rigs that started in Q3'23 was offset primarily by the startup cost from the Unconventional Land Rigs, depreciation for the new Offshore rigs as well as interest charges for new loans, higher rates, and interest expenses that were capitalized in H1'23.\n\nH1'24 Adjusted Net Income excludes a non-cash impairment chare of SAR 105 million to amend the book carrying value of one land and one offshore rig that was recognized in Q2'24.\n\nQ1'24 Adjusted Net Income was SAR 125 million, which is SAR 21 million lower than Q1'24. This decrease is due to additional depreciation costs of SAR 14 million, mainly from both the Unconventional Land Rig start-up and other sustaining Capex, as well as reduced financial income on short term deposits of SAR 7 million QoQ due to lower excess cash availability as the accelerated capex cycle approaches its peak.\n\nCAPEX\n\nQ2'24 Capex spending amounted to SAR 613 million or double the amount in the previous Quarter as the accelerated spending in Q2'24 on the Unconventional Land Rigs coincided with the physical delivery of the rigs and the purchase of additional rig moving equipment to support the expanded fleet size.\n\nTo date, the total spent on the Unconventional Land Rigs program is approx. SAR 1.2 billion, with the total estimated spending projected to be in the range of SAR 2.1 to 2.2 billion by end of Q1'25.\n\nCASH FLOWS AND WORKING CAPITAL\n\nFor H1'24, the Net Cash Flow generated from Operating Activities was SAR 570 million compared to SAR 821 million for the same period last year. This decrease was mainly due to an unfavorable YoY NWC variance of approx. SAR 430 million. As of 30 June 2023, NWC was exceptionally low and represented only 5% of the last 12-month trailing revenue, compared to 21% as of 30 June 2024.\n\nNet Cash Flow generated from Operating Activities in Q2'24 was SAR 314 million, up +23% QoQ, mainly due to a favorable swing in the Net Working Capital ('NWC') and other items of approx. SAR 70 million. Excluding QoQ variances on NWC and other items, cash generated from operations in Q2'24 was close to SAR 400 million and in line with that of the quarter.\n\nNET DEBT AND CASH POSITION\n\nAs of 30 June 2024, the Company's Cash and Cash Equivalents position was SAR 687 million or -45% lower than in Q1'24. This decrease is consistent with the high Capex spending incurred during the Quarter, as mentioned above. In addition, a dividend payment of SAR 225 million for the period related to H2'23 was made in April, and the Company also repaid SAR 50 million on one of its two bank loans. As of 30 June 2024, the excess cash invested in Short Term Deposits amounted to SAR 375 million.\n\nAs of 30 June 2024, the Company's Net Debt position was SAR 2,419 million, an increase of +31% QoQ, mainly driven by the reduced cash position mentioned above, while the Gross Debt position remained unchanged at SAR 3.1 billion as the loan repayment of 50 million was offset by the accrued portion of the interest.\n\nConsequently, the leverage ratio (Net Debt / EBITDA) has increased from 1.2x in Q1'24 to 1.5x in Q2'24, as previously expected.\n\nThe Company is likely to draw an additional available secured facility of up to SAR 500 million before year-end to complete the Unconventional Capex investments.\n\nKEY FINANCIAL METRICS\n\nSAR Millions\n\nQ2'24\n\nQ1'24\n\nChange\n\nH1'24\n\nH1'23\n\nChange\n\nRevenue\n\n939\n\n967\n\n-3%\n\n1,906\n\n1,570\n\n+21%\n\nEBITDA\n\n386\n\n405\n\n-5%\n\n791\n\n658\n\n+20%\n\nEBITDA (% of Revenue)\n\n41.1%\n\n41.9%\n\n-80 bps\n\n41.5%\n\n41.9%\n\n-40 bps\n\nAdjusted Operating Profit\n\n180\n\n214\n\n-16%\n\n394\n\n352\n\n+12%\n\nAdjusted Net Income (1)\n\n125\n\n146\n\n-14%\n\n271\n\n282\n\n-4%\n\nNet Income\n\n20\n\n146\n\n-86%\n\n166\n\n282\n\n-41%\n\nAdjusted EPS (SAR)\n\n1.41\n\n1.64\n\n-14%\n\n3.05\n\n3.17\n\n-4%\n\nCapital Expenditure (2)\n\n613\n\n306\n\n+100%\n\n919\n\n782\n\n+18%\n\nCF from Operating Activities\n\n314\n\n256\n\n+23%\n\n570\n\n821\n\n-30%\n\nActive Rigs (3)\n\n48\n\n47\n\n+2%\n\n48\n\n44\n\n+9%\n\nNotes:\n\n(1) Excludes a non-cash asset impairment charge of SAR 105 million recognized in Q2'24\n\n(2) H1'23 Capex includes SAR 37.6 million of capitalized interest cost\n\n(3) Active rigs at the end of the period include rigs operating and generating revenue.\n\nRESULTS BY SEGMENTS\n\nLAND Segment (1)\n\n(SAR Millions)\n\nQ2'24\n\nQ1'24\n\nChange\n\nH1'24\n\nH1'23\n\nChange\n\nRevenue\n\n520\n\n514\n\n+1%\n\n1,034\n\n489\n\n111%\n\nCost of Revenue (2)\n\n(527)\n\n(455)\n\n+16%\n\n(982)\n\n(392)\n\n151%\n\nGross Profit\n\n(7)\n\n59\n\n-112%\n\n52\n\n97\n\n-47%\n\nAdjusted Gross Profit (3)\n\n48\n\n59\n\n-19%\n\n107\n\n97\n\n+10%\n\nOFFSHORE Segment\n\n(SAR Millions)\n\nQ2'24\n\nQ1'24\n\nChange\n\nH1'24\n\nH1'23\n\nChange\n\nRevenue\n\n419\n\n453\n\n-7%\n\n872\n\n302\n\n+189%\n\nCost of Revenue (2)\n\n(283)\n\n(243)\n\n+17%\n\n(526)\n\n(170)\n\n+210%\n\nGross Profit\n\n136\n\n210\n\n-35%\n\n346\n\n194\n\n+162%\n\nAdjusted Gross Profit (3)\n\n186\n\n210\n\n-11%\n\n396\n\n194\n\n+204%\n\nNotes:\n\n(1): includes OFSAT results\n\n(2): includes Depreciation, excludes G&A, Interest and Tax\n\n(3): excludes impact of non-cash asset impairment\n\nOPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS\n\nRIG ACTIVITY & UTILIZATION RATE\n\nThe active rig count increased from 47 to 48 rigs QoQ. Overall, the utilization rate decreased from 96% to 91% QoQ, representing 48 active rigs over an available fleet of 53 units.\n\nThe addition of the four Unconventional Land Rigs was offset by the previously announced suspensions of two offshore rigs which became effective at the end of May and the conclusion of one rig's contract at the end of June, as expected.\n\nThe three offshore rigs are now located in a shipyard facility in Saudi Arabia. Two of these rigs are currently undergoing mandatory planned recertification activities and are all being actively marketed in and outside of Saudi Arabia.\n\nConsequently, utilization rate in Offshore Segment decreased from 100% in Q1'24 to 75% in Q2'24. In contrast, the utilization rate in the Land Segment increased from 94.6% to 95.1% QoQ following the contract start of the four Unconventional Land Rigs.\n\nPost period-end, discussions were initiated regarding the suspension of one additional leased offshore rig. The Company continues to monitor operational adjustments from Aramco that may result in further changes to their Offshore and Land fleet requirements.\n\nOPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE\n\nOur fully-owned rig move subsidiary, OFSAT, completed 38 rig moves during Q2'24 with an average net saving of 1.1 days per rig move compared to Aramco's Rig Move KPI. These savings translate to an additional 43 days of rig operating time. OFSAT continues to play a key role in running efficient and safe rigs moves.\n\nNon-Productive Time (\"NPT\") increased QoQ from 0.81% to 1.61%, with a 12-month rolling NPT of 1.29%. Q2'24 NPT was adversely impacted by service quality events which are being addressed and may result in future uptime recovery.\n\nBACKLOG\n\nAs of 30 June 2024, the Company's backlog stood at SAR 11.0 billion or approx. SAR 800 million lower compared to last Quarter. The decrease is a result of a quarterly backlog consumption rate of approx. SAR 900 million, partially offset by a backlog addition of SAR 100 million, mainly due to a one-year extension on an Offshore rig contract.\n\nThe ratio of the current Backlog to the LTM Revenue (Book-to-Bill ratio) was at 2.9x and the average remaining contract tenure was 2.46 years per rig.\n\nHEALTH, SAFETY & ENVIRONMENT\n\nThe YTD Total Recordable Incident Frequency (\"TRIF\") increased slightly to 0.94 in Q2'24, compared to 0.90 in Q1'24 . Since the beginning of the year, seven of the Company's active rigs have achieved significant milestones of six years or more without any Lost Time Injury (\"LTI\") events. These remarkable achievements demonstrate the Company's strong adherence to its HSE values and commitment to maintaining high safety standards.\n\nGUIDANCE\n\nFY'24 Revenue guidance remains unchanged with a range of SAR 3.6 billion to 3.9 billion reflecting a +4% to +12% YoY increase. This revenue guidance assumes the impact of the three stacked offshore rig and one possible further suspension in H2'24.\n\nFY'24 CAPEX guidance of SAR 2.1 billion to SAR 2.4 billion remains unchanged based on the current progress of the Unconventional Rigs Capex program.\n\nDIVIDEND\n\nPursuant to the resolution passed during the last Ordinary General Assembly, the Company's Board approved an interim dividend of SAR 1.35 per share for the period related to H1'24. The dividend eligibility date is 05 August 2024 and is expected to be paid by 22 August 2024.\n\nAll dividend payments are contingent on various factors, including the Company's anticipated earnings and cash flows, available financing and capital requirements, and prevailing market and general economic conditions, in line with the Company's dividend distribution policy.\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nGhassan Mirdad, Chief Executive Officer of Arabian Drilling, commented:\n\n\"We have made significant progress during the first half of the year on our Unconventional Lang Rigs program with half of our fleet to date already deployed and generating revenues. The remaining five rigs from the first award are set to come online by end of August. The additional three from the second award are set to start in Q4, well ahead of the contractual start date of Q1'25. We expect further organic development in gas drilling which provides an exciting avenue for future growth.\n\nOn the Offshore front, we are actively looking for new contracts for our stacked rigs which are kept ready for rapid redeployment. We continue to seek opportunities and partnership to place our offshore rigs in other markets. This could potentially take some time but we have been tactical in derisking our offshore exposure by keeping a portion of the offshore fleet on lease.\n\nAdditionally, we are continuously exploring acquisition opportunities and developing non-core services to diversify our portfolio and strengthen our market position.\"\n\nHubert Lafeuille, Chief Financial Officer of Arabian Drilling, commented.\n\n\"We have maintained a resilient financial position as we reach the peak of our Unconventional Land Rigs capex program with material investments accelerating to deploy and support our expanded fleet. Although the offshore suspensions will impact our short-term profitability, they do not affect our ability to grow in the long-term and maintain a resilient balance sheet.\n\nOur revenue guidance remains unchanged within the previously announced range, supported by the Unconventional Land Rigs coming online and helping to offset the shortfall from our Offshore operations.\n\nWe are committed to maintain a prudent capital management approach to drive our current investment cycle, together with financial discipline in our day-to-day operations, to provide the flexibility to pursue new opportunities.\"", "source": {"uri": "zawya.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zawya.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAR_supergroup", "type": "wiki", "score":

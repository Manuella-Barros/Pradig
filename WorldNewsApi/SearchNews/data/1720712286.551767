The American singer kicked off the shows at Edinburgh\u2019s Murrayfield Stadium on Friday night (June 7) and has remained there throughout the weekend. She will play her third show tonight (June 9) before moving on to Liverpool for shows at Anfield Stadium next week. On the first night, videos shared online saw huge crowds come to a standstill while they were trying to exit the venue following the end of the gig. Another massive queue formed as hundreds waited for a tram.

Another said it was a 'bottleneck entrance' with everyone trying to cram in. However, other fans described it as \u2018hellish\u2019, with one saying they spent \u00a375 on a Uber in a bid to get out from the crowds. They said: \u201c'It was hellish, the crowd was so big that we were worried we just wouldn\u2019t be able to get home so we had to spend a ridiculous amount of money on Uber.\" Meanwhile, further into town at Haymarket, ScotRail had organised queues for those hoping to get onto later trains to Glasgow Queen Street, Perth, Dunblane and Dundee. However, the times of services were not largely advertised apart from the last train to depart Edinburgh at 12.12am to Glasgow. ScotRail are urging fans to head straight to Haymarket after the concert if they are planning to get a train home. Phil Campbell, ScotRail Customer Operations Director, said: \"It will be fantastic to see so many people travel to Scottish Gas Murrayfield stadium to see Taylor Swift, and ScotRail is delighted to be able to add more seats and extra late-night trains to help fans enjoy the occasion. \u201cWe\u2019re encouraging customers to plan ahead and allow extra time for travel to and from Edinburgh. Buying return tickets in advance on the ScotRail app or website will minimise your need to queue, and help your day run smoothly.\u201d Taylor Swift will perform in Liverpool from June 13-15. She will then head to Cardiff on June 18, followed by three nights at London's Wembley Stadium from June 21-23. She will then finish up this leg of the UK and Ireland tour with three nights at Dublin's Aviva Stadium.", "summary": "&quot;The crowd was so big that we were worried we just wouldn\u2019t be able to get home&quot;", "url": "https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/taylor-swift-fans-trapped-hellish-29321333", "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29321441.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_AMR_MEN_090624_TS.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 13:25:34", "author": "Adam Maidment,Katie Williams", "authors": ["Adam Maidment", "Katie Williams"], "language": "en", "catgory": "entertainment", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.2}

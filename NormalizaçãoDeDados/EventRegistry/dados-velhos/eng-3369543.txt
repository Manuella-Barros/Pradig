There are no good Klansmen.\"\n\nCohen also said the protests in Charlottesville reminded him of Kristallnacht, the riots in which Nazis targeted Jews.\n\n\"It appeared that the Charlottesville protesters were chanting 'Jews will not replace us' and 'blood and soil,' an infamous Nazi slogan, as they marched with torches and conjured up images of Klan rallies,\" he said. \"None of the marchers spewing such verbiage could be considered 'very fine people' as the president suggested.\"\n\nHe noted that at least one white nationalist protester had verbally attacked Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and adviser. Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, are Jewish.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2x7sBbI", "id": "9731324", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Democratic lawmaker to file

There are no good Klansmen,\" he added.\n\nMr Cohen, a Tennessee liberal, is the highest ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice. His declaration that he will try to get Mr Trump removed from office follows a similar effort by Democratic Congressman Brad Sherman.\n\nMr Sherman in July introduced his own articles of impeachment against Mr Trump, asserting that the President obstructed justice during a federal investigation into Trump campaign advisers' alleged ties to Russia.\n\nDemocrats have quietly been discussing the possibility of impeaching Mr Trump for months, but party leaders have discouraged the talk.\n\n\"If you are talking about impeachment, you are talking about what are the facts. Not that I don't like him and I don't like his hair and -- what are the facts?\" House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said in May. \"What are the facts that you would make a case on? What are the rules that he may have violated? If you don't have that case you are just participating in more hearsay.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr Cohen suggested that he felt morally and legally obligated to introduce articles of impeachment.\n\n\"As a Jew and as an American and as a representative of an African American district, I am revolted by the fact that the President of the United States couldn't stand up and unequivocally condemn Nazis who want to kill Jews and whose predecessors murdered 6 million Jews during the Holocaust, and could not unequivocally condemn Klansmen whose organization is dedicated to terrorizing African Americans,\" Mr Cohen said.\n\n\"No moral president would ever shy away from outright condemning hate, intolerance and bigotry.\"\n\nA new poll by the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) shows that 40 per cent of Americans - including almost 75 per cent of Democrats and seven per cent of Republicans - back impeaching the President and removing him from office. This is a big jump from the 30 per cent of Americans who supported the idea in February, according to NBC News.", "id": "9737129", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Democrat to introduce

The Democrats last month launched a 2018 messaging agenda that doesn't mention Trump at all.\n\nBut last weekend's violent marches in Charlottesville have sparked new levels of Democratic outrage against the president, whose initial response was to blame \"many sides\" for the bloodshed in Virginia; he has now doubled down on that contention. Speaking Tuesday from Trump Tower in New York City, the president condemned the \"egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence\" of groups like neo-Nazis, but also accused the counterprotesters -- the \"alt-left,\" by his term -- of being \"very, very violent\" and contributing to the tragic events.\n\n[...]\n\nThe Democrats have pounded Trump relentlessly over his response, and at least two House lawmakers -- Reps. Gwen Moore (D-Wis.) and Jackie Spier (D-Calif.) -- have called this week for his removal from office. Speier, in doing so, invoked the 25th Amendment, which outlines Congress's impeachment powers, but stopped short of announcing plans to introduce her own articles of impeachment.\n\nCohen has been talking about potential impeachment since mid-May when he said, \"My belly says go forward with impeachment, but my brain says wait until... facts are more developed.\"\n\n.@RepCohen on Trump: \"My belly says go forward with impeachment, but my brain says wait until... facts are more developed.\" @LocalMemphis pic.twitter.com/JBzZ3hYSaF\n\n-- Drew Petrimoulx (@DrewPetrimoulx) May 17, 2017\n\nCohen introduced a resolution of \"no confidence\" in Trump last month because he believed the president had been exhibiting \"offensive behavior\" and had \"taken the unprecedented action in the modern era of refusing to release his tax returns.\"\n\nHe said Thursday that Trump's response to the Charlottesville violence left him no choice but to push for him to be impeached, according to the Hill.\n\n\"As a Jew and as an American and as a representative of an African American district, I am revolted by the fact that the president of the United States couldn't stand up and unequivocally condemn Nazis who want to kill Jews and whose predecessors murdered 6 million Jews during the Holocaust, and could not unequivocally condemn Klansmen whose organization is dedicated to terrorizing African Americans,\" Cohen said.\"No moral president would ever shy away from outright condemning hate, intolerance, and bigotry.\"", "id": "9764516", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17",

Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) announced Thursday that he is introducing articles of impeachment against the president, saying Trump \"has failed the presidential test of moral leadership.\"\n\nCohen had already expressed that he had no confidence in the president, when he introduced the Resolution of No Confidence last month.\n\n\"I have expressed great concerns about President Trump's ability to lead our country in the Resolution of No Confidence (H.Res. 456) that I introduced in July with 29 of my colleagues; however, after the President's comments on Saturday, August 12 and again on Tuesday, August 15 in response to the horrific events in Charlottesville, I believe the President should be impeached and removed from office,\" the congressman said in a statement on his website.\n\n\"Instead of unequivocally condemning hateful actions by neo-Nazis, white nationalists and Klansmen following a national tragedy, the President said 'there were very fine people on both sides.' There are no good Nazis. There are no good Klansmen,\" Cohen said.\n\n\"We fought a World War to defeat Nazis, and a Civil War to defeat the Confederacy. In reaction to the downfall of the Confederacy, and the subsequent passage of the Reconstruction Amendments to our constitution, the KKK embarked on a dastardly campaign to terrorize and intimidate African Americans from exercising their newly acquired civil rights,\" he said.\n\n\"Subsequent incarnations of the Klan continued to terrorize African Americans with lynchings and civil rights murders such as the assassination of Medgar Evers and the killings of Schwerner, Chaney, Goodman and other civil rights workers,\" Cohen added.\n\nAs CNSNews.com previously reported, Trump said Tuesday that both sides in Charlottesville were violent and that not all the people protesting were white supremacists - some were just there to protest the taking down of the Robert E. Lee statue.\n\n\"I will tell you something. I watched those very closely -- much more closely than you people watched it, and you have -- you had a group on one side that was bad, and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent, and nobody wants to say that, but I'll say it right now,\" he said.\n\nWhen asked whether he thinks what he called the alt-left is the same as neo-Nazis, Trump said, \"Those people -- all of those people --excuse me, I've condemned neo-Nazis. I've condemned many different groups, but not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me. Not all of those people were white supremacists by any stretch. Those people were also there because they wanted to protest the taking down of a statue of Robert E. Lee.\"\n\nCohen, who is Jewish, said the protests by neo-Nazis and white supremacists in last weekend reminded him of Ku Klux Klan rallies and of Kristallnacht, also referred to as \"the Night of Broken Glass,\" when Nazis torched synagogues, vandalized Jewish homes, schools, and businesses, and killed close to 100 Jews. In the aftermath of Kristallnacht, 30,000 Jewish men were arrested and sent to concentration camps.\n\n\"When I watched the videos from the protests in Charlottesville, it reminded me of the videos I've seen of Kristallnacht in 1938 in Nazi Germany. It appeared that the Charlottesville protesters were chanting 'Jews will not replace us' and 'blood and soil,' an infamous Nazi slogan, as they marched with torches that conjured up images of Klan rallies,\" Cohen said.\n\n\"None of the marchers spewing such verbiage could be considered 'very fine people' as the President suggested. And it certainly appeared the participants were in lock-step,\" he said. \"Some of the white nationalist protesters were interviewed by the media, such as Sean Patrick Nielsen. He said one of his three reasons for being there was 'killing Jews.'\n\n\"Another was Christopher Cantwell, one of the white nationalist leaders, who said he couldn't watch 'that Kushner bastard walk around with that beautiful girl' and said he hoped 'somebody like Donald Trump, but who does not give his daughter to a Jew,' would lead this country,\" Cohen said.\n\nCantwell was referring to the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner and Trump's daughter, Ivanka, who converted to Judaism.\n\n\"As a Jew and as an American and as a representative of an African American district, I am revolted by the fact that the President of the United States couldn't stand up and unequivocally condemn Nazis who want to kill Jews and whose predecessors murdered 6 million Jews during the Holocaust, and could not unequivocally condemn Klansmen whose organization is dedicated to terrorizing African Americans,\" Cohen said.\n\n\"President Trump has failed the presidential test of moral leadership. No moral president would ever shy away from outright condemning hate, intolerance and bigotry. No moral president would ever question the values of Americans protesting in opposition of such actions, one of whom was murdered by one of the white nationalists,\" he said.\n\n\"President Trump has shown time and time again that he lacks the ethical and moral rectitude to be President of the United States. Not only has he potentially obstructed justice and potentially violated the Constitution's Foreign Emoluments Clause, but he has also shown that he is incapable or unwilling to protect Americans from enemies, foreign and domestic,\" Cohen said.\n\n\"Neo-Nazis and the KKK are domestic terrorists. If the President can't recognize the difference between these domestic terrorists and the people who oppose their anti-American attitudes, then he cannot defend us,\" he said.", "id": "9745263",

Lee, one of the counter-protesters, 32-year-old Heather Heyer, was killed as were two police officers and 33 more people were injured in the violence -- which included a white supremacist plowing a car into a crowd of counter-protesters.\n\nBut Trump gave two statements in which he blamed \"both sides\" for the violence, and in his initial statement on Saturday as the violence continued to play out, Trump reportedly refused to single out the neo-Nazis and white supremacists for specific condemnation. In a press conference on Tuesday, Trump repeated his \"both sides\" claim, adding that there were \"very fine people\" among both the ultra-right wing demonstrators and the counter-protesters, whom Trump labeled \"the alt-left.\"\n\nTennessee Representative Steve Cohen, 68, announced on Thursday that he would now introduce articles of impeachment against Trump because, with his refusal to categorically condemn the white supremacists and insistence on holding counter-protesters equally responsible for the violence, Trump had \"failed the test of moral leadership.\"\n\n\"Not only has (Trump) potentially obstructed justice and potentially violated the Constitution's Foreign Emoluments Clause,\" Cohen said in a statement, \"but he has also shown that he is incapable or unwilling to protect Americans from enemies, foreign and domestic. Neo-Nazis and the KKK are domestic terrorists. It is morally and legally incumbent upon me, based on my oath of office, to introduce articles of impeachment.\"\n\nOn July 12, Democrats Brad Sherman of California and Al Green of Texas introduced their own articles of impeachment against Trump. Sherman and Green focused on an \"obstruction of justice\" accusation against Trump as the basis to impeach him. The charge stems from Trump's May 9 firing of then FBI Director James Comey, who according to Trump's own statements was dismissed in order to relieve \"pressure\" on Trump from the FBI's investigation of Trump's ties to Russia -- and possible collusion with Russia as Russian intelligence services staged cyber-attacks against Democrats in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nWatch Cohen discuss his proposed articles of impeachment in the following video.\n\nAccording to a poll released on Thursday by the Public Religion Research Institute, 40 percent of Americans now favor impeaching Trump -- a jump of 10 percent since February, shortly after Trump took office.\n\nHowever, only 7 percent of Republicans favor impeachment, according to the poll, as opposed to a whopping 72 percent of Democrats. Among Americans who label themselves \"independents,\" 38 percent now support the impeachment of Donald Trump. But all three blocs showed an increase in those supporting impeachment since the February survey. Even among Republicans, support for impeachment jumped three points, while Democrats were at 58 percent in favor back in February.\n\nAfter comments on #Charlottesville, I'll be introducing Articles of #Impeachment against #Trump. No good Nazis or Klansmen! #ImpeachTrump pic.twitter.com/x6pWL35evL\n\n-- Steve Cohen (@RepCohen) August 17, 2017\n\nCohen is a ranking member of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice, making him the highest ranking Democrat so far to openly call for Trump's impeachment.\n\n\"As a Jew and as an American and as a representative of an African American district, I am revolted by the fact that the President of the United States couldn't stand up and unequivocally condemn Nazis who want to kill Jews and whose predecessors murdered 6 million Jews during the Holocaust, and could not unequivocally condemn Klansmen whose organization is dedicated to terrorizing African Americans,\" Cohen said on Thursday.", "id": "9769310", "details": {}, "date":

Brad Sherman of California and Al Green of Texas jointly announced that they would file articles of impeachment against Trump, accusing the president of obstruction of justice for his firing of former FBI Director James Comey, Politico reports.\n\nOn Aug. 17, a survey conducted by the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) found that 40 percent of national adults supported a Trump impeachment, NBC News reports.\n\nThe PRRI poll found that 38 percent of overall respondents were favorable toward Trump while 56 percent were unfavorable. And 72 percent of Democratic respondents supported impeaching the president while only 7 percent of Republicans agreed.", "id": "9830033", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "House Democrat

Two state troopers monitoring the rally also died in a helicopter crash.\n\nTrump initially blamed \"many sides\" for hatred and bigotry on Saturday, but eventually condemned white supremacist groups specifically after facing intense backlash. However, on Tuesday, he defended rally participants and accused counterprotesters -- whom he referred to as the \"alt-left\" -- of also acting violently. He's since aligned himself further with rally participants by decrying the removal of Confederate monuments.\n\n\"None of the marchers spewing such verbiage could be considered 'very fine people' as the President suggested,\" Cohen continued. \"No moral president would ever shy away from outright condemning hate, intolerance and bigotry.\"\n\nCohen, ranking member of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice, isn't the first member of Congress to push for impeachment.\n\nPresident Trump has failed the presidential test of moral leadership.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) have floated the idea in recent months.\n\nRep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.) filed the first article of impeachment against Trump in June after following former FBI Director James Comey's explosive testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n\n\"I believe that Trump's use of threats to obstruct the ongoing criminal investigations of Michael Flynn clearly violate 18 U.S.C. 1512(b)(3); Violations of that section are a felony,\" Sherman said in a statement. \"Trump's efforts to obstruct the investigation of his campaign's possible collusion with Russia violated the same statute.\"\n\nDespite mounting Democratic interest, impeachment is a complicated process that requires the support of a majority of members of the House of Representatives. No GOP members have publicly floated impeachment, though lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have begun to express concern over whether Trump is fit to lead in recent weeks.\n\n\"Neo-Nazis and the KKK are domestic terrorists,\" Cohen said. \"If the [Trump] can't recognize the difference between these domestic terrorists and the people who oppose their anti-American attitudes, then he cannot defend us.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on HuffPost.", "id": "9773804", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Congressman Moves To Impeach Donald Trump, Says No Such Thing As 'Good Nazis'", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5.eeXngWcw.AP75_Ok0rRg--/aD0xODY1O3c9MzMzMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/the_huffington_post_584/7a9b10bfaacf15edbb5877181b01f38e", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 868, "date": "2017-08-17", "amb": false, "textEnd": 883}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 1, "id": "191", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "197456", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "200134", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "227084", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "242094", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}, "id": "302677", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nazism"}, "id": "302813", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Crime"}, "id": "302901", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}, "id": "302944", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Impeachment"}, "id": "303340", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment"}, {"label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}, "id": "304050", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}, "id": "304323", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives"}, {"label": {"eng": "Steve Cohen"}, "id": "304998", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Cohen"}, {"label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}, "id": "305262", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism"}, {"label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}, "id": "305969", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Felony"}, "id": "308455", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony"}, {"label": {"eng": "Elizabeth Warren"}, "id": "310108", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Warren"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bigotry"}, "id": "310173", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigotry"}, {"label": {"eng": "Aisle"}, "id": "310381", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aisle"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rallying"}, "id": "315718", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rallying"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ku Klux Klan"}, "id": "318256", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan"}, {"label": {"eng": "Michael F.

He doesn't understand America, he doesn't understand his job as President. He's morally, ethically and intellectually incapable of being president of the United State of America.\"\n\nCohen said Trump should be impeached for not unequivocally condemning actions by neo-Nazis, white nationalists, and Klansmen after a national tragedy.\n\n\"Instead of unequivocally condemning hateful actions by neo-Nazis, white nationalists and Klansmen following a national tragedy, the President said 'there were very fine people on both sides.' There are no good Nazis.

He said if half of the Congress votes to impeach and 66 percent of the Senate votes to convict, the President could be impeached for jaywalking.\n\nDespite his vigor, Cohen admits it's currently an uphill battle to get the votes required to impeach Trump.\n\nHowever, Cohen said he believes the tide is turning against Trump and those who defend his actions. He said he expects Democrats to win some Congressional seats in the next election.\n\n\"If we [Democrats] get a majority, impeachment will be a front line issue in 2019. If we don't get a majority, but make major gains, the Republicans will see the writing on the wall for 2020 and they will initiate impeachment to get Trump out, put Pence in, and hopefully save their rear ends,\" Cohen said.\n\nOne Tennessee Republican condemned Trump on Thursday by saying he had not shown that he \"understands what has made this nation great.\"\n\nAs for the Confederate monuments in Memphis, Cohen supports removing the monuments. He said Mayor Jim Strickland and City Council both approved removing the monuments. However, the law gives the final say of moving Memphis' Confederate monuments to a board. Cohen said since Governor Bill Haslam appoints the members of that board, he is to blame for the monuments still being up.\n\nCohen said Haslam should go to the board and get them to vote in favor of removing the monuments.\n\nCohen's full statement on the release of articles of impeachment is below:", "id": "9781030", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "TN Congressman proposes

Instead of unequivocally condemning hateful actions by neo-Nazis, white nationalists and Klansmen following a national tragedy, the President said 'there were very fine people on both sides.' There are no good Nazis. There are no good Klansmen.\"\n\n\"We fought a World War to defeat Nazis, and a Civil War to defeat the Confederacy. In reaction to the downfall of the Confederacy, and the subsequent passage of the Reconstruction Amendments to our constitution, the KKK embarked on a dastardly campaign to terrorize and intimidate African Americans from exercising their newly acquired civil rights. Subsequent incarnations of the Klan continued to terrorize African Americans with lynchings and civil rights murders such as the assassination of Medgar Evers and the killings of Schwerner, Chaney, Goodman and other civil rights workers.\"\n\n\"When I watched the videos from the protests in Charlottesville, it reminded me of the videos I've seen of Kristallnacht in 1938 in Nazi Germany. It appeared that the Charlottesville protesters were chanting 'Jews will not replace us' and 'blood and soil,' an infamous Nazi slogan, as they marched with torches that conjured up images of Klan rallies. None of the marchers spewing such verbiage could be considered 'very fine people' as the President suggested.\n\nAnd it certainly appeared the participants were in lock-step. Some of the white nationalist protesters were interviewed by the media, such as Sean Patrick Nielsen. He said one of his three reasons for being there was 'killing Jews.' Another was Christopher Cantwell, one of the white nationalist leaders, who said he couldn't watch 'that Kushner bastard walk around with that beautiful girl' and said he hoped 'somebody like Donald Trump, but who does not give his daughter to a Jew,' would lead this country\n\nAs a Jew and as an American and as a representative of an African American district, I am revolted by the fact that the President of the United States couldn't stand up and unequivocally condemn Nazis who want to kill Jews and whose predecessors murdered 6 million Jews during the Holocaust, and could not unequivocally condemn Klansmen whose organization is dedicated to terrorizing African Americans.\n\n\"President Trump has failed the presidential test of moral leadership. No moral president would ever shy away from outright condemning hate, intolerance and bigotry. No moral president would ever question the values of Americans protesting in opposition of such actions, one of whom was murdered by one of the white nationalists\n\nSenator John McCain rightfully tweeted this week that there was 'no moral equivalency between racists and Americans standing up to defy hate.' Senator Marco Rubio tweeted, \"Very important for the nation to hear @potus describe events in #Charlottesville for what they are, a terror attack by #whitesupremacists.\"\n\nPresident Trump has shown time and time again that he lacks the ethical and moral rectitude to be President of the United States. Not only has he potentially obstructed justice and potentially violated the Constitution's Foreign Emoluments Clause, but he has also shown that he is incapable or unwilling to protect Americans from enemies, foreign and domestic. Neo-Nazis and the KKK are domestic terrorists. If the President can't recognize the difference between these domestic terrorists and the people who oppose their anti-American attitudes, then he cannot defend us.\"\n\nMartin Niem\u00f6ller, a prominent Protestant pastor who was an outspoken critic of Adolph Hitler, said:\n\nFirst they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out --\n\nBecause I was not a Socialist.\n\nThen they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out --\n\nBecause I was not a Trade Unionist.\n\nThen they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out --\n\nBecause I was not a Jew.\n\nThen they came for me -- and there was no one left to speak for me.\n\n\"They have come for me, and for the majority of my Congressional constituency. Accordingly, I must speak out today after what happened on Saturday and our President's subsequent response. It is morally and legally incumbent upon me, based on my oath of office, to introduce articles of impeachment.\"", "id": "9710670", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Cohen to Introduce

As a chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Tennessee plays a key role in shaping US' foreign policy.\n\n\"We should hope that (Trump) aspires that he does some self-reflection, that he does what is necessary to demonstrate stability, to demonstrate competence, to demonstrate that he understands the character of our nation and works daily to bring out the best of the people in our nation,\" Corker said.\n\nDemocratic Congressman Anthony G Brown said that Trump is unfit for office. \"Donald Trump is unfit for office. His despicable actions this week have confirmed that he lacks the moral fortitude to be the leader of the free world and simply cannot be trusted to preserve, protect and defend our Constitution against all threats, foreign and domestic. I will vote in favour of censure, and call on Congressional Republicans to take meaningful action to rein in this Administration,\" he said.\n\nBrown said that Trump's response to the savage actions of white supremacists and extremists in Charlottesville and his convoluted and distorted rationalisation of the murder of Heather Heyer, is \"shameful and unbecoming of the president of the US\".\n\n\"He lacks a basic understanding of and appreciation for our nation's values, as well as of the history of the struggles and sacrifices that have been made by generations of Americans to perfect our imperfect nation,\" he said.\n\nTrump, just completing seven months in the White House, is under fire for his response to Saturday's clashes between far-right and counter-protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, in which he blamed \"both sides\" for the violence.\n\nThe rally was in protest at the removal of a statue of Robert E Lee, a general who fought for the pro-slavery Confederacy during the US Civil War.\n\nIn a related development, Congressman Steve Cohen, Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice, announced that he will be introducing articles of impeachment against President Trump following his controversial comments about the racist violence in Virginia.\n\n\"I have expressed great concerns about President Trump's ability to lead our country in the Resolution of No Confidence that I introduced in July with 29 of my colleagues; however, after the president's comments on Saturday and again on Tuesday in response to the horrific events in Charlottesville, I believe the president should be impeached and removed from office,\" Cohen said.\n\n\"Instead of unequivocally condemning hateful actions by neo-Nazis, white nationalists and Klansmen following a national tragedy, the president said there were very fine people on both sides. There are no good Nazis. There are no good Klansmen,\" he said in a statement.\n\nCohen is the third Democratic lawmaker to file articles of impeachment against Trump. The other two being Al Green and Brad Sherman. Meanwhile Tony Schwartz, co-author of the 1987\n\nbestselling 'Art of the Deal' predicted that Trump will soon resign from presidency.\n\n\"The circle is closing at blinding speed. Trump is going to resign and declare victory before Mueller and congress leave him no choice,\" he said in a tweet.\n\n\"Trump must be isolated. Resistance every day. The end is near but must keep pressure high,\" tweeted Schwartz, who had made similar prediction in May during controversy over firing of FBI Director Robert Mueller.", "id": "9877044", "details": {},

Steve Cohen thinks President Trump's comments about the violence is Charlottesville are enough to get the president removed from office.\n\n\"President Trump has failed the presidential test of moral leadership. No president would ever shy away from outright condemning hate, intolerance and bigotry. No moral president would ever question the values of Americans protesting in opposition of such actions, one of whom was murdered by one of the white nationalists,\" the Tennessee Democrat in a statement.\n\n\"President Trump has shown time and time again that he lacks the ethical and moral rectitude to be President of the United States. Not only has he potentially obstructed justice and potentially violated the Constitution's Foreign Emoluments Clause, but he has also shown that he is incapable or unwilling to protect Americans from enemies, foreign and domestic. Neo-Nazis and the KKK are domestic terrorists. If the President can't recognize the difference between these domestic terrorists and the people who oppose their anti-American attitudes, then he cannot defend us.\"\n\nOn Monday President Trump specifically denounced white nationalist groups involved in Saturday's violence, seeking to clarify comments he made over the weekend. But a day later during remarks to reporters at Trump Tower, the president said there were \"very fine people on both sides.\"\n\n\"You have some very bad people in that group, but you also had people that were very fine people on both sides,\" he said. \"You had people in that group -- excuse me, excuse me -- I saw the same pictures as you did. You had people in that group that were there to protest the taking down of, to them, a very, very important statue and the renaming of a park from Robert E.

Among those on the list were U.S. Sens. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Bob Corker of Tennessee and Charles Grassley of Iowa.\n\nIn what appears to be a coordinated effort, the DNC sent out an email alert to Democrats Thursday requesting that they show up this weekend at anti-Trump rallies in cities across the U.S.\n\nIt's apparently part of a strategy to feed off of the anti-Trump energy created in the media post-Charlottesville with the destruction and removal of Confederate monuments in multiple cities such as Baltimore, Atlanta, Nashville, Durham, North Carolina and San Antonio, Texas.\n\n\"What happened this past weekend in Charlottesville, and Donald Trump's disgraceful actions since, should only motivate us to keep fighting even harder for what is right,\" DNC Chair Tom Perez says in the email. \"Come out this Weekend of Action to an event near you, and say you'll rise and organize with us.\"\n\nThursday's posting by Anonymous comes one day before the so-called Denouncement Day, in which some members of Anonymous are calling on people to gather at Confederate statues in 11 cities and tear them down, reports the Chicago Tribune.\n\nThe goal of the release of personal contact information, said Rob Pfeiffer, chief editor of online publication Anon Journalis, is for people to contact these members of Congress \"to more forcefully condemn the president and call for Trump's impeachment.\"\n\nAnonymous attached a link to a video description of its case against Trump saying \"We are angry.\" The video showed the desecration of the Robert E. Lee Monument on the campus of Duke University earlier this week.\n\nBREAKING NEWS: Anonymous Releases Personal Information of 22 GOP Senators (Link in Video Description) https://t.co/cDWnPsiOe9 #DayToDenounce\n\n-- TheAnonJournal (@TheAnonJournal) August 17, 2017\n\nCalls for impeachment also exploded on Twitter Thursday along with a frenzy of demands for Trump's resignation.\n\nAmong the comparisons to Hitler and Nazism was an ad, going viral on some liberal sites, showing a Trump bobblehead figure trapped inside of a tied condom and the words \"Some people should never have been born.\"\n\nAn \"Impeach Trump Now\" meme was trending on Facebook Thursday, complete with a button to \"donate\" to the cause and another to sign a petition.\n\nCongressman introduces articles of impeachment\n\nDemocrat Congressman Steve Cohen of Tennessee answered the call.\n\nThe ranking member of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice said he planned to introduce articles of impeachment.\n\nCohen cited potential obstruction of justice and violations of the Constitution's Foreign Emoluments Clause as the reasons for impeachment while also addressing his own strong moral opposition to the president's words and actions relating to the violence in Charlottesville over the weekend, CBS News reports.\n\nAfter comments on #Charlottesville, I'll be introducing Articles of #Impeachment against #Trump. No good Nazis or Klansmen! #ImpeachTrump pic.twitter.com/x6pWL35evL\n\n-- Steve Cohen (@RepCohen) August 17, 2017\n\nCohen further elaborated in a statement released by his office:\n\n\"In response to the horrific events in Charlottesville, I believe the President should be impeached and removed from office. Instead of unequivocally condemning hateful actions by neo-Nazis, white nationalists and Klansmen following a national tragedy, the President said 'there were very fine people on both sides.' There are no good Nazis. There are no good Klansmen.\" As a Jew and as an American and as a representative of an African American district, I am revolted by the fact that the President of the United States couldn't stand up and unequivocally condemn Nazis who want to kill Jews and whose predecessors murdered 6 million Jews during the Holocaust, and could not unequivocally condemn Klansmen whose organization is dedicated to terrorizing African Americans.\"\n\nNBC, Newsweek, Reuters, Politico and other establishment media rushed to publish \"news\" in support of the new \"impeach Trump\" campaign. NBC cited a survey by an obscure polling agency that said 40 percent of Americans are in favor of impeaching Trump, a 10-point jump in the last six months.\n\n\"The PRRI survey was conducted August 2-8, before last weekend's white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va. Trump's statement that 'both sides' deserve blame for the resulting violence has prompted criticism from Republicans and Democrats alike,\" NBC stated.\n\nReuters posted a story titled \"Trump's attacks could leave him friendless if impeachment comes.\"\n\nNewsweek chimed in with an article Thursday titled \"Trump is just six Senate votes away from impeachment.\"\n\nThe Newsweek article lays out an entire scenario, which some on the right dismiss as fanciful. It assumes the Democrats will retake control of the House in the mid-term elections, or come close enough to a majority that a handful of Republicans will be interested in joining their scheme to impeach Trump. They would vote to impeach and force a trial in the Senate, where a two-thirds majority is needed to oust the president. The Senate is uncomfortably close to that super majority now, let alone after the mid-terms.\n\n\"Following impeachment in the House, a trial takes place in the Senate. Conviction requires two-thirds of the Senate and by my count there are already twelve [GOP] senators who have shown a willingness to take on the president when they believe he is in the wrong,\" wrote Elaine Kamarck, director of the Center for Effective Public Management at the left-leaning Brookings Institution, for Newsweek.\n\nHer list of potential Republican pro-impeachment votes in the Senate starts with Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham and includes Susan Collins, R-Maine; Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska; Mike Lee, R-Utah; Dean Heller, R-Nev.; Rob Portman, R-Ohio; Shelley Moore Capito, R- W.Va.; and Rand Paul, R-Ky.\n\nThe foreign press was equally excited about the prospects. The U.K.-based Telegraph published a story Thursday titled \"Donald Trump latest approval rating and impeachment odds.\"\n\n\"The bookmakers are banking on things getting worse for Trump with the latest odds from Ladbrokes showing that there is a 48 percent chance he will fail to make it to the end of his first term in office,\" the Telegraph declared.\n\nThe U.S. Constitution requires a majority in the House of Representatives to force an impeachment trial and a two-thirds majority in the Senate to remove a president, who must be found guilty at trial of \"high crimes and misdemeanors.\"\n\nSome want more than impeachment\n\nBut for one Democrat state legislator from St. Louis, Missouri, even impeachment was not enough to satisfy her hatred of Trump. Democrat Maria Chappelle-Nadal acknowledged on Thursday that she wrote a post on her personal Facebook page that read: \"I hope Trump is assassinated!\"", "id": "9800451", "details": {}, "date":

AP\n\nCorker's comments gain significance given that once he was considered for vice presidential position by Trump and also for that of the secretary of state after his election.\n\nAs a chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Tennessee plays a key role in shaping US' foreign policy.\n\n\"We should hope that (Trump) aspires that he does some self-reflection, that he does what is necessary to demonstrate stability, to demonstrate competence, to demonstrate that he understands the character of our nation and works daily to bring out the best of the people in our nation,\" Corker said.\n\nDemocratic Congressman Anthony G Brown said that Trump is unfit for office.\n\n\"Donald Trump is unfit for office. His despicable actions this week have confirmed that he lacks the moral fortitude to be the leader of the free world and simply cannot be trusted to preserve, protect and defend our Constitution against all threats, foreign and domestic. I will vote in favour of censure, and call on Congressional Republicans to take meaningful action to rein in this administration,\" he said.\n\nBrown said that Trump's response to the savage actions of white supremacists and extremists in Charlottesville and his convoluted and distorted rationalisation of the murder of Heather Heyer, is \"shameful and unbecoming of the president of the US\".\n\n\"He lacks a basic understanding of and appreciation for our nation's values, as well as of the history of the struggles and sacrifices that have been made by generations of Americans to perfect our imperfect nation,\" he said.\n\nTrump, just completing seven months in the White House, is under fire for his response to Saturday's clashes between far-right and counter-protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, in which he blamed \"both sides\" for the violence.\n\nThe rally was in protest against the removal of a statue of Robert E Lee, a general who fought for the pro-slavery Confederacy during the US Civil War.\n\nIn a related development, Congressman Steve Cohen, Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice, announced that he will be introducing articles of impeachment against President Trump following his controversial comments about the racist violence in Virginia.\n\n\"I have expressed great concerns about President Trump's ability to lead our country in the Resolution of No Confidence that I introduced in July with 29 of my colleagues; however, after the president's comments on Saturday and again on Tuesday in response to the horrific events in Charlottesville, I believe the president should be impeached and removed from office,\" Cohen said.\n\n\"Instead of unequivocally condemning hateful actions by neo-Nazis, white nationalists and Klansmen following a national tragedy, the president said there were very fine people on both sides. There are no good Nazis. There are no good Klansmen,\" he said in a statement.\n\nCohen is the third Democratic lawmaker to file articles of impeachment against Trump. The other two being Al Green and Brad Sherman.\n\nMeanwhile Tony Schwartz, co-author of the 1987 bestselling 'Art of the Deal' predicted that Trump will soon resign from presidency.\n\n\"The circle is closing at blinding speed. Trump is going to resign and declare victory before Mueller and Congress leave him no choice,\" he said in a tweet.\n\n\"Trump must be isolated. Resistance every day. The end is near but must keep pressure high,\" tweeted Schwartz, who had made similar prediction in May during controversy over firing of FBI director James Comey.\n\nPublished Date: Aug 18, 2017

Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he fears the nation will be in peril unless Trump makes radical changes at the White House. \"The president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to demonstrate in order to be successful,\" Corker told reporters after a townhall in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Corker's remains gains significance given that once he was considered for vice presidential position by Trump and also for that of the secretary of state after his elections. As a chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Tennessee plays a key role in shaping US' foreign policy.\n\n\"We should hope that (Trump) aspires that he does some self-reflection, that he does what is necessary to demonstrate stability, to demonstrate competence, to demonstrate that he understands the character of our nation and works daily to bring out the best of the people in our nation,\" Corker said. Democratic Congressman Anthony G Brown said that Trump is unfit for office. \"Donald Trump is unfit for office. His despicable actions this week have confirmed that he lacks the moral fortitude to be the leader of the free world and simply cannot be trusted to preserve, protect and defend our Constitution against all threats, foreign and domestic. I will vote in favour of censure, and call on Congressional Republicans to take meaningful action to rein in this Administration,\" he said. Brown said that Trump's response to the savage actions of white supremacists and extremists in Charlottesville and his convoluted and distorted rationalisation of the murder of Heather Heyer, is \"shameful and unbecoming of the president of the US\". \"He lacks a basic understanding of and appreciation for our nation's values, as well as of the history of the struggles and sacrifices that have been made by generations of Americans to perfect our imperfect nation,\" he said.\n\nTrump, just completing seven months in the White House, is under fire for his response to Saturday's clashes between far-right and counter-protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, in which he blamed \"both sides\" for the violence. The rally was in protest at the removal of a statue of Robert E Lee, a general who fought for the pro-slavery Confederacy during the US Civil War. In a related development, Congressman Steve Cohen, Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice, announced that he will be introducing articles of impeachment against President Trump following his controversial comments about the racist violence in Virginia. \"I have expressed great concerns about President Trump's ability to lead our country in the Resolution of No Confidence that I introduced in July with 29 of my colleagues; however, after the president's comments on Saturday and again on Tuesday in response to the horrific events in Charlottesville, I believe the president should be impeached and removed from office,\" Cohen said. \"Instead of unequivocally condemning hateful actions by neo-Nazis, white nationalists and Klansmen following a national tragedy, the president said there were very fine people on both sides. There are no good Nazis. There are no good Klansmen,\" he said in a statement. Cohen is the third Democratic lawmaker to file articles of impeachment against Trump. The other two being Al Green and Brad Sherman.\n\nMeanwhile Tony Schwartz, co-author of the 1987 bestselling 'Art of the Deal' predicted that Trump will soon resign from presidency. \"The circle is closing at blinding speed. Trump is going to resign and declare victory before Mueller and congress leave him no choice,\" he said in a tweet. \"Trump must be isolated. Resistance every day. The end is near but must keep pressure high,\" tweeted Schwartz, who had made similar prediction in May during controversy over firing of FBI Director Robert Mueller.", "id": "9830645", "details": {},

His despicable actions this week have confirmed that he lacks the moral fortitude to be the leader of the free world and simply cannot be trusted to preserve, protect and defend our Constitution against all threats, foreign and domestic. I will vote in favour of censure, and call on Congressional Republicans to take meaningful action to rein in this Administration,\" he said.\n\nBrown said that Trump's response to the savage actions of white supremacists and extremists in Charlottesville and his convoluted and distorted rationalisation of the murder of Heather Heyer, is \"shameful and unbecoming of the president of the US\".\n\n\"He lacks a basic understanding of and appreciation for our nation's values, as well as of the history of the struggles and sacrifices that have been made by generations of Americans to perfect our imperfect nation,\" he said.\n\nTrump, just completing seven months in the White House, is under fire for his response to Saturday's clashes between far-right and counter-protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, in which he blamed \"both sides\" for the violence.\n\nThe rally was in protest at the removal of a statue of Robert E Lee, a general who fought for the pro-slavery Confederacy during the US Civil War.\n\nIn a related development, Congressman Steve Cohen, Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice, announced that he will be introducing articles of impeachment against President Trump following his controversial comments about the racist violence in Virginia.\n\n\"I have expressed great concerns about President Trump's ability to lead our country in the Resolution of No Confidence that I introduced in July with 29 of my colleagues; however, after the president's comments on Saturday and again on Tuesday in response to the horrific events in Charlottesville, I believe the president should be impeached and removed from office,\" Cohen said.\n\n\"Instead of unequivocally condemning hateful actions by neo-Nazis, white nationalists and Klansmen following a national tragedy, the president said there were very fine people on both sides. There are no good Nazis. There are no good Klansmen,\" he said in a statement.\n\nCohen is the third Democratic lawmaker to file articles of impeachment against Trump. The other two being Al Green and Brad Sherman.\n\nMeanwhile Tony Schwartz, co-author of the 1987 bestselling 'Art of the Deal' predicted that Trump will soon resign from presidency.\n\n\"The circle is closing at blinding speed. Trump is going to resign and declare victory before Mueller and congress leave him no choice,\" he said in a tweet.\n\n\"Trump must be isolated. Resistance every day. The end is near but must keep pressure high,\" tweeted Schwartz, who had made similar prediction in May during controversy over firing of FBI Director Robert Mueller", "id": "9830169", "details": {},

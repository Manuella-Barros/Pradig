It just wasn't enough.\n\nIn their final game of the Las Vegas Summer League tournament, the Cavs squandered a fourth-quarter lead, losing to the high-profile Los Angeles Lakers, 93-89, on Thursday night. There's one game left in Vegas -- a basically meaningless matchup in the consolation round that features all 26 teams that don't make the four-team playoff. The Cavs went just 1-3 in tourney play.\n\nFor the first week of summer league, Cleveland was in the smaller gym, away from the Vegas spotlight. Not Thursday. It needed a bigger stage. Because Bronny James and the Lakers were on the other side.\n\nLeBron's oldest son has received plenty of attention since being selected No. 55 overall in the 2024 NBA Draft. On Thursday night, fans inside Thomas and Mack Center roared each time James splashed a jumper, including a clutch triple in the final minutes. They ooh'd and aah'd when he darted toward the rim and flipped in ambidextrous layups. They shouted when the final buzzer sounded on the Lakers' come-from behind victory.\n\nBut for most of the night, Cleveland's first-round rookie was stealing the show.\n\nBronny who?\n\nThe 21-year-old Tyson, chosen 35 picks earlier than James, nearly recorded the first triple-double at Las Vegas Summer League in almost a decade. Tyson finished with a game-high 21 points, 11 rebounds and nine assists in 32 head-turning minutes.\n\nAssistant coach Jordan Ott, who recently joined Kenny Atkinson's staff and is leading the summer Cavs, spoke last week about experimenting with Tyson at point guard -- a chance to tap into his playmaking ability and versatility.\n\nOtt did it Thursday night. Partially out of necessity.\n\nWith steady second-year point guard Craig Porter Jr. unavailable, Tyson was thrust back into a do-everything offensive role, similar to the way he was used as a junior at California. Looking more comfortable than at any other point in the first three games, Tyson sliced the Lakers' defense in pick-and-roll, pushed the ball ahead in transition and tossed lobs to Pete Nance -- the kind of shot creation general manager Mike Gansey boasted about on draft night.\n\n\"The hardest thing to do is get big wings that can kind of do a little bit of everything and play both ways,\" Gansey said on June 26. \"He can just do so many things. He had to do everything for Cal this year. Played one, two and three. He just kind of checks a lot of boxes. We're excited.\"\n\nNot even Tyson's all-around brilliance was enough to get the Cavs a second Vegas triumph, as the Lakers used a 9-0 run over the final few minutes to erase a one-time double-digit deficit and stun Cleveland, which was in front most of the night. Los Angeles' comeback was aided by three consecutive missed 3-pointers off the fingertips of Cavs 2023 second-round pick Emoni Bates.\n\nThe 20-year-old Bates, likely to be on a two-way contract again this season, ended the game with 14 points on an inefficient 4 of 18 from the field and 3 of 12 from beyond the arc.\n\nNance added 16 points. Australian Luke Travers chipped in with eight points in 25 minutes.\n\nLos Angeles was led by first-rounder Dalton Knecht, who poured in six of the Lakers' final nine fourth-quarter points. Knecht finished with 20 points and seven rebounds.\n\nJames had his best game of summer league, tallying 13 points, five rebounds and three assists in 25 minutes. The ballyhooed Bronny sparked the Lakers' 9-0 surge with a cold-blooded step-back triple at the three-minute mark -- the shot that flipped momentum and put a slight damper on Tyson's spectacular performance.\n\nUp next\n\nThe Cavs will play Indiana in the consolation round on Saturday at 5 p.m. ET. The game will air on NBA TV.", "source": {"uri": "cleveland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cleveland"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronny_James", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bronny James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Summer_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Summer League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_&_Mack_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thomas & Mack Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Gansey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Gansey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clutch_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clutch (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Layup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coach_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coach (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Porter_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Porter Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoni_Bates", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emoni Bates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Nance", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pete Nance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-way_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Two-way contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_TV", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Nance", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Larry Nance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pick_and_roll", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pick and roll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Sports", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Spectrangle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Spectrangle", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/v2/65BRCELRMJELVE6SE5D2LIL4RM.jpg?auth=9cb0cd489de98c5fd6191950b3e344130edfebacff46fe8ba18439a83bf4ac15&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9748564", "eventUri": "eng-9748564", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-26", "textStart": 2326, "textEnd": 2333}], "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

The Lakers and Cavs each sit at 1-2.\n\nBoth teams played Wednesday night, with the Lakers defeated the Atlanta Hawks by 1 point while the Cavs fell to Golden State.\n\nKeep scrolling for a look at the latest odds, best prop picks and a prediction for Lakers vs. Cavs.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers vs. Cleveland Cavaliers Odds\n\nThe Cavaliers are favorites for tonight's matchup, sitting at -5.5 at -115 odds. The Cavs are considerable moneyline favorites at -240 while the Lakers sit at +195.\n\nThe Lakers have looked rough this Summer, to say the least. However, Bronny James had a strong game that led LA to a win over Atlanta on Wednesday with Dalton Knecht seemingly shut down for the remainder of Summer League.\n\nThe Over/Under for this matchup has been set at 178.5 on Fanatics. The Cavs are averaging 91 points per game while the Lakers have failed to eclipse 90 in Las Vegas. And being down a top scorer, this game could lean towards the under.\n\nOdds as of July 18. Check out our latest Fanatics Sportsbook Promo Code for more info on an excellent welcome offer.\n\nSummer League Players To Watch\n\nHere's a look at the top players to watch Thursday between the Lakers and Cavaliers.\n\nBronny James\n\nWe've all heard the Bronny James jokes, and we all rolled our eyes a bit when the Lakers selected him at No. 55. And while he struggled to start the Las Vegas Summer League, James had a strong Game 3 against the Atlanta Hawks. Highlights from the game are above.\n\nJames went 5-11 from the field with 12 points and a pair of 3-pointers made, a step in the right direction after failing to eclipse double digits in his previous Summer League outings.\n\nCraig Porter Jr.\n\nPorter has been excellent for Cleveland in Las Vegas. The 2nd year guard out of Wichita State totaled 14 points, 6 rebounds, 3 assists and 4 steals in the Cavs' last outing. He showed off his ability to facilitate against the Bucks with 7 assists.\n\nEmoni Bates\n\nBates is another 2nd-year player that is having a strong Summer League with Cleveland. He's averaging 17 points per game and dropped 20 in Game 1 against the Orlando Magic.\n\nAssuming Bates and Porter take the court tonight, the Cavs have the better 1-2 punch between these 2 teams. It's early, but both look like they can contribute at the NBA level very soon.\n\nKnicks vs. Kings Picks & Predictions\n\nLos Angeles was able to squeak out a win on Wednesday against a bad Hawks team missing their No. 1 overall pick. Without Knecht on the floor I'm just not sure Los Angeles will be able to find enough scoring to keep up with Cleveland.\n\nThe Cavaliers have seen some strong performances from Craig Porter Jr, but also from former Eastern Michigan F Emoni Bates. I like Bates' matchup against Colin Castleton, too.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, I'd lean towards the under hitting in this matchup. Cleveland scored 112 against Milwaukee but has been 85 and under in both other matchups. The Lakers have been even worse offensively, even with Knecht on the floor.", "source": {"uri": "sportsbettingdime.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Betting Dime"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ethan_stone@sportsbettingdime.com", "name": "Ethan Stone", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronny_James", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bronny James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Hawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Hawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoni_Bates", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emoni Bates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Michigan_Eagles_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Michigan Eagles men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wichita_State_Shockers_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wichita State Shockers men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_Magic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orlando Magic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Print_and_Play", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Print and Play", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn.sportsbettingdime.com/app/uploads/media/4/USATSI_23750442.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9748564", "eventUri": "eng-9748564", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-18", "textStart": 1081, "textEnd": 1088}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

A stark contrast to their performance against the Milwaukee Bucks earlier in the week.\n\nThe Cavs fell behind 7-0 and trailed by 16 in the first half. It was an uphill climb from the jump.\n\nCleveland was led by Craig Porter Jr.'s 14 points while Emoni Bates nabbed 13 points and Pete Nance grabbed eight rebounds.\n\nBoth are on two-way contracts and have a lot to play for in these exhibition games. Bates is averaging 17 points per game, while Porter Jr. is averaging 13 points and four assists.\n\nRookie Jaylon Tyson was limited to just four points on six shots with four assists and four first-half turnovers. After posting marks of 15 and 14 points, the No. 20 overall pick from the University of California appeared less comfortable in the flow of the game.\n\nTyson averaged 14.5 points, 7.5 rebounds and 4.0 assists in the team's first two games of the summer.\n\nThe Cavs are averaging 92 points per game on 44.1% shooting. Their defense is allowing 94.3 points per game. Cleveland is allowing its opponents to shoot 35.9% but staying nifty in the passing lanes with an average of 11 steals per game.\n\nWatch Cavs vs. Lakers for free on DirecTV Stream\n\nThe Lakers (1-5) lost all three games of the California Classic and followed up with two losses to the Houston Rockets and the Boston Celtics in the Vegas league. Los Angeles finally entered the win column with a scrappy 87-86 victory over the Atlanta Hawks.\n\nBronny James, son of NBA all-time leading scorer LeBron James, finally broke through with an admirable performance. He notched a career-high 12 points on 5-for-11 shooting along with one rebound and one steal. He also went 2-for-5 from beyond the arc, marking his first 3-pointer of his professional career.\n\nWhile the stats were a nice touch, James hit the game-tying 3-pointer in crunch time, summing up his overall solid performance.\n\nLakers No. 17 overall pick Dalton Knecht, who has impressed this summer, did not play (rest). He is averaging 22 points, including 41.2% from beyond the arc. The Tennessee product is expected to return against the Cavs on the second night of a back-to-back.\n\nIn his absence on Wednesday, Los Angeles received a strong performance from Colin Castleton, who scored 17 points, 12 rebounds and six assists. Blake Hinson added 14 points to help boost the struggling offense. The Castleton-Bates matchup will be an intriguing one to keep an eye on.\n\nThe Lakers are averaging 79.8 points while allowing 92.2 points per game. They are shooting 44.5%, including just 26.4% from beyond the arc.\n\nBoth teams need a win to pull to .500 and salvage their Vegas summer league. Both are coming off games less than 24 hours ago.

Mandatory Credit: Darren Yamashita-USA TODAY Sports / Darren Yamashita-USA TODAY Sports\n\nSummer League is full of intense battles, and fans got one between the Cleveland Cavaliers and Los Angeles Lakers on Thursday evening. The two standouts in this matchup were recent draft picks for both teams, Jaylon Tyson and Bronny James.\n\nBronny has found his groove over the last two games and dropped 12 points, three rebounds, and three ssts while shooting 50 percent (5-for-10) from the floor and 33 percent (1-for-3) from behind the arc against the Cavs.\n\nThis was an impressive all-around performance, but Cleveland's newest guard had the best game of anyone on either team.\n\nTyson finished 21 points, 11 rebounds, and nine assists against the Lakers and shot 66 percent (6-for-9) from the field.\n\nEveryone in Cleveland knew the Cavs got a scorer when he was drafted out of the University of California. However, Tyson's playmaking ability has been a pleasant surprise throughout Summer League, and coming one assist shy of a triple-double in Thursday's game is an encouraging sign of what his role will be during the NBA season.\n\nDespite this impressive performance from Cleveland's first-round pick, the Cavs fell to the Lakers after leading for most of the game. The Cavaliers' lead stretched grew to 12 at the end of the third quarter, but Los Angeles chipped away during the fourth and stole the lead in the final minutes.\n\nThe Cavaliers' next Summer League game is on Saturday (July 20) against the Indiana Pacers.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronny_James", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bronny James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haas_Pavilion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Haas Pavilion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Buffaloes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Buffaloes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Golden_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California Golden Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Berkeley, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkeley, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Religious_and_Inspirational", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Religious and Inspirational", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5599,h_3149,x_0,y_583/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/cavs_insider/01j34f13byt1tcy35gj4.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9748564", "eventUri": "eng-9748564", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-20", "textStart": 1644, "textEnd": 1651}, {"amb": false, "date": "2010-01-", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}], "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

Instead, many of the players who are playing their first NBA minutes are realizing the difficulties of being successful in the league. The Cavs are 1-3 through four games heading into Saturday's consolation contest with the 1-3 Pacers.\n\nIn their latest game, without point guard Craig Porter Jr., Jaylon Tyson was thrust back into a role that saw the ball in his hands for a majority of their loss to Bronny James and the Los Angeles Lakers, which went down to the wire.\n\nTyson isn't unfamiliar with being ball-dominant, as when he was at the University of California, the 6-foot-7, 21-year-old was tasked with learning point guard to increase his opportunities to have the ball in his hands. After a disappointing Game 3 of summer league, Tyson bounced back against the Lakers, nearly recording a triple-double with 21 points, 11 rebounds, and nine assists while shooting 6 of 9 from the field and recording two steals on the defensive end.\n\nThe No. 20 overall pick in the 2024 NBA Draft displayed the ability to run the floor, play defense, create his own shot, and facilitate during this year's summer league.

Here are four players that have stood out so far:\n\nThe Cavaliers' former second-round pick in the 2023 NBA Draft has continued to show signs of growth in his second year with Cleveland. Emoni Bates leads the team in points per game with 17, along with 2.3 three-pointers per game.\n\nComing out of college, Bate's ability to score from all levels made him an intriguing prospect at pick 49 last year. His pull-up jump shot from any spot has been on display all summer, which could be perfect for a Cleveland roster that lacks scorers off the bench.\n\nJaylon Tyson\u00c2 was this year's first-round pick for the Cavaliers and has already shown flashes during the three games in Las Vegas.\n\nThe former California forward is averaging 11 points per game while leading the team in rebounds 6.3 with a night. Tyson was quiet in his last game against the Golden State Warriors, scoring only four points on six attempts from the field, but the potential of being a scoring weapon for the Cavaliers is clearly prevalent.\n\nCraig Porter Jr.'s underdog story continues. From being undrafted in the 2023 NBA Draft to signing with the Cavs and starting in six games last season, Porter Jr. has thrived in the Summer League.\n\nThe 6-foot-2 guard has been the facilitator for the Cavs Summer League Team, averaging 13 points and four assists in three games. His gritty style of play makes him a defensive threat, as he is averaging 2.3 steals and 3.7 defensive rebounds so far in Las Vegas.\n\nWith the development of Porter, he could blossom into viable depth piece to Cleveland's rotation that offers a strong defensive presence.\n\nLuke Travers' rights have belonged with Cleveland since 2022, but he has only been featured with the team during the Summer League. For the past two seasons, the 22-year-old played in the Australian Basketball League, but is slowly making improvement.\n\nThe 6-foot-7 forward is averaging only 19.6 minutes in his two appearances but has made the most of his time.

They opened the game with a 7-0 scoring run that was indicative of how things would play out. The Cleveland Cavaliers put up some resistance to close the first quarter but weren't able to get that going through halftime. They couldn't establish a consistent offense and weren't able to provide much resistance defensively to make it a competitive game. Golden State cruised to an easy 96-85 victory.\n\nThis isn't the Cavs' Summer League team from last season. There is a lack of interior defense and on-ball creation to make a team work. Craig Porter Jr. was supposed to provide some of the on-ball juice to give this team structure. He's provided aggressiveness, but the Cavs needed more than that.\n\nPorter led the team in scoring (14) and shot attempts (16). There was an emphasis on pushing the ball in transition and taking threes. He connected on three of his nine attempts from deep by aggressively hunting his outside shot. This is exactly what you want to see in Summer League considering he was hesitant to shoot at the end of last season.\n\nPorter's issues came in other areas. The feel for the game that we've come to expect wasn't there. He also wasn't able to get downhill and create for others as he shot 2-7 inside the arc and 1-5 near the restricted area with three assists. The aggressiveness seemed to have come at the expense of getting others involved. That said, the others didn't exactly show they deserved more of an opportunity.\n\nLuke Travers displayed some of the concerns that plagued him in previous Summer Leagues and in the NBL. It's difficult to make it as a wing who can't shoot and create off-the-dribble. The soft skills he showed in the win against the Milwaukee Bucks were still present, but those attributes weren't able to overcome his lack of usefulness in the half-court offense. Travers finished two points on 3-9 shooting with two boards and no assists.\n\nEmoni Bates couldn't get anything going on offense as he put up 13 points on 4-11 shooting with no assists. Jaylon Tyson had his most nondescript game of Summer League so far as he registered just four points on six attempts with three helpers. Hunter Cattoor provided 12 points on 4-9 shooting from deep with two steals.\n\nIt's dangerous to make too many sweeping conclusions from Summer League. That's especially true in a lopsided game. All three of the Cavs' summer exhibitions have been decided by double digits.

While it was assumed that void would be filled via trade or free agency, the Cavs also took a shot on Jaylon Tyson in last month's draft with the No. 20 overall pick.\n\nThe 6-foot-6 wing is set to bring positional size to the floor in Cleveland, with a reliable perimeter jumper, self-creation upside and the ability to handle the ball. After three college seasons, the 21-year-old brings experience and a valuable skillset to the Cavs. Even then, it's difficult for any rookie to make a significant impact on a playoff team in year one.\n\nBut Tyson's performance at NBA Summer League thus far lends well to the idea that he could be a real contributor in the upcoming season.\n\nThrough his first few summer league games, Tyson made an immediate impact. He found his footing early and showcased his well-rounded game by doing a little bit of everything on the floor. He didn't have any jaw-dropping stat lines, but his production was consistent and clear.\n\nThen Thursday night's game against the Los Angeles Lakers was Tyson's best yet, nearly notching a triple-double with 21 points, 11 rebounds and nine assists. He was also incredibly efficient given he scored those 21 points on just nine shots from the floor.\n\nWhile he won't be expected to perform at this level every night -- especially in the upcoming season -- it did further prove he's ready to be part of the regular rotation as a rookie.

He had 21 points, 11 rebounds and nine assists and went 6-for-9 from the field and 8-for-9 from the free-throw line. After the contest, the swingman spoke to the media and was asked about his jumper, saying that he feels great.\n\n\"Oh, I feel amazing,\" he said. \"I don't even know when there was questions about it. But I know I can shoot the piss out of the ball. That's all I've ever been. So, I'm super confident in my jump shot.\"\n\nThe University of California, Berkeley product was the Cavs' 20th overall pick in the 2024 NBA Draft. Perhaps the matchup against the Lakers ignited something inside of him, as it gave him the opportunity to know how he stacks up against more high-profile draft classmates such as Dalton Knecht and Bronny James.\n\nTyson showed why Cleveland should look into including him in the rotation once the regular season starts. Not only did he shoot the lights out from the field, which could help space the floor for his teammates, but he also showed an all-around game.\n\nThe Cavs' core players are already set, with Darius Garland, Donovan Mitchell, Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen locked into the starting lineup. But the small forward spot may still be up for grabs. Max Strus seems like it is his to lose, although the coaching staff, led by recent acquisition Kenny Atkinson, could look at other options, such as Caris LeVert.\n\nTyson is unlikely to jump ahead of the other players, although if he continues to hone his craft, particularly on the defensive end of the floor, he could have a chance at cracking the rotation and getting some consideration for a starting spot in the future.\n\nCleveland is coming off an appearance in the Eastern Conference semifinals, where it lost to the Boston Celtics in five games. In the 2023 playoffs, the Cavs reached the playoffs for the first time since 2018 but were eliminated by the New York Knicks in the first round.\n\nThe franchise is likely looking to advance further in the 2024-25 season, but it would need not just its stars but also its role players to step their games up.", "source": {"uri": "cavaliersnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cavaliers Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "orel_dizon@cavaliersnation.com", "name": "Orel Dizon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swingman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swingman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronny_James", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronny James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_shot_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jump shot (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Berkeley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2023 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Strus", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Max Strus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Mobley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Evan Mobley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darius_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Darius Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Atkinson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Atkinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donovan_Mitchell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donovan Mitchell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrett_Allen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jarrett Allen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caris_LeVert", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caris LeVert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition_Shooting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition Shooting", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo_Golf", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo Golf", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Print_and_Play", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Print and Play", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Jumps", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Jumps", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cavaliersnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screen-Shot-2024-07-19-at-4.46.44-PM-e1721432828523.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9748564", "eventUri": "eng-9748564", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

Jaylon Tyson was a steady contributor in his first three outings but nearly notched a triple double in his breakout game.\n\nTyson scored 21 points on just nine field goal attempts -- an efficient shooting night to go with 11 rebounds, 9 assists and 2 steals. He was given ball-handling responsibilities for the first time and responded with immediate results. Tyson generated open looks throughout as his ability to create advantages was fully displayed.\n\nOnly so much can be learned from a single Summer League game but this was as encouraging of a performance as we have seen from anyone on the Cavs roster.\n\nEmoni Bates began the night hot but quickly fizzled out, finishing 4-18 and missing the final three field goals with a chance to take the lead. Bates has struggled to score efficiently throughout his young career and has yet to make a meaningful leap so far in Las Vegas.\n\nThe Cavaliers have allowed Bates to work on his craft through reps in the G-League. There has been an emphasis on playing without the ball and simplifying his shot diet. While Bates has occasionally struck the perfect balance -- tonight was an example of his worst tendencies taking over.\n\nIt's hard not to root for Bates. He's an undeniably gifted shooter and has worked relentlessly to follow the developmental path laid in front of him. With that said, Bates still has a long way to go. Generating clean offense should not be this much of an obstacle for a player competing in his second Summer League. The 20-year-old sharpshooter will remain on everyone's radar but likely spend the upcoming season with the Charge once again.\n\nIt has not been a superb Summer League for Pete Nance. He's been mostly out of position and a step too slow defensively. This, along with his poor finishing in the paint, has made Nance a tough prospect to watch.\n\nNance posted 16 points (7-16 shooting), 3 rebounds and 2 assists in 32 minutes. His paint presence has been absent for a starting center, providing little authority on either end of the floor. He knocked down a pair of triples but ultimately failed to be an effective offensive spark at the end of a close game.\n\nHis intrigue as a potential floor spacer is not so interesting when packaged with the rest of his game. In today's NBA, shooting is no longer a guarantee for success. You need to have numerous other skills -- with a touch of three-point shooting being a non-negotiable for most role players. Nance has a little bit of range but none of the other tools that would be required for him to make the NBA leap.", "source": {"uri": "fearthesword.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fear The Sword"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tony_pesta@fearthesword.com", "name": "Tony Pesta", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_goal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Field goal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Summer_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Summer League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoni_Bates", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emoni Bates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_G_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA G League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Nance", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pete Nance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dj84VQqrDb8hmCJcRlL97cRWSok=/0x992:2752x2368/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25537375/2161984451.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9748564", "eventUri": "eng-9748564", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

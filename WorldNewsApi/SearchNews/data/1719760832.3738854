Barman Alessandro Impagnetiello, 31, admitted to brutally killing his seven-month pregnant girlfriend Giulia Tramontano after she met his British lover. But after brutally killing her, Impagnetiello calmly watched a football match on his phone and then went for a meal with his mum. He told the Court of Milan, in northern Italy, on May 27: \"I was having lunch at my mother's with the body in the car.\" Later, local media reported he attempted to burn and hide her body before taking her passport, bag and cash to make it look like she left him. The court heard that Impagnetiello broke down during police questioning and led officers to where he had hidden Giulia's body. Police said he doused Giulia with rat poison for months in order to bring about a miscarriage after he learned she was pregnant. Police said they found online searches for \"ammonia foetus,\" \"rat poison\" and \"how much rat poison is needed to kill a person\" on the cheat's phone and other devices. He had also bought chloroform under a fake name, and Giulia complained of feeling 'drugged' to friends and family, the court heard. Prosecutors told how Impagnetiello had hacked Giulia to death with a knife while she was taking a bath. The killer told the court: \"I killed Giulia Tramontano but I don't know why. The number of stab wounds will always haunt me. \"The person I was in that period is not the person I am today. This trial is helping me organise my scattered thoughts and confusing pieces. Now, I can reveal the real truth. I had created a web of lies in which I drowned.\" Prosecutors said Impagnetiello decided to kill Giulia when she was contacted by a 23-year-old English woman who had also been seeing him. His second lover was not named in the trial but heart-breaking photos from CCTV footage of their meeting on May 27 last year show the pair hugging as they leave. Just hours after the meeting Giulia died in a frenzied knife attack by Impagnetiello who then burned her body in a bath. He hid her remains in a garage and then in a cellar before dumping them. Impagnetiello admits aggravated voluntary homicide, concealing a body, and non-consensual abortion, reported local media. The case continues.", "summary": "Barman Alessandro Imagnetiello calmly watched a football match on his phone then went to eat lunch with his mum after he killed his girlfriend who was seven-months pregnant with his unborn child", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/man-stabbed-pregnant-girlfriend-37-32916491", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32916693.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_MAIN-stabbed.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:07:08", "author": "Anders Anglesey,Anders-anglesey", "authors": ["Anders Anglesey", "Anders-anglesey"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.013}

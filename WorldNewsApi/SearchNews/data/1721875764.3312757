The Kansas City Chiefs tight end's brother and his family was spotted showing support for Swift and Kelce's romance. The presence of Kelce's relatives in London is a massive nod to how they're embracing his relationship with the chart-topping singer. Jason Kelce shared his thoughts on the unexpected crossover between Swifties and sports fans at Sport Beach 2024 in Cannes, as reported by Vanity Fair.: \"It's been fun for me, I have three little girls, so in some ways, the show and everything that's transpired over the past year, has given reasons for girls to get involved in a sport where previously there wasn't that much interest,\" he said. \"So all of a sudden, dads are hanging out with daughters and there's worlds colliding, and our show gets to be another place where worlds collide, and it's awesome.\" Kylie and Jason were snapped sporting black shirts at Wembley Stadium, with Kelce standing out in a green button-down teamed with a cowboy hat as he made his way to a VIP area. Post an early touchdown at England's iconic soccer venue, Jason hit it off with the fans, scribbling signatures on hats and an Eagles jersey. Not just autographs, though Kelce was dishing out friendship bracelets too, a sweet nod to the spark of romance with Taylor Swift. The NFL hero spilled the beans about romancing the pop icon on the \"New Heights\" podcast he hosts with Jason, revealing his hopeless romantic side after checking out Swifts Eras Tour concert in May 2023. \"I was disappointed that she doesn't talk before or after her shows because she has to save her voice for the 44 songs that she sings,\" said Travis. \"So I was a little... hurt I didn't get to hand her one of the bracelets I made for her..\" Swift and Kelce, the ultimate celebrity coupling, officially stamped their romance timeline around September of the same year. Taylor fast became a familiar face hovering in the lavish stands at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City where her bond with Brittany blossomed. Brittany Mahomes, wife of Travis's teammate Patrick, gave her two million Instagram fans a sneak peek into a trip to Europe, prompting speculation they'd also attend. She shared clips of their kids Sterling and Bronze with the caption: \"Nothing like a 5 a.m. wake up call. [Peace] out America.\" She also uploaded a cute selfie with hubby Patrick after their flight, boasting: \"6.5 hour flight completed... no naps were required\". However, she shared photos in Portugal the next day. There are many theories they could attend a later show as part of the current European leg of the tour. Away from the the field, the friendship between them grew in tandem with Kelce and Mahomes campaign that saw a rocky start morph into a sensational second Super Bowl victory in succession. \"Brittany is thrilled to be building a genuine friendship with Taylor,\" an insider spilled to US Weekly earlier in October 2023. \"They've hung out a couple of times and have grown fairly close in a short period of time. Brittany thinks Taylor is so sweet and down to earth and they get along really great.\" Swift is set to dazzle fans at a packed Wembley Stadium for another two nights, before heading over the Irish Sea for her Dublin shows. She's circling back to London from August 15-20 with Paramore to wrap up the European stretch of her tour.", "summary": "Taylor Swift has received plenty of support from her boyfriend Travis Kelce's family during her three-night run at Wembley Stadium, with the tight end's brother Jason and his wife Kylie joining the couple in London", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/other-sports/american-sports/travis-kelces-family-shows-what-33087327", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/article33087326.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_untitled-design-2024-06-22t023352334.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-23 00:10:25", "author": "Declan Walsh", "authors": ["Declan Walsh"], "language": "en", "catgory": "entertainment", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.427}

{"id": 231288862, "title": "Claims the California Legislature is transparent are bogus", "text": "\u201cTransparency in government is paramount,\u201d said Assemblywoman Gail Pellerin, D-Santa Cruz, proving that hypocrisy in government is clearly the rule in California. As chair of the Committee on Elections and Redistricting, Pellerin praised \u201ctransparency\u201d as she voted to kill a bill that would have banned non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) from the bill-making process. The bill, Assembly Bill 2654, was in response to a report by KCRA\u2019s Ashley Zavala, who broke the news that special interest groups had signed NDAs when secretly negotiating bills that set wages, working hours, and other working conditions at fast food restaurants last year. Pellerin claimed that her opposition to the NDA bill wasn\u2019t based on substance, but rather the limited time legislators had to review it. The bill had been in her committee for just three days and in print for only seven. \u201cThis rushed process, which necessitated an expedited hearing by this committee, prevented this bill from receiving the level of scrutiny and analysis that bills normally receive before being heard,\u201d she said. \u201cIt has also restricted the public\u2019s ability to review and analyze this bill and to provide public comment.\u201d We\u2019d agree with the assemblywoman \u2013 if it weren\u2019t all for show. The Democratic supermajority doesn\u2019t care about the process, transparency or scrutiny when they want something passed \u2013 especially when they don\u2019t want you looking at it too closely. Look no further than the state budget, arguably the most important piece of legislation in any given year, which had its first committee hearing last week. Last Wednesday afternoon, Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas and Senate Pro Tem Mike McGuire announced that the two legislative houses had agreed on a budget proposal. Less than 24 hours later, on Thursday morning, the Assembly Budget Committee took up the budget package. What about the analysis that bills normally receive before being heard? Well, the Department of Finance and the Legislative Analyst Office testified that they had not had time to review the plan. As for the scrutiny? Assemblyman Jesse Gabriel, the chair of the budget committee, and the Democratic chairs of the budget subcommittees went around reading congratulatory statements that offered few specifics. In all, it took about 42 minutes for the committee to \u201cscrutinize\u201d and approve a plan that burns through half the state budget reserve in just one year, and at a time when the LAO is predicting budget shortfalls every year through 2027-2028. But what about the public\u2019s ability to review and analyze this bill and to provide public comment? Well, there was a public comment period \u2013 after the committee had already voted on the package. The vote was 18-4, along party lines. But what we got last week isn\u2019t even the actual budget. It\u2019s the Legislature\u2019s draft budget. The governor has his own draft, too. Now, the substantial provisions of the budget will be negotiated behind closed doors among the two Democratic legislative leaders and Gov. Gavin Newsom. What we get is not a true annual spending plan for the state but a 1,000-page sham full of blanks to be filled in later through hundreds of \u201cbudget trailer bills.\u201d But what about Pellerin\u2019s insistence on \u201ctransparency?\u201d What about the \u201cscrutiny?\u201d What about a proper \u201canalysis?\u201d What about the \u201cpublic\u2019s ability to review\u201d and \u201cprovide comment?\u201d What about the \u201cprocess?\u201d Never mind, apparently. Pellerin voted for the budget package in committee. Under California\u2019s one-party rule anything that remotely looks like good government goes out the window.

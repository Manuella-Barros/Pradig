He is detained! ))) smh (shake my head) free meek (sic).\"\n\nA video of the alleged arrest, the footage originally shared on Instagram Live, has since made its way online. In the video, Mill can be heard telling officers he was coming from a basketball game, to which an unidentified policeman starts asking him about Wednesday's dirt biking.\n\n\"You weren't riding around with a motorcycle yesterday? I got pictures of you, I got videos of running up and down,\" he says.\n\nMill manages to avoid answering the question but tells officers he has the right to be treated with the same respect as anyone else. As the video nears its conclusion, the officer can be overheard saying \"Cuff him up\".\n\nMill was charged with one count of reckless endangerment and was awaiting arraignment at Manhattan Criminal Court late on Thursday night.\n\nHis last post on social media saw him promoting a scheduled appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. The show's Twitter page later uploaded a video of him performing with The Dream.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Recordings", "wgt": 100, "id": 57, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Recordings"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "wgt": 100, "id": 203, "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Media_Production", "wgt": 100, "id": 615, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Media Production"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/AudioVisual", "wgt": 100, "id": 655, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/AudioVisual"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Video", "wgt": 100, "id": 762, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Video"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/Digital_Video", "wgt": 100, "id": 869, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/Digital Video"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Textiles_and_Nonwovens/Resources", "wgt": 100, "id": 987, "label": "dmoz/Business/Textiles and Nonwovens/Resources"}], "concepts": []}

Police tell Page Six that the rapper was riding without a helmet, doing wheelies and putting \"himself and others at great risk of injury.\"\n\nAt this point, Mill has not been officially booked, but TMZ affirms that it is likely he will be by Friday. What makes the arrest even more shocking for fans is that Mill's initial confrontation with the NYPD occurred while he was on Instagram live. An alleged video of the incident has appeared online, which shows the interior roof and the passenger side of a vehicle. Police sirens can also be seen and heard.\n\nMill can heard telling the police that he was coming from a basketball game, while the unidentified officer asks him about about the dirt biking from the previous evening: \"You weren't riding around with a motorcycle yesterday? I got pictures of you, I got videos of running up and down.\" Mill avoids answering the question, but asserts that he wants his rights to be treated with the same respect as anyone else's. Towards the end of the video, the officer can be heard saying \"Cuff him up.\"\n\nWatch above.\n\nAmong the 7,000 viewers who saw Mill's arrest in real time, many have taken to Twitter to discuss another setback in the rapper's tumultuous career with the law.\n\nMost of them believe that Mill being booked over riding a dirt bike is a bit unfair, or as one user put it, \"I don't even like Meek Mill and this s**t is f**ing Bull shit. They arrested him for riding a dirt bike 2 days ago? This is stupid.\" Another fan voiced their concern over seeing Mill get booked yet again: \"My heart was broken watching Meek Mill get arrested on Instagram.\"\n\nOther fans voiced their anger over missing what was surely a shocking moment on Instagram Live. \"The time I don't click on meek mill instagram live something like this happens smh\" wrote one disappointed user, while another tweeted out \"Meek Mill arrested on Instgram Live? Wow man lol.\"\n\nThen of course, there was this completely valid observation:\n\nMill, born Robert Williams, has continued to draw the attention of the law since his release from prison in 2014. This past March, he was arrested for assaulting two pedestrians at an airport in St. Louis, Missouri.

The interaction with police was caught on incident that was caught on Instagram Live.\n\nIn the video, Meek can be heard asking, \"What I do?\"\n\nThe officer responds, \"You weren't riding on a motorcycle yesterday? Yesterday, right? I got pictures of you, I got videos of you running up and down.\"\n\nMeek replies, \"I just came from a basketball game. I just want to know my rights.\"\n\nHe's then asked to get out of the car and the audio gets a little muddled before Meek is heard discussing the situation with whoever else was in the car.\n\nThe incident was provoked by a since-deleted Instagram post Meek made on Wednesday (August 16) that showed him riding bikes and quads through the 34th precinct without a helmet, which reportedly violated traffic laws.\n\nHe is apparently being held at the 34th precinct awaiting his arraignment.\n\nThe Wins & Losses rapper was in town to perform on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon!.\n\nWatch the video of the stop above.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "wgt": 100, "id": 203, "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Amusement_Parks_and_Attractions", "wgt": 100, "id": 364, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Amusement Parks and Attractions"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Vacations_and_Touring", "wgt": 100, "id": 365, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Vacations and Touring"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Regional", "wgt": 100, "id": 732, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Regional"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles", "wgt": 100, "id": 951, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Events", "wgt": 100, "id": 1154, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Events"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218049"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302532", "label": {"eng": "Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302573", "label": {"eng": "Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302616", "label": {"eng": "Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorcycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302904", "label": {"eng": "Motorcycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "303287", "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303315", "label": {"eng": "Automobile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304129", "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arraignment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "304761", "label": {"eng": "Arraignment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-terrain_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "308959", "label": {"eng": "All-terrain vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_motorcycles#Off-road", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "313852", "label": {"eng": "Dirt bike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precinct", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "326609", "label": {"eng": "Precinct"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangerment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "349536", "label": {"eng": "Endangerment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meek_Mill", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "351139", "label": {"eng": "Dreamchasers 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenth_Avenue_(Manhattan)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "364314", "label": {"eng": "Tenth Avenue (Manhattan)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Eugene_Meek", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "528463", "label": {"eng": "Seth Eugene Meek"}}]}

As the video nears its conclusion, the officer can be overheard saying \"Cuff him up\".\n\nMill was charged with one count of reckless endangerment and was awaiting arraignment at Manhattan Criminal Court late on Thursday night.\n\nHis last post on social media saw him promoting a scheduled appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.

Rick Scott shows up at New York City trial to defend Donald Trump", "body": "'It's a crime in this country to use the court system to go after your political opponents,' Scott said. 'What is happening in this courtroom is clearly criminal.'\n\nTALLAHASSEE - Before adult film star Stormy Daniels testified for a second day in former President Donald Trump's hush money cover-up trial in New York City, the Republican presidential contender had a defender Thursday outside the courthouse:\n\nFlorida U.S. Sen. Rick Scott.\n\n\"I'm here because I've known Donald Trump a long time, I knew him before I was governor. I consider him a friend,\" Scott said before a FOX News TV camera. \"What he is going through is just despicable.\"\n\nTrump is barred by a judicial gag order from attacking the prosecutors in the case, but Scott was able to unleash a partisan blast that was immediately aired on the X account of a Trump-allied Super PAC.\n\n\"It's a crime in this country to use the court system to go after your political opponents,\" Scott said. \"What is happening in this courtroom is clearly criminal.\"\n\nRick Scott was early supporter of Trump, still stands by ex-president\n\nScott was a relatively early endorser of Trump in 2016 and has stuck by the president. His allegiance may be more helpful to Scott this year as he runs for a second six-year term in the U.S. Senate.\n\nElected twice as governor and once as a U.S. Senate candidate, Scott has never won by a margin of more than 1.2% of the vote.\n\nA leading Democratic rival, former U.S. Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell of Miami, likened Scott to a \"fan waiting for a selfie.\"\n\n\"Maybe someone should remind Scott that rather than sitting in New York trying to suck up to a defendant found liable for sexual abuse, he should be at work, focusing on lowering costs, securing our border and protecting democracy,\" Mucarsel-Powell said, citing a jury's decision last year awarding columnist E. Jean Carroll $5 million for being sexually abused by Trump during a 1996 encounter.\n\nScott's shortlived run for leader Florida U.S. Sen.

Rick Scott Attends Trump Trial and Calls Prosecutors 'Thugs'", "body": "Florida Republican U.S. Sen. Rick Scott traveled to New York City on Thursday, where he became the first member of Congress to attend Former President Donald Trump's criminal trial.\n\nSpeaking to reporters outside the courtroom during a break from the proceedings, Scott said that the treatment that the former president was enduring was \"despicable.\"\n\nScott is running for reelection to a second term in the U.S. Senate. While the former president is under a gag order that bars him from verbally attacking jurors, Scott is under no such constraints, and lashed out at the prosecution.\n\n\"It's a crime in this country to go after the court system to go after your political opponents,\" Scott said on video that was recorded by POLITICO.\n\n\"What's happening in this courtroom is clearly criminal. It's been led by political thugs -- the lead prosecutor was the number three person at the Biden Justice Department. The Judge's daughter is a political operative and raises money for Democrats. You've got the lead prosecutor's wife is a significant donor to Democrats, and I think to Biden. So this is just a bunch of Democrats saying that we want to make sure that Donald Trump can't talk.\"\n\nThe prosecutor that Scott was referring to is Matthew Colangelo, who was hired by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg in 2022 after serving as a senior official at the U.S. Justice Department. It was revealed this week that FEC records show Colangelo's wife - Anne K. Small - did contribute $2,800 to Biden's 2020 campaign.\n\nThe Judge leading the case is Juan Merchan. Trump's lawyers attempted before the trial to have him step down from the case, alleging bias because his daughter is a Democratic political consultant, the Associated Press has reported.\n\nScott's visit to the Trump trial on Thursday meant that he missed a vote in the Senate on a procedural motion on a bill to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration. That missed vote was duly noted by Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, a Democrat running to be the party's nominee for the U.S. Senate to take on Scott in November.\n\n\"As the man who oversaw one of the largest Medicare frauds in history and pleaded the 5th 75 times, Rick Scott finds himself once again in a courtroom today... this time following Donald Trump like a fan waiting for a selfie,\" she said in a statement sent to the Phoenix. \"Maybe someone should remind Scott that rather than sitting in New York trying to suck up to a defendant found liable for sexual abuse, he should be at work focusing on lowering costs, securing our border, and protecting democracy.\"\n\nMucarsel-Powell's comment was a reference to how Scott invoked the 5 Amendment 75 times in a deposition he gave in 2000 as part of a civil case involving his time leading Columbia/HCA, a healthcare company. Scott resigned from the company in 1997 following government allegations of Medicare fraud.

He resigned from Columbia/HCA after the FBI began a probe that ultimately resulted in the company paying $1.7 billion in fines to settle charges of rampant Medicare fraud.

On Wednesday, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) called the four different state and federal cases against Trump a \"borderline criminal conspiracy\" orchestrated by Democrats.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts in New York for falsifying business records in order to conceal payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels, who said she and Trump had a sexual encounter in 2006. During the trial, Manhattan prosecutors have sought to prove Trump orchestrated the payments from 2015 to 2017 to bury the stories he feared would damage his presidential campaign.\n\nScott said Trump had not asked him to come and that he came of his own volition because Trump's prosecution reminded Scott of when he was fined $1.7 billion for defrauding Medicare during his time as CEO of Columbia/HCA, a for-profit hospital company.\n\n\"I'm fed up.

He previously moved against McConnell in 2022 but was rebuffed by their colleagues.\n\nIt's not clear if hugging Trump would help Scott's leadership candidacy, but it probably wouldn't hurt.\n\nDebbie Mucarsel-Powell, a former Democratic congresswoman trying to unseat Scott in November, blasted him for sucking up to Trump.\n\n\"As the man who oversaw one of the largest Medicare frauds in history and pleaded the 5th 75 times, Rick Scott finds himself once again in a courtroom today ... this time following Donald Trump like a fan waiting for a selfie,\" Mucarsel-Powell said in a written statement. \"Maybe someone should remind Scott that rather than sitting in New York trying to suck up to a defendant found liable for sexual abuse, he should be at work focusing on lowering costs,

At the same time it could hurt him among those less enamored of the former president.\n\nIt came as Trump faced some especially salacious testimony from porn star Stormy Daniels, who took the stand and appeared to enrage the former president when she told the jury about their alleged sexual encounter.\n\nWhile plenty of members of Congress have talked about Trump's trials on the airwaves or fundraised off them, Scott is believed to be first to join the former president at the courthouse. It even gave Scott an opening to amplify comments the former president has made to discredit the New York case.\n\nOn Thursday morning, Scott drove with Trump from Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue down to the courthouse in Lower Manhattan, where the presumptive GOP nominee is on trial related to hush money allegations to cover up an affair. Scott sat in the front row of the courtroom while the defense questioned Daniels.\n\nScott, a former hospital chain CEO who served two terms as Florida governor, then walked outside and spoke to the cameras three hours into the trial. \"I'm here because I have known Donald Trump a long time,\" he said. \"I knew him before I was governor. I consider him a friend. And what he is going through is just despicable.\"\n\nWhile the former president is under a gag order that prevents him from publicly commenting on jurors, witnesses or other people involved in the case, Scott faces no such restriction unless prosecutors can prove the senator's remarks were directed by Trump.\n\nThe senator told reporters that one of the prosecutors, Matthew Colangelo, used to work in the Justice Department -- a suggestion that the case against Trump is politically motivated. He also disparaged Justice Juan Merchan's family members.\n\nTrump is allowed to publicly comment on District Attorney Alvin Bragg and the judge overseeing the case.\n\nTrump and Scott have known each other for more than 25 years, talk regularly and see each other at functions roughly once a month, said Scott reelection campaign senior adviser Chris Hartline. In their official capacities they worked together on Everglades restoration and on policies toward Cuba and Venezuela.\n\n\"It's not just a political alliance,\" Hartline said. \"It's a genuine friendship that has been built long before either of them were in office.\"\n\nScott was invited to attend the trial by Susie Wiles, Trump's senior campaign adviser, who was also Scott's first campaign manager, he told POLITICO during a brief interview on Capitol Hill. But he added that he decided to make public remarks and was not asked to do so by the campaign.\n\n\"He's standing strong, he's working hard,\" Scott said of Trump, and hinted at the possibility of going back to the trial.\n\nHis relationship with Trump is far different than with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. Scott and DeSantis have feuded for years, going back to when DeSantis was an incoming governor. The dynamic was also on display last year when DeSantis turned down a chance to meet with President Joe Biden in the wake of a hurricane but Scott stepped in.\n\nTrump complained last week that the streets near the courthouse were too blocked off, preventing his supporters from protesting. Since then, roughly three weeks into the trial, he's been spotted with other key players in politics, including Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, Wiles and Trump's son Eric.\n\n\"The friendship and support of Sen. Scott is important to President Trump and to the campaign,\" Trump campaign senior adviser Brian Hughes said. \"When Biden and the Democrats are attacking you every minute of every day, it is always good to have strong friends and supporters at your side.\"\n\nMelissa Stone, who was Scott's chief of staff when he was governor, said that Scott often ignores public opinion or what the GOP establishment wants. She added that he was \"one of the best friends you can have\" when going through a difficult time, saying he called every day when her son was in the neonatal intensive care unit.\n\n\"This is the most on brand thing Rick Scott has ever done, because he has a very strong sense of right and wrong and strong sense of sticking up for someone when he feels like they are in an unfair situation,\" she said.\n\nMAGA Inc., the super PAC supporting Trump, shared Scott's comments about the prosecution on social media. Scott's reelection campaign sent a roundup of the senator's various comments during the day to reporters on Thursday afternoon.\n\nOn Thursday, Scott insisted that, to him, the case was personal, not only because of his relationship with Trump but because he saw similarities to his own life. Outside the courthouse, as well as early in the morning in a Fox & Friends appearance, Scott raised the fact that he opposed Hillary Clinton's health care reform proposal in the 1990s. He then accused the Justice Department of going after the hospital chain he led, Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp., as an act of retribution.\n\n\"This can't continue,\" Scott said. \"What is happening to this president is wrong.\"\n\nScott left the company in 1997 while it was under a federal investigation that ultimately led to a record $1.7 billion for Medicare fraud. Over the years, Scott has maintained his innocence and has faced attacks about it in all of his runs for office, though his approach to it has evolved since his 2010 gubernatorial run, when he said he took responsibility and learned from the experience. He became one of the wealthiest members of Congress after a childhood spent in poverty and is able to self-fund his political campaigns.\n\nFlorida Democrats made it clear that 2024 would be no different in terms of focusing on Scott's Medicare record and accused him of being in New York \"kissing up to Trump.\" The group used Scott's comments outside the courthouse to blast him in an email to reporters and on social media.\n\nScott's likely challenger, Democrat Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, a former congresswoman from Ecuador, had a similar message and slammed Scott for missing a procedural vote to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration, which ended up passing by a wide bipartisan margin.\n\n\"Instead of showing up to vote on a bill that protects Florida travelers, strengthens air safety, and provides our aviation workforce with the resources they need to secure our skies, Rick Scott spent his day sucking up to a defendant found liable for sexual abuse,\" she said in a statement. \"It should come as no surprise that the man who oversaw one of the largest Medicare frauds in history would put himself and his own extreme agenda before the people he was elected to represent.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 5,

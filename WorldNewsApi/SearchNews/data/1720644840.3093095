During the Critics Choice Association inaugural Celebration of LGBTQ+ Cinema & Television event held on Friday, June 7, at the Fairmont Century Plaza in Los Angeles, the actors reflected on high-profile entertainment figures who played a role in helping them come out as gay. Lane, 68, began his acceptance speech as the career achievement award recipient by recounting how he was first asked if he was gay by a theater journalist in an interview \"way back in 1989.\" Noting that he had \"come out to my mother and my two brothers when I was 21 and was certainly out to my friends and colleagues in the business,\" Lane said, \"I had marched in Pride Parades in the late seventies, but nobody had ever expressed interest in my sexuality.\" But, The Producers star explained that once he \"began playing gay roles, it started to come up more and more.\" Lane then shared that taking on his role in The Birdcage had brought up the topic of his sexuality again. \"I certainly wish I had been braver at the time,\" he explained, adding, \"Like when Oprah Winfrey on her show asked me why I was so good at all that girly stuff in The Birdcage. If I could go back in time, the answer I wish I had given is: The reason I'm good at all that stuff is because I'm a wonderful actor, but if you're asking me if I'm gay, the answer is yes and proud of it.\" Lane further detailed how he had been \"terrified and overwhelmed just sitting opposite Oprah Winfrey\" and how he \"was yet again not prepared to publicly declare my sexual allegiance,\" despite saying the TV host was \"just being playful.\" \"I had expressed my fears beforehand to the late, great Robin Williams, who kindly said to me, 'Don't worry, Nathan. You don't have to discuss it if you're not ready.' And he went on to protect me whenever he could, throughout the awkward moments,\" Lane said. Lane later revealed that he decided to officially come out publicly after the murder of Matthew Shepherd, a 21-year-old gay student who was killed in 1998. Describing it as \"an incredibly sobering moment,\" the actor said, \"I'd already come out on a personal level, why not come out publicly now that I was the so-called public figure if it might be meaningful to others in the struggle. So I did, and I'm glad I did.\" Lane also shared some words of wisdom he had received from an acting icon, telling audience members, \"One of the first lessons I learned about being a public figure was to try to ignore what people write about you. As Bette Midler once said to me, angrily, 'Don't read that s---. You can go on the internet right now and find The Society to Assassinate Bette Midler. What are you going to do? F--- 'em!' She has a way of getting to the heart of things.\" During his acceptance speech, Takei, meanwhile, credited two different men with helping him come out. \"I'm here tonight because of two men: Arnold Schwarzenegger and Howard Stern,\" he said, before explaining how in 2005, then California Governor Schwarzenegger had \"vetoed California's marriage equality, and I was furious.\" He continued, \"I was 68 years old, but that year I came out and I spoke up. On many TV guests spots after that, I became gay George Takei.\" The actor then shared how \"radio trailblazer\" Stern \"gave me a microphone,\" making him the official announcer on The Howard Stern Show, which allowed him to reach \"many millions of people sharing my story, promoting LGBTQ Rights.\" \"Thanks to Arnold, I came out of the closet to fight for change. Thanks to Howard, I was given a big microphone that I used to advocate for LGBTQ equality,\" he continued.

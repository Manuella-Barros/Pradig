Or do they let that story tell itself while concentrating on other, more traditional topics like the economy?\n\nA focus on Trump could help sharpen the argument that the 45th president is unfit to hold the nation's highest office again. He is the first president found guilty of felonies, the first president to be twice impeached -- the second time for his conduct around Jan. 6, 2021 -- and he has been indicted in three other criminal cases.\n\nThe argument against such a focus, however, is that spending time on the criminal conviction does not actually shift many voters, the vast majority of whom have likely made their minds up about Trump's moral character a long time ago.\n\nTime and ad money used casting Trump as unacceptable is not spent defending President Biden's record or pushing the Democratic messaging on favorable topics like reproductive rights.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) laid out the case for focusing in on Trump's conviction during a Sunday appearance on CNN's \"State of the Union.\"\n\nSchiff said that he understood why Biden might not want to seem to be gleeful about the verdict on the day when it was announced or immediately thereafter.\n\nBut Schiff added: \"I think the president should be leaning into this going forward. His competitor is a convicted felon. And you can only imagine, if the situation was reversed, they would be going after Joe Biden with a vengeance.\"\n\nThe California congressman, who is a Senate candidate this year, also contended that Trump's conviction could be used to make the case that he could not be trusted to run the country.\n\n\"You want the country run properly. You don't want a convicted felon to turn the Oval Office and the federal government [into] some kind of a racketeering operation,\" he said. \"I think that's a powerful case to make and certainly one supported by the verdict here.\"\n\nSo far, Team Biden has delivered a somewhat bifurcated response to Trump's conviction, which revolved around a $130,000 hush money payment to adult actress Stormy Daniels in the final stretch of the 2016 election.\n\nThe president and his White House staff have been circumspect, while Biden's reelection campaign has been much more forceful.\n\nBiden campaign communications director Michael Tyler said on the day of the verdict that it was a rebuke to Trump's purported belief that \"he would never face consequences for breaking the law for his own personal gain.\"\n\nLater, after Trump had made remarks blasting the verdict, Tyler said \"America just witnessed a confused, desperate and defeated Donald Trump ramble about his own personal grievances and lie about the American justice system.\"\n\nStill, when viewing the verdict through an electoral lens, the question remains as to whether Trump being found guilty does anything more than amplify the dislike Democratic-leaning voters already feel for him.\n\nThe initial evidence on the verdict's political impact is mixed.\n\nAn ABC News/Ipsos poll found that a plurality of Americans, 50 percent, believe the guilty verdict was correct and 49 percent think Trump should end his 2024 campaign. Yet the same poll showed Trump's overall favorability rating basically unchanged, albeit at a lowly 31 percent.\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Saturday found a clear majority of Americans saying the verdict would make no difference to their willingness or unwillingness to vote for Trump.\n\nAmong independents, though, 25 percent said it would make them less likely to vote for him -- while 18 percent said it made them more likely to do so.\n\nDemocratic strategist Joel Payne argued that the key objective for Democrats was to connect the conviction with a larger argument that Trump's legal woes make him ill-placed to take effective action on real issues.\n\nPayne said he did not think Democrats \"should shy away\" from talking about Trump's conviction but added that he would not \"spend a bunch of ad money\" on the topic alone.\n\n\"It's one thing to say, isn't it terrible that Donald Trump broke these laws and is a convicted felon? But the better message is, Donald Trump is a convicted felon and he is spending all of his time and all of his energy focusing on himself. He is not worried about the issues that matter to the American people.\"\n\nDick Harpootlian, a South Carolina state senator who also serves on the finance committee of Biden's campaign, argued that there was a moral argument to be made based on Trump's behavior.\n\n\"To have a convicted felon running for president of the United States? A convicted felon who paid off a porn star because he thought it would affect his election? It's morally reprehensible,\" Harpootlian said.\n\nThough Harpootlian freely acknowledged that there were some Trump loyalists who would never be peeled away from their support of the former president, he also contended \"there are a bunch of folks out here who can be persuaded this guy is not fit to be the president of the United States, and I think the Biden campaign should remind folks of that.\"\n\nRepublicans -- even those deeply skeptical of Trump -- seem far less likely to believe the court verdict can move voters, or that Democrats would be wise to focus much time on it.\n\n\"There was nothing any voter learnt coming out of this trial that they didn't know at the beginning,\" said one such GOP strategist, Dan Judy.\n\n\"What the Joe Biden campaign needs to worry about is Joe Biden. What he needs to worry about is sub-40 percent approval ratings.\n\n\"The fundamental problem for them is not Donald Trump's unpopularity, it is Joe Biden's unpopularity,\" Judy added.", "source":

The threat that Trump poses would be greater in a second term than it was in his first term. This isn't the same Trump who got elected in 2016. He's worse.\"\n\nBiden didn't hold back in his assessment of Trump's current state of mind: \"Something snapped in him when he lost in 2020. He can't accept he lost, and it is literally driving him crazy. Now he's running again. And he's not only obsessed with losing in 2020, he is clearly unhinged.\"\n\nHe concluded by highlighting some of Trump's controversial statements: \"Just listen to him.

Trump has railed against the verdict and the legal proceedings since he was convicted, and plans to appeal. On Sunday, he said he would accept home confinement or jail time but that it would be tough for the public to accept.\n\nEarlier in the day, Biden's son Hunter was in court for a criminal case against him over his purchase and possession of a revolver in 2018, a historic criminal prosecution of a sitting president's son with the potential to influence the 2024 presidential election.\n\nBiden did not comment on his son's legal troubles. He had issued a statement earlier in the day saying \"Jill and I love our son and we are so proud of the man he is today,\" and added that a lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction.\n\nAt the Greenwich fundraiser, Biden also called Trump \"unhinged\" and unable to accept defeat. He stressed Trump's earlier comments about terminating the U.S. Constitution and wanting to be a dictator on day one if he wins a second term.\n\n\"Throughout this campaign Trump has made it clear he is running to exact for revenge.

The guilty verdict followed five weeks of evidence.\n\nHe also said an independent judicial system was an essential bedrock of US democracy, adding: \"We should never allow anyone to tear it down.\"\n\nTrump is due to be formally adopted as the Republican nominee at the party's national convention which opens in Milwaukee on 15 July - four days after he is scheduled to be sentenced by Judge Juan Merchan, who presided over his trial and whom he has called \"a devil\".\n\nSpeaking at a fundraiser hosted by Richard Plepler, the former chief executive of HBO, Biden appeared to question Trump's mental state, suggesting he had been literally driven \"crazy\" by his 2020 election defeat.\n\n\"Here's what is becoming clearer and clearer every day: the threat Trump poses in his second term would be greater than it was in his first,\" Biden said. \"This isn't the same Trump that got elected in 2016.

But during a fundraiser in New York on Monday, Biden went on the offensive, warning about the threat the \"convicted felon\" poses to democracy. \"The campaign entered uncharted territory last week,\" Biden told supporters in White Plains. \"For the first time in American history, a former president that is a convicted felon is now seeking the office of the presidency.\"\n\n\"But as disturbing as that is,\" the president added, \"more damaging is the all-out assault Donald Trump is making on the American system of justice.\"\n\nBiden was referring to claims from Trump and his allies that the historic conviction on 34 felony counts amounted to political persecution by Democrats; in recent days, Republicans have raged against the verdict, and in some cases directly called on the conservative-led Supreme Court to intervene on Trump's behalf. \"It's reckless and dangerous for anyone to say it's rigged just because they don't like the outcome,\" Biden said Monday. \"The threat Trump poses would be greater in a second term.\"\n\nThe future of democracy and American institutions has been a recurring theme for Biden. In his remarks Monday, he underscored the link between Trump's personal corruption -- as displayed by his guilty verdict -- and his antidemocratic ambitions. \"Something snapped in this guy for real,\" Biden said of the \"unhinged\" Republican. \"Just listen to his rantings. He wants to, in his words, be a dictator in one day.\"\n\nBiden and the Democrats have seemed unsure so far just how much to focus on Trump's conviction this campaign season. More Americans than not seem to believe that the verdict was correct and that Trump should end his campaign -- and some polling suggests his felony conviction has even hurt his standing among some in the Republican electorate. But conservatives have long proven willing to overlook his criminality -- obvious, even before a jury of 12 New Yorkers made it official last week -- and in many cases even embraced it.

Merchan set sentencing for July 11, just days before the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where GOP leaders, who remained resolute in their support in the aftermath of the verdict, are expected to formally make him their nominee.\n\nThe verdict was a stunning legal reckoning for Trump and exposes him to potential prison time in the city where his manipulations of the tabloid press helped catapult him from a real estate tycoon to reality television star and ultimately president. As he seeks to reclaim the White House in this year's election, the judgment presents voters with another test of their willingness to accept Trump's boundary-breaking behavior.", "source": {"uri": "nj.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NJ.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Tuberville", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Tuberville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsmax", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newsmax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_voter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent voter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Venezuela"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Venezuela"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabloid_journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tabloid journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://www.nj.com/resizer/v2/4VG2FRVC5JA4ZDP2H7MTPIPL7Q.jpg?auth=d707ab2116366670aca765524065679ce8861c770a327db75223367420f83b11&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623975", "eventUri": "eng-9623975", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-11", "textStart": 1469, "textEnd": 1476}], "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

But as worrying as it is, Donald Trump's all-out assault on the American justice system is even more damaging.\n\nOther Democratic officials have used similar rhetoric. But this sentence took on even more force in the mouth of the president himself. Although Republicans have rallied behind Trump since his conviction, it remains unclear how the verdict will be applied in swing states, where a change of a few thousand votes could decide the November election.\n\nBiden's remark was another stunning turn in an election mired in Trump's multiple legal threats. It came on a day when the first family was embroiled in its own extraordinary courtroom drama as Biden's son Hunter became the first child of a sitting president to go on trial. The younger Biden has pleaded not guilty to charges of illegally purchasing and possessing a firearm while addicted to or abusing drugs. He will also face a tax trial in September.\n\nLast week, Biden noted that Trump had been convicted on 34 counts and said it was reckless, dangerous and irresponsible for his opponent to say the verdict was rigged. Presidential remarks at off-camera fundraisers can often serve as a testing ground for rhetoric that later emerges at public events. But Biden's sharp tone will certainly lead to accusations from the Trump campaign that the former president's conviction came after a process of political weaponization of the justice system.\n\nIn another important legal development Monday, Trump received good news from Georgia, where he is among several defendants in a racketeering case for his attempt to steal the swing state from Biden's column in the 2020 election. Georgia Court of Appeals has scheduled oral arguments to remove Fulton County Prosecutor Fani Willis from the case for October 4.\n\nIt was just the latest blow to prosecutors pursuing Trump in his election interference case. The fact that the proceedings take place barely a month before Election Day provides an incredibly short time frame for a trial. The Georgia case, in which Trump pleaded not guilty, was delayed by the defendants' attempt to disqualify Willis after she hired a prosecutor with whom she had a relationship.\n\nTwo federal cases against Trump, in which he also pleaded not guilty, are pending.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule this month on Trump's sweeping request for immunity for actions he took while president. The justices could still make a final ruling, but any ruling requiring further litigation in lower courts could mean time is running out in special counsel Jack Smith's election interference case, with just five months until Election Day. At the same time, multiple disputes in pretrial motions have put on hold the impending federal trial in Florida over Trump's alleged mishandling of classified documents. Democrats have accused Trump-appointed Judge Aileen Cannon of showing political bias in her decisions.\n\nThe stalemate on multiple fronts means it may prove impossible for the U.S. legal system to explain a former president's alleged attempt to stay in power against the wishes of voters before having the chance to win another mandate. In itself, this delay represents a significant threat to American democracy's attempt to save itself, as it suggests that a future president who acted in the same way as Trump could expect impunity.\n\nTrump's avoidance of accountability for his interference in the 2020 election through a mix of skilled litigation by his lawyers, some decisions turned against him by prosecutors, and luck would also significantly raise the stakes for November elections.\n\nIf Trump loses, his future, having already lost one criminal case, looks incredibly bleak, with three cases likely to end up going to trial that will result in huge legal fees. But if Trump wins, he could appoint an attorney general who could stop federal cases in their tracks. And his Justice Department will be sure to do everything possible to delay or cover up any negative outcome he faces in the Georgia case as well as the New York hush money conviction scheduled for July 11 . It is reasonable to assume that Trump will stop at nothing to regain power at a time when he refuses to guarantee acceptance of the outcome of the 2024 election.\n\nTy Cobb, a former Trump White House lawyer, told CNN's Erin Burnett on Monday that Georgia's October date means there is no chance this case will go to trial before the election. avoid any legal liability for his actions in 2020 if he wins in 2024.\n\nIt's very real if he wins the election, it's not real at all if he loses, Cobb said. Referring to the federal election interference case and the classified documents case, Cobb said: \"Both of those things will eventually go away at some point if Trump loses early to mid next year and the Georgia case will probably follow suit.\n\nThe slow pace of Trump's criminal trials contrasts with the efficiency of those facing Hunter Biden, who is also scheduled to go to trial on tax charges in September.\n\nThe cases of the former president and the current president's son are not analogous, and those surrounding Trump are extremely complicated. But they are sure to leave many Democrats wondering that the only federal lawsuit related to this year's election could be one that targets Hunter Biden and not Trump, whose actions after the 2020 election pushed American democracy to its limits .\n\nJoe Biden pledged Monday not to comment on the outcome of a federal trial, but in a statement he expressed boundless love for his son and respect for his success in overcoming his addiction to crack cocaine. I'm the president, but I'm also a dad, Biden said.\n\nBiden's intensified rhetoric at Monday's fundraiser follows a warning from Trump in an interview with Fox News broadcast Sunday about the consequences if Judge Juan Merchan imposes a prison sentence after last week's guilty verdict .\n\nI'm not sure the public would accept it, the former president said. I think it would be difficult for the public to accept. You know, at some point there's a breaking point. Some senior Democrats accused Trump of inciting violence in his remarks, which took on a more ominous aspect given his call for his supporters to fight like hell before his supporters' mob attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.\n\nThis is clearly Donald Trump once again inciting violence, potential violence, when he is convicted, Rep. Adam Schiff told Kasie Hunt on CNN's State of the Union on Sunday. The California Democrat accused Trump of making a dangerous new call for violence.\n\nThe extraordinary tangle of the 2024 election and legal cases weighing on both Trump and Biden will likely dominate a hearing on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, when Attorney General Merrick Garland faces renewed questioning from Republicans.\n\nGarland pledged to restore trust in the legal system when he took office after the tumultuous Trump years by making sure everyone plays by the same rules.\n\nThree years later, he has frustrated much of Washington with a quest that seems quaint in an era when judges, prosecutors and juries, in a proliferating wave of politically charged cases, are almost constantly under attack.\n\nBut the hostility toward Garland doesn't just come from Republicans, who will seek revenge Tuesday after Trump's conviction. Democrats are concerned about the slow pace of federal investigations. And the White House complained to Garland after special counsel Robert Hurs' report on Joe Biden's handling of classified documents described the president's memory as significantly degraded in a report that sparked weeks of political reverberations, a reported CNN.\n\nGarland is also likely to face scrutiny in the Hunter Biden trial. House Republicans have seized on the matter to try to politically damage the president, especially after failing to provide any evidence that he profited from Hunter Biden's business dealings as part of their failed impeachment inquiry .\n\nRepublicans celebrated the failure of a plea deal, which they saw as favorable treatment for Hunter Biden, in court. But the Hunter Biden trial, as well as a federal corruption trial targeting New Jersey Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez, undermine Republican claims that the justice system is biased, made in the wake of the Trump verdict in New York last week .\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance

Trump was accused and found guilty of falsifying business records in order to hide a hush money scheme involving a porn star that his closest advisers believed would have damaged his presidential campaign were it made public.\n\nThe ex-president is separately facing three other impending criminal trials, two related to his efforts to change the results of the 2020 election and block Joe Biden from becoming president, and one related to his allegedly illegal retention of classified materials including documents and files related to the US's military capabilities. He has professed his innocence in all cases.\n\nIn the days following his conviction in his former home state of New York, Trump has turned to his base of political support for donations, raising a staggering $34.8m in the first 24 hours alone. At the same time, reports have emerged indicating that Democrats are split on the issue of campaigning against the former president while mentioning his criminal conviction, with some wary of politicising the criminal justice process.\n\nPresident Biden merely flashed a grin when asked by a reporter about his 2024 opponent's conviction on 34 felony counts and how it would affect the election, but expanded on his thoughts significantly on Monday at a private event with campaign donors in Connecticut.\n\n\"Folks, the campaign entered uncharted territory last week,\" he told his audience.\n\n\"For the first time in American history, a former president that is a convicted felon is now seeking the office of the presidency,\" Biden added. \"But as disturbing as that is, more damaging is the all-out assault Donald Trump is making on the American system of justice.\"\n\nRepublicans who have raised objections to the multiple prosecutions of Trump, who in essence has been campaigning for re-election since the day he left the White House in 2021, have largely ignored or explained away the former president's own vows to utilise the Justice Department to go after members of Joe Biden's family, or the president himself, in a hypothetical second Trump term. Megyn Kelly, an on-again-off-again supporter of Trump in conservative media, even suggested on a broadcast this past week that Barack Obama could be a target of a vengeful Republican-led Department of Justice.\n\nBut Trump's repeated threats to jail his political opponents are nothing new. What's new are the plans being drawn up by organizations involved with the so-called \"Project 2025\" effort, which seeks to reshape the federal government along conservative priorities including, most importantly, a massive erosion of the political independence of the Justice Department and attorney general.\n\nAlong with going after his political enemies, Trump has made a number of other promises in recent weeks which have been aimed at the American justice system and the integrity of the Department of Justice's decisions related to criminal prosecution.\n\nIn numerous campaign speeches, he has vowed to issue pardons for convicted and charged participants in the January 6 riot, the 2021 attack on the US Capitol by his supporters aimed at halting or reversing the certification of the 2020 presidential election, seemingly at Trump's urging.\n\nAt a recent appearance in Washington DC at the Libertarian Party's national convention, he also promised to commute the sentence of Ross Ulbricht, the convicted founder of the Silk Road dark web marketplace which served as a major hub for drug sales and other ilicit activity.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com",

A TikTok account linked to Biden, which had been sharing content about the former Republican president's behavior, inadvertently ended up shooting itself in the foot.\n\nThe account shared a video clip on Sunday night featuring a former producer who claimed that Trump had used a racial slur during the filming of The Apprentice's first season. However, instead of focusing on the content of the TikTok video, the comment section was flooded with queries about inflation and how Biden intends to tackle this significant issue affecting millions of Americans.\n\nComments varied from \"Why is my rent expensive\" to \"Why can't I afford the rent,\" reports the Express. Other pointed questions included: \"Why did Joe Biden say poor kids are just as smart as white kids?\"\n\nMelania Trump urged to 'dump' Donald by TV star who sheds light on 'contractual agreement'\n\nDonald Trump should 'terminate' election campaign after convictions, according to half of Americans\n\nDespite racking up over 1.4 million views and 1,000 comments since June 2, social media users seemed to largely ignore the original topic of the video. This latest jab at Trump came just 24 hours after the convicted former President made his debut on TikTok.\n\nHis first post on the app was a 13-second montage of him attending a UFC fight in New Jersey, where he was seen entering the arena and greeting fans. Within days of joining, the former president had already gathered over four million followers - ten times the number that the joint Biden-Harris HQ account has managed to attract since its launch in February.\n\nTrump has dealt another blow to the American President, with records showing his campaign raised a whopping $141m in May. This surge in donations came hot on the heels of Trump's formal conviction on 34 felony charges in his hush money trial.\n\nFor all the latest news straight to your inbox, sign up for our FREE newsletters here.\n\nThe former president shared a link to his donor website on Truth Social just minutes after the guilty verdict was announced, causing the site to crash almost immediately. In a statement, the Trump campaign said: \"We are moved by the outpouring of support for President Donald J. Trump.\"\n\nThey added: \"The American people saw right through Crooked Joe Biden's rigged trial, and sent Biden and Democrats a powerful message the REAL verdict will come on November 5th.\" It was also revealed that a quarter of the donors in May were first-time contributors.\n\nTrump had previously raised $76m in April and over $65.6m in March. As for the Biden campaign, they have yet to confirm their numbers for May, but they raised $51m in April and $90m in March.\n\nFor the latest local news and features on Irish America, visit our homepage here.", "source": {"uri": "irishstar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_o_sullivan@irishstar.com", "name": "John O'sullivan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "aurora_bosotti@irishstar.com", "name": "Aurora Bosotti", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Apprentice_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Apprentice (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigger", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nigger"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Film producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Irish people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://i2-prod.irishstar.com/incoming/article32957263.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_gettyimages-2155455852-612x612jpeg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623975", "eventUri": "eng-9623975", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-02", "textStart": 1243, "textEnd": 1249}, {"amb": false, "date": "-11-05", "textStart": 2579, "textEnd": 2591}], "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

Among those candidates is Tony Wied, who is running to replace former Rep. Mike Gallagher in Wisconsin and is backed by both Trump and his son Donald Trump Jr.\n\nIn fact, Wied is expected to rake in more than $150,000 during a Tuesday night fundraiser in Green Bay, according to figures first shared with the Washington Examiner -- marking a huge haul for the Republican as he faces two other candidates to secure the GOP nomination for Wisconsin's 8th Congressional District.\n\n\"President Trump's verdict has been jet fuel for fundraising,\" one House GOP strategist aligned with Trump told the Washington Examiner. \"Tony Wied having Don Jr., one of the strongest campaign surrogates in GOP politics is a huge get for him, especially as he continues to dominate his primary.\"\n\nThe significant haul comes as Trump and other Republican groups have reported massive fundraising numbers for the month of May, which could help the former president close the gap with President Joe Biden as the November election nears.\n\nTrump and the Republican National Committee raised $141 million in May, spurred in part by his criminal conviction in New York last week. That haul is roughly the same as what Biden and the Democratic Party raised in March and April combined.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) said his fundraising platforms had also brought in record-high figures following Trump's conviction, arguing it has sparked \"backlash\" among voters who view the verdict as politically motivated.\n\n\"This goes to the very core of who we are, that foundation of who we are as a nation,\" Johnson said. \"That's why it's bigger than just President Trump. It's bigger than just these cases. It's about our system itself. President Trump hit a fundraising record the day after, within 24 hours of the verdict. We did as well on our fundraising platforms. We raised record amounts of money because people understand what's at stake.\"\n\nBiden, for his part, has sought to seize on Trump's \"disturbing\" conviction as a weapon against the former president.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\n\"Folks, the campaign entered unchartered territory last week,\" Biden told donors Monday in Greenwich, Connecticut. \"For the first time in American history, a former president that is a convicted felon is now seeking the office of the presidency.\"\n\nThe Biden campaign has not yet released its May fundraising numbers. However, based on Trump's record-high figures, it's possible the president has been outraised by his GOP challenger for the second month in a row.

They're going to vote for him anyway.\n\nThis is overwhelmingly true if those people are Republicans, a group that has largely abandoned the rule of law only when it applies to Trump. When 147 Republicans in the House and Senate voted against certifying Biden's historic win in the 2020 presidential election, that was an irreparable rupture in this nation's foundation. And it's only gotten worse. Every Republican toadying up to Trump to be his 2024 running mate has offered some version of the same damning qualifier: They will accept November's results if it is a \"free and fair\" election.\n\nThe inference, of course, is that 2020 wasn't, which is a Trump-manufactured lie that he's still spewing. For many Republicans, including those who want to be vice president, the only free and fair election is one that Trump wins.\n\nEvery time Trump garners another ignoble first -- first president to be twice impeached, first former president to be indicted, first former president to be convicted in a criminal case -- there's a kind of collective breath-holding to wait and see if just maybe, this will be the moment when a significant number of Trump's followers say \"Enough.\"\n\nBut that has yet to happen and probably won't. If anything, when Trump faces any measure of accountability, like being found guilty on 34 felony counts last week for falsifying business records to help his 2016 presidential campaign, his followers seem bound even closer to him. His campaign claims Trump got $53 million in donations in the 24 hours after his \"hush-money\" case conviction.\n\nA recent episode of \"The Daily Show\" aired excerpts from 2023 interviews with Trump followers by The Young Turks news program. Echoing an infamous Trump comment, a man made this shocking statement: Trump \"could stand on the front steps of the White House and commit murder, and I'm with him.\"\n\nDuring a 2016 campaign stop, Trump crowed about the loyalty of those he called \"my people.\" He said, \"I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose any voters, OK? It's incredible.\"\n\nMore than incredible, it's incredibly disturbing how many people are willing to a lawless president. When he won the presidency in 2016, Trump got 63 million votes. More than 11 million voters who witnessed the chaos, cruelties, and lies of Trump's White House years decided, \"Yup, I want some of that, too,\" and he got 74 million votes in 2020 in a losing effort. There's no reason to think he won't top his 2020 total in November.\n\nIf Trump's attempts to upend the peaceful transfer of power, including inciting a deadly insurrection and bringing this nation to the brink of its worst constitutional crisis ever, haven't eroded his grasp on the Republican Party, it's hard to believe anything ever will.\n\nIn the 1970s, cult leader Jim Jones convinced his followers that a paradise in the jungles of Guyana awaited them in a place he called Jonestown. But once they arrived, he took their passports to prevent them from leaving. His followers became his hostages.\n\nThat's not the case with Trump's minions. They could walk away from Trump at any time. Nothing is holding them except their belief that he is the only man who will keep America white; continue to erode women's reproductive and health care autonomy; keep Black and brown people in their place and preferably outside this nation's borders; and push LGBTQ people out of the streets and back into closets.\n\nIn The Young Turks interview, a Trump follower said, \"If [Trump] says it, then I'll go with it. If he wants to be a dictator, then so be it.\" While the Supreme Court is slow-walking its decision on whether a president has total immunity from criminal prosecution, his followers have already decided that whatever Trump wants, Trump should get.\n\nThis is the part where someone will say Trump's followers shouldn't be shamed or criticized for their continued support of the former president. But the fault never lies with the demagogues alone. It also lies with their followers who elevate them to power, keep them relevant, and do their terrible bidding.\n\nWithout his millions of followers, Trump is nothing more than a lousy businessman and a one-and-done former president. But with them, he could be months away from perhaps the most disreputable first of all -- the first convicted felon elected to the White House.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType":

{"id": 225066908, "title": "How \u2018The Chosen\u2019 Creator Turned the Bible Into Binge TV: \u201cThis Is Such a Dangerous Show\u201d", "text": "\u201cIt was, by every objective measure, one of the most devastating days of my life,\u201d Dallas Jenkins recalls. The Midwest-born director and son of a best-selling author of Christian novels had for years struggled to build a Hollywood career and had finally landed his big break: directing a movie for Get Out producer Jason Blum, who shared Jenkins\u2019 belief that there was an untapped market for elevated religious fare. Their film \u2014 2017\u2019s rom-com The Resurrection of Gavin Stone \u2014 scored \u201cinsanely\u201d well at a test screening and their hopes were high. Then came opening weekend. \u201cI was at home with my wife and shell-shocked,\u201d Jenkins recalls. Gavin Stone ranked 18th at the box office and opened to just $1.2 million. \u201cI mean, we were crying. I thought this was my chance. I had finally got in the door. I was working with one of the most prolific and influential producers in Hollywood, who liked me. And it just completely failed. I thought, \u2018Maybe this is the wrong business for me.\u2019 \u201d But within weeks, Jenkins had another idea. This one was for a TV series, which would go on to gather a flock of more than 200 million viewers worldwide who have watched at least one episode, largely driven by word-of-mouth. The show has also sold an incredible $63 million in theatrical ticket sales after becoming the first series to screen an entire season in theaters. It even has its own annual fan convention. All this, and you\u2019ve probably barely heard of The Chosen, which tells the story of Jesus and his disciples across a planned seven seasons (a long-awaited streaming date for season four is coming very soon). Yet to hear Jenkins tell it, the fact that The Chosen is still obscure to many is a very good thing. The 48-year-old producer is convinced his addictive, character-driven, serialized drama has the potential to reach new heights of mainstream popularity now that he\u2019s made a global distribution deal with Lionsgate and the show is edging toward its most dramatic story beats yet (including a devastating, multi-episode crucifixion sequence). His new studio partnership is a major step toward producing a slew of other modern takes on biblical stories that he\u2019s developing. How about a Moses show? \u201cMoses was like a reluctant Tony Soprano,\u201d Jenkins pitches. \u201cHe was the head of the largest family and didn\u2019t want to be.\u201d Or Noah\u2019s Ark? \u201cThe story of Noah is basically Parenthood on a boat,\u201d he says. And, of course, he\u2019s got plans for a Chosen sequel and prequels galore. Get ready, the Jesus Cinematic Universe is coming. \u201cOne of the most exciting things is that so many people tell us they\u2019re into the show in the same way they\u2019re into Marvel or DC,\u201d Jenkins says. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t do it cynically \u2014 \u2018Let\u2019s create a Marvel experience and find content that fits.\u2019 It started with the content.\u201d \u201cI WASN\u2019T EVEN GETTING IN THE DOOR TO BE REJECTED\u201d As a teen growing up in Zion, Illinois, Jenkins\u2019 interest in filmmaking was sparked by watching movies like One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest and It\u2019s a Wonderful Life. His fascination made him a bit of a rebel in his conservative, evangelical community. \u201cThe relationship that church folks had with Hollywood was almost exclusively antagonistic,\u201d he says. \u201cIf the church engaged with Hollywood, it was usually in the form of a boycott.\u201d Like some movie-geek version of Kevin Bacon\u2019s dancing character in Footloose, Jenkins would fantasize about making his own Oscar-winning film and secretly practice acceptance speeches in his bathroom mirror. \u201cI wish I could say that ended when I was 15,\u201d he admits. His community\u2019s assumption that Christianity and Hollywood are mortal enemies, he figured, didn\u2019t make sense. \u201cI remember fairly early on thinking that if we believe faith is relevant in the culture, then what\u2019s stopping us from making things like others do in Hollywood who have their own message or agenda?\u201d he says. \u201cThe best filmmakers are personal and have a voice. I thought: \u2018Well, what\u2019s wrong with me having my voice?\u2019 \u201d At age 25, Jenkins moved to Los Angeles and tried to build a career. He had one advantage: His father, Jerry B. Jenkins, co-wrote the best-selling Left Behind franchise \u2014 those apocalyptic, Book of Revelation-inspired novels that sold more than 60 million copies and spawned several films and games from 1995 to 2007. The elder Jenkins helped bankroll his son\u2019s early filmmaking. \u201cDallas was embarrassed by a lot of Christian media and was saying, \u2018We have to do this better,\u2019 \u201d Jerry B. Jenkins recalls. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want to be known as a Christian filmmaker. He just wanted to be known as a good filmmaker.\u201d Dallas adapted of one his father\u2019s stories, Midnight Clear, and then shot a Capra-esque fantasy called What If. Neither popped. \u201cI didn\u2019t face a lot of rejection,\u201d he says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t even getting into the door to be rejected. My movies weren\u2019t on-the-nose evangelical enough to get a lot of success in that world, but I also wasn\u2019t a good enough artsy-indie filmmaker to have a Sundance hit.\u201d Then Jenkins scored that deal with Blum, which seemingly gave him everything he wanted: an opportunity to make a wide-release, mainstream film with Christian values. \u201cDallas was friendly and talented and had a profound understanding of his audience \u2014 things they would respond to, and the things that would rub them the wrong way,\u201d Blum recalls. But when the movie\u2019s crushing opening weekend numbers rolled in, Blum had to make the dreaded call. \u201cI said the same thing to Dallas that I\u2019ve had to say to other directors,\u201d Blum says, \u201cwhich is this: \u2018I\u2019m sorry. I wish we could have delivered a hit for you.'\u201d It\u2019s a line that\u2019s devastating in its politeness and lack of blame. \u201cI bet on the right guy, but the wrong project!\u201d Blum adds. \u201cI was one too early.\u201d \u201cJESUS IS A BAD MAIN CHARACTER\u201d Like a protagonist in one of those faith-based movies that he finds so cheesy, Jenkins did what a despairing, down-on-his-luck Christian is supposed to do: turn himself over to a higher power. \u201cI truly surrendered,\u201d Jenkins says. \u201cInstead of trying to make another big movie, I figured I\u2019m going to do what I feel is best, what is most honoring to God and to my wife and people I care about. I\u2019ll make anything.\u201d Jenkins shot a humble follow-up: a short film for his Harvest Bible Chapel megachurch\u2019s Christmas Eve service (well, not that humble \u2014 he had a $100,000 budget). The short, written with Tyler Thompson, was about the birth of Christ, but told from the perspective of a shepherd. Jenkins had played with this idea before, having made another short about Jesus on the cross that focused on the two thieves being crucified alongside him. He discovered that following the lesser-known supporting characters in a classic divinity story gave his films a grounded and relatable feel. During filming, Jenkins was struck by The Big Idea. He was jogging on a treadmill and bingeing HBO\u2019s The Wire when he thought: What if somebody told the story of Christ in an ensemble drama series that jumps between different sociopolitical points of view like in The Wire, while focusing mainly on supporting players? This was two decades into the Peak TV boom, when streamers and cable networks had scrubbed their vaults for every piece of familiar rebootable content they could find, yet somehow nobody had tried updating the so-called greatest story ever told. \u201cI thought, \u2018Man, this could be so cool. Whoever does this is going to look really smart.'\u201d Also, potentially, massively controversial: The last filmmaker who dared to upend biblical storytelling conventions on a large canvas was Martin Scorsese with his widely boycotted 1988 film The Last Temptation of Christ. Jenkins didn\u2019t want to become a pariah in his own community, yet also believed he couldn\u2019t tell this story right for modern audiences unless he moved past Christian storytelling tropes. \u201cI know this sounds bad, but Jesus doesn\u2019t actually make for a good main character,\u201d he says. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t learn anything. He doesn\u2019t grow. He doesn\u2019t struggle.\u201d Jenkins partnered with Angel Studios, which at the time was called VidAngel and mainly known for selling sanitized versions of popular movies for Christian home viewing. The company proposed a crowdfunding model like the Kickstarter campaign that revived Veronica Mars \u2014 why pay for something yourself if you don\u2019t have to? Jenkins thought the crowdfunding idea was \u201cridiculous\u201d and was stunned when they raised $11 million in their first round \u2014 a record for a TV or film project. The first season of The Chosen is ultra-low-budget and uneven, yet still effective, with rural Texas doubling for Judaea and Galilee. (Jenkins\u2019 production facility is in the tiny town of Midlothian.) The cast is full of ethnically diverse actors doing Middle Eastern accents. The story opens with Jesus as an adult, just as he\u2019s starting to gather his disciples. Right out of the gate, Jenkins and his co-writers made creative moves they knew were risky: Mary Magdalene (Elizabeth Tabish) is an alcoholic and sex abuse survivor. Matthew (Paras Patel) is a tax collector on the autism spectrum. Some of the oppressive Romans are rather likable. The show\u2019s early protagonist is Simon (Shahar Isaac), who\u2019s introduced having a fistfight in the street. \u201cSimon has the biggest and most temperamental arc, and we thought, \u2018He\u2019s the James Kirk of the story,'\u201d Jenkins says. The pilot drew inspiration from The West Wing, with Jesus showing up in the last five minutes just like President Bartlet did on the NBC hit. (The show is like The West Wing in another respect, as it rivals Aaron Sorkin\u2019s drama for its sheer amount of walking-and-talking \u2014 much of the show is likable bearded guys wandering around chatting.) To cast his messiah, Jenkins hired Jonathan Roumie, an unknown actor who so effortlessly looks the part that he\u2019d been teasingly called Jesus by friends for years. Roumie\u2019s got the sad eyes down, and his Christ comes across like a warm and affable therapist with a desert-dry sense of humor. \u201cDallas tried to temper my expectations, like, \u2018Look, this probably won\u2019t go anywhere, but at least it\u2019ll be a couple of episodes of work,'\u201d recalls Roumie. In some ways, the show\u2019s lack of money for effects made it better. For scenes where Jesus performs a miracle, Jenkins considered several options. \u201cAre we going to change his voice?\u201d Jenkins recalls. \u201cAre clouds going to come in? Are we going to have his eyes roll back in his head like Bran on Game of Thrones?\u201d He decided to stage miracles in ways that were as non-flashy as possible. When Jesus fills Simon\u2019s nets with fish, his boat abruptly luges to the side with a loud thud and Simon looks stunned. It\u2019s the simplest filmmaking trick (a jump scare, actually \u2014 Jason Blum would approve), and it works. Angel Studios debuted The Chosen on its app in 2019 in a bid to launch a new streaming service. It opened with a disclaimer warning viewers that creative changes were made to the Gospels and some character backstories and dialogue had been invented. \u201cPeople just needed to know that I know that this is different and difficult,\u201d Jenkins says. \u201cI\u2019m not apologizing \u2014 this is such a dangerous show that if I cared at all about what people think, it\u2019d cripple me.\u201d CONTROVERSIES: BACKPACKS AND PRIDE FLAGS The Chosen\u2018s viewership took off during the pandemic. Seasons have since sprung up on Netflix, Peacock, Hulu, Prime Video and The CW. The crowdfunding model has continued, with Jenkins as the face of the show, posting frequent production updates on social media. Amid the growth, Jenkins has navigated tricky issues. Some evangelicals have slammed the show for its deviations from Scripture, its contemporary dialogue and the characters\u2019 laid-back demeanor (Jesus dropped a wink!). \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s modern at all,\u201d Jenkins pushes back. \u201cI think 2,000 years ago, people laughed and rolled their eyes and said casual things and had metaphors and colloquialisms. The very things that some people feel a little uncomfortable with are the things that have caused the show to be seen by millions of people. It feels modern because we have always seen these characters portrayed like they\u2019re stained glass windows or statues.\u201d Some gripes can be incredibly specific, such as skepticism that Jesus ever wore a backpack. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t have thought of a backpack back then?\u201d Jenkins counters. \u201cTwo straps on a container is just so modern?\u201d There was a larger uproar over Mary Magdalene having a relapse in season two after she was saved. Yet that departure from Scripture led to one of the most affecting moments in the show, particularly among those in the recovery community, when Jesus welcomed her back (\u201cYou redeemed me and I threw it away,\u201d Mary said, and Jesus drolly replied, \u201cIt\u2019s not much of a redemption if it can be lost in a day, is it?). Yet the show\u2019s biggest controversy was sparked by behind-the-scenes footage released last year. An online video included a brief glimpse of a pride flag on a Chosen crewmember\u2019s equipment. That might sound inconsequential, but for a significant segment of The Chosen\u2018s viewership, it was a scandal that incited, as Jenkins dubbed it, an \u201cintra-Christian culture war.\u201d The conservative press accused the show of hypocritically endorsing \u201csin\u201d and going woke (\u201cThe Chosen Can\u2019t Serve Both God and LGBT Activists,\u201d fumed a Federalist headline). Many threatened a boycott if Jenkins didn\u2019t apologize and make changes to his employment practices (\u201cChristians, just like we boycotted Target and Bud Light, we need to boycott The Chosen,\u201d declared right-wing sports writer Jon Root). Jenkins says he was filming an episode when the news broke, and he could see the affected crewmember staring at his phone. \u201cPeople had figured out who he was and were calling for him to be fired,\u201d Jenkins says. \u201cHe was like, \u2018I didn\u2019t want to bring this attention to the show.\u2019 And I told him, \u2018I love you. Do your job. Don\u2019t worry about it. Let me take care of this.'\u201d Jenkins, who politically describes himself as a libertarian, posted a 19-minute response on YouTube. In an age of hypersensitivity to online outrage, and of studio controversies typically being addressed with brief, lawyer-approved PR statements, Jenkins\u2019 message was refreshing in its thoughtful detail and polite-yet-firm refusal to kowtow. \u201cEverybody loves our cast and crew members \u2026 and they have widely different beliefs that go across the entire spectrum,\u201d he says in the video. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a political or religious litmus test for who we hire. We don\u2019t police individual workspaces or social media. If this issue bothers you, that\u2019s fine. But that\u2019s not something for us to be concerned with or try to change. We are not a church.\u201d That last line, however, is a bit debatable. \u201cI TITHE A PORTION OF MY PAYCHECK TO HELP THE SERIES\u201d The Chosen is now a big deal, with some famous fans starting to emerge (\u201cJust finished season 3 of The Chosen and I absolutely love it,\u201d country star Blake Shelton posted on X last week, with Gwen Stefani chiming in, \u201cObsessed!\u201d). Its fan convention, ChosenCon, is going into its second year in September and expected to bring in 5,000 fans. There\u2019s an online merch business (their \u201cBinge Jesus\u201d T-shirt says it all). Earlier this year, Fathom Events screened the show\u2019s upcoming fourth season in theaters. It\u2019s a relationship that began with screening a single Chosen special coming out of the pandemic. \u201cThat was the first time we really got confirmation that we had a tiger by the tail here,\u201d says Fathom CEO Ray Nutt. \u201cThe audience reaction was spectacular.\u201d When fans approach Jesus actor Roumie, they don\u2019t just want a photo. Couples want him to marry them, others want to touch him. They call him Jesus and suspect he might have some kind of healing power. \u201cIt\u2019s not the ordinary kind of celebrity encounters,\u201d Roumie says. \u201cIt\u2019s like people have things deep within their heart that they want to share with you, or they say the show has changed their lives \u2014 they haven\u2019t been to church in 20 years and now they have a relationship with God. I\u2019m a bit of an introvert, so I start to get a little anxiety.\u201d The show has creatively evolved, as has Jenkins\u2019 strength as a director (he\u2019s helmed every episode). In season two, there\u2019s an impressive 13-minute continuous shot showing the disciples busily working a crowd that is waiting to be healed by Jesus. Jenkins\u2019 team worked all day to get the ambitious take and nailed it during the final minutes of daylight. \u201cYou can actually see the sun going down during the shot,\u201d Jenkins says. \u201cAt the end of the take, we ran out of light, and I burst into tears because there had been so much pressure.\u201d One of his proudest moments, Jenkins likes to say, was when he turned on Prime Video and saw The Chosen on the streamer\u2019s most popular list along with Cocaine Bear. If that\u2019s not getting Christ into the cultural mainstream, what is? Yet as the show receives more media attention, there\u2019s a term that makes Jenkins bristle: \u201cfaith-based.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not ashamed that I\u2019m an evangelical,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not ashamed that it\u2019s a show about Jesus. But we really do believe that the show can be watched by anybody, and we just don\u2019t want people turning it off before they watch it because of a label. I\u2019m not trying to, through the art, convert anybody or preach anything. It\u2019s a historical drama.\u201d The show\u2019s internal surveys found that only about half its viewers are practicing Christians. Religion is arguably mixed with the show\u2019s business side, however. It\u2019s hard to imagine a secular show being able to draw 12,000 fans to a Salvation Army camp to appear as extras over three days of filming, making their own costumes, and even paying $1,000 each for the privilege (it\u2019s a savvy TV business model when your extras pay you). Funds for the show\u2019s first three seasons were raised by Angel Studios\u2019 Pay It Forward service \u2014 the same crowdfunded method employed to make the polarizing sex trafficking movie Sound of Freedom a hit. In addition to taking a percentage cut off the top, Angel initially distributed the show exclusively on its app, which, as The Chosen LLC\u2019s president, Brad Pelo, puts it, was \u201cvery, very confining.\u201d In 2022, The Chosen severed part of its Angel Studios relationship, claiming breach of contract, and replaced Pay It Forward with a nonprofit ministry called Come & See. Jenkins posts messages urging fans to make tax-deductible donations to Come & See, and there\u2019s an implicit missionary angle to the pitch: By supporting The Chosen, you\u2019re helping spread Jesus\u2019 message to new audiences around the globe. The ministry also helps to arrange screenings of The Chosen in places such as prisons and churches, and has translated the show into 50 languages (toward an eventual goal of 600). Wrote one viewer on The Chosen\u2018s subreddit, where fans sometimes worry that the show doesn\u2019t have enough money to continue: \u201cI tithe a portion of my paycheck to help fund the series. I get little thank you notes from all over the globe. It\u2019s honestly incredible.\u201d One starts to wonder if Jenkins is the guy who\u2019s not only figured out how to revive biblical epics for the streaming era, but also how to do so for televangelism in the YouTube age. When I press Jenkins as to why he still needs fan money four seasons into a production that\u2019s being heavily consumed across so many platforms, he insists that fan support is essential to the show\u2019s survival and that the streaming deals and merch sales haven\u2019t come close to paying for production. Season four cost $40 million, and season five is only partly funded even as they\u2019re currently filming. The ministry also helped pay for a $50 million production backlot, which includes two full-size soundstages. The Chosen is now in arbitration with Angel, seeking a release from a crucial part of their original deal \u2014 the part that gave Angel the show\u2019s first distribution window, which the show sees as a hurdle to securing traditional backing, and perhaps even stepping away from fan funding. Being available on so many streamers at once, Jenkins says, is a double-edged sword for the show. \u201cAll of the funding for the production currently comes from Come & See; the license agreements we have with the streamers are not big,\u201d Jenkins says. \u201cIt\u2019s not a lot of money because they didn\u2019t have exclusive rights to it. Until there\u2019s an exclusive arrangement, or until somebody gets the first window, we absolutely still have to rely on donations.\u201d The arbitration is also holding up the release of the show\u2019s fourth season, which will get a streaming date as soon as a verdict is rendered. Jenkins contrasts his situation to that of the other disruptive showrunner building a TV empire outside Fort Worth, Texas. \u201cTaylor Sheridan has [MTV Entertainment Studios and 101 Studios] financing his stuff and probably doesn\u2019t have his own company of 65 employees,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have to generate our own profits. We are one of the most watched shows in the world, and yet even successful TV shows aren\u2019t profitable for the first few years. Normally, a studio will say, \u2018Let\u2019s pump money into this show that we have made from our other projects.\u2019 We don\u2019t have that.\u201d Surprisingly, Jenkins and Sheridan haven\u2019t met, though Jenkins would love to have a chat. He has questions about how to successfully grow one show into many. In addition to those Noah and Moses ideas, Jenkins envisions a Chosen sequel about the Book of Acts and the rise of the early church, a Ruth and Boaz movie, and an animated series for kids set in the world of The Chosen. Like Young Jesus? \u201cNot that,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we\u2019re talking about a lot of Old Testament shows and spinoffs; we\u2019ve already laid some Easter eggs for them \u2014 no pun intended. I don\u2019t think the Old Testament is any trickier to do than The Crown or Rome or Vikings. We think we\u2019re close to another tipping point.\u201d THE MOST DEVASTATING CRUCIFIXION EVER? The Chosen\u2018s entire sixth season will cover just one day, Jenkins reveals, with the crucifixion itself taking hours of screen time. The plan isn\u2019t to indulge in Mel Gibson-style torture \u00e0 la The Passion of the Christ, but rather emotional devastation, taking advantage of how viewers will have already spent dozens of hours with Roumie\u2019s yoga-studio-friendly messiah. \u201cIn most portrayals, Jesus is on the cross, and you just see a bunch of people weeping and he\u2019s being tortured and mocked,\u201d Jenkins says. \u201cWe want to stress Jesus\u2019 desire for comfort and connection with his friends and family. And that period of time lasted several hours, which hasn\u2019t been portrayed before. We have the time and I have more tools in my tool belt for the crucifixion than other filmmakers had.\u201d Jenkins likens the season\u2019s potential impact to, of all things, The Walking Dead gorily killing off fan favorite Glenn in season seven. \u201cThat was abnormally upsetting for audiences not just because of what happened, but because by then you cared so much about the person,\u201d he says. A rollout in theaters for seasons five and six is certain (though not yet planned), and in the meantime The Chosen won\u2019t be Jenkins\u2019 only work landing on the big screen. He recently completed filming Lionsgate\u2019s The Best Christmas Pageant Ever, based on Barbara Robinson\u2019s children\u2019s novel about a group of impoverished kids staging a holiday play. The movie will test whether Jenkins can make a believer-nonbeliever crossover hit that\u2019s set in modern times like the other films he tried before The Chosen came along. \u201cIt\u2019s total chaos, and then, because of their poverty and outsider, tossed-aside, disadvantaged status, then end up closer to the story of Jesus than the regular people are,\u201d Jenkins says Jenkins\u2019 father, unsurprisingly, is awfully proud of all this. \u201cSomebody asked me recently when I thought The Chosen would surpass Left Behind in its impact,\u201d Jerry B. Jenkins says. \u201cThat ship sailed a long time ago. The funny thing is Dallas used to be known as \u2018Jerry Jenkins son.\u2019 I\u2019m now known as \u2018Dallas Jenkins father.\u2019 May it ever be so.\u201d Dallas, however, has some concerns. He doesn\u2019t want to be seen as selling out to Hollywood, even though, to some degree, that\u2019s precisely what needs to happen for his company to grow. He worries about screwing up \u2014 specifically, getting canceled. It\u2019s one of the reasons he posts so many candid videos. He wants to put his own failings online so nobody else does it first (and, perhaps, build an army of supporters who will stand by him). \u201cI\u2019m a flawed guy and I don\u2019t want my own flaws to get in the way,\u201d he says. \u201cI used to struggle with pornography. I make inappropriate jokes on the set. My wife always says, \u2018Your mouth\u2019s going to bring you down at some point.\u2019 I don\u2019t want to trip on a land mine.\u201d Especially now, when he\u2019s getting the Hollywood success and status that eluded him for so long. \u201cI used to dream of being in meetings with the people who work for the people I\u2019m meeting with now,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s fun to sit in a room with some of the most powerful people in Hollywood, who say, \u2018We\u2019d love to work with you.\u2019 \u201c Do power players actually watch The Chosen, though? \u201cThere\u2019s always someone else in the room and they\u2019ll say, \u2018For two years, this person has been telling us we need to meet with you because they\u2019re obsessed with it.\u2019 \u201d Yet Jenkins long ago stopped giving those awards speeches to his bathroom mirror. \u201cThis show will never get an Emmy,\u201d he says. He likewise used to make ambitious five-year plans, and swears he doesn\u2019t anymore. \u201cI was always trying to please people,\u201d Jenkins says. \u201cI needed affirmation. I needed to be taken seriously. Now I genuinely \u2014 and I\u2019m not just saying this \u2014 my only goal and hope and dream is to make season five, which I\u2019m making now, as good as it can be, and to be a good husband and father. Some of the things that are happening now are things I used to greatly care about.

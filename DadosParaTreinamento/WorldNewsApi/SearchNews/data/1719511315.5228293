The Saturday Night Takeaway presenter, 48, became a dad for the first time earlier this month when Anne-Marie Corbett gave birth to a baby boy named Wilder Patrick. Following months of speculation about whether Anne-Marie was expecting, their first child together arrived on May 14, news which Ant confirmed via social media with a cute snap. The new parents have kept a low profile since their family expanded \u2013 Ant is already a step-dad to Anne-Marie\u2019s two daughters \u2013 but were seen enjoying the sunshine this week. Clearly still in the baby bubble, the Britain\u2019s Got Talent host and his other half, 46, put on an affectionate display by holding hands. Ant took the lead by pushing their son\u2019s pram, while their beloved Maltipoo dogs, Bumble and Milo, ran beside them. The TV star pushed his newborn son in a pram on a walk with his wife (Picture: W8media/TillenDove) Ant and Anne-Marie were joined by their two dogs (Picture: W8media/TillenDove) Geordie star Ant kept it casual in a patterned shirt and shades, while Anne-Marie wore a loose-fitting sky blue dress, teamed with a navy cardigan and trainers. The couple \u2013 who married in 2021 \u2013 were seen chatting and smiling on their outing to the park, making the most of the nice weather. When announcing Wilder\u2019s birth, Ant wrote online: \u2018Welcome to the family Wilder Patrick McPartlin. \u2018Born, 14/05/24 at 8.54am. \u2018Baby is beautiful, Mummy\u2019s a legend, Sisters are over the moon. Dad\u2019s a mess!\u2019 The adorable announcement included a picture of Ant cuddling his bundle of joy and revealing a family tree tattoo, with the names of his two stepdaughters, Poppy and Daisy, on either side and their pet pooches. Days later, however, Ant was forced to clear up rumours about his arm ink. The pair held hands and put on an affectionate display (Picture: W8media/TillenDove) The TV personality set the record straight when fans expressed outrage as Hurley, the labrador he shares with ex-wife Lisa Armstrong, seemed to be missing. Alongside a new photo of the artwork, the I\u2019m A Celeb host thanked fans for their \u2018kind messages of love\u2019 and was \u2018glad\u2019 they loved the tattoo. He continued: \u2018For all you dog lovers who asked why my beloved Hurley wasn\u2019t on the family tree\u2026 he was!! He was just covered by our newborn. \u2018All my love, gratitude and heartfelt thanks.\u2019 As for Ant\u2019s co-star Declan Donnelly, who also has two young kids, he\u2019s taken on a \u2018special role\u2019 following his best mate\u2019s big life change. In a move that probably won\u2019t come as a shock to many, Dec is believed to be Wilder\u2019s godfather. Ant announced baby Wilder\u2019s arrival via social media, showcasing his family tree tattoo (Picture: Instagam) Ant has been married to ex-PA Anne-Marie for three years (Picture: Wirelmage) Insiders revealed to The Sun that Ant had bestowed the honour upon his longtime friend, also 48. Ant is also reportedly the godfather of Dec\u2019s children, daughter Isla and son Jack, whose middle name is Anthony in tribute to his bestie. The TV titans are due to return to screens next week to host the BGT live semi-finals each night. However, as for other projects, such as Saturday Night Takeaway, Ant and Dec will be taking some time off. Speaking ahead of becoming a father, Ant confirmed that they were putting the entertainment show on pause after 20 series so they could be with loved ones more. \u2018On a more personal level, part of the reason we\u2019re pausing Takeaway is we need a break ourselves, and we need to spend some time with our family,\u2019 he told Fault Magazine. He and Dec are due to take some time off to be with their family (Picture: Karwai Tang/WireImage) They\u2019ll host the Britain\u2019s Got Talent live shows next week (Picture: Dymond/Thames/Syco/Shutterstock) \u2018We\u2019ve both got children that we need to spend time with for a little bit. \u2018We need time to think and, and time to step back and look at the bigger picture and just see where we are now.\u2019 Got a story?

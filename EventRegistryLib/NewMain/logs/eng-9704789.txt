The complaint, filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, also alleges Combs forced English to \"engage in prostitution and sex work\" between 2006 and 2009.\n\nThe lawsuit marks the ninth against Combs since last November and the eighth directly accusing him of sexual assault. One of the eight lawsuits, filed by former girlfriend Cassie Ventura, has been settled. Another lawsuit accused his son Christian Combs of sexual assault, and Sean Combs is accused of aiding and abetting.\n\n\"No matter how many lawsuits are filed it won't change the fact that Mr. Combs has never sexually assaulted or sex trafficked anyone,\" Jonathan Davis, an attorney for Combs said in a statement when asked about English's lawsuit.\n\n\"We live in a world where anyone can file a lawsuit for any reason and without any proof. Fortunately, a fair and impartial judicial process exists to find the truth and Mr. Combs is confident he will prevail against these and other baseless claims in court,\" the attorney added.\n\nEnglish's lawsuit requests a jury trial and seeks an undisclosed amount of punitive damages.\n\nCombs has vehemently denied claims from many of the civil suits but has not responded to all of the allegations. In December 2023, after four lawsuits had been filed against him, Combs posted a fierce denial on his social media, writing that \"sickening allegations\" had been made by accusers \"looking for a quick payday.\"\n\nHe added, \"Let me be absolutely clear: I did not do any of the awful things being alleged.\"\n\nFederal investigators are also preparing to bring accusers of Combs before a federal grand jury, two sources familiar with the probe previously told CNN -- signaling the US Justice Department is moving toward potentially seeking an indictment of Combs.\n\nBringing individuals who have filed civil lawsuits against Combs before a grand jury would mark a significant escalation in the government's ongoing investigation involving the producer and Bad Boy Records founder.\n\nCNN's Nicki Brown, Josh Campbell, Alli Rosenbloom and Gloria Pazmino contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "elizabeth_joseph@cnn.com",

Combs admitted to and apologized for the assault shortly thereafter, noting he \"was disgusted then\" when he did it and is \"disgusted now.\"\n\nVentura, 37, sued Combs in November, accusing him of years of rape, sex trafficking and physical abuse. The suit was settled the following day but followed by other accusers filing their own lawsuits against Combs, alleging sexual assault, harassment and drugging.\n\nIn late May, a source told CNN that Combs could soon face a federal indictment as potential witnesses were being prepared to testify before a grand jury in New York City.\n\nIn the wake of the lawsuits and surveillance video, the Harlem native returned New York's honorary Key to the City, which he was awarded in September.\n\nIn formal letters addressed to Combs' New York and L.A. offices in June, Mayor Eric Adams requested he hand over the key, noting he was \"deeply disturbed\" by what he saw in the footage and that Combs is no longer considered \"a model for fellow and future New Yorkers.\"\n\nAnd just last week in Miami

His lawyer Jonathan Davis said in a statement: \"No matter how many lawsuits are filed it won't change the fact that Mr Combs has never sexually assaulted or sex trafficked anyone. We live in a world where anyone can file a lawsuit for any reason and without any proof.

But at the third event, Combs allegedly demanded she have sex with guests, \"as they had learned about her past in adult entertainment and used it forcefully to coerce Plaintiff into sex work\". The lawsuit names a number of other individuals and companies as defendants.\n\nNumerous other allegations of sexual assault have been made against Combs, beginning in November when his former girlfriend, R&B singer Cassie, accused him of rape and physical abuse. That lawsuit was settled the following day, though Combs was forced to apologise after footage of him physically assaulting Cassie in 2016 was leaked in May.\n\nPlaintiffs Joi Dickerson-Neal, Rodney Jones Jr, April Lampros and Crystal McKinney have each since filed lawsuits alleging sexual assault, along with two others from unnamed women. Combs has denied all of those allegations. Combs is also named in a lawsuit against his son Christian \"King\" Combs, described as a \"lewd and meritless claim\" by a lawyer for both men.\n\nCombs was once one of the most successful rappers in the US, with a string of hit tracks including US No 1 singles Can't Nobody Hold Me Down, I'll Be Missing You and Shake Ya Tailfeather. His label Bad Boy Records was home to popular artists including Notorious BIG and Mase, and he had success with other business ventures such as clothing brand Sean John and vodka brand C\u00eeroc.\n\nBut his reputation has been damaged since the allegations. In recent weeks New York mayor Eric Adams has demanded Combs return the ceremonial key to the city he was awarded in September 2023, while Howard University rescinded Combs' honorary degree, discontinued a scholarship programme in his name and returned a $1m donation.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sean Combs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_trafficking", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sex trafficking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Davis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MDMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual intercourse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plaintiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_work", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sex work"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sex industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassie_Ventura", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cassie Ventura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contemporary_R&B", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Contemporary R&B"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexual_activity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human sexual activity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mase", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can't_Nobody_Hold_Me_Down", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Can't Nobody Hold Me Down"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I'll_Be_Missing_You", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "I'll Be Missing You"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shake_Ya_Tailfeather", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shake Ya Tailfeather"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_John", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sean John"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C\u00eeroc", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "C\u00eeroc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_the_City", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of the City"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Adams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Howard University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Notorious_B.I.G.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Notorious B.I.G."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Boy_Records", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bad Boy Records"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex_Offenses", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex Offenses", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Genderqueer", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Genderqueer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sexual_Addiction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sexual Addiction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Politics_of_Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Politics of Sexuality", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/1bb2ec67006b84bd3451aad18ebb9f0c", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704789", "eventUri": "eng-9704789", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 223, "relevance": 1}

After that encounter with Jacob Arabov (known in the hip-hop world as \"Jacob the Jeweler\"), English was \"passed off\" to other people at Combs' parties who sexually assaulted her, alleges the suit.\n\nWhen English finally escaped Combs' circle in 2009, she says he made good on his threats to cut her and her boyfriend out the industry, the lawsuit claims.\n\nThe documents also name Tamiko Thomas, a woman English describes as the Ghislaine Maxwell to Combs' Jeffrey Epstein, alleging she helped facilitate his sex trafficking, according to TMZ. Additional defendants include Arabov and Combs' Bad Boy Records.\n\nEnglish is the ninth person to file a sex trafficking and/or sexual assault lawsuit against Combs, whose music and media empire has unraveled following a lawsuit from R&B singer Cassie Ventura in November.\n\nIn that suit, Ventura accused Combs of sexual and physical abuse during their yearslong relationship. The two parties settled the suit the following day, but in May, CNN published surveillance video of Combs viciously beating Ventura in a L.A. hotel in 2016.\n\nWhat was seen in the footage closely resembled an incident described by Ventura in her lawsuit.\n\nAuthorities are currently investigating Combs as part of a federal sex trafficking probe, which was confirmed after Homeland Security raided his properties in Miami and Los Angeles in March.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, TMZ reported Combs is selling his L.A. mansion and has no plans to stay in the city.\n\n\u00a92024 New York Daily News.

The four instances of sexual assault allegedly took place over a period of many years, ranging from the mid-1990s to the early-2000s.\n\nFurthermore, the music mogul has also recently been accused of sexually assaulting and drugging a model in 2003. Crystal McKinney alleges that she was forced to perform oral sex on him at his recording studio in New York City in 2003.\n\nThe swathe of lawsuits filed against Combs began last year when his ex-partner, Cassie Ventura, accused him of rape and physical assault. The rapper denied the claims brought forward by Ventura before reaching a settlement with his former partner, bringing the case to a close.\n\nHowever, in May, footage emerged of Combs attacking Ventura at a hotel in 2016, which he issued an apology for on social media. While Combs previously denied being violent toward Ventura, he accepted \"full responsibility\" for the attack, adding, \"I was disgusted when I did it. I'm disgusted now,\" he says in the video. The rapper also described the period as \"the darkest times\" in his life.\n\nNow, Combs is at the centre of another lawsuit, which has been initiated by former adult film star Adria English. She alleges that she was forced to have sex with guests at a party hosted by Combs, and that he also forced her to consume ecstasy and alchohol.\n\nThe alleged events occurred between 2004 and 2009, according to the lawsuit, which claims that \"Combs groomed Plaintiff into sex trafficking over time\". The case states the coercion began at one of Combs' \"white parties\" in 2004 when Combs allegedly made her have sex with a guest \"as they had learned about her past in adult entertainment and used it forcefully to coerce Plaintiff into sex work\".\n\nBefore attending the party, English had assumed there was \"no sinister intent or requirements for physical sexual contact\".\n\nThe new allegation has been denied by Combs. In a statement, his lawyer, Jonathan Davis, rebuffed the claims: \"No matter how many lawsuits are filed it won't change the fact that Mr Combs has never sexually assaulted or sex trafficked anyone. We live in a world where anyone can file a lawsuit for any reason and without any proof.\"\n\nDavis concluded: \"Fortunately, a fair and impartial judicial process exists to find the truth and Mr Combs is confident he will prevail against these and other baseless claims in court.\"\n\nThis is a developing story.", "source": {"uri": "faroutmagazine.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Far Out Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_taysom@faroutmagazine.co.uk", "name": "Joe Taysom", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sean Combs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventura,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ventura, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ventura, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_Institute_of_Technology", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fashion Institute of Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_sex", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oral sex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_misconduct", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual misconduct"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassie_Ventura", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cassie Ventura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plaintiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_trafficking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sex trafficking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_work", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sex work"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sex industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Davis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coercion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coercion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MDMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexual_activity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human sexual activity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex_Offenses", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex Offenses", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sexual_Addiction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sexual Addiction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Politics_of_Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Politics of Sexuality", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/static/uploads/1/2024/02/Sean-'Diddy-Combs-2023-Far-Out-Magazine.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704789", "eventUri": "eng-9704789", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.5529411764705883, "wgt": 222, "relevance": 1}

Cassie Ventura, a former girlfriend, has reached a settlement in one of the eight cases.

Combs' lawyers did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nA subject of an investigation is someone who is within the scope of a criminal investigation, according to legal experts. An individual is designated a target when prosecutors likely intend to seek an indictment from the grand jury against the person.\n\nA person's status can be upgraded or downgraded during an investigation. Combs has not received a target letter, the sources said, and the Southern District of New York is not required to send one.\n\nThis news comes three months after Combs' houses were raided in both Los Angeles and Miami by law enforcement officials.\n\nIn May, Combs apologized after a video, obtained by CNN, showed him beating his then girlfriend Cassandra \"Cassie\" Ventura at a Los Angeles hotel in 2016.\n\nIn a video apology posted to his Instagram, Combs admitted to the incident and said he took \"full responsibility.\"\n\n\"It's so difficult to reflect on the darkest times in your life, but sometimes you got to do that,\" Combs said. \"I was f---ed up -- I mean, I hit rock bottom -- but I make no excuses.\"\n\nCombs initially denied Ventura's allegations of assault and sex trafficking which she described in a federal lawsuit filed in November. The two settled for an undisclosed amount the following day.\n\nAt the time of Combs' admission of the assault, an attorney for Ventura, Meredith Firetog, said, \"When Cassie and multiple other women came forward, he denied everything and suggested that his victims were looking for a payday.\"\n\nFiretog added, \"That he was only compelled to 'apologize' once his repeated denials were proven false shows his pathetic desperation.\"\n\nVentura's attorneys did not respond to a question from NBC News regarding whether she has been called to take part in any grand jury proceedings.\n\nMeanwhile, Combs has been accused of a wide range of allegations in multiple civil lawsuits. The latest lawsuit was filed on Wednesday, accusing Combs of sex trafficking by a former adult film star.\n\nThe former music executive has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and has not been charged with a crime. Jonathan Davis, attorney for Sean Diddy Combs, dismissed the latest lawsuit.\n\n\"No matter how many lawsuits are filed, it won't change the fact that Mr. Combs has never sexually assaulted or sex trafficked anyone,\" Davis said. \"We live in a world where anyone can file a lawsuit for any reason and without any proof.

Meanwhile, he's also facing yet another lawsuit in a series of civil claims brought against him by women who say he assaulted or trafficked them during the height of his fame.\n\nThe allegations against Combs have snowballed since last November, when ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura filed a bombshell lawsuit claiming sexual assault and coercion, domestic violence, and other acts of abuse. He settled with Ventura the day after she filed, but denied the allegations. Several lawsuits from other women followed, apparently emboldened by Ventura's claims. Combs has denied these allegations, as well.\n\nThe release of security footage mentioned by Ventura in her suit shook those who believed Combs's claims of innocence: in a video from 2016, Combs was seen shoving and striking Ventura as she struggled to escape a hotel room. Combs eventually admitted to the attack via an Instagram video that he has since deleted.\n\nCalifornia's criminal case statute of limitations means he can't be charged for the admitted attack on Ventura, but a Homeland Security-led raid of his homes in March suggested that officials believed Combs might be involved in other illegal activities. Last month, it was reported that federal officials were working to convene a grand jury in Manhattan to weigh evidence against Combs, with prosecutors combing through the allegations made in the multiple civil cases against him for any useful details.\n\nThose prosecutors now have an additional civil case to examine, as numerous media outlets report that a woman named Adria English filed suit against Combs on Wednesday, saying that as a former employee of the entrepreneur's, she was was \"groomed... into sex trafficking over time.\"\n\nEnglish, who says she worked at Combs's annual Labor Day \"White Party\" at his Hamptons home, says the job had no \"requirements for physical sexual contact and seemed to be a legitimate employment opportunity\" when she accepted it, but after working three such events, Combs \"demanded\" that she \"begin engaging in vaginal sexual intercourse with guests, as they had learned about her past in adult entertainment and used it forcefully to coerce Plaintiff into sex work.\" (Under the name \"Omunique,\" English had previously been employed in the adult film industry. She says that Combs did not hire her to work in that capacity.)\n\nPage Six reports that one of the guests she was reportedly trafficked to was Jacob Arabov, a man once known as \"Hip-Hop's Jeweler\" for his relationships with folks in the R&B music industry. Arabov, also known as \"Jacob the Jeweler,\" was jailed in 2008 as part of a federal investigation into a Detroit-area drug ring. He has since been released. (Vanity Fair's efforts to reach Arabov were unsuccessful as of publication time.)\n\n\"At the end of the night, Defendant Combs, personally congratulated Plaintiff for following his directives with Defendant Jacob and a job well done,\" the lawsuit states. At subsequent parties, she was also coerced into additional nonconsensual acts as a victim of Combs's \"ongoing corrupt sex trafficking organization,\" her suit claims.\n\nVia statement, Combs attorney Jonathan Davis issued a denial, saying \"No matter how many lawsuits are filed, it won't change the fact that Mr. Combs has never sexually assaulted or sex trafficked anyone. We live in a world where anyone can file a lawsuit for any reason and without any proof. Fortunately, a fair and impartial judicial process exists to find the truth and Mr. Combs is confident he will prevail against these and other baseless claims in court.\"\n\nBut before he gets to the civil courthouse, Combs might be defending himself in a criminal courtroom in New York. According to NBC News, Combs's attorneys have been notified \"by federal authorities in the Southern District of New York that he is a subject of an ongoing criminal investigation.\"\n\nA federal grand jury is currently hearing evidence gathered by prosecutors and law enforcement as part of a probe into Combs and his activities, NBC also reports. It's unclear, however, if any charges against Combs are expected in the coming days, as spokespeople for the U.S. Attorney's Office are on holiday break and were unavailable for comment as of publication time.", "source": {"uri": "vanityfair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vanity Fair"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conde_nast@vanityfair.com", "name": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "type": "author",

The complaint marks the ninth sexual assault lawsuit filed against the rapper since last November, when his ex-girlfriend Casandra \"Cassie\" Ventura filed a lawsuit in which she described being abused by Combs.\n\nAdria English, an adult film actor who says she worked for Combs from 2004 to 2009, accuses the rapper of conducting and participating in a RICO enterprise, sexual assault, sexual harassment and sex trafficking, according to legal documents reviewed by The Times. The 114-page complaint raises more than 30 allegations against Combs, several of his business ventures, celebrity jeweler Jacob \"Jacob the Jeweler\" Arabo, a woman who allegedly facilitated the rapper's sex trafficking and two media companies, in addition to unnamed individuals.\n\n\"No matter how many lawsuits are filed it won't change the fact that Mr. Combs has never sexually assaulted or sex trafficked anyone,\" Jonathan Davis, an attorney for Combs, told The Times in a statement. \"We live in a world where anyone can file a lawsuit for any reason and without any proof. Fortunately, a fair and impartial judicial process exists to find the truth and Mr. Combs is confident he will prevail against these and other baseless claims in court.\"\n\nIn the lawsuit, English details her account of working at Combs' various high-profile \"white parties\" at his residences in New York and Florida, where she alleges she was \"demanded\" to engage in sexual intercourse with guests, including Arabo. English accuses Combs of forcing her to have sexual intercourse with Arabo in 2007, noting in the lawsuit that refusing the hip-hop star's \"demands was not an option.\"\n\nA representative for Arabo did not immediately respond to The Times' request for comment.\n\nEnglish accuses Combs of threatening to \"blackball [her] from the entertainment industry\" and her then-boyfriend from the modeling industry if she did not engage in sex work at the parties. In 2009, English left New York and returned to California, where she currently resides. The lawsuit says that was English's \"only way to escape\" Combs.\n\nEnglish filed her complaint months after U.S. Department of Homeland Security agents conducted searches of Combs' Holmby Hills and Miami mansions in March as part of a federal inquiry into sex trafficking allegations involving Combs. It's unclear whether English's allegations are related to that inquiry. TMZ reported Wednesday that Combs is seeking to sell that Holmby Hills mansion for $70 million.\n\nIn addition to Combs and the companies and individuals who allegedly participated and facilitated his white parties, English is suing music magazine Vibe and its owner Penske Media Corporation. She alleges the media companies provided Combs the resources to throw his parties, inflicted emotional distress connected to the alleged sex trafficking, and publicized her likeness in a November 2006 magazine issue about the parties.\n\nEnglish is asking for damages including Vibe and PMC's profits from the November 2006 magazine, legal fees, losses and \"further legal and equitable relief as deemed proper.\" She wants a trial by jury.", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He originally purchased the home for $40 million in 2014.\n\nSources reportedly said Combs, \"wants out of LA\" and has been spending most of his time in Miami.\n\nEarlier this year, federal agents raided Combs' homes in Miami and Los Angeles as part of a sex trafficking investigation. He is also facing lawsuits from other accusers alleging sexual misconduct and abuse.\n\nAs CrimeOnline previously reported, the reported raids occurred four months after his ex, Cassie Ventura, accused him of sex trafficking and abuse. In a multimillion-dollar lawsuit, she alleged that Combs drugged her and forced her to have sex with other men. The pair settled the lawsuit a day after its filing.\n\nPrevious Video Coverage\n\nTwo more accusers came forward a week after Cassie. One of the women claimed Combs drugged and raped her at Syracuse University in New York in 1991. Combs denied those allegations before a third accuser, named Liza Gardner, levied similar allegations against him.\n\nIn that case, Gardner claimed Combs and singer-songwriter Aaron Hall drugged and raped her and a friend following an Uptown Records event in 1990. Gardner said she was 16 at the time of the incident. She also accused Combs of choking her a day after the assault.\n\nCombs has repeatedly denied allegations of sexual assault.

Court documents obtained by TMZ reveal that she is claiming she was threatened with being blacklisted from the music industry if she didn't comply with Combs's demands.\n\nCombs has vehemently refuted all accusations levelled against him, with his legal representatives slamming the claims as opportunistic \"money grabs,\" \"baseless\" or \"sickening.\"\n\nThe lawsuit, filed by lawyers Ariel Mitchell-Kidd, Esq. and Steven Metcalf, Esq, sees the adult star alleging she endured emotional trauma including \"intimacy issues\" and \"painful memories,\" following the alleged sex trafficking.\n\nThe claimant alleges in the lawsuit that she and her then-unnamed boyfriend encountered Combs in 2004 when he was auditioning for a potential modelling job. She claims that Combs demanded sexual acts from them immediately, asking the couple to perform oral sex on him to secure the job.\n\nHer then-boyfriend reportedly turned down a sexual proposition but later accepted a job with Combs after being approached by one of his associates. He was allegedly offered a modelling gig on the condition that she would dance at Combs' White Party in the Hamptons on Labor Day.\n\nIn her lawsuit, the claimant alleged that she and her boyfriend agreed to the terms, and she submitted photos as evidence of her working at the high-profile event. Post-Labor Day, she claimed her work for the rapper continued, where she was allegedly made to consume alcohol spiked with drugs like ecstasy and encouraged to mingle flirtatiously with party-goers, as per the report.\n\nShe went on to allege that while initially not required to engage in sexual activities, over time she felt \"groomed\" into sex trafficking by the music mogul. She asserted in the legal documents that Combs once coerced her into having sex with another hip hop artist.\n\nFollowing what she described as \"forced sexual intercourse\" with the man in question, the claimant said she received an extra $1,000 from Combs and was personally \"congratulated\" by him.\n\nShe has alleged that following a distressing incident, her situation deteriorated as she found herself being \"passed off\" to Combs' friends at his gatherings, where she claims further sexual assaults occurred. She is also taking legal action against another woman, accusing her of orchestrating what English describes as Combs' sex trafficking ring.\n\nThe news emerges amidst the backdrop of an ongoing sex trafficking probe and multiple sexual assault legal battles involving the I'll Be Missing You artist. The father of seven is currently embroiled in several civil lawsuits alleging sex trafficking, sexual abuse, and rape.\n\nOn the latest claim, Combs' attorney Jonathan Davis has told TMZ: \"No matter how many lawsuits are filed it won't change the fact that Mr. Combs has never sexually assaulted or sex trafficked anyone.

Multiple people have filed civil lawsuits against him, claiming he coerced them into sex, using his status and drugs.\n\nThe raids came four months after ex Cassie Ventura filed an explosive lawsuit and then settled it with him the next day. More accusers followed.\n\nThen came the release of a video showing Combs, who has denied all claims against him, savagely beating Ventura in a hotel hallway, just as she said he did in her lawsuit. After the release of the video, Combs released his own video on social meda admitting that he had beaten Ventura and saying he was now a better man.\n\nThe latest lawsuit filed against Combs came this week from an adult film star who accused him of sex trafficking.\n\nAn attorney, Jonathan Davis, denied those allegations on behalf of his client, calling them \"baseless claims.\"\n\nFor the latest true crime and justice news, subscribe to the 'Crime Stories with Nancy Grace' podcast.", "source": {"uri": "crimeonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Crime Online"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kc_wildmoon@crimeonline.com", "name": "Kc Wildmoon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sean Combs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grand jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_trafficking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sex trafficking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Grace", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Grace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "True crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassie_Ventura", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cassie Ventura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventura,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ventura, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ventura, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Davis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://co-a2.azureedge.net/co-static/images/co_540x540.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704789", "eventUri": "eng-9704789", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

Details of what precisely the grand jury is looking at have yet to be revealed.\n\nThe outlet reports that federal authorities notified Combs' legal team last week that he was the subject of an ongoing criminal investigation. However, it was stated that there is no indication that charges are imminent and that Combs has not received a target letter.\n\nAn individual is labeled a target when prosecutors likely intend to seek an indictment from the grand jury against the person, according to legal experts (though the Southern District of New York is not required to send one). A person's status can also be upgraded or downgraded during the course of an investigation.\n\nCombs has faced multiple allegations of sexual assault and sex trafficking from several women over the past seven months and had his properties in Los Angeles and Miami raided by law enforcement back in March.\n\nIn May, CNN obtained security surveillance footage from a Los Angeles hotel that showed Combs assaulting his then-girlfriend, the singer Cassie Ventura, in 2016. Combs settled a federal lawsuit filed by Ventura last November.\n\nAfter the security footage was released, Combs, who had originally denied Ventura's claims, took to Instagram where he shared an apology video.\n\n\"It's so difficult to reflect on the darkest times in your life, but sometimes you got to do that,\" Combs said in the video. \"I was f**ked up...

Jacob The Jeweler). She alleges that the trio was \"aided and abetted\" by several companies also named as defendants in the complaint, including Bad Boy Entertainment, Combs Global Enterprises, Sean John Holdings, VIBE magazine and its current parent company, Penske Media Corporation (PMC). (PMC did not own VIBE when the alleged events occurred.)\n\nNotably, the complaint alleges that the actions of all defendants amounted to a violation of federal RICO (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations) laws, which have historically been used to target the mafia, drug cartels and other organized crime rings (a similar state-level law in Georgia has formed the basis of prosecutors' case against rapper Young Thug, whom they allege leads a violent Atlanta street gang known as Young Slime Life). These types of racketeering laws make it easier for prosecutors to sweep up members of alleged criminal enterprises based on many individual actions.\n\nEnglish claims she first came into contact with Combs in 2004 -- when she says she was working as a dancer at Larry Flynt's Hustler Club in Manhattan -- after accompanying her then-boyfriend, model Anthony Gallo, to an audition for a Sean John modeling campaign. While at the audition, she says Gallo and another model were asked to perform fellatio on Combs as a condition of booking the job. After Gallo refused, she claims he was later told he could book the campaign if he commanded English to work as a go-go dancer at Combs' Labor Day White Party in the Hamptons, N.Y. \"In an effort to assist Mr. Gallo's desire to become a model, Plaintiff agreed to what she believed to be legitimate employment,\" the complaint reads.\n\nWhile working the event, English says she was instructed to give lap dances and be \"sexually flirtatious\" with guests and \"forced to consume liquor and illicit narcotics,\" including bottles she claims were laced with ecstasy. She alleges she was subsequently invited to perform at additional White Parties, where Combs and Thomas -- whom she compares to Ghislaine Maxwell, the former associate of late sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein -- eventually \"groomed\" her into sex trafficking.\n\nBy her third White Party, English claims that Combs and Thomas demanded she partake in sexual intercourse with guests, using knowledge of her past work in adult films \"to coerce\" her into doing so. This activity, she claims, continued through 2009 at White Parties thrown at Combs' Hampton and Miami residences.\n\nOne of the men English says she was forced to have sexual intercourse with during this period was Jacob Arabov (Jacob The Jeweler) at the behest of Combs, as she feared she could lose her job along with her boyfriend's future modeling opportunities. \"Plaintiff, fearing not only her safety, but her and her then-boyfriend's job security, did as instruct and went with Defendant Jacob where she engaged in forced sexual intercourse with Defendant Jacob at the demand and behest of Defendant Combs,\" the complaint reads.\n\nEnglish further alleges that Combs kept hidden cameras in every room of his Hamptons and Miami homes and believes her sexual assaults were caught on tape, including when she was \"unconscious.\"\n\nDuring this period, English also alleges that VIBE magazine published an image of her in a November 2006 story about Combs' White Parties without her consent, claiming its use violates her \"rights to privacy via misappropriation.\" She claims she \"did not discover the infringing use\" until April 2024. She further accuses VIBE and parent company PMC of \"intentionally and falsely marketing and promoting\" Combs' White Parties \"as a high-profile networking and social event in an effort to disguise and deceive the real intent of the event...and to further the goals of the Defendants illegal and criminal Enterprise.\"\n\nEnglish says she continued putting up with Combs' demands in part due to promises that he would help her break into the music business by putting her in an all-female music group. She says she finally detached herself from Combs when she returned to California in 2009, at which point she claims she suffered from deep depression and anxiety in response to the past trauma of being assaulted and trafficked, along with her unraveling career.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, English's victimization at the hands of Combs and his alleged co-conspirators has led her to suffer continued \"extreme emotional distress\" that has impacted every aspect of her personal life.\n\nIn a statement sent to Billboard, Combs' attorney Jonathan Davis said, \"No matter how many lawsuits are filed it won't change the fact that Mr. Combs has never sexually assaulted or sex trafficked anyone. We live in a world where anyone can file a lawsuit for any reason and without any proof. Fortunately, a fair and impartial judicial process exists to find the truth and Mr. Combs is confident he will prevail against these and other baseless claims in court.\"\n\nBillboard reached out to Thomas and Arabov for comment but had not heard back by press time. PMC declined to comment.\n\nThis is the 10th sexual misconduct lawsuit to be filed against Combs since his ex-girlfriend, pop star Cassie, made waves with her sexual abuse suit against the mogul in November, which was settled less than 24 hours later. He has vehemently denied all cases against him. Combs' Miami and Los Angeles homes were raided by federal agents in March, though no arrests were made.\n\nIn May, disturbing footage obtained by CNN showed Combs abusing Cassie in an elevator bank at a Los Angeles hotel in March 2016. Soon after the footage came out, Combs apologized for his actions, which he says he was \"disgusted\" by.\n\n\"I was f -- ed up. I mean, I hit rock bottom. But I make no excuses,\" he said in the since-deleted Instagram clip. \"My behavior on that video is inexcusable. I take full responsibility for my actions in that video. I'm disgusted. I was disgusted then when I did it, I'm disgusted now.\"\n\nIn the wake of the allegations, the fallout for Combs has continued to reverberate. Last month, his media company Revolt announced employees would become the company's largest shareholders after Combs reportedly sold his stake to an anonymous buyer. Also in June, Combs' Miami Day honor was revoked and Howard University withdrew an honorary degree it bestowed upon him.", "source": {"uri": "billboard.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Billboard"},

Details of what precisely the grand jury is looking at have yet to be revealed.\n\nThe outlet reports that federal authorities notified Combs' legal team last week that he was the subject of an ongoing criminal investigation. However, it was stated that there is no indication that charges are imminent and that Combs has not received a target letter.\n\nAn individual is labeled a target when prosecutors likely intend to seek an indictment from the grand jury against the person, according to legal experts (though the Southern District of New York is not required to send one). A person's status can also be upgraded or downgraded during the course of an investigation.\n\nCombs has faced multiple allegations of sexual assault and sex trafficking from several women over the past seven months and had his properties in Los Angeles and Miami raided by law enforcement back in March.\n\nIn May, CNN obtained security surveillance footage from a Los Angeles hotel that showed Combs assaulting his then-girlfriend, the singer Cassie Ventura, in 2016. Combs settled a federal lawsuit filed by Ventura last November.\n\nRelated\n\n'The View': Alyssa Farah Griffin Reveals Surviving Abuse While Discussing Sean Combs Attack Video\n\nAfter the security footage was released, Combs, who had originally denied Ventura's claims, took to Instagram where he shared an apology video.\n\n\"It's so difficult to reflect on the darkest times in your life, but sometimes you got to do that,\" Combs said in the video. \"I was f**ked up... I mean, I hit rock bottom -- but I make no excuses... I take full responsibility.\"\n\nSince the allegations came to light, Hulu scrapped a planned reality series centered on Combs and his seven children, and Howard University stripped the producer of his honors.\n\nIf you or someone you know is the victim of domestic abuse, contact the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233.\n\nIf you or someone you know is the victim of sexual assault, contact the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network's National Helpline at 1-800-656-HOPE (4673).

This time, the allegations come from former adult film star Adria English.\n\nAccording to the latest lawsuit, English accuses Diddy of grooming her for sex trafficking while she was employed by him.\n\nEnglish claims that she was subjected to calculated grooming schemes where Diddy hired her to work at his famed Hamptons Labor Day \"white parties\" as a go-go dancer.\n\nShe alleges that during her nearly two-decade-long tenure at these annual parties, she was \"required\" to consume narcotics provided at the events. English asserts that Diddy often laced the liquor with ecstasy and gave her explicit instructions to drink from specific bottles.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, English was trafficked from 2004 to 2009 by Diddy, Tamika Thomas, and Jacob Arabov, also known as \"Jacob the Jeweler\" of Jacob & Co. \"Despite being forced to drink copious amounts of alcohol and consume illicit narcotics, the encounters Plaintiff was forced to endure were so excruciating that they still haunt her to this day,\" reads the legal document.\n\nInitially, English believed the 2004 \"White Party\" to be a legitimate employment opportunity with no sinister intentions. However, around the third party, she alleges that Diddy \"demanded\" she start engaging in sexual activities with guests, leveraging her past in adult entertainment to coerce her into sex work. She further claims that the increased demand for drug and alcohol consumption rendered her unable to recall details from subsequent Miami \"White Parties.\"\n\nAccording to NBC News, Combs is currently the subject of an ongoing federal criminal investigation in New York. A grand jury in the Southern District of New York is hearing evidence as part of the probe. While no specific details have emerged, sources confirm that Combs and his attorneys were formally notified of the grand jury proceedings last week.\n\n\"This is the next step in the process for Mr. Combs as the investigation continues,\" a law enforcement official stated. The official added that Combs has not received a target letter, indicating prosecutors are likely to seek an indictment.\n\nLaw enforcement officials raided Combs' residences in Los Angeles and Miami three months ago. These recent developments follow a series of sexual assault allegations against Combs over the past seven months.\n\nThe allegations culminated in the release of a video in May, obtained by CNN, showing Combs beating his then-girlfriend, Cassandra \"Cassie\" Ventura, at a Los Angeles hotel in 2016. Combs settled a federal lawsuit filed by Ventura last November, just one day after it was filed.\n\nLast update on 2024-07-04 / Affiliate links / Images from Amazon Product Advertising API", "source": {"uri": "socialitelife.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Socialite Life"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_trafficking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sex trafficking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_grooming", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Child grooming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sean Combs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Narcotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liquor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go-go_dancing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Go-go dancing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MDMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Labor Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Arabo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jacob Arabo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_drink", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alcoholic drink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_work", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sex work"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sex industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_party_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Third party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_trafficking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human trafficking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexual_activity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human sexual activity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plaintiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventura,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ventura, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ventura, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex_Offenses", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex Offenses", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Politics_of_Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Politics of Sexuality", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://socialitelife.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/diddy-sean-combs-lede-07042024.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704789", "eventUri": "eng-9704789", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

She likened Thomas to Ghislaine Maxwell, who was found guilty of child sex trafficking and other offences in 2021 in connection with now-deceased convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nEnglish claimed she worked for Combs under the impression that he would help advance her career in music. However, she alleged that he used her career aspirations against her with threats to blackball her from the industry.\n\nAlthough she allegedly stopped working for the Bad Boy Records exec after five years, English claimed Combs made good on his threats and ruined any chance she had in the music industry.\n\nEnglish claimed she also suffered emotional trauma, such as intimacy issues and painful memories, as a result of the alleged sex trafficking.\n\nShe is seeking unspecified damages.\n\nReps for Combs did not immediately respond to our requests for comment.\n\nEnglish is the eighth person to file a lawsuit against the I Need a Girl rapper in the last nine months.\n\nIn November 2023, Combs' ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura opened the floodgates when she accused him of rape and abuse during their nearly 10-year romance.\n\nSoon after, several other people came forward with claims of sexual assault -- including Combs' former producer Rodney \"Lil Rod\" Jones.\n\nJones claimed the music mogul repeatedly sexually assaulted him and would allegedly grope his genitals and touch his anus to groom him into having sex.\n\nCombs has denied all the accusations levied against him.\n\nIn May, it was reported that federal prosecutors were preparing to bring Combs' accusers in front of a grand jury, indicating that the US Justice Department would be moving toward seeking an indictment against him.", "source": {"uri": "news.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "News.com.au"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki",

Three months after his two Los Angeles and Miami properties were raided by law enforcement, the 54-year-old was hit with another lawsuit by a woman named Adria English.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit obtained by TMZ on Wednesday, July 3, English accused Combs of asking her partner and another model at the time to perform oral sex on him in order to get a Sean John modeling gig. After the two allegedly refused to do so, English claimed that her partner was given another chance as long as she worked as a \"go-go dancer\" at Combs' Hamptons party in 2004.\n\nAfter that, English -- who worked under her porn star name Omunique at the time -- noted in the lawsuit that she worked for Diddy's parties frequently. Eventually, however, she was allegedly expected to have sex with guests, inducing jeweler Jacob Arabov, per the lawsuit. English claimed she had \"forced sexual intercourse\" with Arabov, and Combs congratulated her afterward by paying her an additional $1,000.\n\nElsewhere in the lawsuit, English claimed she was sexually assaulted by people whom she did not name and that she was expected to have sex with other party guests while working for Diddy for about five years.\n\nIn response to the latest lawsuit, Combs' lawyer, Jonathan Davis, denied English's claims in a statement obtained by TMZ.\n\n\"No matter how many lawsuits are filed, it won't change the fact that Mr. Combs has never sexually assaulted or sex trafficked anyone,\" the statement read. \"We live in a world where anyone can file a lawsuit for any reason and without any proof. Fortunately, a fair and impartial judicial process exists to find the truth and Mr. Combs is confident he will prevail against these and other baseless claims in court.\"\n\nDiddy has had a controversial year. Toward the end of 2023, he was sued by his ex Cassie Ventura for sexual and physical abuse, but they quickly settled the lawsuit. By early 2024, similar accusations from other people surfaced against the Bad Boy Records founder. In May, surveillance footage from 2016 was released of Diddy beating and dragging Ventura. The record producer publicly apologized in an Instagram video.\n\nIf you or anyone you know has been sexually abused, call the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 1-800-656-HOPE (4673).

Details of what precisely the grand jury is looking at have yet to be revealed.\n\nThe outlet reports that federal authorities notified Combs' legal team last week that he was the subject of an ongoing criminal investigation. However, it was stated that there is no indication that charges are imminent and that Combs has not received a target letter.\n\nAn individual is labeled a target when prosecutors likely intend to seek an indictment from the grand jury against the person, according to legal experts (though the Southern District of New York is not required to send one). A person's status can also be upgraded or downgraded during the course of an investigation.\n\nCombs has faced multiple allegations of sexual assault and sex trafficking from several women over the past seven months and had his properties in Los Angeles and Miami raided by law enforcement back in March.\n\nIn May, CNN obtained security surveillance footage from a Los Angeles hotel that showed Combs assaulting his then-girlfriend, the singer Cassie Ventura, in 2016. Combs settled a federal lawsuit filed by Ventura last November.\n\nRelated'The View': Alyssa Farah Griffin Reveals Surviving Abuse While Discussing Sean Combs Attack Video\n\nAfter the security footage was released, Combs, who had originally denied Ventura's claims, took to Instagram where he shared an apology video.\n\nMore from this section Euphoria 10 Shocking Behind the Scenes Moments Pink Apologizes for Abruptly Canceling Concert: 'I'm Unable to Continue' Twisters: A Look Inside (Featurette)\n\n\"It's so difficult to reflect on the darkest times in your life, but sometimes you got to do that,\" Combs said in the video. \"I was f**ked up... I mean, I hit rock bottom -- but I make no excuses... I take full responsibility.\"\n\nSince the allegations came to light, Hulu scrapped a planned reality series centered on Combs and his seven children, and Howard University stripped the producer of his honors.\n\nIf you or someone you know is the victim of domestic abuse, contact the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233.\n\nIf you or someone you know is the victim of sexual assault, contact the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network's National Helpline at 1-800-656-HOPE (4673).

The 54-year-old also wants to make some profit off the property as his asking price is $70 million.\n\nThe property is said to boast of amenities including a two-main story house with a living space covering 17,000 square feet, a 35-seat theater, a gym, and a wine room, per The Los Angeles Times. The property also has a separate 3,000-square-foot building as well as a lagoon-style swimming pool and a grotto.\n\nBut in March, agents with Homeland Security raided Combs' Los Angeles and Miami mansions in connection with a federal sex trafficking investigation. CNN also reported that federal investigators were making arrangements for Combs' accusers to appear before a New York City grand jury.\n\nCombs has since decided to part ways with Los Angeles, TMZ reported, adding that he now usually spends his time in Miami. As previously reported by Face2Face Africa, Combs currently remains under public scrutiny after CNN shared a video of him assaulting his ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura at a Los Angeles hotel in 2016.\n\nThe rapper and music executive had initially denied allegations of rape and abuse from Cassie. But he later issued an apology on social media after the circulation of the video.\n\nCombs and Cassie started dating in 2007 and had an on-and-off relationship for over 10 years. The American music mogul signed Cassie to his label in 2005 when she was 19 and he was 37.\n\nAnd Cassie, now 37, initially filed a lawsuit in New York federal court alleging that Combs brought her into his \"ostentatious, fast-paced, and drug-fueled lifestyle\" after she met him. The lawsuit further alleged that Combs was \"prone to uncontrollable rage\" and physically abused her during their relationship including punching, beating, kicking, and stomping on her. It alleged that Combs urged Cassie to use drugs and forced her to have sex with other men while he masturbated and filmed. The lawsuit was later dismissed after both parties reached an undisclosed settlement.\n\nCombs is additionally facing multiple sexual assault lawsuits.", "source": {"uri": "face2faceafrica.com",

However, it's not been reported what the criminal investigation relates to specifically.\n\nCombs is currently facing a number of lawsuits that have been filed over the last year, with the latest claims following a video shared in May that saw him appear to attack his ex-girlfriend, singer Cassie. Following the video going viral online, Howard University stripped Diddy of his honorary degree.\n\nIn November, Cassie filed a lawsuit against him on allegations of physical and sexual abuse, which Diddy denied. They then settled the lawsuit \"to mutual satisfaction\" a day after it was filed.\n\nMeanwhile, the mother of late rap legend The Notorious B.I.G. - who worked closely with Diddy throughout his career - said in May that she wanted to \"slap the daylights\" out of him.", "source": {"uri": "nme.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NME Music News, Reviews, Videos, Galleries, Tickets and Blogs | NME.COM"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adam_england@nme.com", "name": "Adam England", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_trafficking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sex trafficking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sean Combs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Howard University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Notorious_B.I.G.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Notorious B.I.G."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sex_Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sex Education", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Politics_of_Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Politics of Sexuality", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Advice", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sexology", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sexology", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sean-Diddy-Combs-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704789", "eventUri": "eng-9704789", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-03", "textStart": 362, "textEnd": 368}], "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

substantial evidence linking him or her to the commission of a crime.\"\n\nA law enforcement official confirmed to Deadline Wednesday night that Diddy and his legal team were formally notified of the proceedings last week, but did not give details on what claims the investigation involves.\n\nA spokesperson for the U.S. attorney's office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.\n\nNews of the alleged criminal investigation comes after yet another sex trafficking lawsuit was filed on Wednesday against the Grammy-winning rapper.\n\nAdria English, a former porn star who used Omunique as her stage name, has accused Combs of forcing her to drink alcohol laced with narcotics and have sex with multiple people at his notorious parties, according to documents obtained by TMZ.\n\nEnglish is the ninth person to file a sex trafficking and/or sexual assault lawsuit against Combs, whose music and media empire has unraveled following a lawsuit from R&B singer Cassie Ventura in November.\n\nVentura accused Combs of sex trafficking, rape and physical abuse during their years-long relationship, with one alleged incident closely resembling what was later seen in hotel surveillance video of Combs assaulting Ventura in 2016, published by CNN in May.\n\nWhile the two parties settled the suit in a single day, multiple others came forward with similar lawsuits

However, there have been no indications that charges will be brought against Combs soon. He has not received a target letter which is sent by a US attorney if it is believed that there is substantial evidence linking them to the commission of a crime. However, SDNY is not required to send him one.\n\nSean Combs and a grand jury\n\nThis grand jury investigation is three months after the rap mogul's houses in Los Angeles and Miami were raided by authorities.\n\nIn May, after CNN showed a video of Combs beating then-girlfriend Cassandra \"Cassie\" Ventura in 2016 at a hotel in Los Angeles, he apologized in a video he posted on Instagram. In it, he admitted he was at fault and said that he took \"full responsibility.\"\n\nCombs stated, \"It's so difficult to reflect on the darkest times in your life, but sometimes you got to do that. I was f***ed up -- I mean, I hit rock bottom -- but I make no excuses.\"\n\nWhen news of Ventura's allegations of assault and sex trafficking hit the media, the rapper denied it. Ventura described the details of her assault in a federal lawsuit filed in November last year. The lawsuit was settled for an undisclosed amount less than 24 hours after Ventura filed her claims.\n\nWhen Combs admitted to the assault, Ventura's lawyer Meredith Firetog said, \"When Cassie and multiple other women came forward, he denied everything and suggested that his victims were looking a payday.\"\n\nShe added, \"He was only compelled to 'apologize' once his repeated denials were proven false shows his pathetic desperation.\"\n\nVentura's lawyers did not respond when they were asked whether their client would take part in the grand jury proceedings.\n\nCombs has been accused of multiple allegations resulting in several civil lawsuits. The most recent one was filed July 3 by an adult film actress who accused the rapper of sex trafficking.\n\nThe hip-hop mogul has denied any wrongdoing and has not been charged. His lawyer, Jonathan Davis, dismissed the most recent claim.\n\n\"No matter how many lawsuits are filed, it won't change the fact that Mr. Combs has never sexually assaulted or sex trafficked anyone,\" he said.\n\n\"We live in a world where anyone can file a lawsuit for any reason and without any proof. Fortunately, a fair and impartial judicial process exists to find the truth and Mr. Combs is confident he will prevail against these and other baseless claims in court,\" Davis added.\n\nWhat is a grand jury?\n\nWhile many of us are familiar with the words grand jury, we're not quite well-versed with what they do.\n\nFirst things first, a grand jury does not decide if the subject of the investigation is guilty. Members of the grand jury can range between 16 to 23 and they hear the witnesses that are brought before them by an ADA or an assistant district attorney. They then decide one of three things: hand an indictment, find that there isn't enough evidence to go to trial or they can transfer the case to the lower courts if they decide that the case is more a misdemeanor than a felony. A grand jury only hears criminal cases, not civil ones.\n\nFor a grand jury to reach a quorum -- the minimum number of members in a group -- they need 17 votes.

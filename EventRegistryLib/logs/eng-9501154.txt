(AP) -- Caitlin Clark's early play in WNBA will serve as her tryout for a spot on the U.S. Olympic women's basketball team.\n\nThe women's roster for the Paris Games won't be determined before June 1. Unable to attend the U.S. training camp this month, Clark will have the start of her WNBA career to show the U.S. women's basketball selection committee whether she deserves a spot on the team.\n\nSelection committee chair Jennifer Rizzotti said she'll be watching.\n\n\"You always want to introduce new players into the pool whether it's for now or the future,\" Rizzotti told The Associated Press. \"We stick to our principles of talent, obviously, positional fit, loyalty and experience. It's got to be a combination of an entire body of work. It's still not going to be fair to some people.\"\n\nClark was invited to attend the U.S. training camp in Cleveland, but it was held during the Final Four when she was still competing for a national championship with Iowa. Attending the camp wasn't mandatory to make the team, but it certainly would have helped the NCAA Division I all-time scoring leader show the selection committee she could hold her own against some of the best players in the world. The camp in Cleveland was the last one the U.S. had before announcing its roster.\n\nThe team will get together in Phoenix for a few days in July right before the Olympics, including playing an exhibition All-Star game against WNBA players.\n\nThe U.S men's basketball Olympic roster was announced last week.\n\nThe American women, who are trying for an eighth consecutive Olympic gold medal, have a talented group of guards in the pool. The list includes five-time Olympian Diana Taurasi as well as Chelsea Gray, Ariel Atkins and Jewell Loyd, who all played on the Tokyo Games team in 2021. Kelsey Plum, who owns an Olympic gold medal in 3x3, and Sabrina Ionescu are also in the pool.\n\n\"Thinking about Diana and Chelsea Gray and when their careers are done, you want to make sure you're in a position with these upcoming guards with Sabrina, Kelsey and Caitlin that you feel good that our future is set,\" Rizzotti said during 3x3 training camp last weekend.\n\nRizzotti will get a first-hand look at Clark when the No. 1 pick in the draft opens her WNBA career at the Connecticut Sun on May 14. Rizzotti is the president of the Sun.\n\nIf Clark makes the team, she wouldn't be the first WNBA rookie to be on an Olympic squad. Breanna Stewart was the last one to do it, making the team in 2016. The difference was that Stewart had been part of the national team since she was a sophomore in college, playing on the 2014 World Cup squad.\n\nWhile Clark has no senior national team experience, she has played on junior USA teams. She won gold medals at the 2019 and 2021 FIBA U19 World Cups and the 2017 FIBA U16 Americas Championship.\n\nThere were reports Clark potentially could've been part of the 3x3 team. but Clark has said her focus is playing on the 5-on-5 team.\n\n\"It's where I want to be,\" Clark told the AP last week. \"Three-on-three is really cool, I've just never done it. But 5-on-5 is the goal and the dream. To play with the best in the world and against the best in the world, you can't script it better than that.\"\n\n___", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington

(AP) - Caitlin Clark\u00b4s early play in WNBA will serve as her tryout for a spot on the U.S. Olympic women\u00b4s basketball team.\n\nThe women's roster for the Paris Games won't be determined before June 1. Unable to attend the US training camp this month, Clark will have the start of her WNBA career to show the U.S. women\u00b4s basketball selection committee whether she deserves a spot on the team.\n\nSelection committee chair Jennifer Rizzotti said she'll be watching.\n\n'You always want to introduce new players into the pool whether it\u00b4s for now or the future,' Rizzotti told The Associated Press. 'We stick to our principles of talent, obviously, positional fit, loyalty and experience. It\u00b4s got to be a combination of an entire body of work. It\u00b4s still not going to be fair to some people.'\n\nClark was invited to attend the U.S. training camp in Cleveland, but it was held during the Final Four when she was still competing for a national championship with Iowa. Attending the camp wasn't mandatory to make the team, but it certainly would have helped the NCAA Division I all-time scoring leader show the selection committee she could hold her own against some of the best players in the world. The camp in Cleveland was the last one the U.S. had before announcing its roster.\n\nCaitlin Clark's first few games in the WNBA will serve as her tryout for the Olympic team\n\nClark was selected by the Indiana Fever with the first overall pick in the 2024 WNBA Draft\n\nThe team will get together in Phoenix for a few days in July right before the Olympics, including playing an exhibition All-Star game against WNBA players.\n\nThe U.S. men's basketball roster was announced last week.\n\nThe American women, who are trying for an eighth consecutive Olympic gold medal, have a talented group of guards in the pool. The list includes five-time Olympian Diana Taurasi as well as Chelsea Gray, Ariel Atkins and Jewell Loyd, who all played on the Tokyo Games team in 2021. Kelsey Plum, who owns an Olympic gold medal in 3x3, and Sabrina Ionescu are also in the pool.\n\n'Thinking about Diana and Chelsea Gray and when their careers are done, you want to make sure you're in a position with these upcoming guards with Sabrina, Kelsey and Caitlin that you feel good that our future is set,' Rizzotti said during 3x3 training camp last weekend.\n\nRizzotti will get a first-hand look at Clark when the No. 1 pick in the draft opens her WNBA career at the Connecticut Sun on May 14. Rizzotti is the president of the Sun.\n\nClark led the Iowa Hawkeyes to back-to-back championship game appearances\n\nIf Clark makes the team, she wouldn't be the first WNBA rookie to be on an Olympic squad. Breanna Stewart was the last one to do it, making the team in 2016. The difference was that Stewart had been part of the national team since she was a sophomore in college, playing on the 2014 World Cup squad.\n\nWhile Clark has no senior national team experience, she has played on junior USA teams. She won gold medals at the 2019 and 2021 FIBA U19 World Cups and the 2017 FIBA U16 Americas Championship.\n\nThere were reports Clark potentially could've been part of the 3x3 team but Clark has said her focus is playing on the 5-on-5 team.\n\n'It's where I want to be,' Clark told the AP last week. 'Three-on-three is really cool, I've just never done it. But 5-on-5 is the goal and the dream. To play with the best in the world and against the best in the world, you can't script it better than that.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"},

Kelsey Plum, who owns an Olympic gold medal in 3x3, and Sabrina Ionescu are also in the pool.\n\nYou might be interested in Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969\n\n\"Thinking about Diana and Chelsea Gray and when their careers are done, you want to make sure you're in a position with these upcoming guards with Sabrina, Kelsey and Caitlin that you feel good that our future is set,\" Rizzotti said during 3x3 training camp this past weekend.\n\nRizzotti will get a first-hand look at Clark when the No. 1 pick in the draft opens her WNBA career at Connecticut on May 14.

Unable to attend the U.S. training camp this month, Clark will have the start of her WNBA career to show the U.S. women's basketball selection committee whether she deserves a spot on the team.\n\nSelection committee chair Jennifer Rizzotti said she'll be watching.\n\nOLYMPIC STAR KATIE LEDECKY HOPEFUL TO MEET CAITLIN CLARK: 'SHE'S GREAT'\n\n\"You always want to introduce new players into the pool whether it's for now or the future,\" Rizzotti told The Associated Press. \"We stick to our principles of talent, obviously, positional fit, loyalty and experience. It's got to be a combination of an entire body of work. It's still not going to be fair to some people.\"\n\nClark was invited to attend the U.S. training camp in Cleveland, but it was held during the Final Four when she was still competing for a national championship with Iowa. Attending the camp wasn't mandatory to make the team, but it certainly would have helped the NCAA Division I all-time scoring leader show the selection committee she could hold her own against some of the best players in the world. The camp in Cleveland was the last one the U.S. had before announcing its roster.\n\nThe team will get together in Phoenix for a few days in July right before the Olympics, including playing an exhibition All-Star game against WNBA players.\n\nThe U.S men's basketball Olympic roster was announced last week.\n\nThe American women, who are trying for an eighth consecutive Olympic gold medal, have a talented group of guards in the pool. The list includes five-time Olympian Diana Taurasi as well as Chelsea Gray, Ariel Atkins and Jewell Loyd, who all played on the Tokyo Games team in 2021. Kelsey Plum, who owns an Olympic gold medal in 3x3, and Sabrina Ionescu are also in the pool.\n\nCAITLIN CLARK SELECTED NO 1 OVERALL BY INDIANA FEVER IN 2024 WNBA DRAFT\n\n\"Thinking about Diana and Chelsea Gray and when their careers are done, you want to make sure you're in a position with these upcoming guards with Sabrina, Kelsey and Caitlin that you feel good that our future is set,\" Rizzotti said during 3x3 training camp last weekend.\n\nRizzotti will get a first-hand look at Clark when the No. 1 pick in the draft opens her WNBA career at the Connecticut Sun on May 14. Rizzotti is the president of the Sun.\n\nIf Clark makes the team, she wouldn't be the first WNBA rookie to be on an Olympic squad. Breanna Stewart was the last one to do it, making the team in 2016. The difference was that Stewart had been part of the national team since she was a sophomore in college, playing on the 2014 World Cup squad.\n\nWhile Clark has no senior national team experience, she has played on junior USA teams. She won gold medals at the 2019 and 2021 FIBA U19 World Cups and the 2017 FIBA U16 Americas Championship.\n\nThere were reports Clark potentially could've been part of the 3x3 team, but Clark has said her focus is playing on the 5-on-5 team.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"It's where I want to be,\" Clark told the AP last week. \"Three-on-three is really cool, I've just never done it. But 5-on-5 is the goal and the dream.

Attending the camp wasn't mandatory to make the team, but it certainly would have helped the NCAA Division I all-time scoring leader show the selection committee she could hold her own against some of the best players in the world. The camp in Cleveland was the last one the U.S. had before announcing its roster.\n\nThe team will get together in Phoenix for a few days in July right before the Olympics, including playing an exhibition All-Star game against WNBA players.\n\nThe U.S men's basketball Olympic roster was announced last week.\n\nThe American women, who are trying for an eighth consecutive Olympic gold medal, have a talented group of guards in the pool. The list includes five-time Olympian Diana Taurasi as well as Chelsea Gray, Ariel Atkins and Jewell Loyd, who all played on the Tokyo Games team in 2021. Kelsey Plum, who owns an Olympic gold medal in 3x3, and Sabrina Ionescu are also in the pool.\n\n\"Thinking about Diana and Chelsea Gray and when their careers are done, you want to make sure you're in a position with these upcoming guards with Sabrina, Kelsey and Caitlin that you feel good that our future is set,\" Rizzotti said during 3x3 training camp last weekend.\n\nRizzotti will get a firsthand look at Clark when the No. 1 pick in the draft opens her WNBA career at the Connecticut Sun on May 14. Rizzotti is the president of the Sun.\n\nIf Clark makes the team, she wouldn't be the first WNBA rookie to be on an Olympic squad. Breanna Stewart was the last one to do it, making the team in 2016. The difference was that Stewart had been part of the national team since she was a sophomore in college, playing on the 2014 World Cup squad.\n\nWhile Clark has no senior national team experience, she has played on junior USA teams. She won gold medals at the 2019 and 2021 FIBA U19 World Cups and the 2017 FIBA U16 Americas Championship.\n\nThere were reports Clark potentially could've been part of the 3x3 team. but Clark has said her focus is playing on the 5-on-5 team.\n\n\"It's where I want to be,\" Clark told the AP last week. \"Three-on-three is really cool, I've just never done it. But 5-on-5 is the goal and the dream. To play with the best in the world and against the best in the world, you can't script it better than that.\"\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Sports Basketball Job Market Armed Forces Be

The list includes five-time Olympian Diana Taurasi as well as Chelsea Gray, Ariel Atkins and Jewell Loyd, who all played on the Tokyo Games team in 2021. Kelsey Plum, who owns an Olympic gold medal in 3x3, and Sabrina Ionescu are also in the pool.\n\n\"Thinking about Diana and Chelsea Gray and when their careers are done, you want to make sure you're in a position with these upcoming guards with Sabrina, Kelsey and Caitlin that you feel good that our future is set,\" Rizzotti said during 3x3 training camp last weekend.\n\nRizzotti will get a first-hand look at Clark when the No. 1 pick in the draft opens her WNBA career at the Connecticut Sun on May 14. Rizzotti is the president of the Sun.\n\nIf Clark makes the team, she wouldn't be the first WNBA rookie to be on an Olympic squad. Breanna Stewart was the last one to do it, making the team in 2016. The difference was that Stewart had been part of the national team since she was a sophomore in college, playing on the 2014 World Cup squad.\n\nWhile Clark has no senior national team experience, she has played on junior USA teams. She won gold medals at the 2019 and 2021 FIBA U19 World Cups and the 2017 FIBA U16 Americas Championship.\n\nThere were reports Clark potentially could've been part of the 3x3 team. but Clark has said her focus is playing on the 5-on-5 team.\n\n\"It's where I want to be,\" Clark told the AP last week. \"Three-on-three is really cool, I've just never done it. But 5-on-5 is the goal and the dream. To play with the best in the world and against the best in the world, you can't script it better than that.\"\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your

Unable to attend the U.S. training camp this month, Clark will have the start of her WNBA career to show the U.S. women's basketball selection committee whether she deserves a spot on the team.\n\nSelection committee chair Jennifer Rizzotti said she'll be watching.\n\n\"You always want to introduce new players into the pool whether it's for now or the future,\" Rizzotti told The Associated Press. \"We stick to our principles of talent, obviously, positional fit, loyalty and experience. It's got to be a combination of an entire body of work. It's still not going to be fair to some people.\"\n\nClark was invited to attend the U.S. training camp in Cleveland, but it was held during the Final Four when she was still competing for a national championship with Iowa. Attending the camp wasn't mandatory to make the team, but it certainly would have helped the NCAA Division I all-time scoring leader show the selection committee she could hold her own against some of the best players in the world.

Iowa lost to South Carolina in the Final Four college basketball championship game of the women's NCAA Tournament on Sunday.\n\nDOUG FEINBERG AP Basketball Writer\n\nSPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) -- Caitlin Clark's early play in WNBA will serve as her tryout for a spot on the U.S. Olympic women's basketball team.\n\nThe women's roster for the Paris Games won't be determined before June 1. Unable to attend the U.S. training camp this month, Clark will have the start of her WNBA career to show the U.S. women's basketball selection committee whether she deserves a spot on the team.\n\nSelection committee chair Jennifer Rizzotti said she'll be watching.\n\n\"You always want to introduce new players into the pool whether it's for now or the future,\" Rizzotti told The Associated Press. \"We stick to our principles of talent, obviously, positional fit, loyalty and experience. It's got to be a combination of an entire body of work. It's still not going to be fair to some people.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

Attending the camp wasn't mandatory to make the team, but it certainly would have helped the NCAA Division I all-time scoring leader show the selection committee she could hold her own against some of the best players in the world. The camp in Cleveland was the last one the U.S. had before announcing its roster.\n\nThe team will get together in Phoenix for a few days in July right before the Olympics, including playing an exhibition All-Star game against WNBA players.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe U.S men's basketball Olympic roster was announced last week.\n\nThe American women, who are trying for an eighth consecutive Olympic gold medal, have a talented group of guards in the pool. The list includes five-time Olympian Diana Taurasi as well as Chelsea Gray, Ariel Atkins and Jewell Loyd, who all played on the Tokyo Games team in 2021. Kelsey Plum, who owns an Olympic gold medal in 3x3, and Sabrina Ionescu are also in the pool.\n\n\"Thinking about Diana and Chelsea Gray and when their careers are done, you want to make sure you're in a position with these upcoming guards with Sabrina, Kelsey and Caitlin that you feel good that our future is set,\" Rizzotti said during 3x3 training camp last weekend.\n\nRizzotti will get a first-hand look at Clark when the No. 1 pick in the draft opens her WNBA career at the Connecticut Sun on May 14. Rizzotti is the president of the Sun.\n\nIf Clark makes the team, she wouldn't be the first WNBA rookie to be on an Olympic squad. Breanna Stewart was the last one to do it, making the team in 2016. The difference was that Stewart had been part of the national team since she was a sophomore in college, playing on the 2014 World Cup squad.\n\nWhile Clark has no senior national team experience, she has played on junior USA teams. She won gold medals at the 2019 and 2021 FIBA U19 World Cups and the 2017 FIBA U16 Americas Championship.\n\nThere were reports Clark potentially could've been part of the 3x3 team. but Clark has said her focus is playing on the 5-on-5 team.\n\n\"It's where I want to be,\" Clark told the AP last week. \"Three-on-three is really cool, I've just never done it. But 5-on-5 is the goal and the dream. To play with the best in the world and against the best in the world, you can't script it better than that.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The list includes five-time Olympian Diana Taurasi as well as Chelsea Gray, Ariel Atkins and Jewell Loyd, who all played on the Tokyo Games team in 2021. Kelsey Plum, who owns an Olympic gold medal in 3x3, and Sabrina Ionescu are also in the pool.\n\n\"Thinking about Diana and Chelsea Gray and when their careers are done, you want to make sure you're in a position with these upcoming guards with Sabrina, Kelsey and Caitlin that you feel good that our future is set,\" Rizzotti said during 3x3 training camp last weekend.\n\nRizzotti will get a first-hand look at Clark when the No. 1 pick in the draft opens her WNBA career at the Connecticut Sun on May 14.

The list includes five-time Olympian Diana Taurasi as well as Chelsea Gray, Ariel Atkins and Jewell Loyd, who all played on the Tokyo Games team in 2021. Kelsey Plum, who owns an Olympic gold medal in 3x3, and Sabrina Ionescu are also in the pool.\n\n\"Thinking about Diana and Chelsea Gray and when their careers are done, you want to make sure you're in a position with these upcoming guards with Sabrina, Kelsey and Caitlin that you feel good that our future is set,\" Rizzotti said during 3x3 training camp last weekend.\n\nRizzotti will get a first-hand look at Clark when the No. 1 pick in the draft opens her WNBA career at the Connecticut Sun on May 14. Rizzotti is the president of the Sun.\n\nIf Clark makes the team, she wouldn't be the first WNBA rookie to be on an Olympic squad. Breanna Stewart was the last one to do it, making the team in 2016. The difference was that Stewart had been part of the national team since she was a sophomore in college, playing on the 2014 World Cup squad.\n\nWhile Clark has no senior national team experience, she has played on junior USA teams. She won gold medals at the 2019 and 2021 FIBA U19 World Cups and the 2017 FIBA U16 Americas Championship.\n\nThere were reports Clark potentially could've been part of the 3x3 team. but Clark has said her focus is playing on the 5-on-5 team.\n\n\"It's where I want to be,\" Clark told the AP last week. \"Three-on-three is really cool, I've just never done it. But 5-on-5 is the goal and the dream. To play with the best in the world and against the best in the world, you can't script it better than that.\"\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to

(AP) -- Caitlin Clark's early play in WNBA will serve as her tryout for a spot on the U.S. Olympic women's basketball team.\n\nThe women's roster for the Paris Games won't be determined before June 1. Unable to attend the U.S. training camp this month, Clark will have the start of her WNBA career to show the U.S. women's basketball selection committee whether she deserves a spot on the team.\n\nSelection committee chair Jennifer Rizzotti said she'll be watching.\n\n\"You always want to introduce new players into the pool whether it's for now or the future,\" Rizzotti told The Associated Press. \"We stick to our principles of talent, obviously, positional fit, loyalty and experience. It's got to be a combination of an entire body of work. It's still not going to be fair to some people.\"\n\nClark was invited to attend the U.S. training camp in Cleveland, but it was held during the Final Four when she was still competing for a national championship with Iowa. Attending the camp wasn't mandatory to make the team, but it certainly would have helped the NCAA Division I all-time scoring leader show the selection committee she could hold her own against some of the best players in the world. The camp in Cleveland was the last one the U.S. had before announcing its roster.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The list includes five-time Olympian Diana Taurasi as well as Chelsea Gray, Ariel Atkins and Jewell Loyd, who all played on the Tokyo Games team in 2021. Kelsey Plum, who owns an Olympic gold medal in 3x3, and Sabrina Ionescu are also in the pool.\n\n\"Thinking about Diana and Chelsea Gray and when their careers are done, you want to make sure you're in a position with these upcoming guards with Sabrina, Kelsey and Caitlin that you feel good that our future is set,\" Rizzotti said during 3x3 training camp last weekend.\n\nRizzotti will get a firsthand look at Clark when the No. 1 pick in the draft opens her WNBA career at the Connecticut Sun on May 14. Rizzotti is the president of the Sun.\n\nIf Clark makes the team, she wouldn't be the first WNBA rookie to be on an Olympic squad. Breanna Stewart was the last one to do it, making the team in 2016. The difference was that Stewart had been part of the national team since she was a sophomore in college, playing on the 2014 World Cup squad.\n\nWhile Clark has no senior national team experience, she has played on junior USA teams. She won gold medals at the 2019 and 2021 FIBA U19 World Cups and the 2017 FIBA U16 Americas Championship.\n\nThere were reports Clark potentially could've been part of the 3x3 team. but Clark has said her focus is playing on the 5-on-5 team.\n\n\"It's where I want to be,\" Clark told the AP last week. \"Three-on-three is really cool, I've just never done it. But 5-on-5 is the goal and the dream.

Despite missing a U.S. training camp due to her NCAA commitments, Clark's inaugural season in the WNBA will be her proving ground to secure her place among basketball's elite on the Olympic stage.\n\nClark had to miss the U.S. team's training camp in Cleveland this month since it is coincided with the Final Four in the women's NCAA Tournament, although she was invited. The camp was the last one before Team USA announces its roster by June 1. This makes Clark's upcoming WNBA games even more critical as a showcase of her talent to the selection committee.\n\nClark's journey to potentially join Team USA is highlighted by her impressive track record - including becoming the NCAA Divison 1 all-time scoring leader this season - and the high expectations follow her as the No. 1 WNBA draft pick. If she is selected for the team, Clark would follow in the footsteps of Breanna Stewart, who made the Olympic team as a rookie in 2016. Unlike Stewart, who had extensive experience with the national team, Clark's senior team exposure is limited, although she has a notable history with the junior USA squads, securing gold at the FIBA U19 World Cups in both 2019 and 2021, as well as at the FIBA U16 Americas Championship in 2017.\n\nSpeculation had hinted at the possibility of Clark joining the three-on-three basketball team; however, Clark has said her aspirations lie with the traditional five-on-five format.\n\n\"It's where I want to be,\" Clark said, per Doug Feinberg of the Associated Press. \"Three-on-three is really cool, I've just never done it. But 5-on-5 is the goal and the dream. To play with the best in the world and against the best in the world, you can't script it better than that.\"\n\nThe U.S. men's team was announced April 17.\n\nSelection Committee watching Caitlin Clark with interest\n\nJennifer Rizzotti, chair of the selection committee, expressed keen interest in Clark's journey, acknowledging the importance of fresh talent for the team's future.\n\n\"You always want to introduce new players into the pool whether it's for now or the future,\" Rizzotti said, per Doug Feinberg of the Associated Press. \"We stick to our principles of talent, obviously, positional fit, loyalty and experience. It's got to be a combination of an entire body of work. It's still not going to be fair to some people.\"\n\nThe U.S. women's basketball team, aiming for their eighth straight Olympic gold, boasts a deep and skilled roster. The group features veteran five-time Olympian Diana Taurasi and returning Tokyo Games players Chelsea Gray, Ariel Atkins and Jewell Loyd. Additionally, Kelsey Plum, a gold medalist in 3\u00d73 basketball, and Sabrina Ionescu are part of the ensemble.\n\n\"Thinking about Diana and Chelsea Gray and when their careers are done, you want to make sure you're in a position with these upcoming guards with Sabrina, Kelsey and Caitlin that you feel good that our future is set,\" Rizzotti said.\n\nAs the team prepares for a pre-Olympic gathering in Phoenix come July, which includes an exhibition All-Star game against WNBA players, all eyes will be on Clark as she begins her WNBA chapter against the Connecticut Sun May 14.",

The list includes five-time Olympian Diana Taurasi as well as Chelsea Gray, Ariel Atkins and Jewell Loyd, who all played on the Tokyo Games team in 2021. Kelsey Plum, who owns an Olympic gold medal in 3x3, and Sabrina Ionescu are also in the pool.\n\n\"Thinking about Diana and Chelsea Gray and when their careers are done, you want to make sure you're in a position with these upcoming guards with Sabrina, Kelsey and Caitlin that you feel good that our future is set,\" Rizzotti said during 3x3 training camp last weekend.\n\nRizzotti will get a first-hand look at Clark when the No. 1 pick in the draft opens her WNBA career at the Connecticut Sun on May 14. Rizzotti is the president of the Sun.\n\nIf Clark makes the team, she wouldn't be the first WNBA rookie to be on an Olympic squad. Breanna Stewart was the last one to do it, making the team in 2016. The difference was that Stewart had been part of the national team since she was a sophomore in college, playing on the 2014 World Cup squad.\n\nWhile Clark has no senior national team experience, she has played on junior USA teams. She won gold medals at the 2019 and 2021 FIBA U19 World Cups and the 2017 FIBA U16 Americas Championship.\n\nThere were reports Clark potentially could've been part of the 3x3 team. but Clark has said her focus is playing on the 5-on-5 team.\n\n\"It's where I want to be,\" Clark told the AP last week. \"Three-on-three is really cool, I've just never done it.

It's got to be a combination of an entire body of work. It's still not going to be fair to some people.\"\n\nClark missed Team USA's last try-out because the session took place while she and the Iowa Hawkeyes were competing for the NCAA National Championship earlier this month. And the WNBA's No. 1 overall draft pick's competition is stiff, too. She's vying for a roster spot alongside guards like Diana Taurasi, Chelsea Gray, Ariel Atkins, Jewell Loyd, Kelsey Plum and Sabrina Ionescu.\n\nTeam USA, who is looking for its eighth-straight gold medal at the Summer Games later this year, recently freed up a guard position after Sue Bird retired in 2022.\n\nRelated: Caitlin Clark Draws Records Viewers for 2024 WNBA Draft\n\nClark is perhaps the most popular name in women's basketball, but making the team is anything but a given. Rookies rarely make the squad, the last being Breanna Stewart in 2016.\n\n\"Obviously [Clark is] a great player and what she's been able to accomplish in college, and now she's taking it to the next level in the WNBA, and we'll see how things go,\" Stewart, 29, recently told The Los Angeles Times. \"Obviously what I want to do is play alongside the other players that are named on this roster. I don't know what that's going to be, but I'm sure Caitlin has played USA Basketball before and I don't think her time with USA Basketball is going to be done anytime soon.\"\n\nRelated: All About Caitlin Clark's 2 Siblings, Blake and Colin Clark\n\nThe Des Moines, Iowa, native told reporters during a press conference at the NCAA Tournament this month that playing for Team USA at the upcoming Olympics \"would be a dream,\" according to CBS Sports.\n\nAnd Clark wants that dream to begin sooner than later.\n\n\"You always want to grow up and be on the Olympic team,\" she said, getting asked about having to decline her invite to Team USA's tryouts because of the Final Four. \"Lucky for me, I have the opportunity to possibly not doing that because I want to be at the Final Four playing basketball with my team. But if not, that's where I'll be. People that are on that roster are people that I idolize and have idolized growing up. So just to be extended a camp invite is something you have to be proud of and celebrate and enjoy.\"\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nIf Clark doesn't make Team USA's five-on-five squad, there is the potential she could represent the country on the women's three-on-three team. But five-on-five is the goal, she told the AP.\n\n\"It's where I want to be,\" Clark said. \"Three-on-three is really cool, I've just never done it. But 5-on-5 is the goal and the dream. To play with the best in the world and against the best in the world, you can't script it better than that.\"\n\nThe American women's basketball team's Olympic roster is scheduled to be announced sometime after June 1, the AP reported.

Her first few weeks in the WNBA will determine if she is worthy of a roster spot.\n\nThis comes after the former Iowa superstar was unable to attend Team USA's training camp.\n\nClark received an invitation to participate. However, the Hawkeyes were playing in the Final Four.\n\nAlthough attendance is not mandatory, an inability to compete at camp would typically preclude an athlete from making it onto the team. Especially for a rookie, who has not faced that level of talent. That could still be the case. It is very possible that the U.S. women's basketball selection committee determines that Clark is not quite ready to go international and play for the stars and stripes.\n\nCommittee chair Jennifer Rizzotti left the door wide open when speaking to Doug Feinberg.\n\nYou always want to introduce new players into the pool whether it's for now or the future. We stick to our principles of talent, obviously, positional fit, loyalty and experience. It's got to be a combination of an entire body of work. It's still not going to be fair to some people.\n\nAn finalized roster for Team USA will not be determined until June 1. Clark will begin her WNBA career with two preseason games on May 3 and May 10. Her first regular season game is scheduled to take place on May 14 against the Connecticut Sun.\n\nThat matchup is rather convenient. Rizzotti is the president of the Sun. She will get a first-hand look at the most-hyped rookie in league history before having to make a decision on Team USA.\n\nFrom there, Clark will play eight additional regular season games prior to the first of June. Rizzotti and the committee is going to make a decision on whether she deserves to compete for Team USA the Olympics based off of two preseason and nine regular season games.\n\nAlthough Clark does not have any senior national team experience, she won gold at the 2019 and 2021 FIBA U19 World Cups and the 2017 FIBA U16 Americas Championship. There was also chatter that Team USA would consider adding her to the 3X3 team.\n\nHowever, that is not in the cards.\n\nThree-on-three is really cool, I've just never done it. But five-on-five is the goal and the dream. To play with the best in the world and against the best in the world, you can't script it better than that.\n\nShould Caitlin Clark make the Olympic roster, she would be the first rookie to do so since Breanna Stewart in 2016.

He has been working at PEOPLE since 2019. His work has previously appeared in Rolling Stone, The New York Times, ESPN, and more.\n\nCaitlin Clark's WNBA debut is less than a month away, but many are already wondering about her status for the Paris Olympics come July.\n\nClark, 22, is on the shortlist to make the Team USA women's basketball team, the squad's selection committee chair Jennifer Rizzotti told The Associated Press this week.\n\nBut the NCAA's Division I all-time leading scorer will need to prove herself during the first few weeks of the season, Rizzotti said, as the Indiana Fever guard will be competing with five other talented American guards hoping to make the roster.\n\n\"You always want to introduce new players into the pool whether it's for now or the future,\" Rizzotti told the outlet. \"We stick to our principles of talent, obviously, positional fit, loyalty and experience. It's got to be a combination of an entire body of work. It's still not going to be fair to some people.\"\n\nClark missed Team USA's last try-out because the session took place while she and the Iowa Hawkeyes were competing for the NCAA National Championship earlier this month. And the WNBA's No. 1 overall draft pick's competition is stiff, too. She's vying for a roster spot alongside guards like Diana Taurasi, Chelsea Gray, Ariel Atkins, Jewell Loyd, Kelsey Plum and Sabrina Ionescu.\n\nTeam USA, who is looking for its eighth-straight gold medal at the Summer Games later this year, recently freed up a guard position after Sue Bird retired in 2022.\n\nClark is perhaps the most popular name in women's basketball, but making the team is anything but a given. Rookies rarely make the squad, the last being Breanna Stewart in 2016.\n\n\"Obviously [Clark is] a great player and what she's been able to accomplish in college, and now she's taking it to the next level in the WNBA, and we'll see how things go,\" Stewart, 29, recently told The Los Angeles Times. \"Obviously what I want to do is play alongside the other players that are named on this roster. I don't know what that's going to be, but I'm sure Caitlin has played USA Basketball before and I don't think her time with USA Basketball is going to be done anytime soon.\"\n\nThe Des Moines, Iowa, native told reporters during a press conference at the NCAA Tournament this month that playing for Team USA at the upcoming Olympics \"would be a dream,\" according to CBS Sports.\n\nAnd Clark wants that dream to begin sooner than later.\n\n\"You always want to grow up and be on the Olympic team,\" she said, getting asked about having to decline her invite to Team USA's tryouts because of the Final Four. \"Lucky for me, I have the opportunity to possibly not doing that because I want to be at the Final Four playing basketball with my team. But if not, that's where I'll be. People that are on that roster are people that I idolize and have idolized growing up. So just to be extended a camp invite is something you have to be proud of and celebrate and enjoy.\"\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nIf Clark doesn't make Team USA's five-on-five squad, there is the potential she could represent the country on the women's three-on-three team.

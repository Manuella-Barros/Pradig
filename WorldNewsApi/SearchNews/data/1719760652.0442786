Criminals can use special tech to wirelessly access the information stored in those cards and IDs. There's a way to fight back, though: Consider investing in an RFID-blocking wallet, passport case or bag. Most of the latest credit cards, debit cards and government IDs have an RFID chip installed. In the case of credit and debit cards, this tech comes in handy; it lets you tap to pay for all kinds of purchases at stores worldwide. But that same tech is what a criminal is looking for. Hackers can scan your credit or debit card numbers or IDs, allowing them to steal your money or identity. An RFID-blocking wallet prevents contactless scanning, which is also known as a \"skimming attack.\"Best RFID-blocking wallets and bagsRFID-blocking wallets, passport cases, fanny packs, purses and crossbody bags incorporate a layer of carbon fiber or aluminum that can prevent a skimming attack and keep the information stored in your cards and IDs protected.

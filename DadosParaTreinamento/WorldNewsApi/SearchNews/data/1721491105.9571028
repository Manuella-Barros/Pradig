{"id": 237984320, "title": "CBS Still Only Network To Report Latest Port Biden Collapse", "text": "CBS EVENING NEWS 6/18/24 6:34 PM NORAH O\u2019DONNELL: Israel's military paused its fighting for 11 hours along a crucial supply route in southern Gaza today. And it says it plans to do the same thing every day as part of a tactical pause to increase the flow of desperately needed aid. Now, the move comes as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dissolved his influential war cabinet. CBS's Chris Livesay reports on these new developments tonight from Tel Aviv. CHRIS LIVESAY: It was a coalition of rivals, meant to sow unity in Israel after the Hamas attacks of October 7th, and the conflict that followed in Gaza. Last week, that changed when Benny Gantz, the leading moderate opponent of the prime minister, left the war cabinet over the absence of a day-after plan for Gaza. The war cabinet now dismantled, that leaves Netanyahu only with the hard right as the linchpin of his support. The shake-up comes after Israel announced a tactical pause in the fighting, limited to seven and a half miles of this road in the Rafah area, during daylight hours only to allow more aid for displaced people like Ibrahim Shaban el-dahdouh. \"There is no aid, medicine, food, or water coming in, and even the sick people can't leave\" he tells our CBS News team in Gaza. \"We\u2019re isolated from the world.\" But if this pause holds, it could at least address some of these overwhelming needs as the offensive continues in Rafah. Israeli forces say they control 70% of this Hamas stronghold, the U.N. says 1.3 million people have fled the cities since the fighting began, and as the Israeli public grows more impatient, says diplomatic and staunch Netanyahu critic Alon Pinkas. ALON PINKAS: Because they think it is- it is eight months. It's too long, there's no clear victory. There's no decisive victory that can be- um, announced. LIVESAY: Now it's early days for that pause but, so far, UNICEF says they\u2019ve seen no more aid than usual entering the Strip, and the humanitarian pier the U.S. built, well it's down for repairs again due to rough seas. Officials hope it will be up and running later this week. Norah. O\u2019DONNELL. Chris Livesay, thank you so much.", "summary": "The botched U.S.-built humanitarian pier in Gaza, known by some as \u201cPort Biden\u201d, remains an ongoing embarrassment to the Biden Administration due to its general unserviceability.

Amongst the top contenders for a medal is the seasoned and accomplished wrestler, Vinesh Phogat. With a storied career marked by numerous accolades, Vinesh has consistently proven herself to be one of the best women wrestlers India has produced.\n\nBorn into the renowned Phogat family, Vinesh has wrestling in her blood. Babita Phogat, Sangita Phogat and Vinesh Phogate, popularly known as the Phogat sisters, trained by their father Mahavir Singh Phogat, have played a big role in revolutionising women's wrestling in India. Vinesh, in particular, has carved out a remarkable career with multiple accolades on the international stage. Her journey has been inspirational, marked by overcoming significant obstacles, including a serious knee injury at the Rio Olympics 2016, which could have ended her career.\n\nHowever, her relentless dedication and hard work have brought her back to the pinnacle of the sport, and she might just be one of India's bright chances of a medal.\n\nVinesh's most recent triumph came at the Asian Wrestling Olympic Qualifiers in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, where she secured a Paris 2024 quota in the women's 50kg category. This achievement was particularly significant given that she had to drop her weight class from 53kg to 50kg due to Antim Panghal's emergence in the 53kg division. Vinesh's determination and adaptability were evident as she cruised through the qualifiers, winning three bouts back-to-back against top-quality opponents.\n\nHer performance in the qualifiers was all the more impressive considering it was her first international competition since the 2022 World Championships, where she won a bronze medal in the 53kg category. More recently, Vinesh Phogat won gold in the Spanish Grand Prix on July 6, by defeating Mariia Tiumerekova 10-5 in the final and setting up the perfect buildup to her Olympics 2024 campaign.\n\nVinesh Phogat has been at the centre of a high-profile feud with the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) President Brij Bhushan Singh. The controversy, which involved allegations of sexual harassment against Singh, led to the suspension of the WFI. Vinesh, along with other wrestlers, protested against Singh's leadership, citing his mismanagement and misconduct.\n\nDespite the challenges, Vinesh remains focused on her ultimate goal: winning an Olympic medal.\n\n\"It's been difficult so far, but when you win, it seems like all the struggles were worth it. I'll probably feel at peace with myself for the next four-five days, but the Olympics are the main target. I'll try to achieve what I couldn't in the last two Olympics,\" Phogat said after securing the Olympics quota.\n\nAs India pins its hopes on Vinesh Phogat to bring home a medal, her recent performances and unwavering dedication make her a strong contender for success. While the road ahead will be fraught with challenges, Vinesh's unrelenting spirit and skill on the mat make her a force to be reckoned with in the world of wrestling.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinesh_Phogat", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vinesh Phogat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phogat_sisters", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Phogat sisters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahavir_Singh_Phogat", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mahavir Singh Phogat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babita_Kumari", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Babita Kumari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amateur wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling_Federation_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling Federation of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brij_Bhushan_Sharan_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling_weight_classes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling weight classes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishkek", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bishkek"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bishkek"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kyrgyzstan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wrestling_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Wrestling Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Prix_motorcycle_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Prix motorcycle racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_harassment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual harassment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Backyard_Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Backyard Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Hand_Games/Thumb_Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Games/Hand Games/Thumb Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202407/vinesh-phogat-174016777-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=zENoAAfC2GmpORpyZCX2FjDDA0kHH02K", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9749703", "eventUri": "eng-9749703", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-06", "textStart": 1932, "textEnd": 1938}], "sentiment": 0.4745098039215687, "wgt": 218, "relevance": 1}

A three-time gold medallist in the Commonwealth Games, Vinesh will be competing in her third straight Olympics this year.\n\nVinesh made her Olympics debut at the Rio Games in 2016 where she managed to reach the quarterfinals. She went down against Chinese Sun Yanan after suffering a knee injury to miss out on a medal. She was one of the favourites to win a medal at the Tokyo Olympics 2020 but once again failed to make it past the quarterfinal.\n\nVinesh, who comes from India's renowned Phogat wrestling family, has enjoyed a stellar career so far. The three-time gold medallist in the Commonwealth Games created history by becoming the first Indian female wrestler to win a gold medal at both the Commonwealth Games and the Asian Games in 2018.\n\nShe has also won two bronze medals at the World Championships and is the only Indian female wrestler with multiple medals in the prestigious competition. However, an Olympic medal has continued to elude Vinesh, who will be eager to finish on the podium in Paris this year.\n\nVinesh started wrestling at a very young age and was introduced to the sport by her uncle Mahavir Singh Phogat, the father of Geeta Phogat and Babita Phogat. Following the footsteps of her cousin, Vinesh too gained prominence quickly in the sport and went on to become one of the finest female wrestlers in the country.\n\nLike her cousins, Vinesh too faced opposition from neighbours and the villagers, who believed wrestling was a man's sport. However, her resolve and determination to make a name for herself in the sport saw her achieve great heights. Vinesh also lost her father when she was just 9 but overcame the challenges in his childhood to forge a successful career in wrestling.\n\nVinesh has made more headlines recently due to being involved in controversies than her performances on the mat. She was suspended by the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) after the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 on the charges of indiscipline for refusing to train with his Indian teammates.\n\nThe 29-year-old was involved in protests against tainted former WFI president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh last year and earlier this year. Vinesh along with Bajrang Punia and Sakshi Malik led the protests against Brij Bhushan, who was accused of sexual assault by several female wrestlers.\n\nOne of the favourites to return with a medal in her weight category, Vinesh will be hoping to brush the controversies aside and end her long-standing drought at the Olympics in Paris this time around.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "abhishek_kumar@news9live.com", "name": "Abhishek Kumar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinesh_Phogat", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vinesh Phogat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Commonwealth Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Yanan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sun Yanan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahavir_Singh_Phogat", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mahavir Singh Phogat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babita_Kumari", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Babita Kumari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wrestling_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Wrestling Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geeta_Phogat", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geeta Phogat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asian Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling_Federation_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling Federation of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bajrang_Punia", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bajrang Punia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brij_Bhushan_Sharan_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakshi_Malik", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sakshi Malik"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Backyard_Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Backyard Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Hand_Games/Thumb_Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Games/Hand Games/Thumb Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://images.news9live.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Vinesh-Phogat-getty.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9749703", "eventUri": "eng-9749703", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 218, "relevance": 1}

Meanwhile, Aman Sehrawat (57kg) will be the sole representative among the men.\n\nThe significance of this record number of female qualifiers is heightened by the fact that three of these wrestlers were part of an unprecedented protest against the Wrestling Federation of India and its former president, Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, just a year ago on the streets of Delhi.\n\nOne of the protest leaders, Vinesh Phogat, stands out. At 29, she is the most senior member of the squad and has made history by qualifying for her third Olympic Games, having previously competed in Rio de Janeiro and Tokyo. Qualifying for the Olympics is a remarkable achievement, especially considering her tumultuous 2023, which involved leading the protest at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi and undergoing major surgery for a torn ACL ligament in her knee.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR ALL THE PARIS 2024 UPDATES\n\nVinesh Phogat has plenty of \ue816Olympic experience, and she will need it. Competing in the women's 50kg category on August 6th and 7th, Vinesh faces a significant challenge. Her first task will be to make weight. Vinesh competed in the women's 48kg category at the Rio Olympics. Still, the difficulty of managing her weight led her to move up to the 50kg category in 2018 and then to the 53kg category the following year. While she won two world championship bronze medals in the 53kg class, even this weight cut sometimes left her disoriented -- most notably at the Tokyo Olympics, where she crashed out early despite being one of the favourites to medal.\n\nHistory beckons: At 22, Anshu Malik will become one of India's youngest two-time Olympians when she steps on the mat in Paris. | Photo Credit: Getty Images\n\nHistory beckons: At 22, Anshu Malik will become one of India's youngest two-time Olympians when she steps on the mat in Paris. | Photo Credit: Getty Images\n\nUnfortunately for Vinesh, with Antim Panghal qualifying in the women's 53kg category, she has to drop down to the 50kg category. This weight cut is even more challenging due to her surgery and subsequent recovery. She managed to make weight at the Asian Olympic qualifiers, but she was fortunate that her draw included wrestlers from Korea, Cambodia, and Kazakhstan -- not the most challenging opponents.\n\nSince then, Vinesh has competed in the Hungary Ranking Series, where she beat Olympic qualifier Alisson Cardozo of Colombia but was defeated by China's Jiang Zhu. She also participated in the Grand Prix of \ue816Spain, where she won a morale-boosting gold medal by defeating Pan American champion and Paris qualifier Yusneylis Guzman of Cuba.\n\nEven if Vinesh manages to make weight in Paris, it will only be the first hurdle cleared. The women's 50kg category will be highly competitive at the Olympics. As a relatively recent entrant in this weight class during this Olympic cycle, Vinesh will go in unseeded. Japan's Yui Susaki will be the frontrunner to win gold, while China's Feng Ziqi and Ukrainian-born Azerbaijani female wrestler, and four-time Olympic medallist, Mariya Stadnik are also among the top contenders.\n\nAt 22, Anshu will become one of India's youngest two-time Olympians when she steps on the mat in Paris. Despite dealing with a shoulder injury sustained at the Hungary Ranking Series last month, Anshu -- a former world silver medallist -- will be in contention for a medal in the women's 57kg category on August 8 and 9.\n\nA four-week training stint in Japan earlier this year seemed to have an immediate impact on her speed, as seen at the Asian Olympic qualifier and the Hungary Ranking Series, where she beat the 2023 world silver medallist Anastasia Nichita 6-5. However, a 12-1 loss to China's Olympic qualifier, Kexin Hong, in the final serves as a reminder that there is still work to be done. The 57kg category is packed with elite competitors, including Japan's Tsugumi Sakurai, who will be eyeing her maiden Olympic title, and USA's Helen Maroulis, who hopes to reclaim the gold she won in 2016. Four-time world medallist Odunayo Adekuoroye of Nigeria, who defeated Anshu in the finals of the 2022 Commonwealth Games, is another significant threat.\n\nGearing up for action: Out of the six Indian wrestlers who have qualified for the Paris Olympics, Aman (in pic) and Antim are the only ones seeded due to their ranking points. | Photo Credit: PTI\n\nGearing up for action: Out of the six Indian wrestlers who have qualified for the Paris Olympics, Aman (in pic) and Antim are the only ones seeded due to their ranking points. | Photo Credit: PTI\n\nIndia's best prospects for a medal in Paris likely come from the two youngest members of the squad -- Antim and Reetika. At 19 years old, Antim will be the youngest member of the Indian wrestling contingent. Given her competition in the women's 53kg category on August 7th and 8th and her pedigree, she is well-placed to return with a medal.\n\nAntim is one of only two Indian wrestlers to be seeded -- the other being Aman in the men's freestyle -- meaning she will likely avoid the gold medal favourite, Akari Fujinami of Japan. In 2022, Antim became the first Indian woman to win gold at the Junior World Championships. She also benefits from the withdrawal of Russian and Belarusian wrestlers from the Olympics, as neither Natalia Malysheva of Russia, whom Antim narrowly defeated at the 2023 World Championships, nor Vanesa Kaladzinskaya, who beat Antim in the semifinals of the 2023 Worlds, will be competing. While the field has \ue816thinned somewhat, the 53kg category still presents challenges. Sweden's Jonna Malmgren recently defeated Antim while China's Olympic silver medallist Qianyu Pang and Ecuador's Lucia Guzman, who nearly stunned Fujinami at last year's World Championships, will also be strong contenders.\n\nIf Antim's field is opening up perfectly for her, Reetika isn't overly concerned about the competition in the women's 76kg category on August 10 and 11. The 21-year-old became the first Indian woman to win gold at the U-23 World Championships last year and has been on an impressive run since, losing just one international match since that competition. Among the Indian contenders for Paris, Reetika has wrestled more prospective opponents than anyone else over the past year. Of the 15 possible opponents, she's faced seven and beaten six, including the USA's Kennedy Blades, who defeated 2020 Olympic silver medallist Adeline Gray in the USA trials. Her only loss came by one point against 2023 World bronze medallist Tatiana Renteria of Colombia. While Japan's Yuka Kagami and Kyrgyzstan's Aiperi Kyzy -- the 2023 World gold and silver medallists -- are favourites for the top podium spots in Paris, Reetika remains a formidable contender.\n\nDespite qualifying for the Olympics in the final qualification tournament in Istanbul, neither Aman nor Nisha will be considered favourites to make the podium in the men's 57kg freestyle category on August 8 and 9 and the women's 68kg category on August 5 and 6, respectively.\n\nAman won gold at the U-23 World Championships in 2022 but has struggled to fill the shoes of Tokyo silver medallist Ravi Dahiya. He lost early to Zelimkhan Abakarov of Albania at last year's World Championships and was beaten by technical superiority (10-0) by Gulomjon Abdullaev of Uzbekistan. Both of these opponents have qualified for Paris. Indeed, Aman has yet to defeat any of his 15 opponents in Paris.\n\nThe Indian wrestling team for Paris Olympics 2024:\n\nMen:\n\nAman Sehrawat - Men's 57kg\n\nWomen:\n\nVinesh Phogat - Women's 50kg

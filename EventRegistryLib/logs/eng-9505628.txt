Game 2 was one of the best playoff games in recent memory, and it had a ridiculous ending. Jamal Murray, who struggled all game with his jump shot, nailed a buzzer-beater that broke the Lakers spirit. Additionally, minutes after the celebration in the Nuggets home arena, Jokic's brother got involved in a battle of his own. A video was released of the 2-time MVP's brother allegedly punching a fan. The video has prompted the league and law enforcement to investigate.\n\nAuthorities are making progress in their investigation into Nikola Jokic's brother, Strahinja Jokic's, alleged punching incident. The man who was alegedly struck in the face earlier this week by Strahinja Jokic appears to have been found. A spokesperson for the Denver Police has confirmed that the department has been in contact with the alleged victim. We still do not know if the alleged punching victim is pressing charges or not. The investigation is ongoing, and fans are curious how this will play out.\n\nRead More: Nikola Jokic's Brother Allegedly Throws Punch At Fan After Game 2 Against The Lakers\n\nThe older brothers of Jokic are well-known for their altercations with just about everyone. In the past, they have stood up to fans, rival athletes, and referees to defend their younger brother. Strahinja jumped over a row of seats to punch the fan. In the video Strahinja appears to have gotten close, pushing through a crowd, and allegedly delivered a punch. The fan and Jokic Brother continued to yell back and forth afterward. Notably, Nikola's wife was right by Strahinja when it all went down, and she was holding Nikola Jokic's young daughter through the violent incident.\n\nOverall, it's an unfortunate incident and an unnecessary distraction for the two-time MVP. There is a more than good chance that Jokic will be awarded his third MVP trophy in the coming weeks. The Denver Nuggets look unstoppable so far, and they are the favorites to win their second straight NBA title. The Nuggets face off against LeBron and the Los Angeles Lakers tonight in a pivotal game 3. The Nuggets have now won ten straight against the Lakers.

Not long after Jamal Murray hit a buzzer-beater to lift Denver to a 101-99 victory, a fan captured a video that appeared to show Strahinja jumping over the row of seats in front of him and punching a fan in the face.\n\nYou can see the clip here.\n\nAccording to TMZ, the Denver Police Department is investigating the incident. Police have seen the video of the haymaker and are trying to identify the man who was on the receiving end, but no one has filed a report claiming to be a victim. Investigators have asked witnesses to share any information they might have.\n\nThe NBA is also looking into the situation.\n\nStrahinja and Nemanja, who are massive in stature like Nikola, are known for passionately supporting their brother. That support sometimes presents itself as entertaining pettiness, but they have also done things like threatening an opposing player who got into it with Nikola.\n\nNikola Jokic had 27 points, 20 rebounds and 10 assists in Denver's Game 2 win.

Nikola Jokic led his team to a 101-99 victory over Lebron James and the Lakers. The game was full of great moments and spectacular play from the stars involved. Apparently, the action in the stands turned violent when one of Jokic's brothers punched a fan. Shortly after the incredible game-winning shot by Jamal Murray, Jokic's brother was filmed punching a fan in the stands.\n\nThe clip shows Jokic's older brother, Strahinja, in an altercation with a fan. It's a terrible incident to have, especially after your brother just won an important game. Jokic's older brothers are massive guys who are known to get into altercations with anyone and everybody. They have confronted referees, fans, and even opposing players in the past to defend their little brother. It's unacceptable behavior from someone who is related to a two-time MVP, especially in the playoffs. The NBA is reportedly looking into the incident.\n\nThe video shows Strahinja jumping over seats to punch a fan. He pushed his way through a crowd of fans to confront the man. Strahinja was clearly eager to get close, and as soon as he did, he punched him in the face. The fan and Jokic Brother continued to bark at one another for some time after the incident. Nikola's wife was seated by Strahinja and close to the incident the entire time, holding the two-time MVP's young daughter. At this point, we don't know what started the incident, but the Jokic brothers are known to defend their families even if they are in the wrong.\n\nThe Nuggets now lead the Lakers 2-0 and will head to Los Angeles for Game 3 on Thursday. Nikola Jokic dropped an impressive triple-double of 27 points, 20 rebounds, and 10 assists. His partner in crime, Jamal Murray, scored 14 of his 20 points in the fourth quarter. Murray nailed a dagger at the buzzer to devastate the Lakers. The incident with Jokic's brother will hopefully not be a distraction for the defending champion.", "source": {"uri": "hotnewhiphop.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HotNewHipHop"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jamil_david@hotnewhiphop.com", "name": "Jamil David", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/imgprst/2292x1200-fit-81-auto/2024/04/GettyImages-2149789541.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505628", "eventUri": "eng-9505628", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

Also getting socked in the face during the game, this time without being metaphorical, was a fan in the stands, who caught the fist of Jokic's older brother, Strahinja. A video of the altercation has already gone viral.\n\nIt is unclear what exactly triggered Strahinja to snap at the fan, but it seemed serious enough for Jokic's brother to come down a couple of rows to get to his target. Fortunately for the fan, he only took one shot to the face. He also seems to have quite a jaw as he did not appear to be seriously hurt by the punch and can even be seen in the video still exchanging words with Strahinja after the physical confrontation.\n\nThis is not a good look for Strahinja, but again, it's better to hear an explanation from each side before making a final judgment.\n\nThe NBA is already looking into the matter, according to TMZ Sports.\n\n\"I don't see Doncic brother doing such things.. Clear MVP in my unbiased opnion opinion,\" joked X (formerly Twitter) user @fball_newzz.\n\n\"Haha dude took the punch and walked away,\" said @fadde, who was left impressed by the fan's tolerance.\n\nIt's the same sentiment from @urqmyheart: \"No way, the guy didn't even fall? The Jokic brothers hype was totally unjustified \ud83d\ude2d.\"\n\nEmotions ran high during the Lakers-Nuggets game, especially with how it concluded but could that be a reason behind the shocking scuffle in the stands involving a fan and a Jokic?\n\n\"Didn't get punched for no reason, need to hear the back story first,\" stated @_Bato_.\n\n\"People with money do not go to jail. He will be sued, and his brother will pay the fine. He will be back in the stands for the next game,\" opined @Gregory74755904.\n\n\"Even the fans can't do anything about them,\" said @JabrkitJubawdit.\n\nTo be fair, getting between that fan and Strahinja, who is not a small human being (listed at 6-7), was never going to be an easy decision to make for the people near the incident.\n\n\"Honestly, the Lakers should sign the Jokic brothers this summer,\" @CJToledano shared.\n\nFrom @TheSportsHernia: \"How was that dude still standing? Regardless, this is exactly the way the Jokic brothers postseason debut was expected to go down.\"\n\n\"Gaht damn dude took that punch on the chin like a CHAMP from Jokic brother. Wonder if the league will investigate and if the guy will sue em. Jokic brother gotta be banned straight up,\" Chris Williamson wondered.\n\nAs for what happened on the court in Game 2, the Nuggets pulled off a stunning 101-99 victory despite being down by as many as 20 points. Jamal Murray added to his legend in Mile High City by sinking a game-winning jumper at the buzzer to send Nuggets fans everywhere into a state of pandemonium. Murray finished with 20 points with five assists, three rebounds, and two blocks in 40 minutes. Meanwhile, Jokic paced the Nuggets with a monster triple-double of 27 points, 20 rebounds, and 10 assists, while shooting 9/16 from the floor and 7/7 from the free throw line.\n\nGame 3 of the series will be on Thursday in LA at 10 p.m. Eastern Time.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rexwell_villas@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Rexwell Villas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Williamson_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Williamson (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Nikola-Jokics-older-brother-caught-punching-Lakers-fan-during-wild-Game-2-comeback.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505628", "eventUri": "eng-9505628", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

He's certainly more passionate on the court, though and that same level of energy has been exuded by brothers as his team's playoff series against the Los Angeles Lakers continues. Most recently, one of Jokic's siblings ended up getting in a fight in the stands with another fan and, yes, there's a video.\n\nAfter the Denver Nuggets' impressive comeback victory over the Los Angeles Lakers in Monday night's Game 2 matchup, the clip of Nikola Jokic's brother, Strahinja, getting into it with a fan surfaced. Here's what we know about the situation and the game during which the incident occurred.\n\nShortly after the Denver Nuggets defeated the Los Angeles Lakers in a buzzer-beating 101-99 victory, Strahinja Jokic was in no mood to celebrate, it seems. Check out the video, which shows him climbing down a row to meet another fan and striking him in the face with a closed fist:\n\nStrahinja was quickly backed up by his other brother, Nemanja. The woman pulling at them is Nikola Jokic's wife, Natalija, who was seen holding their young daughter, Ognjena, in her other arm. While words were exchanged between the two men after the punch, it doesn't seem as though the incident escalated any further. It could've been worse but, based on the footage, I think nearby spectators would've preferred Strahinja take inspiration from Joel Embiid and give the fan his favorite WWE gesture instead.\n\nThe Denver Nuggets' victory put them up two games to zero on the Los Angeles Lakers and, given the latter blew a sizable lead to lose this game, tensions were high. Suffice it to say, Anthony Davis' mic drop press conference can best represent the vibe of Lakers fans in the stadium:\n\nPersonally, I'd looked forward to seeing jovial Lakers fans sing \"You Are My Sunshine\" to LeBron James, but it doesn't seem like that will be happening anytime soon. The LA-based team did about everything right to beat the Nuggets and were still unable to get it done. To be clear, we don't know exactly what set off the situation between Nikola Jokic's brother and the fan, but there's surely a possibility that the playoff game's outcome factored into it.\n\nThe NBA courtside is often more known for featuring a celebrity like Emma Stone waving to players and less about brawls. In a season that has shown the league take action against Draymond Green for violence on the court that even had Metta Sanford-Artest sharing his thoughts, one has to wonder if the league will take action against the Jokic brothers. I don't think it's unrealistic to believe they might be banned from at least one of the Nugget's upcoming games (if not the rest of the series) based on disciplinary action that's been handed down in the past.\n\nThe off-court drama might be more evidence, however, that people should stop scanning the 2024 TV schedule and spending more time locked into the NBA playoffs. It'd be an understatement to say that the first round has been loaded with some big matchups. And, with games on just about every night and no shortage of commentary from the likes of Shaquille O'Neal and Charles Barkley, there's plenty of justification to spend evenings watching some of the best teams in the league compete for a chance to win the championship.\n\nNikola Jokic's Denver Nuggets next play the Los Angeles Lakers on TNT on Thursday at 10:00 p.m. ET.

While passionate support is a hallmark of sports fandom, violence and aggression have no place in the stands.\n\nAs the NBA investigates the incident, questions remain about the potential consequences for Strahinja and the fan involved.

So what started all this?\n\nThat's what's unclear at this point. We don't know what started all of this yet. The NBA is conducting an investigation on it, however, according to The Athletic:\n\n\"The NBA confirmed to The Athletic that it is looking into an alleged altercation between Strahinja and the fan. The Nuggets are not commenting on the situation as of yet, but are known to be actively looking into the altercation.\"\n\nWe may not know what happened here yet, but we'll certainly find out.\n\nWow. What a strange situation.\n\nIt is strange, certainly, but it's not surprising in the least bit. Jokic's brothers have a bit of a violent reputation at this point.\n\nRemember a few years ago when Jokic got into an altercation on the court with Markieff Morris? They threatened to get involved after Marcus Morris tweeted about Nikola's cheap shot on Markieff. Not only that, but the brothers also appeared ready and willing to get into an altercation a few years ago when Nikola and Devin Booker got into it.\n\nYikes, man. That's scary.\n\nIt is. Strahinja, himself, has also had some legal troubles in the past, according to The Athletic.\n\n\"Strahinja Joki\u0107 was arrested for allegedly choking and pushing a woman during a domestic dispute on Sept. 26, 2019, when he was accused of second-degree assault and two misdemeanors by the Denver District Attorney's Office. According to the Denver Post, he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count of obstruction of phone service and felony trespassing in February 2020. The other charges were reportedly dismissed.\"\n\nNone of this is a good look for him.\n\nSo how does this end?\n\nAt this point, that's unclear. We have to wait until the end of the NBA's investigation to see where the league will take things.\n\nBut one thing is for sure: The history here does not look great. It feels like a certainty that the NBA will consider it. If it does, it wouldn't be shocking at all if the Jokic brothers weren't a fixture at these games anymore.\n\nHonestly, though, that might be the least of their troubles after this.", "source": {"uri": "ftw.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "For The Win"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_d_sykes@ftw.usatoday.com", "name": "Mike D.

The exchange quickly turned to blows as Strahinja Jokic punched the fan in the face as brother Nemanja Jokic followed behind. The TikTok user captioned the video: \"Jokic brothers going wild.\"\n\nThe footage emerged after Denver's 101-99 Game 2 win over the Los Angeles Lakers, which saw the Nuggets overcome a 20-point deficit to take a 2-0 lead over LeBron James and the Lakers in the first-round series.\n\nThe video also caught the attention of Denver Police, which is investigating the incident, although a victim has not come forward yet.\n\n\"The Denver Police Department is aware of the video circulating on social media... The incident was not reported to Denver Police at the arena or after the game was over, and at this time, no one has come forward as a victim of this incident,\" DPD said in a statement to USA TODAY Sports. \"The Department is looking into this incident, is actively working to identify the person in the video who was struck, and encourages anyone who was involved or witnessed this firsthand to contact the Denver Police Department.\"\n\nJokic brothers have had multiple dust-ups\n\nThis is not the first off-court altercation that has involved the Jokic siblings. When Nikola Jokic was involved in a dust-up with the Phoenix Suns' Devin Booker during the 2021 Western Conference semifinals, Strahinja Jokic and Nemanja Jokic were visibly upset in the stands and had to be held back from the court.\n\nIn November 2021, after Nikola Jokic and Miami's Markieff Morris were involved in an on-court scuffle that resulted in a one-game suspension for the youngest Jokic brother, Strahinja Jokic and Nemanja Jokic took the beef to Twitter.\n\nIn response to a tweet from Marcus Morris, brother of Markieff Morris - \"Waited till bro turned his back smh. NOTED.\"- the Jokic brothers opened the twitter account @JokicBrothers and responded: \"You should leave this the way it is instead of publicly threatening our brother!

Jokic's brother was in no mood to celebrate the comeback victory over the Lakers as he was seen and recorded punching a fan in the face at the game. The video shows Strahinja hopping over multiple rows of seats and kicking his way through a crowd to reach the male spectator. All this occurred just minutes after the Denver Nuggets took Game 2 from Lebron James.\n\nIn addition, the third Jokic brother, Nemanja, was right behind Strahinja for backup as he continued to bark at the fan after the punch. According to TMZ, the two-time MVP's wife was sitting with the brothers, and she can be seen in the video holding their young daughter. However, she was trying to stay out of the way.\n\nAfter the events, it is unclear what actually led to this altercation. It is not known what the fan had said to the family. However, this is not a good look for either side, and police could be involved shortly. The Jokic brothers are not shy about showing their intense feelings, and they have always rushed to defend their superstar brother.\n\nOf course, it will be interesting to see what kind of punishment the NBA hands out for this.

He has been working at PEOPLE since 2019. His work has previously appeared in Rolling Stone, The New York Times, ESPN, and more.\n\nThe Denver Police Department are looking into an allegation that Denver Nuggets star Nikola Jokic's brother, Strahinja Joki\u0107, was seen punching another fan in the face following a dramatic playoff game on Monday night, PEOPLE confirms.\n\nA spokesperson with the department says officials have been in contact with the individual who was punched and that the department \"continues to look into\" the incident which allegedly involved Strahinja, according to CNN and USA Today.\n\n\"At this point all we are able to say is that the investigation is ongoing and no arrests have been made,\" the Denver Police spokesperson says.\n\nIt's not clear whether charges have been filed or whether the individual seen throwing a punch in the viral video is Strahinja.\n\nTMZ published a fan's video of the incident, which shows a broad man wearing a dark blue Jokic No. 15 Nuggets jersey climbing over a row of seats and approaching another fan who appears to be arguing with him. The video, first shared on TikTok, shows the man who is allegedly Strahinja then unleashing a fierce punch to the other man's face using his right fist.\n\nThe man who gets punched staggers backwards, but appears to walk away from the incident as the man alleged to be Strahinja continues yelling in his direction.\n\nThe Associated Press reported Tuesday that Denver police are investigating the incident, which took place moments after the final buzzer of the Nuggets' last-second 101-99 win over the Los Angeles Lakers on Monday.\n\nIn a statement confirming the investigation to PEOPLE on Wednesday, a spokesperson with the Denver Police said the department \"is aware of the video circulating on social media that appears to have happened Monday night at the Denver Nuggets game.\"\n\n\"The incident was not reported to Denver Police at the arena or after the game was over, and at this time, no one has come forward as a victim of this incident,\" the statement reads. \"The Department is looking into this incident, is actively working to identify the person in the video who was struck, and encourages anyone who was involved or witnessed this firsthand to contact the Denver Police Department.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Nuggets did not immediately respond to PEOPLE's request for comment on the matter.\n\nThe Nuggets currently hold a 2-0 series lead over LeBron James and the Lakers in the first round of the NBA Playoffs. Denver's 101-99 win Monday night came on a dramatic last-second shot from Nuggets guard Jamal Murray, sending the hometown Denver crowd into a frenzy at Ball Arena.\n\nJokic, 29, has two older brothers: Strahinja and Nemanja Joki\u0107. The two-time NBA MVP told SLAM Magazine in 2016 that his siblings inspired him to play basketball and that they both moved to Denver with him from their hometown of Sombor, Serbia when the Nuggets selected him in the 2014 NBA Draft.\n\n\"I fell in love with basketball because of them,\" Jokic said. \"We would always play together.\"\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nStrahinja was a professional basketball player in Serbia before retiring, while Nemanja played college basketball in the United States before returning to play in Serbia, according to SLAM.\n\nJokic is widely liked throughout the NBA and its fanbase. With a dry, but strong sense of humor, the 6-foot-11 Serbian star has gone viral for his seemingly nonchalant approach to the game - a game in which he's already laid out a Hall of Fame-caliber career with six NBA All-Star selections, back-to-back regular season MVP awards in 2021 and 2022, and helping lead the Nuggets to an NBA Championship last season while being named the NBA Finals MVP in the process.\n\nThis week, Jokic also made headlines for his wholesome appearance in the new trailer for Despicable Me 4.", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"},

It's unclear when the incident involving Jokic's brother occurred or what led to the confrontation. It is believed the victim was a fan of the Lakers, who clearly was in enemy territory.\n\nStrahinja and Nemanja Jokic have attended Nuggets games for years in support of their brother, a candidate to win his third NBA MVP award.\n\nPolice are presumably looking for the victim for questioning, not because he did anything wrong. But it could lead to trouble for Jokic's brother.\n\nThe NBA is also investigating the altercation, league sources told FanBuzz. It's unclear what sparked the altercation, but one thing's for sure -- Jokic's brother made sure to end it fairly quickly.\n\nWhen it comes to the Lakers and their fans, it seems, the Jokic bros. just keep delivering knockout blows.

But anyway, he then made his way to a male spectator.\n\nWhen Strahinja got close enough, he snuffed the fan in the face.\n\nAfter the assault, both Strahinja and the guy who caught the jab kept talking smack even while the third brother, Nemanja, was behind his aggressive brother for moral support.\n\nNow, get this: Joker, a two-time MVP, had his wife, Natalija, also in the stands. She was merely feet away from the action with Joker's brothers while holding their young daughter. She did try to get Strahinja to chill, but he wasn't having any of it.\n\nThe Jokic brothers, who are as imposing as their famous brother, are known for defending Joker at games, but flat-out punching people is another thing.

The exchange quickly turned to blows as Strahinja Jokic punched the fan in the face as brother Nemanja Jokic followed behind. The TikTok user captioned the video: \"Jokic brothers going wild.\"\n\nThe footage emerged after Denver's 101-99 Game 2 win over the Los Angeles Lakers, which saw the Nuggets overcome a 20-point deficit to take a 2-0 lead over LeBron James and the Lakers in the first-round series.\n\nThe video also caught the attention of Denver Police, which is investigating the incident, although a victim has not come forward yet.\n\n\"The Denver Police Department is aware of the video circulating on social media...

When Nikola Jokic was involved in a dust-up with the Phoenix Suns' Devin Booker during the 2021 Western Conference semifinals, Strahinja Jokic and Nemanja Jokic were visibly upset in the stands and had to be held back from the court.\n\nIn November 2021, after Nikola Jokic and Miami's Markieff Morris were involved in an on-court scuffle that resulted in a one-game suspension for the youngest Jokic brother, Strahinja Jokic and Nemanja Jokic took the beef to Twitter.\n\nIn response to a tweet from Marcus Morris, brother of Markieff Morris - \"Waited till bro turned his back smh. NOTED.\"- the Jokic brothers opened the twitter account @JokicBrothers and responded: \"You should leave this the way it is instead of publicly threatening our brother!

Strahinja and Nemanja Jokic continue toward the fan in the video, but no other part of the incident are recorded. It's unknown if this escalated further.\n\nTMZ reported that \"the NBA is currently looking into the situation.\" The Athletic also confirmed that the league is investigating the situation. Denver Police are also looking into the incident, per ESPN, citing an email from the media relations unit.\n\n\"At this time, no one has come forward as a victim of this incident,\" the email said, per ESPN. \"The Department is looking into this incident, is actively working to identify the person in the video who was struck, and encourages anyone who was involved or witnessed this firsthand to contact the Denver Police Department.\"\n\nJokic is a two-time MVP and one of the biggest stars in the league. He helped spur the Nuggets' 20-point comeback in Game 2, registering 27 points, 20 rebounds and 10 assists.\n\nIt's not the first time the Jokic brothers have been in the headlines. In 2021, they had a very public spat with Marcus and Markieff Morris. Nikola Jokic shoved Markieff Morris during a game, which resulted in a one-game suspension. The brother duo took to social media to issue a warning to the twins.\n\n\"You should leave this the way it is instead of publicly threatening our brother!\" a tweet from the account \"JokicBothers\" read. \"Your brother made a dirty play first.

Jokic is shooting 61.5% from the field and 42.9% from deep.\n\nWith the Game 2 win, the Nuggets have now won 10 in a row against the Lakers, dating back to last year's Western Conference Finals.\n\nJokic was not the hero in the 101-99 win, which included a 20-point comeback. That title belonged to Jamal Murray. The Nuggets guard shook off a slow start with a huge fourth quarter, which included the game-winning step-back at the buzzer.\n\n\"The thing about Jamal is that we know what he's capable of,\" Jokic said. \"We obviously would like him to make every shot, but we know that everyone goes through a bad stretch. We know what he's capable of, and we want him to shoot the ball because we know he can make all kinds of shots.\"\n\nThe series now heads to Los Angeles for Game 3.

According to TMZ, Denver police have already seen the footage in question but cannot take any action without an active victim.\n\n\"Denver PD has seen the footage of Strahinja Jokic punching a spectator in the stands after the Nuggets' Game 2 win over the Lakers on Monday,\" wrote TMZ Sports. \"But as of right now, no one has filed a report claiming to be a victim.\"\n\nAmid the Nuggets' miraculous 20-point comeback on Monday, a scene broke out in Ball Arena involving one Strahinja and a courtside fan. In a video that has gone viral online, Strahinja can be seen throwing punches somewhere in the stands and the NBA has deemed it's serious enough to warrant its own investigation.\n\nIt will take some time for the league to confirm the details of this incident but there could be serious consequences for whoever is found to be the most guilty. Depending on which is the aggressor here, either the fan or even Strahinja Jokic himself could be banned or suspended from attending games or any NBA-related event.\n\nSo far, neither Jokic nor the Nuggets have acknowledged the encounter and it's likely to stay that way unless they are pressured to make a statement. With the first round of the playoffs officially underway, the Nuggets have nothing to gain from getting caught up in distractions right now.\n\nFor Jokic, this is hardly his first incident involving his family and people from the NBA. In an infamous exchange back in 2022, both Jokic brothers got caught up in a cold war with the Morris twins that saw them make threats back and forth for weeks.\n\nNo doubt, the past will play a role in the NBA's judgment here and Strahinja did himself no favors by having these outbursts multiple already. Of course, that's not to mention his violent behavior off the court, which includes choking and pushing a woman in Denver. But despite the outbursts and lack of self-control from his own family, Nikola never lets any of it impact his game on the court. The Nuggets star is strictly business and it's one of the many reasons why he's on the verge of his third MVP.", "source": {"uri": "fadeawayworld.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fadeaway World"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nico_martinez@fadeawayworld.net", "name": "Nico Martinez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ball Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://fadeawayworld.net/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjA1OTQ4MDI0MzIzNTgxNTY0/strahinja-jokic.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505628", "eventUri": "eng-9505628", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

So how is he such a dominant force in the NBA? Well, I've got a theory, and I'm pretty confident about it to tell you the truth.\n\nHe grew up with two older brothers that just might be the toughest, meanest beings on Earth.\n\nNikola Jokic grew up in Serbia with two older brothers, Strahinja and Nemanja. Since Nikola started his NBA career, he's seemingly made it a goal to stay under the radar as much as he can... even though he's a super star. His older brothers, on the other hand, appear to have a collective goal of punching and fighting as many people as they can. While Nik kinda gives you loveable big man vibes, his brothers give you \"bad guys in a John Wick movie\" vibes.\n\nThey've done it before plenty of times, and Strahinja and Nemanja were back at it again last night after the Denver Nuggets came back and won against the Los Angeles Lakers to go up 2-0 in the series. Now that the NBA is in the playoffs (and the players are actually trying), the stakes are high out on the basketball court, and we're just in the first round.\n\nHowever, one could argue that the stakes were even higher for one fan that was sitting next to the Jokic brothers at the game. As you might imagine with Nikola Jokic being a center in the NBA, his brothers are giant human beings as well. Strahinja apparently got fed up with another, regular-sized person in the stands, and actually ended up sucker punching him.\n\nMiraculously, the guy who got punched right square in the face stayed upright, and was virtually unfazed. He might need to look into a boxing or MMA career if he's that good at taking a punch, especially from someone in a bigger weight division.\n\nThe video is pretty crazy, and the NBA just recently announced that they were officially investigating the incident. So now Nikola Jokic has to worry about defending an NBA title and defending his fan-punching brothers. I'm sure the solution is pretty simple: Tell them not to do what they did in this footage:", "source": {"uri": "whiskeyriff.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Whiskey Riff"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sucker_punch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sucker punch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.whiskeyriff.com/wp-content/uploads/Jokic-4.png?fit=1200%2C709&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505628", "eventUri": "eng-9505628", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

According to the Denver Post, he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count of obstruction of phone service and felony trespassing in February of 2020. The other charges were reportedly dismissed.\n\nThe Joki\u0107 brothers are no strangers to fisticuffs, as they famously feuded with the Morris twins, NBA players Marcus and Markieff Morris, back in November 2021.

A video on social media shows an altercation where a man wearing a Joki\u0107 jersey, reported to be one of the two-time MVP's older brothers, Strahinja Joki\u0107, punches another man in the face while in the stands.\n\nThe Nuggets have not made any public statement on the situation, though they are reportedly looking into it, as is the Denver Police Department, per the Denver Post. It's unclear how the altercation began or what led to it, but you can see the man in the Joki\u0107 jersey climbing down a row of seats to punch a man in the face. It doesn't appear as though the situation escalated past that, as the man who was punched turned around and didn't engage further in the situation.\n\nHere's the video of the altercation:\n\nJoki\u0107's older brothers are typically seen supporting Nikola at games. If it is confirmed that it is Strahinja in the video, it wouldn't be the first time he has been involved in a physical altercation. In 2019, he was arrested for allegedly choking and pushing a woman while the two were inside a Denver apartment. He was later charged with second-degree assault, false imprisonment and obstruction of phone service and pled guilty in 2020 to a misdemeanor count of obstruction of phone service and felony trespassing. The other charges against the older Jokic brother were dismissed.\n\nIn addition to that, Joki\u0107's brothers got into a social media spat with NBA players Marcus and Markieff Morris in November 2021. That situation stemmed from Nikola getting ejected from a game against the Miami Heat after a late hit on Markieff. Heat players came to Markieff's defense, and players needed to be separated. Later on social media, Marcus posted how Nikola \"Waited till bro turned his back\" before trucking Markieff in the back. He wrote \"NOTED,\" insinuating that he would get some sort of payback on the Nuggets franchise centerpiece. That led to Joki\u0107's brothers creating an X (formerly known as Twitter) account to respond in part, writing, \"You should leave this the way it is instead of publicly threatening our brother...If you want to make a step further we will be waiting for you.\"\n\nThere was also a video in June 2021 of Strahinja and Nikola's other brother, Nemanja, yelling at Suns players while having to be held back by arena security. That stemmed from a scuffle Nikola got into with Devin Booker following a hard foul on former Suns player Cameron Payne. Nikola was later ejected for his foul on Payne.\n\nThere seems to be a history with Joki\u0107's older brothers, so we'll have to wait and see the results of the NBA, Nuggets and Denver Police investigations.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jasmyn_wimbish@cbssports.com", "name": "Jasmyn Wimbish", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denver Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markieff_Morris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Markieff Morris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Denver_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Denver Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Payne", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cameron Payne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_Booker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Devin Booker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/04/23/f9756ed4-f28b-42f8-84c5-9fe5dc1a57e7/thumbnail/1200x675/ddb46b42164640bb833a4a0f4124e02d/strahinja-jokic-nuggets-brother-g.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505628", "eventUri": "eng-9505628", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

It's unclear if Jokic's brothers will be in attendance.\n\nMany fans believe the NBA should step in and prevent Jokic's older brother from attending future playoff games.", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_rosvoglou@postandcourier.com", "name": "Chris Rosvoglou", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "label": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 46}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/1e/11eedee9-70d2-517f-a4d0-f3cec75947f6/66280e44116d7.image.png?crop=1166%2C612%2C0%2C93&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505628", "eventUri": "eng-9505628", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Strahinja and Nemanja Joki\u0107, who is the third Joki\u0107 brother, are seen approaching two men in the stands in Denver and confronting them. It's unclear what led up to the altercation or what was said, but Strahinja then appeared to throw a punch that hit the fan in the head.\n\nThe single punch seemed to be the end of it, and the two sides then left.\n\nAccording to TMZ, Denver Police are also investigating the incident, though no police report has been filed.\n\nThe incident is far from the first involving Joki\u0107's brothers. Strahinja and Nemanja took to social media in 2021 after Joki\u0107 was suspended for shoving Miami Heat forward Markieff Morris and threatened Morris multiple times. The pair are frequently sitting courtside at Nuggets games, too, and aren't afraid to get very involved in the action anytime something pops up. For example, they were seen screaming at Phoenix Suns players after a scuffle broke out during a game in 2021.\n\nStrahinja was arrested for allegedly choking and pushing a woman during a domestic dispute in 2019.

Like in that game against the Phoenix Suns when Nikola had a disagreement with Devin Booker.\n\nStrahinja and Nemanja didn't hesitate, they were ready to rush onto the field and defend their younger brother against Booker, who was two heads shorter and thirty kilos lighter...\n\nThe Jokics clan from Zombor is a strong team, as can be seen in this family photo. Strahinja is fourth from the left.\n\nNikola was once asked if he was afraid of anyone on the basketball court. The player replied:\n\nWhy should I keep it? We just play on the pitch.

This is America. People love to sue, especially when they think there's a quick payday on the horizon.\n\nWhat I will say is the fan who got rocked should be very proud of himself for how he handled that punch. Dude got jacked up by a punch right to the face, and didn't even fall.\n\nA massive Serbian man unloaded a powerful shot to the guy's jaw, and he stood his ground without backing down. Everyone is talking about Strahinja's idiotic behavior, but we should be talking about the iron jaw of whoever this guy is.\n\nMost people would crumble like a crushed tin can if they took a shot to the face. He stumbled a bit, but never went down. Never went down!\n\nAs for Strahinja, he's likely going to find himself with a phone call from the league or stadium security in the very near future if it hasn't already happened.

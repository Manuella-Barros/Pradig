{"id": 231313016, "title": "Padres Daily: Power play; All-Star outfielders; King's contribution; Waldron's first focus", "text": "Good morning, Fernando Tatis Jr. was talking about his own swing and his journey to slugging more consistently this season. \u201cHomers are gonna come and go,\u201d he said late last night. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to be a good hitter with power. Everybody loves homers. I do too. We\u2019ve got to hit the ball right first.\u201d A good hitter. Then power. He could have well been talking about the team in general. The dearth and the rebirth of the Padres' power was the focus of my game story (here) from last night\u2019s 10-3 victory over the Diamondbacks. The Padres last night hit three home runs in a game for the first time since May 19. In the 18 games in between that date and last night, they had hit a total of nine homers. In that span, they continued to get hit in great numbers. But on the nights they couldn\u2019t get those hits in bunches \u2014 notably, during the five-game losing streak they took into last night\u2019s game \u2014 the lack of slug cost them. The Padres lead the major leagues with a .261 team batting average and are fifth with a .325 on-base percentage. Their 23.3 percent line drive rate ranks fifth. They have the second-most hard-hit balls in the National League. They hit the ball to center field more often than all but the Brewers. They do a lot of things right. \u201cWe talk about staying on the ball, and a lot of times \u2026 the approach of staying on the ball leads to slug,\u201d manager Mike Shildt said. \u201cWe don't want to just be \u2018stay on the ball, stay on the ball.\u2019 We are kind of built for that. I don't want to get away from that identity. But a lot of times you stay on the ball and you get mistakes, you can pull balls and drive balls. That\u2019s what we were able to do tonight. So let's not kid ourselves, the homers, it's still a friend of ours, but we can do it all is the point. And we need to be holistic in that approach. So it was nice to get some balls that were able to get in the gaps and get out of the ballpark and create some instant runs. We want to be able to compete offensively in every different area effectively. We've been able to do that. We've just got to get consistent with it.\u201d Tatis and Jurickson Profar hit back-to-back homers in last night\u2019s first inning, and Ha-Seong Kim hit a two-run homer in the fifth. The Padres also scored five runs in the eighth inning without a homer, which has been far more common for them this year. \u201cWe really like the way we play the game,\u201d hitting coach Victor Rodriguez said after last night\u2019s game. \u201cWe really like it, but \u2026 we know there is going to be power there.\u201d Last night was just the third home run during Tatis\u2019 13-game hitting streak. But none of those three have been cheap. Last night\u2019s blast the second time he cleared the wall in center field. All three have been longer than 400 feet. This has been building, as his misses lately have become 330-foot fly balls off the end of his bat instead of rollover grounders. He is staying back on the ball, not flailing or, in the parlance of hitting coaches, drifting around the ball. The swing is easy again. \u201cI\u2019m putting good at-bats out there,\u201d Tatis said. \u201cPutting my barrel out there, which is more important.\u201d Profar has for some time seemed destined to be one of the best stories of this year\u2019s All-Star game. The game is being played July 16 at Globe Life Field, home of the Texas Rangers, for whom Profar came up through the minor leagues. He was the No.1 prospect in all of baseball at the time of his MLB debut in 2012 and played his first five big-league seasons in Texas. This would be his first All-Star game. Bryce Miller wrote (here) a couple weeks ago about the prospect of Profar making the All-Star game, and Profar has hardly slowed since then. He ranks second in MLB with a .325 average and leads the National League with a .418 on-base percentage. He hit his ninth homer run last night, which is tied for 19th in the NL. His four RBIs last night gave him 42 for the season, tied for fifth in the NL. Profar\u2019s 2.4 WAR leads NL outfielders by 0.3 points over another player who is proving he still has a lot left as well. That would be ... Tatis. Yes, the good friends and offseason training partners are both positioned to be All-Stars. \u201cThat'd be fun,\u201d Tatis said. \u201cDefinitely be fun and definitely something, if we accomplish it, something that we're gonna talk probably forever and something that we were gonna remind ourselves \u2014 from working in the offseason to playing winter ball together and hopefully going to All-Star game, it'll be really nice piece of our story.\u201d I wrote (here) this week about Luis Campusano\u2019s struggles at the plate as he adjusts to being the Padres\u2019 primary catcher. Campusano, who on Wednesday stopped a hitless streak at 29 at-bats, entered last night\u2019s game batting .102/.185/.153 over his previous 20 games. He went 3-for-4 with a double and two RBIs. It was his first multi-hit game since May 14, after he had 11 in 33 starts to that point. \u201cI think it's huge,\u201d Shildt said. \u201cHe's caught a lot. If you\u2019re going to be the everyday guy, that's pretty much the workload you're looking at. And there's a learning curve to this game. There's a learning curve to what that looks like, and sometimes the curve goes down before it goes up. And you\u2019ve gotta learn to get through it mentally and physically. It's just part of it. There's some growing pains with it. Sometimes it comes in a lot of different forms, and a lot of times it can come with the bat, learning to do all of it and being mentally focused to do all of it when you play that much. And to his credit, he's continued to grow and get better at it, and tonight was a nice night for him.\u201d Last night was the 25-year-old Campusano\u2019s 47th start behind the plate this season, 13 more than he started in 2023. His 433\u2154 innings this season are just 44\u2153 fewer than he played in the major leagues from 2021 to \u201823. The Padres are 9-5 in games Michael King has started, the best record for any Padres starter. That last night was the fourth time they have scored at least 10 runs and the sixth time they have scored at least seven runs in his starts has something to do with that. But King did throw five scoreless innings last night, and it could have gone a lot differently from the start. He walked the first batter he faced on four pitches and had runners at the corners with one out before escaping with a strikeout and a groundout. \u201cWe get out of the first inning, the traffic, and then \u2014 bam! \u2014 the home runs,\u201d Shildt said. \u201cIt was like, all right, we got the lead, which we have not had in a while. We were able to play our game from there.\u201d The Padres led at the end of five innings during their five-game losing streak. Matt Waldron enters tonight\u2019s game having been one of the major leagues\u2019 most effective starting pitchers over the past four weeks. His 1.84 ERA over his past five starts ranks 10th in MLB since May 11. His 35 strikeouts are eighth most. He is one of 17 pitchers to have held opposing hitters to a batting average below .200 and one of 19 pitchers with a WHIP lower than 1.00 in that span. Here is a look at Waldron\u2019s past five starts versus his first seven starts: We spend a lot of time talking about Waldron\u2019s knuckleball. And for good reasons. He is the only one throwing it, it is effective, and it is cool. As discussed in previous newsletters, his conviction with that pitch has been essential in his improvement. But there are two things that have facilitated his ascension more than anything. One, he started to believe he was good enough. It is something pitching coach Ruben Niebla drilled into him over and over. And then opposing hitters told him \u2014 not with their words but with their swings. \u201cThe results at the end of the day are what make you confident,\u201d Waldron said. \u201cI can't be confident in myself and believe I'm better than them when they consistently beat me. And Ruben, he just does a great job communicating with us. So I gotta give credit there.\u201d The other thing that Waldron grasped was that the start of the game can effectively be the end. His last poor start, for instance, was May 5 against the Diamondbacks, who scored four runs against him in the first inning, two in the second and ran him from the game with two more in the fourth. \u201cThat first inning, man, it was ugly a couple times,\u201d Waldron said. \u201cSo just coming out of the gates ready to go has definitely been much better. \u201cIt\u2019s been the level of preparation and maybe also just up here.\u201d He was pointing at his head when he said the last part. It has made a difference. Of the 24 runs he allowed in his first seven starts, 19 were scored in the first two innings. In his past five starts, he has allowed four runs in the first two innings. He has not allowed a run in the first two innings of either of his past two starts. \u201cI always envisioned going long in a game,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you can't ignore that first inning.\u201d Last night was the 15th game this season in which all nine starting position players reached base at least once. It had happened seven times through 67 games last season.The Padres\u2019 five-run eighth inning last night was the 21st time they have scored at least four runs in an inning. They did not have that many innings of four or more runs until Aug. 21 (game 126) last season. All four times Profar has come to the plate with the bases loaded this season, he has driven in at least one run. On three occasions, he has cleared the bases. His double in the eighth inning last night was his second of the season. He also has a grand slam and a walk for a total of 11 RBIs with the bases loaded. Last night was Profar\u2019s 17th multi-hit game last night, tied with Tatis for most on the team. Luis Arraez, who leads the major leagues with a .337 batting average, was 2-for-4 with a walk and has 26 multi-hit games this season (14 with the Padres). You can read Jeff Sanders\u2019 game preview (here) from yesterday afternoon for the latest on Manny Machado and Shildt\u2019s surprise at learning he had been ejected after Thursday\u2019s game. When Wandy Peralta allowed three runs in the seventh inning last night, it was the fifth time a Padres reliever had an impressive scoreless streak snapped in the past 10 days.All right, that\u2019s it for me.

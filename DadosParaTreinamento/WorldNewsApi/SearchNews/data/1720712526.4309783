{"id": 232047858, "title": "Inside the grand Lincolnshire castle which features in latest Bridgerton series", "text": "A grand and picturesque Lincolnshire castle which dates back to the 13th century takes centre stage in the latest series of Bridgerton. Situated near Bourne, Grimsthorpe Castle provided the stunning backdrop for carriage arrivals and departures for an episode of the hit Netflix show, with filming being carried out at a section of the castle called Vanbrugh Hall in the autumn of 2022. The castle has been in the Willoughby de Eresby family for 500 years, and was granted by Henry VIII to William, Baron Willoughby de Eresby on the occasion of his marriage to Maria de Salinas, lady-in-waiting to Katherine of Aragon, in 1516, reports LincolnshireLive. Lucie VonCarthy, Grimsthorpe Castle's Public Access Lead, said the experience of having film crew at the estate was \"amazing\" and it has already brought in a host of new visitors. She said: \"It was slightly unbelievable and you just had to roll with it because it was so hectic. The whole thing was about four months in the planning. We spent the whole summer planning for filming which was just over September and October. \"It was nice to do something different and, off the back of it, it's raised our profile and raised our visitor numbers. We've had a lot of people coming either because they're a Bridgerton fan or because they saw us on the news and said it looked beautiful. \"We've had people that have lived locally all their lives and never come, but now they want to come because we're on Bridgerton. All of our castle tours have been full every day, we've had to put on extra tours. I'm just hoping that the momentum lasts into the summer.\" The castle welcomes visitors on selected days from March to October, offering a glimpse into centuries of history and architecture.

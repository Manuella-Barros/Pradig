He met me on the tarmac and said: 'Let me take your bag (off) you.' It was mental. We flew in an Osprey (helicopter) over the sea and landed on a ship with 4,500 people waiting for us.\n\n\"There have been so many pinch-me moments. All my dreams come true. But I know that I worked hard for this.

Not fame, not money.\n\n'But the actual thing of being taken seriously on screen has been the thing that I was just desperate for.'\n\nShe added: 'I'd spoken to my agent a while before and said, 'I feel like I've earned my stripes. I don't want to be constantly feeding into other people's storylines all the time. I've had enough of that.'\n\n'And it's nothing to do with fame or money - you don't start in theatre for fame or money. Its to do with knowing your worth. There's that line between arrogance and knowing your worth. And I had found my worth and thought, 'No, I can bloody do this, thank you very much. Just give me a chance.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannah_Waddingham",

The actor, who appeared in Hollyoaks between 1997 and 2005, collapsed last month and was rushed to hospital. Paul, 45, had to receive CPR in a touch-and-go moment. The TV star, who was a contestant on the first series of ITV\u2019s Celebrity Love Island, stated that \u2018it\u2019s a miracle [he\u2019s] still here.\u2019 Speaking to The Sun, Paul revealed that doctors warned his loved ones he \u2018might not make it through the night\u2019 after his dash to Whipps Cross hospital, East London. Having been taken ill at his parents\u2019 home, his family feared the worst.

My family were warned I might not make it through the night. I\u2019m so lucky.\u2019 Following his collapse, medics informed Paul that it was caused by his e-cigarette habit. \u2018The doctor was so, so harsh with me. She told me, \u201cPaul, you don\u2019t know how serious this was and you are going to be in here for a while now, on this oxygen.\u201d \u2018She said if I ever smoke in any form again, I risk being linked to an oxygen tank later on in life. She said that\u2019s it now.\u2019 Paul, who began smoking several years ago, said vaping \u2018pushed [him] over the edge\u2019, despite him initially wrongly believing it was a \u2018safer way to smoke\u2019. My family were warned I might not make it through the night. I\u2019m so lucky The actor\u2019s loved ones were told to prepare for the worst after her collapsed (Picture: Shutterstock) He became so hooked on vapes that he even went to bed holding one at night, lured in by the variety of fun flavours and mistaking them as \u2018healthier\u2019. However, like cigarettes, vapes still contain nicotine, which is addictive. Consequently, the habit has the potential to cause chronic lung disease and asthma, plus cardiovascular disease. While experts have claimed that vaping isn\u2019t as damaging as smoking, the NHS warns that it \u2018is not completely harmless\u2019, recommending it only as an in-between for adults trying to give up smoking completely. Paul found his vape to be a \u2018comfort\u2019 in everyday life, so he\u2019s keen to warn others, youngsters in particular, of the dangers. \u2018I\u2019m worried about the kids today, all you see is kids with vapes. \u2018When girls are at festivals they\u2019re on the disposables and think it\u2019s cool. It\u2019s so upsetting. \u2018And the problem is because of the sugar and the taste and nicotine, it\u2019s going to be so hard for them to let go of that.\u2019 Paul appeared on Love Island alongside Liz McClarnon, Lee Sharpe, Isabella Hervey, Nikki Ziering, Fran Cosgrave, Jayne Middlemiss, Calum Best, Rebecca Loos, and Abi Titmuss (Picture: Shutterstock) The TV star, who played tearaway teen Sol Patrick in Hollyoaks, has also struggled with alcohol and drug addictions in the past. His addiction struggles followed his ITV series with co-stars Calum Best and Fran Cosgrave, as partying at the height of fame took a toll. But, fortunately, Paul, who has an eight-year-old son named Deniro, has been sober for over three years. He\u2019s now had a total life overhaul, describing his near-death experience as the \u2018kick\u2019 up the backside that he needed to make changes. \u2018I feel like a different person and I\u2019m ready to kick on with my career. \u2018I\u2019m in the best place mentally I\u2019ve been for ages and can\u2019t wait to see what\u2019s around the corner.\u2019 As well as his appearances in Hollyoaks and Love Island, Paul is known for being a Celebrity Big Brother housemate in 2017 during a career comeback. He\u2019s also been seen on Celebrity Coach Trip and is keen to get back into performing, particularly in theatre roles.

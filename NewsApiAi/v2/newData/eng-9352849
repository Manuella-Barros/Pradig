Although Annie Clark has taken care of production duties herself, she did recruit a group of special guests such as Stella Mogzawa from Warpaint and Cate Le Bon.\n\nIn addition to featuring on lead guitar on 'Broken Man', Grohl also provided a helping hand on 'Flea', which is currently unreleased.\n\nSpeaking with The New Cue, Clark discussed the latter, which she revealed to be a highlight of the recording process.\n\nShe explained: \"I have a couple of favourite moments. One would be having Dave Grohl come over to my studio. The second he kicks in on the first chorus of Flea, it's just mind-blowing, my whole musical life flashes before my eyes and lightning up my spine, he just set me on fire. It's so exciting to hear him play and he's playing on one of my songs, what?!

I feel so honoured by that.\"\n\n\"I just saw that Olivia [Rodrigo] started her tour in the States and she has a purple one of my guitars and she's playing it! And The Last Dinner Party too... In general, I've seen my guitar get played in every genre of music and that makes me really happy.\"\n\nThe interview with NME at the BRITs came just days after St Vincent announced the new album 'All Born Screaming' and dropped lead single 'Broken Man', featuring Dave Grohl.\n\nSharing more details about the LP - which is the follow-up to 2021's acclaimed 'Daddy's Home' - Clarke said: \"It's a heavier record [than before]. I think it's black and white and all the colours in a fire - that's what it sounds like to me.\"\n\n\"I had Dave Grohl play drums, I had Josh Freese [Devo, A Perfect Circle, Foo Fighters] on drums, Justin Meldal-Johnsen, Mark Guiliana. I worked with my very good friend Cate Le Bon, who is one of my favourite artists ever and a great producer in her own right [too],\" she added. \"So I just feel lucky to get to work with my friends\".\n\nWhen asked if any of the songs evolved when recording with other artists, Clarke said: \"Of course! But it's the first record that I self-produced completely.\"\n\n\"I've co-produced on all of my work,\" she explained. \"But this was the one that I was like 'I need to go in and just wander into the woods alone and find out'.\"\n\nSt Vincent also recalled what to expect from 'All Born Screaming' in a separate interview with NME last week, where she revealed that the LP will see her deviate away from her past tradition of adopting a character.\n\n\"In general on this record, there's no character - it's just me. It's just the sound of the inside of my head,\" she said. \"I think this idea of the brokenness that you feel has a lot of layers to it. On the one hand, I can walk in this room and anyone who sees me, man, they want me! I'm on it! I could rule this world. Then the second that is punctured, you see the grizzly meat underneath of rage and fear and loathing and brokenness. That's just the gnarliness of existence.\"\n\nThe album is also set to include a tribute to the late musician, producer, singer and DJ, SOPHIE, who died in January 2021 at the age of 34, following a tragic fall from a hotel rooftop in Athens.\n\n\"The internet twists things, and I don't want it to be seen like I'm trying to capitalise on somebody's death,\" she said during a recent interview with The Guardian. \"I was an admirer from afar, we never met, but I read about the way that she fell because she was trying to get a better look at the moon, which was just the most beautiful, poetic thing I've ever heard.\"", "source": {"uri": "nme.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NME Music News, Reviews, Videos, Galleries, Tickets and Blogs | NME.COM"}, "authors": [{"uri": "liberty_dunworth@nme.com", "name": "Liberty Dunworth", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Vincent_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Vincent (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NME", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NME"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Guitar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brit_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brit Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_Man_(company)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Music Man (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Grohl", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dave Grohl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_kit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drum kit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songwriter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Songwriter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daddy's_Home_(St._Vincent_album)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daddy's Home (St. Vincent album)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_and_white", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Black and white"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Freese", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Freese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cate_Le_Bon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cate Le Bon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Perfect_Circle", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A Perfect Circle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Meldal-Johnsen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Meldal-Johnsen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Guiliana", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mark Guiliana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devo", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Devo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_single", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lead single"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_genre", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Music genre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foo_Fighters", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foo Fighters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LP_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LP record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Record producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sophie (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disc jockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Athens"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Athens"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/St-Vincent@2000x1270.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-9352849", "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 447245656, "relevance": 1}

The recent revelation of guest appearances by Cate Le Bon and Dave Grohl, who contributes his drumming prowess to the lead single 'Broken Man,' adds an exciting dimension to the self-produced album. Beyond Grohl, an eclectic lineup graces the record, featuring talents like Rachel Eckroth, Devo, Foo Fighters' Josh Freese, Mark Guiliana, Justin Meldal-Johnsen, Warpaint's Stella Mogzawa, and David Ralicke.\n\nThe lead single, 'Broken Man,' stands out as an industrial and menacing rock creation, with Annie Clark, also known as St. Vincent, delivering an ominous introduction to her new era. As she prowls and warns,\n\n\"On the street, I'm a king-sized killer - I can make your kingdom come,\" Clark, in a conversation with NME, explains that this line and the overall tone of the track are indicative of the mood permeating 'All Born Screaming.' It encapsulates \"that lustre and swagger that you feel right before things go terribly wrong,\" providing a glimpse into the multifaceted emotional landscape explored in the upcoming album.\n\nIn response to a query about the characters she embodies in 'Broken Man' and 'All Born Screaming,' Clark reveals a departure from her usual character-driven approach. Instead, she presents an introspective journey, sharing:\n\n\"In general on this record, there's no character - it's just me. It's just the sound of the inside of my head. I produced it so my hand is on every moment.\"\n\nShe delves into the theme of brokenness, acknowledging the layers it holds, ranging from the outwardly confident persona to the vulnerability and complexities beneath the surface. This exploration, she notes, captures the gnarly essence of existence, showcasing the dichotomy and intensity of human experience.\n\nThe conversation turns to the notable collaboration with Dave Grohl on drums. Clark provides a vivid description of the song's progression, stating:\n\n\"From the beginning of the song, it's a slow-burn. The shape of the song is climbing the mountain, because it just grows and grows.\"\n\nVincent unveils the involvement of three drummers, with the initial programming, Mark Guiliana's contribution in the middle section, and the grand finale featuring Dave Grohl. Describing Grohl's entrance, she notes his \"absolute reckless spirit\" as he takes the track to the edge, injecting a surge of energy that elevates the song to unprecedented heights.\n\nNeedless to say, this collaboration is a very pivotal element in enhancing the 'gnarl' factor of the music, contributing to the overall intensity and unpredictability of the sonic journey in 'All Born Screaming.'", "source": {"uri": "alternativenation.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Alternative Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "subhojeet_mukherjee@alternativenation.net", "name": "Subhojeet Mukherjee", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Vincent_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Vincent (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Grohl", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dave Grohl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_single", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lead single"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daddy's_Home_(St._Vincent_album)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daddy's Home (St. Vincent album)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Eckroth", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rachel Eckroth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Freese", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Freese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cate_Le_Bon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cate Le Bon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Meldal-Johnsen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Meldal-Johnsen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Guiliana", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Guiliana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devo", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Devo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warpaint_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warpaint (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foo_Fighters", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foo Fighters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NME", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NME"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_kit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drum kit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands_and_Artists", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands and Artists", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Musical", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Musical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "http://www.alternativenation.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/davegrohlmsnbc.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-9352849", "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 447212058, "relevance": 1}

I don't have that Eternal Sunshine-thing of wanting to forget.\"\n\nThe National and The War On Drugs will head out on a co-headline tour of North America later this year.\n\nWith the former coming off the back of a double album release in 2023, and the latter still riding high on 2021's I Don't Live Here Anymore, this big joint ticket is set to begin at the BankNH Pavilion in New Hampshire on September 12th.\n\nA date at Forest Hills Stadium in New York is booked for the following night, and the tour will progress on through to October 7th and the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles.", "source":

This forthcoming offering marks a turning point in the artist's career as her first self-produced project, granting unprecedented total control to create a work that is exclusively pure, uncut St. Vincent.\n\n\"There are some places, emotionally, that you can only get to by taking the long walk into the woods alone -- to find out what your heart is really saying,\" Clark shares, highlighting the clarity found in this creative exercise. \"It sounds real because it is real.\"\n\nThis new perspective rings loud and clear on the first single \"Broken Man,\" a razor-sharp strut dripping with caustic and cynical bravado. Atop a twitching, industrial backbeat, Clark builds from a raspy declaration to an unrepentant roar, complete with stadium drums and thundering guitars, to command the listener, \"What are you looking at?\" The artist's charge is amplified by the track's music video, which literalizes this sonic assault as St. Vincent, engulfed in flames, locks eyes with the camera before attacking it with her standing mic. The force of the pairing must be seen to be believed.\n\nThough Clark's latest is a fully-realized expression of her independent vision, it couldn't come to be without a hand from her high-profile friends. All Born Screaming's list of features is a dream team, including Rachel Eckroth, Josh Freese, Dave Grohl, Mark Guiliana, Cate Le Bon and more.

Although once part of the iconic band, Nirvana, Grohl watched his fame skyrocket as he released songs like \"Monkey Wrench\", \"Walk\", and \"Everlong\". He even starred in the horror comedy Studio 666. Recently, St. Vincent shared a new track for her upcoming LP All Born Screaming. And to create that perfect sound for \"Broken Man\", she enlisted the help of Grohl.\n\nVideos by American Songwriter\n\nSpeaking with NME about the new single, Anne Clark, who goes by the name St. Vincent, detailed how \"Broken Man\" consisted of several drummers. She said, \"From the beginning of the song, it's a slow-burn. The shape of the song is climbing the mountain, because it just grows and grows. There are essentially three drummers on the track: the first part is my programming, the second part Mark Guiliana comes in...\" Finding a place for Grohl, St. Vincent added, \"then at the very end of the track - just when you think it can't get any higher - Grohl comes in with this absolute reckless spirit and just takes it to the edge.\"\n\nSt. Vincent Declares \"It Sounds Real Because It Is Real\"\n\nLooking at the comments, fans praised the singer for the new track as some wrote, \"What I love most about St. Vincent is the fact that EVERY music video makes you feel uneasy or uncomfortable in some way (cruel, cheerleader, slow disco, birth in reverse, and so forth). I hope Annie never loses this iconic visual identity.\" Another fan added, \"One of the absolute musical greats of our time has delivered a brilliant new song!!! an INSTANT discography highlight, as it were. Welcome back, legendary queen, thank you for this powerful anthem.\"\n\n[RELATED: Remember When: Dave Grohl and Jack Black Made that Weird Motel Video for \"Low\" that Was Banned by MTV]\n\nWhile just a teaser of what is to come, St. Vincent considered All Born Screaming to be a journey into the heart. \"There are some places, emotionally, that you can only get to by taking the long walk into the woods alone -- to find out what your heart is really saying.\" She continued to discuss the unique sound of her new work, insisting, \"It sounds real because it is real.\"\n\nWith \"Broken Man\" already making its rounds on social media, the full release of All Born Screaming hits shelves on April 26.\n\n(Photo by Phillip Faraone/Getty Images for GQ)", "source": {"uri": "americansongwriter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "American Songwriter"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_piner@americansongwriter.com", "name": "Chris Piner", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Vincent_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Vincent (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Grohl", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dave Grohl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_666", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Studio 666"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy_horror", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedy horror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everlong", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Everlong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_Wrench_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monkey Wrench (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Songwriter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Songwriter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NME", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NME"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foo_Fighters", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foo Fighters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nirvana (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LP_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LP record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Black", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jack Black"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Music video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Record chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GQ", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GQ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getty_Images", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Getty Images"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disco", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Recordings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Recordings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Musical", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Musical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://americansongwriter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SV.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-9352849", "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 447015523, "relevance": 1}

The video was shot in Philadelphia in mid-January by Alex Da Corte, capturing the album's aesthetic and sharing imagery with its cover.\n\nAhead of the release of her 2021 album Daddy's Home, St. Vincent launched a new model of her signature guitar, called 'Goldie,' with Ernie Ball Music Man. Now, Olivia Rodrigo has taken the guitar on the road for her Guts World Tour, which kicked off in Palm Springs on February 23rd. Clark shared a video from the show of Rodrigo playing the guitar on an unreleased Guts track, \"Obsessed.\" \"Olivia killing it opening night of Guts tour,\" Clark wrote on her Instagram story. \"Playing a custom purple STV Goldie.

As the sole producer of the album, she was able to immediately record on tape those sounds born in her mind, in her heart and in her hands:\n\nThere are some places inside us that we can only reach if we go through the woods alone, to discover what our heart has to say,\" Clark says. \"It sounds real because it is real.\"\n\nAll Born Screaming is an invitation to challenge the limits of the possible and to go beyond them. Thanks also to the help of a very careful selection of friends and collaborators such as Rachel Eckroth, Josh Freese, Dave Grohl, Mark Guiliana, Cate Le Bon, Justin Meldal-Johnsen, Stella Mogzawa and David Ralicke, this new work is an absolute representation of the vision unique to St. Vincent.\n\nProof of this is \"Broken Man\", the first single from side A of All Born Screaming. The song arrives like an avalanche ready to crash down on expectations and preconceptions and presents the album with an unquestionable fury.\n\nThe song is also accompanied by the video shot in Philadelphia in January and directed by Alex Da Corte, whose visuals complete the aesthetics of the new work. The video just premiered on MTV Live, mtvU and Paramount Spaces in Times Square.\n\nAll Born Screaming was produced by St. Vincent and mixed by Cian Riordan.", "source": {"uri": "wecb.fm", "dataType": "news", "title": "WECB"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christopher_johnson@wecb.fm", "name": "Christopher Johnson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Vincent_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Vincent (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Records", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virgin Records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Record producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Album"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Eckroth", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rachel Eckroth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Freese", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Freese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Da_Corte", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alex Da Corte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV_Live_(TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MTV Live (TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTVU", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MTVU"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cate_Le_Bon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cate Le Bon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Meldal-Johnsen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Meldal-Johnsen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Guiliana", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark Guiliana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_Square", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Times Square"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paramount Pictures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Grohl", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dave Grohl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Recordings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Recordings", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Video", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Video", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Albums_and_Frames", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Albums and Frames", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Video/Alternative_Video", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Video/Alternative Video", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://www.wecb.fm/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1709216683_ST-VINCENT-released-the-album-All-Born-Screaming-in-April.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-9352849", "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 446923170, "relevance": 1}

The album arrives April 26, via a new label imprint for St. Vincent, Virgin Music Group.\n\nIt's St. Vincent's first self-produced album, following a run of two albums with producer Jack Antonoff that included 2017's \"Masseduction.\"\n\nA new single, \"\"Broken Man,\" arrived Thursday in tandem with the announcement, with a video directed by Alex Da Corte, who also shot the album cover imagery. A press statement described the video, shot in Philadelphia in January, as reflecting \"the gauntlet of emotional wreckage that is side one of 'All Born Screaming.'\"\n\nCate Le Bon is the album's one billed featured guest, on the concluding title track. The list of players on the album also includes such heavy rock hitters as Dave Grohl and Josh Freese, along with Rachel Eckroth, Mark Guiliana, Justin Meldal-Johnsen, Stella Mogzawa and David Ralicke.\n\nIn an explanation of going the self-production route, Clark said in an announcement statement, \"There are some places, emotionally, that you can only get to by taking the long walk into the woods alone -- to find out what your heart is really saying,\" Clark says. \"It sounds real because it is real.\"\n\nClark had further described the new album in a recent interview with Mojo, before the album title or lineup were announced. \"I needed to go deeper in finding my own sonic vocabulary,\" she told the magazine. \"I like to think of [the record] as post-plague pop, it's a lot about heaven and hell - the metaphorical kinds. Which is appropriate, because sitting alone in a studio for that many hours I would say is a version of hell.\"\n\nShe further told Mojo that the new record, which is marked by the sound of analog synths and \"lots of guitar,\" sounds \"urgent and psychotic, in equal parts the most caustic sound and also, I think, the most sonically blooming. It's high stakes and intentional.\"\n\nAny lingering similarities to \"Daddy's Home\" are probably purely accidental. \"The last record, I was approaching tough subjects with a lot of biting humor and wit,\" she told Mojo. \"I put on a wig, I was prancing around, it was so fun. This record is darker and harder and more close to the bone. I'd say it's my least funny record yet! There's nothing cute about it.\"\n\nTour dates for 2024 have not been announced, beyond a few festival appearances, including Bottlerock in Napa Valley in late May. She also revealed on Twitter that she will be doing individual gigs related to the festival in San Francisco and Napa.", "source": {"uri": "variety.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Variety"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Vincent_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Vincent (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daddy's_Home_(St._Vincent_album)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daddy's Home (St. Vincent album)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_Rodrigo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olivia Rodrigo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Antonoff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jack Antonoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album_cover", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Album cover"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_label", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Record label"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Records", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virgin Records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Record producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Eckroth", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rachel Eckroth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Freese", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Freese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cate_Le_Bon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cate Le Bon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dengue_Fever_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dengue Fever (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Meldal-Johnsen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Meldal-Johnsen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Guiliana", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mark Guiliana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojo_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mojo (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_rock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hard rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Grohl", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dave Grohl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_synthesizer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Analog synthesizer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metaphor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heaven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guitar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Reviews", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Reviews", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands_and_Artists", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands and Artists", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Musical", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Musical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Albums_and_Frames", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Albums and Frames", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Scrapbooking", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Scrapbooking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/LEAD-press-shot-2048x1536-1-e1709214613373.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "eventUri": "eng-9352849", "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 446912412, "relevance": 1}

Additionally, the lead track arrives alongside a video shot by Alex Da Corte in Philadelphia.\n\nDespite All Born Screaming being self-produced by Clark, the record is littered with special guests such as Rachel Eckroth, Josh Freese, Dave Grohl, Mark Guiliana, Cate Le Bon, Justin Meldal-Johnsen, Stella Mogzawa and David Ralicke.\n\nIn a statement, Clark says of All Born Screaming: \"There are some places, emotionally, that you can only get to by taking the long walk into the woods alone -- to find out what your heart is really saying. It sounds real because it is real.\"\n\nAll Born Screaming marks Clark's first release since 2021's Daddy Home, which was an extremely personal record that dealt with her complex relationship with her father, who had recently been released from prison.\n\nIn a recent conversation with Mojo, she explained: \"The last record, I was approaching tough subjects with a lot of biting humour and wit. I put on a wig, I was prancing around, it was so fun. This record is darker and harder and more close to the bone. I'd say it's my least funny record yet! There's nothing cute about it.\"\n\nIn the same interview, Clark stated All Born Screaming is dominated by guitars and analogue synths, resulting in a sound she describes as \"urgent and psychotic, in equal parts the most caustic sound and also, I think, the most sonically blooming.

It's about what is to be alive and to embrace that agony and ecstasy\"\n\nSt Vincent has returned with the \"gnarly\" comeback single 'Broken Man', and announced details of new album 'All Born Screaming'. Check it all out below, as Annie Clark tells NME about the \"agony and ecstasy\" of her seventh record.\n\n'All Born Screaming', the follow-up to 2021's acclaimed 'Daddy's Home', will arrive on April 26. After news recently emerged that Cate Le Bon and Dave Grohl featured on the record - the latter lending drums to 'Broken Man' - now it's been revealed that the self-produced album also features an eclectic line-up of Rachel Eckroth, Devo and Foo Fighters' Josh Freese, Mark Guiliana, Justin Meldal-Johnsen, Warpaint's Stella Mogzawa and David Ralicke.\n\nLead single 'Broken Man' is an industrial menacing rock beast that sees Clark give an ominous intro to her new era as she prowls and warns: \"On the street, I'm a king-sized killer - I can make your kingdom come\".\n\nThat line, and the track as a whole, Clarke told NME, is representative of the mood of 'All Born Screaming' with \"that lustre and swagger that you feel right before things go terribly wrong!\"\n\nAnnie Clark: \"In general on this record, there's no character - it's just me. It's just the sound of the inside of my head. I produced it so my hand is on every moment. I think this idea of the brokenness that you feel has a lot of layers to it. On the one hand, I can walk in this room and anyone who sees me, man, they want me! I'm on it! I could rule this world. Then the second that is punctured, you see the grizzly meat underneath of rage and fear and loathing and brokenness. That's just the gnarliness of existence.\"\n\n\"From the beginning of the song, it's a slow-burn. The shape of the song is climbing the mountain, because it just grows and grows. There are essentially three drummers on the track: the first part is my programming, the second part Mark Guiliana comes in, and then at the very end of the track - just when you think it can't get any higher - Grohl comes in with this absolute reckless spirit and just takes it to the edge.\"\n\n\"The video is the album cover come to life. It's an exploration of brokenness, shot in a black void - a violent dance with the camera. It's a finding and then an acceptance of being absolutely on fire.\"\n\n\"Alex created the visual side of the record. We've worked together before - particularly on my 'New York' music video - and he's one of my absolute favourite modern artists. He's everything. We first started talking about what this record was and the visual component of it in Madrid this summer. We went to the [Museo Nacional del] Prado and saw Goya's Black Paintings.\n\n\"You see Saturn eating his sons, the witch's mask. We walked into this claustrophobic room and saw the paintings that Goya made at the end of his life. He didn't necessarily want them seen, but these were paintings that he had in his house. This is what he had surrounded himself with. Alex and I looked at each other and it was electric. We took a lot of inspiration from the feeling of those Goya Black Paintings.\"\n\n\"For me, the record is black, white and all the colours in the fire, because it's about life and death. Life and death is pretty binary - you're alive or you're dead. The record's about what is to be alive and to embrace that agony and ecstasy.\"\n\n\"It goes to hell. On the record, you have to go through hell to get to some semblance of heaven. The record to me is structured that way.\"\n\n\"I've co-produced every one of my records and seen it through, but with this one I needed to go places I hadn't gone sonically before. I needed to understand sound - scientifically and also as intention. I needed to say, 'I am physically moving electricity around, I'm playing with currents, I'm gonna be fucking Thor'. My fingerprints are on everything. I feel closer in a certain way, because it's genuinely the inside of my head without any filter.\"\n\n\"I'm gonna fuck 'em up. I'm gonna fuck 'em up.\"\n\n\"Me too! I hope it smells of cow manure and a little bit of human piss. It always does!\"\n\nSt Vincent releases 'All Born Screaming' on April 26 via Virgin Music/Fiction Records.

The 2023 Heisman Trophy winner from LSU is expected to be one of the top three players selected Thursday night. After USC quarterback Caleb Williams goes to Chicago first overall, Daniels is the odds-on favorite to be the No. 2 pick, according to BetMGM Sportsbook.\n\nIt's no longer a red flag for prospects to play for multiple schools on their way to the NFL draft\n\nDENVER (AP) -- The name, image and likeness deals on college campuses and relaxed transfer rules mean it's no longer uncommon to see draft prospects such as Caleb Williams or Jayden Daniels play for multiple schools on their way to the NFL draft. It's also no longer a red flag for those players who transferred schools. The NFL used to cast a leery eye on players who transferred, figuring the athletes might have trouble staying in line. Now, about a third of the prospects who were invited to the NFL scouting combine transferred at least once during their college careers.\n\nMichigan's QB battle among many in Big Ten that started in spring and will ramp up again in the fall\n\nBig Ten quarterback competitions that started in the spring will carry over to the fall. Only four of the 14 teams appear set at the position. That doesn't include any of the four teams from the Pac-12 that join the conference July 1. Michigan will go into preseason practice with a three-man competition. Alex Orji and Davis Warren were the starters in the Wolverines' spring game and Jack Tuttle joins the fray in the fall. Kansas State transfer Will Howard is battling Devin Brown at Ohio State. Iowa and Northwestern lost their 2023 starters to the transfer portal after their spring games.\n\nWill Power denies participating in Penske cheating scandal. Silence from Josef Newgarden\n\nWill Power says he was unaware of any manipulations to Team Penske's push-to-power system until after last weekend's IndyCar race at Long Beach and never illegally used the mechanism. Team Penske is under heavy scrutiny following the season-opening race at St. Petersburg, Florida, in which Josef Newgarden was stripped of the victory and Scott McLaughlin, who finished third, was also disqualified. Power finished fourth and while his result was not thrown out, he was docked 10 points and all three Penske drivers were fined $25,000. Power has not been accused of any wrongdoing but was punished because the manipulated systems were found on all three Penske cars.\n\nCubs reliever Luke Little forced to change his glove because of white in American flag patch\n\nCHICAGO (AP) -- Chicago Cubs reliever Luke Little says he had to change his glove before he entered the team's 4-3 victory over Houston because of an American flag patch. Manager Craig Counsell went to insert Little with one out in the seventh inning. But as the 6-foot-8 left-hander went through the usual check by umpires for pitchers coming into the game, he was told he had to swap out his glove. Counsell says the issue was the white in the American flag patch on Little's glove. Little says he has been using the same glove since Class A ball.\n\nHe replaced Mickey Mantle. Now baseball's oldest living major leaguer, Art Schallock, is turning 100\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The oldest living former major leaguer, Art Schallock turns 100 on Thursday and is being celebrated in the Bay Area and beyond. His baseball memories are still fresh. Called up by the New York Yankees to take Mickey Mantle's roster spot, Schallock roomed with Yogi Berra and was tasked with collecting the Hall of Famer's comic books from hotel lobbies each morning. He hardly minded. The three-time World Series winner still wears one of his rings regularly. He's now at an assisted living facility, which is throwing a party for him on his birthday.\n\nNot every WNBA draft pick will make her team's roster. Here's why\n\nThe WNBA draft is over, and superstars like Caitlin Clark are heading toward surefire pro careers. Not all 36 draft picks have such assurances. The league has 144 coveted roster spots among 12 teams, and other options for pro careers in women's basketball either in the U.S. or overseas are scarce. Since 2018, only 65.7% of draft picks have played in a WNBA game at some point in their career.\n\nFrench Open to reveal second retractable roof court at Roland Garros ahead of Olympics\n\nPARIS (AP) -- Organizers of the tennis French Open say the second retractable roof at Roland Garros will be inaugurated on the opening day of main draw play next month. The project was planned with the Paris Olympics in mind. Roland Garros will stage the week-long Olympic tennis tournaments. French Open tournament director Amelie Mauresmo says a ceremony for the roof over the 10,000-seat Suzanne Lenglen court will be held on May 26. It can also be used for qualifying rounds played on previous days. The main 15,000-seat Philippe Chatrier court has had a retractable roof since 2020. Olympics tennis is scheduled from July 27 to Aug. 4.\n\nThibodeau shows when he's mad at his Knicks. They don't mind, knowing the coach has them set to win\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Knicks know when it's coming. When they throw a careless pass that leads to a turnover, or hoist a bad shot that ruins a possession, their coach is likely standing on the sideline with arms in the air, furious he's just witnessed such miscues. Like all coaches, Tom Thibodeau doesn't like mistakes and unlike a lot of his NBA brethren, he doesn't bother hiding it from the nearly 20,000 people in the arena watching. Many coaches will try to have a poker face and not react when their players make mistakes. But the Knicks say they are OK with Thibodeau's tantrums because they believe he has them prepared to win.\n\nNFL to open academy in Australia to identify and develop young prospects\n\nThe NFL will expand its international search for talent by opening an academy in rugby-mad Australia to develop promising teenagers in the Asia-Pacific region into college and pro prospects. The NFL Academy will open in September on the Gold Coast for student athletes aged 12 to 18, following recruitment camps taking place this summer in Australia and New Zealand. Ahead of the NFL Draft, the announcement says the region is full of talent such as Philadelphia Eagles offensive tackle Jordan Mailata, a 6-foot-8 Australian who was deemed too big for rugby league.",

Asked a few times Wednesday about speculation that he doesn't want to play for Washington and whether he prefers going to another team, Daniels understandably took a diplomatic approach one day before the NFL draft. The 2023 Heisman Trophy winner from LSU is expected to be one of the top three players selected Thursday night. After USC quarterback Caleb Williams goes to Chicago first overall, Daniels is the odds-on favorite to be the No. 2 pick, according to BetMGM Sportsbook.\n\nIt's no longer a red flag for prospects to play for multiple schools on their way to the NFL draft\n\nDENVER (AP) -- The name, image and likeness deals on college campuses and relaxed transfer rules mean it's no longer uncommon to see draft prospects such as Caleb Williams or Jayden Daniels play for multiple schools on their way to the NFL draft. It's also no longer a red flag for those players who transferred schools. The NFL used to cast a leery eye on players who transferred, figuring the athletes might have trouble staying in line. Now, about a third of the prospects who were invited to the NFL scouting combine transferred at least once during their college careers.\n\nMichigan's QB battle among many in Big Ten that started in spring and will ramp up again in the fall\n\nBig Ten quarterback competitions that started in the spring will carry over to the fall. Only four of the 14 teams appear set at the position. That doesn't include any of the four teams from the Pac-12 that join the conference in August. Michigan will go into preseason practice with a three-man competition. Alex Orji and Davis Warren were the starters in the Wolverines' spring game and Jack Tuttle joins the fray in the fall. Kansas State transfer Will Howard is battling Devin Brown at Ohio State. Iowa and Northwestern lost their 2023 starters to the transfer portal after their spring games.\n\nWill Power denies participating in Penske cheating scandal. Silence from Josef Newgarden\n\nWill Power says he was unaware of any manipulations to Team Penske's push-to-power system until after last weekend's IndyCar race at Long Beach and never illegally used the mechanism. Team Penske is under heavy scrutiny following the season-opening race at St. Petersburg, Florida, in which Josef Newgarden was stripped of the victory and Scott McLaughlin, who finished third, was also disqualified. Power finished fourth and while his result was not thrown out, he was docked 10 points and all three Penske drivers were fined $25,000. Power has not been accused of any wrongdoing but was punished because the manipulated systems were found on all three Penske cars.\n\nCubs reliever Luke Little forced to change his glove because of white in American flag patch\n\nCHICAGO (AP) -- Chicago Cubs reliever Luke Little says he had to change his glove before he entered the team's 4-3 victory over Houston because of an American flag patch. Manager Craig Counsell went to insert Little with one out in the seventh inning. But as the 6-foot-8 left-hander went through the usual check by umpires for pitchers coming into the game, he was told he had to swap out his glove. Counsell says the issue was the white in the American flag patch on Little's glove. Little says he has been using the same glove since Class A ball.\n\nHe replaced Mickey Mantle. Now baseball's oldest living major leaguer, Art Schallock, is turning 100\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The oldest living former major leaguer, Art Schallock turns 100 on Thursday and is being celebrated in the Bay Area and beyond. His baseball memories are still fresh. Called up by the New York Yankees to take Mickey Mantle's roster spot, Schallock roomed with Yogi Berra and was tasked with collecting the Hall of Famer's comic books from hotel lobbies each morning. He hardly minded. The three-time World Series winner still wears one of his rings regularly. He's now at an assisted living facility, which is throwing a party for him on his birthday.\n\nNot every WNBA draft pick will make her team's roster. Here's why\n\nThe WNBA draft is over, and superstars like Caitlin Clark are heading toward surefire pro careers. Not all 36 draft picks have such assurances. The league has 144 coveted roster spots among 12 teams, and other options for pro careers in women's basketball either in the U.S. or overseas are scarce. Since 2018, only 65.7% of draft picks have played in a WNBA game at some point in their career.\n\nFrench Open to reveal second retractable roof court at Roland Garros ahead of Olympics\n\nPARIS (AP) -- Organizers of the tennis French Open say the second retractable roof at Roland Garros will be inaugurated on the opening day of main draw play next month. The project was planned with the Paris Olympics in mind. Roland Garros will stage the week-long Olympic tennis tournaments. French Open tournament director Amelie Mauresmo says a ceremony for the roof over the 10,000-seat Suzanne Lenglen court will be held on May 26. It can also be used for qualifying rounds played on previous days. The main 15,000-seat Philippe Chatrier court has had a retractable roof since 2020. Olympics tennis is scheduled from July 27 to Aug. 4.\n\nThibodeau shows when he's mad at his Knicks. They don't mind, knowing the coach has them set to win\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Knicks know when it's coming. When they throw a careless pass that leads to a turnover, or hoist a bad shot that ruins a possession, their coach is likely standing on the sideline with arms in the air, furious he's just witnessed such miscues. Like all coaches, Tom Thibodeau doesn't like mistakes and unlike a lot of his NBA brethren, he doesn't bother hiding it from the nearly 20,000 people in the arena watching. Many coaches will try to have a poker face and not react when their players make mistakes. But the Knicks say they are OK with Thibodeau's tantrums because they believe he has them prepared to win.\n\nNFL to open academy in Australia to identify and develop young prospects\n\nThe NFL will expand its international search for talent by opening an academy in rugby-mad Australia to develop promising teenagers in the Asia-Pacific region into college and pro prospects. The NFL Academy will open in September on the Gold Coast for student athletes aged 12 to 18, following recruitment camps taking place this summer in Australia and New Zealand. Ahead of the NFL Draft, the announcement says the region is full of talent such as Philadelphia Eagles offensive tackle Jordan Mailata, a 6-foot-8 Australian who was deemed too big for rugby league.",

The 2023 Heisman Trophy winner from LSU is expected to be one of the top three players selected Thursday night.

It's also no longer a red flag for those players who transferred schools. The NFL used to cast a leery eye on players who transferred, figuring the athletes might have trouble staying in line.

Only four of the 14 teams appear set at the position. That doesn't include any of the four teams from the Pac-12 that join the conference July 1. Michigan will go into preseason practice with a three-man competition. Alex Orji and Davis Warren were the starters in the Wolverines' spring game and Jack Tuttle joins the fray in the fall. Kansas State transfer Will Howard is battling Devin Brown at Ohio State. Iowa and Northwestern lost their 2023 starters to the transfer portal after their spring games.\n\nCubs reliever Luke Little forced to change his glove because of white in American flag patch\n\nCHICAGO (AP) -- Chicago Cubs reliever Luke Little says he had to change his glove before he entered the team's 4-3 victory over Houston because of an American flag patch. Manager Craig Counsell went to insert Little with one out in the seventh inning. But as the 6-foot-8 left-hander went through the usual check by umpires for pitchers coming into the game, he was told he had to swap out his glove. Counsell says the issue was the white in the American flag patch on Little's glove. Little says he has been using the same glove since Class A ball.\n\nHe replaced Mickey Mantle. Now baseball's oldest living major leaguer, Art Schallock, is turning 100\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The oldest living former major leaguer, Art Schallock turns 100 on Thursday and is being celebrated in the Bay Area and beyond. His baseball memories are still fresh. Called up by the New York Yankees to take Mickey Mantle's roster spot, Schallock roomed with Yogi Berra and was tasked with collecting the Hall of Famer's comic books from hotel lobbies each morning. He hardly minded. The three-time World Series winner still wears one of his rings regularly. He's now at an assisted living facility, which is throwing a party for him on his birthday.\n\nNot every WNBA draft pick will make her team's roster. Here's why\n\nThe WNBA draft is over, and superstars like Caitlin Clark are heading toward surefire pro careers. Not all 36 draft picks have such assurances. The league has 144 coveted roster spots among 12 teams, and other options for pro careers in women's basketball either in the U.S. or overseas are scarce. Since 2018, only 65.7% of draft picks have played in a WNBA game at some point in their career.\n\nFrench Open to reveal second retractable roof court at Roland Garros ahead of Olympics\n\nPARIS (AP) -- Organizers of the tennis French Open say the second retractable roof at Roland Garros will be inaugurated on the opening day of main draw play next month. The project was planned with the Paris Olympics in mind. Roland Garros will stage the week-long Olympic tennis tournaments. French Open tournament director Amelie Mauresmo says a ceremony for the roof over the 10,000-seat Suzanne Lenglen court will be held on May 26. It can also be used for qualifying rounds played on previous days. The main 15,000-seat Philippe Chatrier court has had a retractable roof since 2020. Olympics tennis is scheduled from July 27 to Aug. 4.\n\nThibodeau shows when he's mad at his Knicks. They don't mind, knowing the coach has them set to win\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Knicks know when it's coming. When they throw a careless pass that leads to a turnover, or hoist a bad shot that ruins a possession, their coach is likely standing on the sideline with arms in the air, furious he's just witnessed such miscues. Like all coaches, Tom Thibodeau doesn't like mistakes and unlike a lot of his NBA brethren, he doesn't bother hiding it from the nearly 20,000 people in the arena watching. Many coaches will try to have a poker face and not react when their players make mistakes. But the Knicks say they are OK with Thibodeau's tantrums because they believe he has them prepared to win.\n\nNFL to open academy in Australia to identify and develop young prospects\n\nThe NFL will expand its international search for talent by opening an academy in rugby-mad Australia to develop promising teenagers in the Asia-Pacific region into college and pro prospects. The NFL Academy will open in September on the Gold Coast for student athletes aged 12 to 18, following recruitment camps taking place this summer in Australia and New Zealand. Ahead of the NFL Draft, the announcement says the region is full of talent such as Philadelphia Eagles offensive tackle Jordan Mailata, a 6-foot-8 Australian who was deemed too big for rugby league.\n\nPGA Tour players learn how much loyalty is worth in new equity program\n\nPlayers who stayed loyal to the PGA Tour in the divide with Saudi-funded LIV Golf are starting to find out how much that loyalty could be worth. The tour began contacting all 193 players eligible for $930 million in the Player Equity Program. It's a first-of-its-kind ownership plan for players. The top tier is 36 players who have access to $750 million in equity. One British newspaper reported that Tiger Woods would be getting $100 million. It did not say where it got that number. Emails informing players of their equity take are starting to go out Wednesday afternoon.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors":

Michigan will go into preseason practice with a three-man competition. Alex Orji and Davis Warren were the starters in the Wolverines' spring game and Jack Tuttle joins the fray in the fall. Kansas State transfer Will Howard is battling Devin Brown at Ohio State. Iowa and Northwestern lost their 2023 starters to the transfer portal after their spring games.\n\nFrench Open to reveal second retractable roof court at Roland Garros ahead of Olympics\n\nPARIS (AP) -- Organizers of the tennis French Open say the second retractable roof at Roland Garros will be inaugurated on the opening day of main draw play next month. The project was planned with the Paris Olympics in mind. Roland Garros will stage the week-long Olympic tennis tournaments. French Open tournament director Amelie Mauresmo says a ceremony for the roof over the 10,000-seat Suzanne Lenglen court will be held on May 26. It can also be used for qualifying rounds played on previous days. The main 15,000-seat Philippe Chatrier court has had a retractable roof since 2020. Olympics tennis is scheduled from July 27 to Aug. 4.\n\nCubs reliever Luke Little forced to change his glove because of white in American flag patch\n\nCHICAGO (AP) -- Chicago Cubs reliever Luke Little says he had to change his glove before he entered the team's 4-3 victory over Houston because of an American flag patch. Manager Craig Counsell went to insert Little with one out in the seventh inning. But as the 6-foot-8 left-hander went through the usual check by umpires for pitchers coming into the game, he was told he had to swap out his glove. Counsell says the issue was the white in the American flag patch on Little's glove. Little says he has been using the same glove since Class A ball.", "source": {"uri": "yakimaherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yakima Herald-Republic"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Asked a few times Wednesday about speculation that he doesn't want to play for Washington and whether he prefers going to another team, Daniels understandably took a diplomatic approach one day before the NFL draft. The 2023 Heisman Trophy winner from LSU is expected to be one of the top three players selected Thursday night. After USC quarterback Caleb Williams goes to Chicago first overall, Daniels is the odds-on favorite to be the No. 2 pick, according to BetMGM Sportsbook.\n\nIt's no longer a red flag for prospects to play for multiple schools on their way to the NFL draft\n\nDENVER (AP) -- The name, image and likeness deals on college campuses and relaxed transfer rules mean it's no longer uncommon to see draft prospects such as Caleb Williams or Jayden Daniels play for multiple schools on their way to the NFL draft. It's also no longer a red flag for those players who transferred schools. The NFL used to cast a leery eye on players who transferred, figuring the athletes might have trouble staying in line. Now, about a third of the prospects who were invited to the NFL scouting combine transferred at least once during their college careers.\n\nCubs reliever Luke Little forced to change his glove because of white in American flag patch\n\nCHICAGO (AP) -- Chicago Cubs reliever Luke Little says he had to change his glove before he entered the team's 4-3 victory over Houston because of an American flag patch.

Now baseball's oldest living major leaguer, Art Schallock, is turning 100\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The oldest living former major leaguer, Art Schallock turns 100 on Thursday and is being celebrated in the Bay Area and beyond. His baseball memories are still fresh. Called up by the New York Yankees to take Mickey Mantle's roster spot, Schallock roomed with Yogi Berra and was tasked with collecting the Hall of Famer's comic books from hotel lobbies each morning. He hardly minded. The three-time World Series winner still wears one of his rings regularly. He's now at an assisted living facility, which is throwing a party for him on his birthday.\n\nMichigan's QB battle among many in Big Ten that started in spring and will ramp up again in the fall\n\nBig Ten quarterback competitions that started in the spring will carry over to the fall.

They don't mind, knowing the coach has them set to win\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Knicks know when it's coming. When they throw a careless pass that leads to a turnover, or hoist a bad shot that ruins a possession, their coach is likely standing on the sideline with arms in the air, furious he's just witnessed such miscues. Like all coaches, Tom Thibodeau doesn't like mistakes and unlike a lot of his NBA brethren, he doesn't bother hiding it from the nearly 20,000 people in the arena watching. Many coaches will try to have a poker face and not react when their players make mistakes. But the Knicks say they are OK with Thibodeau's tantrums because they believe he has them prepared to win.\n\nFrench Open to reveal second retractable roof court at Roland Garros ahead of Olympics\n\nPARIS (AP) -- Organizers of the tennis French Open say the second retractable roof at Roland Garros will be inaugurated on the opening day of main draw play next month.

The tour began contacting all 193 players eligible for $930 million in the Player Equity Program. It's a first-of-its-kind ownership plan for players. The top tier is 36 players who have access to $750 million in equity. One British newspaper reported that Tiger Woods would be getting $100 million. It did not say where it got that number. Emails informing players of their equity take are starting to go out Wednesday afternoon.\n\nNFL to open academy in Australia to identify and develop young prospects\n\nThe NFL will expand its international search for talent by opening an academy in rugby-mad Australia to develop promising teenagers in the Asia-Pacific region into college and pro prospects. The NFL Academy will open in September on the Gold Coast for student athletes aged 12 to 18, following recruitment camps taking place this summer in Australia and New Zealand. Ahead of the NFL Draft, the announcement says the region is full of talent such as Philadelphia Eagles offensive tackle Jordan Mailata, a 6-foot-8 Australian who was deemed too big for rugby league.\n\nJosef Newgarden stripped of season-opening IndyCar victory for manipulating push-to-pass system\n\nJosef Newgarden has been stripped of his win in IndyCar's season-opening race at St. Petersburg because Team Penske manipulated its push-to-pass system during the race, making Pato O'Ward the winner. O'Ward, who drives for McLaren, had originally finished second. Penske teammate Scott McLaughlin, who finished third, was also disqualified. Will Power, the third Penske driver, was docked 10 points. Additionally, all three entries have been fined $25,000 and will forfeit all prize money associated with the race. Newgarden, a two-time IndyCar champion and reigning Indianapolis 500 winner who is in a contract year with Penske, fell from first in points to 11th with the disqualification.", "source": {"uri":

He's now at an assisted living facility, which is throwing a party for him on his birthday.\n\n'Struggling' Capitals captain Alex Ovechkin is hoping patience pays off soon against the Rangers\n\nARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Alex Ovechkin has just one shot on goal through two games of the Washington Capitals' first-round playoff series against the New York Rangers, which they trail 2-0. Coach Spencer Carbery acknowledged Ovechkin is struggling. The No. 2 career goal-scorer in NHL history believes he needs to be more patient starting with Game 3 Friday night at home. Washington needs production from its longtime captain to get back in the series.\n\nNot every WNBA draft pick will make her team's roster. Here's why\n\nThe WNBA draft is over, and superstars like Caitlin Clark are heading toward surefire pro careers. Not all 36 draft picks have such assurances. The league has 144 coveted roster spots among 12 teams, and other options for pro careers in women's basketball either in the U.S. or overseas are scarce.

Asked a few times Wednesday about speculation that he doesn't want to play for Washington and whether he prefers going to another team, Daniels understandably took a diplomatic approach one day before the NFL draft. The 2023 Heisman Trophy winner from LSU is expected to be one of the top three players selected Thursday night. After USC quarterback Caleb Williams goes to Chicago first overall, Daniels is the odds-on favorite to be the No. 2 pick, according to BetMGM Sportsbook.\n\nCubs reliever Luke Little forced to change his glove because of white in American flag patch\n\nCHICAGO (AP) -- Chicago Cubs reliever Luke Little says he had to change his glove before he entered the team's 4-3 victory over Houston because of an American flag patch. Manager Craig Counsell went to insert Little with one out in the seventh inning. But as the 6-foot-8 left-hander went through the usual check by umpires for pitchers coming into the game, he was told he had to swap out his glove. Counsell says the issue was the white in the American flag patch on Little's glove. Little says he has been using the same glove since Class A ball.\n\nHe replaced Mickey Mantle.

His baseball memories are still fresh. Called up by the New York Yankees to take Mickey Mantle's roster spot, Schallock roomed with Yogi Berra and was tasked with collecting the Hall of Famer's comic books from hotel lobbies each morning. He hardly minded. The three-time World Series winner still wears one of his rings regularly.

The project was planned with the Paris Olympics in mind. Roland Garros will stage the week-long Olympic tennis tournaments. French Open tournament director Amelie Mauresmo says a ceremony for the roof over the 10,000-seat Suzanne Lenglen court will be held on May 26. It can also be used for qualifying rounds played on previous days. The main 15,000-seat Philippe Chatrier court has had a retractable roof since 2020.

Only four of the 14 teams appear set at the position. That doesn't include any of the four teams from the Pac-12 that join the conference July 1. Michigan will go into preseason practice with a three-man competition. Alex Orji and Davis Warren were the starters in the Wolverines' spring game and Jack Tuttle joins the fray in the fall. Kansas State transfer Will Howard is battling Devin Brown at Ohio State. Iowa and Northwestern lost their 2023 starters to the transfer portal after their spring games.\n\nThibodeau shows when he's mad at his Knicks. They don't mind, knowing the coach has them set to win\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Knicks know when it's coming. When they throw a careless pass that leads to a turnover, or hoist a bad shot that ruins a possession, their coach is likely standing on the sideline with arms in the air, furious he's just witnessed such miscues. Like all coaches, Tom Thibodeau doesn't like mistakes and unlike a lot of his NBA brethren, he doesn't bother hiding it from the nearly 20,000 people in the arena watching. Many coaches will try to have a poker face and not react when their players make mistakes. But the Knicks say they are OK with Thibodeau's tantrums because they believe he has them prepared to win.\n\nNFL to open academy in Australia to identify and develop young prospects\n\nThe NFL will expand its international search for talent by opening an academy in rugby-mad Australia to develop promising teenagers in the Asia-Pacific region into college and pro prospects. The NFL Academy will open in September on the Gold Coast for student athletes aged 12 to 18, following recruitment camps taking place this summer in Australia and New Zealand. Ahead of the NFL Draft, the announcement says the region is full of talent such as Philadelphia Eagles offensive tackle Jordan Mailata, a 6-foot-8 Australian who was deemed too big for rugby league.\n\nPGA Tour players learn how much loyalty is worth in new equity program\n\nPlayers who stayed loyal to the PGA Tour in the divide with Saudi-funded LIV Golf are starting to find out how much that loyalty could be worth. The tour began contacting all 193 players eligible for $930 million in the Player Equity Program. It's a first-of-its-kind ownership plan for players. The top tier is 36 players who have access to $750 million in equity. One British newspaper reported that Tiger Woods would be getting $100 million. It did not say where it got that number. Emails informing players of their equity take are starting to go out Wednesday afternoon.\n\nHerro scores 24, Heat hit franchise playoff-record 23 3s to beat Boston and even series 1-1\n\nBOSTON (AP) -- Tyler Herro hit six of Miami's franchise playoff-record 23 3-pointers to lead the Heat to a 111-101 victory over the Boston Celtics and tie their first-round playoff series at one game apiece. Herro had 24 points and 14 assists to lead Miami. Bam Adebayo had 21 points and 10 rebounds, and new Celtics nemesis Caleb Martin also had 21 for the Heat. Miami shot 53.5% from beyond the arc to bounce back after a Game 1 blowout. Jaylen Brown scored 33 points for top-seeded Boston. Jayson Tatum scored 28. The series moves to Miami for Games 3 and 4 on Saturday and Monday.\n\nJosef Newgarden stripped of season-opening IndyCar victory for manipulating push-to-pass system\n\nJosef Newgarden has been stripped of his win in IndyCar's season-opening race at St. Petersburg because Team Penske manipulated its push-to-pass system during the race, making Pato O'Ward the winner. O'Ward, who drives for McLaren, had originally finished second. Penske teammate Scott McLaughlin, who finished third, was also disqualified. Will Power, the third Penske driver, was docked 10 points. Additionally, all three entries have been fined $25,000 and will forfeit all prize money associated with the race. Newgarden, a two-time IndyCar champion and reigning Indianapolis 500 winner who is in a contract year with Penske, fell from first in points to 11th with the disqualification.", "source": {"uri":

It's also no longer a red flag for those players who transferred schools. The NFL used to cast a leery eye on players who transferred, figuring the athletes might have trouble staying in line. Now, about a third of the prospects who were invited to the NFL scouting combine transferred at least once during their college careers.\n\nLSU's Jayden Daniels downplays issues with Commanders, says he'd be 'blessed' to go No. 2 overall\n\nDETROIT (AP) -- Jayden Daniels handled the media with the same poise and command he displays in the pocket. Asked a few times Wednesday about speculation that he doesn't want to play for Washington and whether he prefers going to another team, Daniels understandably took a diplomatic approach one day before the NFL draft. The 2023 Heisman Trophy winner from LSU is expected to be one of the top three players selected Thursday night. After USC quarterback Caleb Williams goes to Chicago first overall, Daniels is the odds-on favorite to be the No. 2 pick, according to BetMGM Sportsbook.\n\nNFL draft attendees down for 3rd straight year. J.J. McCarthy among those who didn't go to Detroit\n\nDETROIT (AP) -- There's no place Drake Maye would rather be. When the NFL invited the former North Carolina quarterback to attend the draft in Detroit, he quickly said yes. Maye says it's a dream come true to walk across the stage. Not everyone feels the same way. Only 13 players chose to celebrate their big night in the Motor City, representing a decline in NFL draft attendees for the third straight year. Former Michigan quarterback J.J. McCarthy was among the first-round prospects who chose to stay away Thursday night.\n\nMan who shot ex-Saints star Will Smith receives 25-year prison sentence for manslaughter\n\nNEW ORLEANS (AP) -- The man who fatally shot retired NFL star Will Smith after a car crash in 2016 has received a 25-year prison sentence following his January conviction on a manslaughter charge. Thursday's hearing in New Orleans marked the second time 36-year-old Cardell Hayes had faced sentencing in the killing. He was convicted of manslaughter in December 2016 and later sentenced to 25 years. But the jury vote had been 10-2 and the conviction was later tossed after the Supreme Court outlawed such non-unanimous verdicts. He was freed on bond while awaiting his retrial but was locked away again after his second conviction in the death of the former New Orleans Saint.\n\nWill Power denies participating in Penske cheating scandal. Silence from Josef Newgarden\n\nWill Power says he was unaware of any manipulations to Team Penske's push-to-power system until after last weekend's IndyCar race at Long Beach and never illegally used the mechanism. Team Penske is under heavy scrutiny following the season-opening race at St. Petersburg, Florida, in which Josef Newgarden was stripped of the victory and Scott McLaughlin, who finished third, was also disqualified. Power finished fourth and while his result was not thrown out, he was docked 10 points and all three Penske drivers were fined $25,000. Power has not been accused of any wrongdoing but was punished because the manipulated systems were found on all three Penske cars.\n\nNadal cruises to straight-set win over American teenager in first round of Madrid Open\n\nMADRID (AP) -- Rafael Nadal didn't need much effort as he cruised to a 6-1, 6-0 victory against American teenager Darwin Blanch in the first round of the Madrid open. Nadal looked in good form in what was only his third match since returning from his latest injury layoff. He had made his return in Barcelona last week, losing to Alex De Minaur in the second round. Nadal had arrived in Madrid saying he was not 100% fit, and that he was only going to play because the tournament was at home.\n\nWrexham schedules 3 games in US and Canada in July\n\nWREXHAM, Wales (AP) -- Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney are taking Wrexham back to the United States this summer. Details of the tour' have been announced in an online video by the co-owners on Thursday. They confirmed two games in California and another in Vancouver, Canada, as part of the Welsh club's preparations for next season. Wrexham shot to global fame after being bought by Hollywood actors Reynolds and McElhenney in 2021. It will play English Premier League teams Bournemouth and Chelsea as well as the Vancouver White Caps in July. Last year's U.S. tour had games against Chelsea and Manchester United.\n\nBernie Williams is back in center - only this time Lincoln Center for New York Philharmonic debut\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- After spending 16 years gaining fame while roaming the grass where Joe DiMaggio and Mickey Mantle once trod, Bernie Williams was on the stage made famous by Leonard Bernstein and where guitar great Andr\u00e9s Segovia once played. The former New York Yankees center fielder made his New York Philharmonic debut on Wednesday night at David Geffen Hall, playing \"Moving Forward,\" a jazz-infused work he composed in 2009. He played alongside Gustavo Dudamel, who becomes music director in 2026-27.\n\nHe replaced Mickey Mantle. Now baseball's oldest living major leaguer, Art Schallock, is turning 100\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The oldest living former major leaguer, Art Schallock turns 100 on Thursday and is being celebrated in the Bay Area and beyond. His baseball memories are still fresh. Called up by the New York Yankees to take Mickey Mantle's roster spot, Schallock roomed with Yogi Berra and was tasked with collecting the Hall of Famer's comic books from hotel lobbies each morning. He hardly minded. The three-time World Series winner still wears one of his rings regularly. He's now at an assisted living facility, which is throwing a party for him on his birthday.\n\n'Struggling' Capitals captain Alex Ovechkin is hoping patience pays off soon against the Rangers\n\nARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Alex Ovechkin has just one shot on goal through two games of the Washington Capitals' first-round playoff series against the New York Rangers, which they trail 2-0. Coach Spencer Carbery acknowledged Ovechkin is struggling. The No. 2 career goal-scorer in NHL history believes he needs to be more patient starting with Game 3 Friday night at home. Washington needs production from its longtime captain to get back in the series.", "source": {"uri": "yakimaherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yakima Herald-Republic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@yakimaherald.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayden_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jayden Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Penske", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Team Penske"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Power", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Will Power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manslaughter", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manslaughter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Smith", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Will Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Newgarden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josef Newgarden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MGM_Resorts_International", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MGM Resorts International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scout (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisman_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heisman Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_California", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Southern California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrexham_A.F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wrexham A.F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INDYCAR", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "INDYCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_McElhenney", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rob McElhenney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madrid Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_McLaughlin_(racing_driver)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scott McLaughlin (racing driver)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutherford_B._Hayes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rutherford B.

Team Penske is under heavy scrutiny following the season-opening race at St. Petersburg, Florida, in which Josef Newgarden was stripped of the victory and Scott McLaughlin, who finished third, was also disqualified.

J.J. McCarthy among those who didn't go to Detroit\n\nDETROIT (AP) -- There's no place Drake Maye would rather be. When the NFL invited the former North Carolina quarterback to attend the draft in Detroit, he quickly said yes. Maye says it's a dream come true to walk across the stage. Not everyone feels the same way. Only 13 players chose to celebrate their big night in the Motor City, representing a decline in NFL draft attendees for the third straight year. Former Michigan quarterback J.J. McCarthy was among the first-round prospects who chose to stay away Thursday night.\n\nLSU's Jayden Daniels downplays issues with Commanders, says he'd be 'blessed' to go No. 2 overall\n\nDETROIT (AP) -- Jayden Daniels handled the media with the same poise and command he displays in the pocket. Asked a few times Wednesday about speculation that he doesn't want to play for Washington and whether he prefers going to another team, Daniels understandably took a diplomatic approach one day before the NFL draft. The 2023 Heisman Trophy winner from LSU is expected to be one of the top three players selected Thursday night. After USC quarterback Caleb Williams goes to Chicago first overall, Daniels is the odds-on favorite to be the No. 2 pick, according to BetMGM Sportsbook.\n\nMan who shot ex-Saints star Will Smith receives 25-year prison sentence for manslaughter\n\nNEW ORLEANS (AP) -- The man who fatally shot retired NFL star Will Smith after a car crash in 2016 has received a 25-year prison sentence following his January conviction on a manslaughter charge. Thursday's hearing in New Orleans marked the second time 36-year-old Cardell Hayes had faced sentencing in the killing. He was convicted of manslaughter in 2016 and later sentenced to 25 years. But the jury vote had been 10-2 and the conviction was later tossed after the Supreme Court outlawed such non-unanimous verdicts. Hayes was convicted by a unanimous jury in January, despite Hayes' insistence that he had fired in self-defense, thinking that Smith had retrieved a gun from his SUV.\n\nWill Power denies participating in Penske cheating scandal. Silence from Josef Newgarden\n\nWill Power says he was unaware of any manipulations to Team Penske's push-to-power system until after last weekend's IndyCar race at Long Beach and never illegally used the mechanism. Team Penske is under heavy scrutiny following the season-opening race at St. Petersburg, Florida, in which Josef Newgarden was stripped of the victory and Scott McLaughlin, who finished third, was also disqualified. Power finished fourth and while his result was not thrown out, he was docked 10 points and all three Penske drivers were fined $25,000. Power has not been accused of any wrongdoing but was punished because the manipulated systems were found on all three Penske cars.\n\nNadal cruises to straight-set win over American teenager in first round of Madrid Open\n\nMADRID (AP) -- Rafael Nadal didn't need much effort as he cruised to a 6-1, 6-0 victory against American teenager Darwin Blanch in the first round of the Madrid open. Nadal looked in good form in what was only his third match since returning from his latest injury layoff. He had made his return in Barcelona last week, losing to Alex De Minaur in the second round. Nadal had arrived in Madrid saying he was not 100% fit, and that he was only going to play because the tournament was at home.\n\nWrexham schedules 3 games in US and Canada in July\n\nWREXHAM, Wales (AP) -- Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney are taking Wrexham back to the United States this summer. Details of the tour' have been announced in an online video by the co-owners on Thursday. They confirmed two games in California and another in Vancouver, Canada, as part of the Welsh club's preparations for next season. Wrexham shot to global fame after being bought by Hollywood actors Reynolds and McElhenney in 2021. It will play English Premier League teams Bournemouth and Chelsea as well as the Vancouver White Caps in July. Last year's U.S. tour had games against Chelsea and Manchester United.\n\nBernie Williams is back in center - only this time Lincoln Center for New York Philharmonic debut\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- After spending 16 years gaining fame while roaming the grass where Joe DiMaggio and Mickey Mantle once trod, Bernie Williams was on the stage made famous by Leonard Bernstein and where guitar great Andr\u00e9s Segovia once played. The former New York Yankees center fielder made his New York Philharmonic debut on Wednesday night at David Geffen Hall, playing \"Moving Forward,\" a jazz-infused work he composed in 2009. He played alongside Gustavo Dudamel, who becomes music director in 2026-27.\n\nHe replaced Mickey Mantle. Now baseball's oldest living major leaguer, Art Schallock, is turning 100\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The oldest living former major leaguer, Art Schallock turns 100 on Thursday and is being celebrated in the Bay Area and beyond. His baseball memories are still fresh. Called up by the New York Yankees to take Mickey Mantle's roster spot, Schallock roomed with Yogi Berra and was tasked with collecting the Hall of Famer's comic books from hotel lobbies each morning. He hardly minded. The three-time World Series winner still wears one of his rings regularly. He's now at an assisted living facility, which is throwing a party for him on his birthday.\n\n'Struggling' Capitals captain Alex Ovechkin is hoping patience pays off soon against the Rangers\n\nARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Alex Ovechkin has just one shot on goal through two games of the Washington Capitals' first-round playoff series against the New York Rangers, which they trail 2-0. Coach Spencer Carbery acknowledged Ovechkin is struggling. The No. 2 career goal-scorer in NHL history believes he needs to be more patient starting with Game 3 Friday night at home. Washington needs production from its longtime captain to get back in the series.\n\nNot every WNBA draft pick will make her team's roster. Here's why\n\nThe WNBA draft is over, and superstars like Caitlin Clark are heading toward surefire pro careers. Not all 36 draft picks have such assurances. The league has 144 coveted roster spots among 12 teams, and other options for pro careers in women's basketball either in the U.S. or overseas are scarce. Since 2018, only 65.7% of draft picks have played in a WNBA game at some point in their career.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@eagletribune.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayden_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jayden Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Penske", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Team Penske"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Power", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Will Power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutherford_B._Hayes", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rutherford B.

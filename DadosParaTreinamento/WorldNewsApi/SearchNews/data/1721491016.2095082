Marshall, Jr., who was appointed to the bench by former President Barack Obama, ruled that the states lacked standing to bring the lawsuit.\u201cThe District Court applied a common sense interpretation of the plain words of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act,\u201d said Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said in an emailed statement.The Louisiana ruling was a partial victory for the attorneys general of Louisiana and Mississippi, who had asked for a much broader emergency injunction that would have stopped the entirety of the EEOC rules from taking effect nationwide.That request had alarmed some civil rights and women's advocacy groups, who warned that the EEOC rules are critical to the successful implementation of the law.Also Read | US Supreme Court preserves access to abortion pill: What was the case, and what the court saidIn an amicus brief, the American Civil Liberties Union and more than 20 labor and women\u2019s advocacy groups cited dozens of cases of pregnant workers who employers have continued to resist granting them accommodations, and said the EEOC rules provided clarity for resolving disputes.Dina Bakst, co-founder and president of the legal advocacy group A Better Balance, which spearheaded a decade-law campaign for the law, condemned the ruling in Louisiana, saying it \u201cdisregarded decades of legal precedent\u201d interpreting pregnancy-related medical conditions to include abortion.However, she stressed that it was \u201cimportant for pregnant and postpartum workers to understand that this ruling does not mean their rights under the PWFA have been taken away,\u201d given the limited scope of the injunction.The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act passed with widespread bipartisan support in December 2022 after a decade-long campaign by women's right advocates, who hailed it as a victory for low-wage workers who have routinely been denied accommodations for everything from time off for medical appointments to the ability to sit or stand on the job.But many Republican lawmakers, including Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, who co-sponsored the bill, were furious when the EEOC stated that the law covered abortions.Both Republican commissioners on the five-member EEOC voted against the rules.In its regulations, the EEOC said its inclusion of abortion is consistent with its own decades-long interpretation of pregnancy-related anti-discrimination law, along with numerous court rulings backing that interpretation.Also Read | Why revival of 1864 abortion law could resonate in US politics beyond ArizonaThe regulations also specified that the rules do not require any employer to provide health care coverage for abortions and the most likely accommodation request would be for time off to undergo the procedure or recover from any complications.The EEOC has said that any situations where an accommodation requests potentially conflicts with state laws would be examined on a \u201ccase-by-case\u201d basis.In their lawsuit, the attorneys general said the \u201cEEOC is forcing States like Louisiana and Mississippi to go against State law and effectively facilitate an abortion.\u201dMississippi bans most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy.Louisiana has a near-total ban on abortion, with exemptions when there is a substantial risk of death or impairment to the patient in continuing the pregnancy and in cases where the fetus has a fatal abnormality.In its lawsuit, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops said it had publicly backed the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act because lawmakers had stressed its uncontroversial nature, with some expressly stating that it would not require leave for elective abortions.Laura Wolk Slavis, a lawyer representing the Catholic groups, said \u201cthe EEOC hijacked a bipartisan protection for expecting mothers and their babies, imposing a national abortion-accommodation mandate.\"She said the ruling was a \u201ccrucial step\u201d in restoring the law \"to its purpose.\"", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/world/federal-agency-cant-enforce-abortion-rule-in-louisiana-and-mississippi-judge-rules-9398561/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/06/Abortion-law-AP.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-18 00:01:50", "author": null, "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.184}

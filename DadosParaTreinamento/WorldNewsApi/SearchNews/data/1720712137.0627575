I tried name-brand shower cleaners and bleach to try and clean the soap scum off the tiles and tub. I had no luck and I would cough and get sick because of how strong the smell was. I thought I would try this to save my lungs. I sprayed my entire shower and left it for about 15 minutes. I came back and rinsed off the walls and they were shiny! I've never had such a clean shower. The smell is amazing and subtle. All I smell is tea tree and it didn't affect me at all. The price is also a good deal since the bottle is pretty large. It came with the sprayer separate and the bottle sealed so it wouldn't leak in the box. I highly recommend this.\" \u2014Amber Erwin Get a pack of two from Amazon for $15.99.", "summary": "<h1>If you haven't tried a pumice cleaning stone before, your life is about to get oh-so-satisfying.</h1><p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2024-06/3/15/enhanced/3dac409dd2a9/original-4007-1717430184-2.jpg?crop=1245:830;3,0\" /></p><hr /><p><a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/malloryannp/home-organization-products-tidy-spaces\">View Entire Post &rsaquo;</a></p>", "url": "https://www.buzzfeed.com/malloryannp/home-organization-products-tidy-spaces", "image": "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2024-06/3/15/campaign_images/0781ddc2eed4/if-youre-puzzled-by-how-people-keep-their-homes-t-3-871-1717430394-0_dblbig.jpg?resize=1200:*", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 12:31:02", "author": "https://www.buzzfeed.com/about,Mallory Mower", "authors": ["https://www.buzzfeed.com/about", "Mallory Mower"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.326}

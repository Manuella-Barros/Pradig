Speaking to reporters after a meeting of TMC MPs and senior leaders, Banerjee said she would be pleased if the \u201cweak and unstable\u201d NDA government was removed from power. \u201cThe BJP is forming the government undemocratically and illegally. Today, the INDIA bloc may not have staked a claim to form the government, but that doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t tomorrow. Let\u2019s wait for some time,\u201d she said. Ultimately, the INDIA bloc will form the government in the coming days, the Trinamool Congress supremo asserted. The TMC had exited the INDIA bloc in West Bengal in January but stated that she would continue to be part of the opposition bloc at the national level. According to sources, during the closed-door meeting, Banerjee told party leaders and MPs that the \u201cNDA government will not complete its full term. While talking to reporters after the meeting also, Banerjee expressed confidence that the \u201cunstable and weak BJP government at the Centre\u201d won\u2019t last long. \u201cThe NDA government to be formed will be unstable. BJP has not secured majority; they are dependent on allies. Let\u2019s see how long they can get along with their allies,\u201d she said. Banerjee remarked that as the mandate was against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, \u201che should have stepped down this time and allowed someone else to take over. \u201cThe country needs change; the country wants change. This mandate was for change. We are waiting and keeping a watch on the situation,\u201d she said. She also announced that the TMC would not attend the swearing-in ceremony of the new government. Banerjee stated that the MPs in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha would seek the repeal of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). \u201cThis Lok Sabha is not going to be like the previous two Lok Sabhas where they passed bills as they had brute majority. Our MPs will demand the repeal of CAA. We don\u2019t want any NRC or Uniform Civil Code. We will raise our demand for the release of due funds of the state,\u201d she said. During the meeting of the TMC MPs, Mamata Banerjee was unanimously elected as the chairperson of the TMC Parliamentary Party. \u201cSudip Bandyopadhyay will be the Leader of the Lok Sabha, and Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar will be the Deputy Leader of the party in Lok Sabha,\u201d she said.

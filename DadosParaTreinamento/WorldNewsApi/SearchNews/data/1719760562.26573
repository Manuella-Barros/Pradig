Dunes on the Waterfront, Ogunquit Dunes on the Waterfront, a group of 21 white clapboard cottages with green shutters on 12 acres of lawns overlooking Ogunquit\u2019s famous beach, dunes, and tidal river, debuted this month. Ranging from one to three bedrooms, the cottages date back to 1936 and were owned by three generations of the Perkins family. Hotelier Tim Harrington and his company, Atlantic Hospitality, bought the cottages last year from the Perkins\u2019 and spent $10 million renovating the property. Harrington has a strong record of restoring and reimagining vintage Maine coastal properties, including The Claremont in Southwest Harbor and Salt Cottages in Bar Harbor. He's also a partner in the Kennebunkport Resort Collection, 10 hotels that include Hidden Pond in Kennebunkport. You can stroll to the resort town\u2019s many restaurants, bars, and shops or take one of the hotel\u2019s complimentary bikes and ride into town. It\u2019s a short distance from the famed Ogunquit Playhouse, Maine\u2019s most beloved summer stock theater. All cottages have a private porch or patio, the better to soak up the coastal atmosphere. Pursuits include relaxing in the heated swimming pool with ocean views, paddle boarding, kayaking, and waterfront yoga classes. Rockport Harbor Hotel, Rockport.

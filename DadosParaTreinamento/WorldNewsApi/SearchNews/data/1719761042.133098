{"id": 225043826, "title": "Fabio Silva insists Rangers was a winner for him despite run in failure as he reveals 5 key lessons learned", "text": "Fabio Silva has revealed the most important lesson learned as his time at Rangers comes to an end. The Wolves loanee will head back down the road to the English Premier League outfit after Philippe Clement's men signed off their campaign with a last-gasp Scottish Cup Final defeat to Celtic at Hampden last weekend - on the back of losing out on the Premiership. The Portuguese Under-21 star found himself in the headlines on more than one occasion during his spell in Glasgow which included accusations of diving. He netted six goals in 25 appearances including two 90-minute outings in the Europa League knockout defeat to Benfica. Silva took to social media to label his campaign as a year of learning and one that also made him a MAN. He also took the opportunity to thank everyone in his circle and both Wolves and Rangers before stating the most important thing is to be 'desired and happy'. He signed off by saying 'trust the process always' as he heads back to Wolves to discover the next step of his career after six months north of the border. He started by sharing a quote on Instagram along side a video montage of him showing tears before going into clips of his time at Rangers and goals. The video ends with him doing his celebration of showing his name on the back of his top. The quote read: \"Life will knock us down but we can choose whether or not to get back up.\" He followed this up by writing: \"Life is made up of good and bad moments. Of ups and downs. This season I gained much more than I lost. I lived in new stadiums, new environments and in a different city. \"It was a year of learning and a year that made me a man. I learned that the important thing is to never give up and that I must mature every day so that the result is consistent. \"Thank you to everyone. To my parents, my brothers, family, friends and my agent. To Wolverhampton and Rangers. The important thing is to be desired and happy. And with them, I can do anything. Trust the process always.\"", "summary": "The attacker heads back to his parent club after his loan stint with Philippe Clement at Ibrox ended.", "url": "https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/fabio-silva-insists-rangers-winner-32917706", "image": "https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article32917771.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS334418494.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:57:26", "author": "Alan Galindo", "authors": ["Alan Galindo"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.573}

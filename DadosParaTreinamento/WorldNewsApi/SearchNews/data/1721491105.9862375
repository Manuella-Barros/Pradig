The Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) announced the excavation of a site in Lod, which is in central Israel, on Facebook on Sunday. The IAA explained that its archaeologists recently found the remains of a \u201cdestroyed Jewish public building\u201d that once stood in Syria Palaestina, or Roman Palestine. \u201cAmong the various finds in the building were impressive stone and marble artifacts; Greek, Hebrew and Latin inscriptions, and one inscription bearing the name of a Jewish man from a priestly family, which is still being studied,\u201d the IAA said. \u201cThese inscriptions, coupled with the complete absence of pig bones from the bone assemblage uncovered in this site, attest to this building\u2019s association with the Jewish community.\u201d Notably, excavators found a hoard of 94 coins that are roughly 1,650 years old. The IAA dates the discovery back to the Jewish revolt against Constantius Gallus, which began in 351 AD. \u201cThe latest coins are dated from the time of the Gallus Revolt (351-354 CE),\u201d the IAA statement explains. \u201cThough written evidence is sparse regarding this revolt, there are texts reporting that major Jewish communities such as Lod, Zipori and Tiberias were destroyed by the forces of Roman Caesar Flavius Constantius Gallus.\u201d The oldest coins could have been produced as early as 221 AD. Historians said the treasure was purposely hidden during the revolt. \u201c[They] were deliberately placed there \u2013 in the hopes of returning to collect them when the situation would calm,\u201d the IAA said. Two of the site\u2019s excavators, Shahar Krispin and Mor Viezel, said in a joint statement that the \u201cmagnificent\u201d building likely served as living quarters for the city\u2019s Jewish elders. \u201cFrom Talmudic writings we know that Lod was a most significant Jewish center in the aftermath of the Second Temple\u2019s destruction in Jerusalem,\u201d the statement explained. \u201cThis building, destroyed down to its very foundation, is a clear indication that the revolt was forcefully put down with violence and cruelty, and was not simply a local uprising event, as some earlier studies contended.\u201d \u201cThis is the singular witness, thus far, to the extent and power of this revolt in Lod, located in the country\u2019s center.\u201d The mayor of Lod, Yair Revivo, called the discovery \u201cvery emotionally moving.\u201d \u201c[It is] another link in the chain of Lod\u2019s Tannaitic period heritage as host to the authors of the Mishna, and to Lod\u2019s Jewish history,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cThe finds in the area proves that Lod is one of the oldest cities in the world.\u201d Professor Joshua Schwartz of the Israel Antiquities Authority Council noted that the discovery also poses additional questions. \u201cIt is difficult to determine if this magnificent building served as synagogue, study hall, meeting hall of the elders, or all three of these functions as one,\u201d Schwartz explained. \u201cBut what is clear is that the building\u2019s size, the coin hoard, and the assemblage of archaeological finds produced by the excavation, fit well Lod/Diospolis\u2019 description in both Jewish and non-Jewish sources as a center of Torah-true Jewish life in the Mishna and Talmud periods.\u201d \u201cLod\u2019s role as a leading community with elders continued from after the destruction though to this moment when it was cruelly cut down in the Gallus Revolt,\u201d Schwartz said.", "summary": "Archaeologists in Israel recently made a \"dramatic\" discovery that provides invaluable historical knowledge about\u00a0Jewish life\u00a0in the ancient Roman era of Israel, officials said.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/06/17/world-news/ancient-treasure-among-1650-year-old-objects-unearthed-in-israel/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/www-facebook-com-antiquitiesen-84005291.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-18 00:54:33", "author": "Fox News", "authors": ["Fox News"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.13}

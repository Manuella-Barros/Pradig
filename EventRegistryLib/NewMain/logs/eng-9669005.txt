A state Senate committee on Thursday advanced a bill that would ban such blowers most of the year, but would allow ones using four-stroke combustion engines to be used during peak cleanup periods in spring and fall. (Dirtier two-stroke models would be phased out after two years.)\n\nIt's a compromise the industry says it is willing to make in the interest of still being able to use the more powerful gas-powered blowers when they are needed most.\n\n\"New Jersey is bombarded with leaves and stuff to clean up,\" said Rich Goldstein, president of the New Jersey Landscape Contractors Association, representing 550 companies in the state. \"We're not California, we're not Florida. We have leaves. The average house in New Jersey, you take away 30 to 50 cubic feet of leaves each fall.

A ban in California starts next month, and similar measures have passed in Washington, D.C., Portland, Oregon; Montgomery County, Maryland; Burlington, Vermont; and Evanston, Illinois, among other places.\n\nDoug O'Malley, director of Environment New Jersey, said more than 100 cities across the U.S. have banned or restricted gas-powered leaf blowers, which he called a major source of pollution. He said using such a blower for an hour creates as much pollution as driving a car for 1,100 miles (1,770 kilometers).\n\nBut just as the push to move away from burning fossil fuels to power cars and homes is drawing opposition from business groups and numerous device owners, the move by government to force a switch to battery-powered leaf blowers has the industry complaining of increased costs and decreased performance under the new regulations.\n\n\"My company, I have $150,000 to $200,000 worth of gas-powered blowers,\" said Goldstein, head of the New Jersey landscapers' group. \"What am I supposed to do, throw them in the garbage?\"\n\nNew Jersey's proposed bill, like others enacted in several U.S. cities, would provide financial assistance to the industry to defray the cost of purchasing new battery-powered blowers.\n\nCost is not the only concern, Goldstein said.\n\n\"It's retrofitting your truck to be able to charge batteries throughout the day,\" he said. \"And by doing that, you'd have to keep your diesel engine running, and that causes another issue. This is just a terrible idea.\"\n\nHe also said two-stroke engines, while less fuel-efficient than four-stroke ones, can do things that the more advanced models can't, such as being turned sideways to reach into hard-to-access places.\n\nMaplewood, New Jersey Mayor Nancy Adams said her community banned gas-powered blowers in January 2023.\n\n\"We are living in an age of climate change, and we've known for 100 years that burning more fossil fuel puts more CO2 into the atmosphere,\" she said.\n\nSince the ban took place, she said, \"Our community is better for it, our quality of life is better.\"\n\nSeveral golf course management and landscaping companies said they support the idea of a gradual transition to battery power, but want more time to phase it in, possibly enabling more powerful battery-powered models to be developed.\n\n___\n\nFollow Wayne Parry on X at www.twitter.com/WayneParryAC", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

A ban in California starts next month, and similar measures have passed in Washington, D.C., Portland, Oregon; Montgomery County, Maryland; Burlington, Vermont; and Evanston, Illinois, among other places.\n\nDoug O'Malley, director of Environment New Jersey, said more than 100 cities across the U.S. have banned or restricted gas-powered leaf blowers, which he called a major source of pollution. He said using such a blower for an hour creates as much pollution as driving a car for 1,100 miles (1,770 kilometers).\n\nBut just as the push to move away from burning fossil fuels to power cars and homes is drawing opposition from business groups and numerous device owners, the move by government to force a switch to battery-powered leaf blowers has the industry complaining of increased costs and decreased performance under the new regulations.\n\n\"My company, I have $150,000 to $200,000 worth of gas-powered blowers,\" said Goldstein, head of the New Jersey landscapers' group. \"What am I supposed to do, throw them in the garbage?\"\n\nNew Jersey's proposed bill, like others enacted in several U.S. cities, would provide financial assistance to the industry to defray the cost of purchasing new battery-powered blowers.\n\nCost is not the only concern, Goldstein said.\n\n\"It's retrofitting your truck to be able to charge batteries throughout the day,\" he said. \"And by doing that, you\u00b4d have to keep your diesel engine running, and that causes another issue. This is just a terrible idea.\"\n\nHe also said two-stroke engines, while less fuel-efficient than four-stroke ones, can do things that the more advanced models can't, such as being turned sideways to reach into hard-to-access places.\n\nMaplewood, New Jersey Mayor Nancy Adams said her community banned gas-powered blowers in January 2023.\n\n\"We are living in an age of climate change, and we've known for 100 years that burning more fossil fuel puts more CO2 into the atmosphere,\" she said.\n\nSince the ban took place, she said, \"Our community is better for it, our quality of life is better.\"\n\nSeveral golf course management and landscaping companies said they support the idea of a gradual transition to battery power, but want more time to phase it in, possibly enabling more powerful battery-powered models to be developed.\n\nFollow Wayne Parry on X at www.twitter.com/WayneParryAC\n\nAntonio Espinoza, a supervisor with the Gras Lawn landscaping company, pulls the cord to start a gasoline-powered leaf blower in Brick, N.J. on June 18, 2024.

manufacturer, evaluation agreement signed - Stockhead", "body": "Special Report: Sprintex has taken a key step forward in supplying its G15 commercial blowers to a leading US vacuum pump and blower manufacturer after signing an evaluation contract.\n\nThe G series blowers are designed for efficient and reliable movement of air at high speeds for use in wastewater treatment, aquaculture, paper milling, and pharmaceuticals.\n\nSprintex's (ASX:SIX) G15 blowers are more than 35% more energy efficient than conventional blowers thanks to the use of smart pulse aeration technology, its own patented motor design, and high efficiency impellers.\n\nThey are also capable of automated operation and are claimed by the company to be the most compact in the industry.\n\nThe company recently secured a cumulative $3.6m in loan funding to ramp up production of its blowers following an increase in demand from customers.\n\nSIX has now reached an agreement to supply G15 blowers for evaluation to a leading global designer and manufacturer of vacuum pumps and blowers headquartered in the US along with additional units to several other customers.\n\nThese units will be tested internally by the customers before they potentially switch specifications to the G15 blowers.\n\nThe company believes these evaluations have the potential to lead to significant annual purchases, underscoring the market's strong interest in its innovative solutions.\n\nAdditionally, the evaluation agreement initiates a strategic partnership which represents a significant private label opportunity for Sprintex as the US company has extensive distribution channels and a large customer base.\n\nIt is also in discussions with other OEM manufacturers who are interested in private label opportunities.\n\nSIX notes that it added over 100 interested companies to its database and received several evaluation orders following a successful attendance at IFAT Munich in May this year.\n\nCompanies that have ordered samples for testing are:\n\nSeparately, the company has secured an initial order of 10 G15 units from \"Fresh by Design\" to supply Tassal Group, Australia's largest seafood producer, following successful evaluations.\n\nIt is also collaborating with a Netherlands-based company to develop a custom compressor to integrate with their ammonia reducing technology for agriculture in response to the Dutch government mandated limits on ammonia emissions from animal manure.\n\n\"We are excited to confirm that Sprintex Limited has commenced supplying our G15 commercial blowers for evaluation by leading developers of advanced blower technologies,\" managing director Jay Upton said.\n\n\"This includes an evaluation agreement with a prominent global designer and manufacturer of vacuum pumps and blowers based in the United States, along with additional units supplied to several other customers.\n\n\"These evaluations underscore the market's strong interest in our innovative energy efficient solutions and represent a significant private label opportunity for Sprintex.\"\n\nThis article was developed in collaboration with Sprintex, a Stockhead advertiser at the time of

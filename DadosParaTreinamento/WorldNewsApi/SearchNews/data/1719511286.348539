{"id": 224046400, "title": "Ukraine-Russia war latest: Putin&#39;s forces &#39;capture village in Kharkiv&#39;", "text": "Russia\u2019s defence ministry says its forces have captured a village in the northeastern Kharkiv region. Russian troops \u201cas a result of successful combat actions liberated the settlement of Berestove in the Kharkiv region,\u201d the ministry said. The battlefield reports have yet to be verified. Berestove is located on the eastern front line close to the Lugansk region, which is almost entirely under Russian control. Russia this month launched an offensive in the north of the Kharkiv region close to the Russian border, making its largest territorial advances for 18 months. The push has marked an inflection point in the conflict, with analysts saying Moscow has gained more territory in 2024 than it lost control of during Ukraine\u2019s much-hyped counteroffensive in the summer of 2023. Ukraine said Friday that it had managed to stop Russia from advancing further and was counter-attacking, but that Moscow was now intensifying its assault at other parts of the front.", "summary": "<![CDATA[<p>Russia\u2019s defence ministry says its forces have captured a village in the northeastern Kharkiv region.</p>]]>", "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/05/26/ukraine-russia-war-latest-news6/", "image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/world-news/2024/05/26/TELEMMGLPICT000379480215_17167285937210_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqA7N2CxnJWnYI3tCbVBgu9TWU-KwRaHvlaJXY1texVLQ.jpeg?impolicy=logo-overlay", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 16:35:22", "author": "Harriet Barber", "authors": ["Harriet Barber"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.11}

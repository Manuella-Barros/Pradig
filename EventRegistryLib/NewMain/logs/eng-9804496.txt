But after having an initial bid turned down, Chelsea made a breakthrough in negotiations for the ex-Braga winger earlier on Friday.\n\nChelsea, who have added Tosin Adarabioyo and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall to their first-team squad, will pay \u00a351.5 million up front for Neto with the rest coming in add-on bonuses dependent on performances.\n\nEnzo Maresca will have Neto in his squad next season competing for a place, with Cole Palmer, Raheem Sterling, Mykhailo Mudryk and Noni Madueke also able to play in wide positions. Neto has been on the radar of the Premier League's big spenders over the last five years since arriving at Wolves, although his injury record has limited his impact.\n\nArsenal had previously had their sights on Neto, two seasons ago, but Wolves were in a strong position with their player having signed a long-term contract until 2027 and the club having no intention to sell.\n\nHis stock has risen even further since with his displays last season when he recorded nine assists. He has long been tipped as the next Wolves player to move onto a bigger club after Matheus Nunes to City last summer and Liverpool landing Diogo Jota.\n\nChelsea have shaped their squad for the new season with Conor Gallagher agreeing to join Atletico Madrid for \u00a333.7 million, while Romelu Lukaku is poised to leave the club for the right offer.\n\nChelsea have informed Napoli that they want the full \u00a337.8 million clause in Lukaku's contract met and are currently not interested in a loan. But Napoli are yet to follow up their interest with a bid and may be waiting to see whether or not Chelsea's stance softens.

clubs in England's top flight.\n\nChelsea are reportedly in advanced talks to secure the signature of Wolverhampton Wanderers winger Pedro Neto.\n\nIn keeping with the trend that has been set since the arrival of Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital as co-owners, the Blues have been relentless in the transfer market this summer.\n\nA total of nine signings have been made, some of whom will not arrive at Stamford Bridge until next year, with the club's recruitment team attempting to find a balance between building a squad for the present and future.\n\nWhile Chelsea are not necessarily short in any area of the pitch, their wide players - aside from Cole Palmer - have generally been inconsistent over the past 12 months.\n\nOf the current crop, only Noni Madueke has made a positive impression in pre-season, with the long-term futures of Raheem Sterling and Mykhaylo Mudryk very much up in the air.\n\nAs first reported by RMC Sport journalist Fabrice Hawkins, Chelsea have made their latest move to resolve their lingering issues in the final third.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nNeto closing on Chelsea transfer\n\nHawkins reports that Chelsea and Wolves are in the final stages of talks regarding a big-money transfer for the Portugal international.\n\nNeto is said to have given the green light to a move to Stamford Bridge, the expectation being that a deal will be finalised in due course.\n\nIn a separate report by David Ornstein of The Athletic, it is claimed that the West Londoners are ready to pay \u20ac60m (\u00a351.4m) plus a further \u20ac3m (\u00a32.57m) in add-ons to sign the 24-year-old.\n\nA medical is likely to take place over the coming days with Chelsea keen to have Neto in the squad for the Premier League opener against Manchester City on August 18.\n\nCity, as well as the likes of Arsenal and Liverpool, have been heavily linked with a move for Neto, yet it appears that they have either missed out or chosen not to match Chelsea's offer.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nWho is getting the better deal?\n\nWolves have previously valued Neto in the region of \u00a360m and the majority of their supporters will argue that the price-tag is justified.\n\nOn the flip side, this is a player who has made just 38 Premier League appearances across the last two seasons having been plagued by significant injuries.\n\nWhen fit, Neto is one of the best wingers in the division, contributing two goals and nine assists from his 1,519 minutes of action during 2023-24.\n\nNevertheless, Chelsea are undoubtedly taking a risk on Neto, who has still only made three starts for Portugal despite making 19 squads at that level.", "source": {"uri": "sportsmole.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Mole"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Neto, 24, scored three goals and added 11 assists in just 24 appearances last season. However, the Portugal international did miss 18 matches due to hamstring injuries.\n\nDespite that, the Blues are now expected to complete a deal for Neto, after agreeing a fee worth \u00a351.4million plus \u00a32.6m in add-ons with Wolves, football.london understands. Neto is set to undergo a medical 'soon' before completing a transfer to Stamford Bridge.\n\nNeto is expected to become their tenth signing of the summer after Tosin Adarabioyo, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, Filip Jorgensen, Omari Kellyman, Aaron Anselmino, Renato Veiga, Caleb Wiley and Marc Guiu, Estevao Willian - who won't join until 2025 - made the switch to the Blues.\n\nIt's set to take Chelsea's summer spending up to more than \u00a3150m and above Aston Villa as the Premier League club with the biggest transfer outlay so far. The Blues have managed to secure \u00a386m from departures, too, with Ian Maatsen, Lewis Hall and Omari Hutchinson leaving this summer. They join Thiago Silva, Hakim Ziyech, Malang Sarr to exit on a permanent basis.\n\nChelsea are no doubt getting a world-class talent in Neto, but there is concerns surrounding his injury record. In fact, Neto has missed a staggering 102 matches over the last four years. Neto has spent more time out on the sidelines than he has on the pitch, having featured 91 times over that period.", "source": {"uri": "football.london", "dataType": "news", "title": "footballlondon"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bobby_vincent@football.london", "name": "Bobby Vincent", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "kieran_king@football.london", "name": "Kieran King", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Neto", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pedro Neto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Portugal national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiernan_Dewsbury-Hall", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willian_(footballer,_born_1988)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Willian (footballer, born 1988)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamford_Bridge_(stadium)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stamford Bridge (stadium)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tosin_Adarabioyo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tosin Adarabioyo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omari_Hutchinson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Omari Hutchinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hall_(footballer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Hall (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Maatsen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ian Maatsen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malang_Sarr", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Malang Sarr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakim_Ziyech", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hakim Ziyech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiago_Silva", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thiago Silva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Villa_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aston Villa F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Company_Loyalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Company Loyalty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://i2-prod.football.london/incoming/article29709975.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Pedro-Neto.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9804496", "eventUri": "eng-9804496", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

Having already gone big this window on young players, it is the first statement buy since Enzo Maresca took over.\n\nThe Portugal international will join Mykhailo Mudryk, Raheem Sterling, Noni Madueke, and Cole Palmer as natural wingers in the Chelsea squad, whilst Christopher Nkunku and Nicolas Jackson are both able to operate wide as well. Omari Kellyman, Carney Chukwuemeka, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, and Marc Guiu round off the attackers before even considering Angelo Gabriel and Tyrique George.\n\nNeto will cost Chelsea \u00a351million with another \u00a32.5million possible in add-ons, football.london understands. If completed, as expected, he will become the most expensive signing of the summer by some distance. Estavao Willian could end up at \u00a351million himself if all clauses are met.\n\nFor a player with just two Premier League goals last season, it is quite the move. Having missed out on Michael Olise and not going as far as pushing for Nico Williams despite strong interest, Neto will leave Chelsea with all eyes on the striker spot for the rest of the window.\n\nThat is likely to be Samu Omorodion, although a deal for Victor Osimhen has not been ruled out. Neto, with nine Premier League assists last season, is the standout of the summer so far though.\n\nHaving missed two significant periods last term with hamstring problems, there are questions over his fitness. It is something that has stopped other teams from going all out to sign him in the past with Arsenal credited with being big admirers of the former Braga man.\n\nREAD MORE: Chelsea complete fourth transfer of week after clear Enzo Maresca squad decision made\n\nREAD MORE: Chelsea face brutal transfer ban reality as \u00a3196.5m nightmare scenario imminent\n\nBefore his first injury issue in October last season, Neto had managed seven assists and one goal for wolves in just 10 games. Upon his return he notched another two assists and a second goal in a run of eight games. He missed seven of the final eight matches though.\n\nAcross five years in England he has missed 112 games. In the same period he has played 135 times, scoring 14 and assisting 24 across all competitions.\n\nNeto featured for his country at Euro 2024 earlier this summer, making three appearances. He is now in pole position to become the 10th player signed by Chelsea since the end of last season.\n\nAt \u00a351million he will cost an initial touch under the price paid for Christopher Nkunku 12 months ago. Had the club acted when Neto was previously available then it could have been much less.\n\nArsenal were one of several teams looking at the 24-year-old as possible attacking reinforcement last summer and have long been linked with a move for the player. As an exciting winger with immense close control, electric speed, and an eye for a goal, he hasn't always had a big price tag.\n\nNeto was signed for just \u00a315million in 2019 as a teenager from Lazio having cost a fraction of that two years earlier when coming from the Braga academy. At that stage his value was only \u00a35million. Before long that started to rise.\n\nIn December 2020 Neto scored a late winner against Frank Lampard's Chelsea. It was vintage Neto as he burst past the defence and fired a shot in on the break with his stronger left foot. Transfermarkt estimates that he was worth around \u00a323million at that stage.\n\nWithin a year that was closer to \u00a330million. Despite injuries starting to derail his progress - Neto only played 31 league games in two seasons before hitting 20 in 2023/24 - his value has rocketed in the last 12 months. It started to dip after hitting an initial peak of around \u00a335million in September 2022 but has been on a one-way incline, now standing at \u00a347million.\n\nThis indicates that Chelsea really aren't paying over the odds for Neto, even if his injury record is something to worry about. Having signed a contract until 2027 at Molineux in March 2022, Chelsea picking up a player of Neto's undoubted quality for what appears to be the market rate for versatile wingers carries risks but value analysis suggests is a fair deal for all parties.\n\nHad they gone earlier for Neto then it may well have come in at a lower price, but that is not how football works. 12 months ago, at his lowest value in nearly five years, Neto was down at \u00a325million. Now he's about to move for double that.\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

Neto, 24, is due to earn Wolves a total of \u00a354m as part of the deal, and in doing so they're due to set to hand Gary O'Neil some funds with which to reinvest in the squad.\n\nNeto joined Wolves in 2019 and he has proven to be an excellent addition in that time; Neto is due to leave Molineux having scored 14 goals in 135 appearances. The winger has long been considered among Wolves' most prized assets, although his time in the West Midlands has been hampered by injury.\n\nIn April 2021, Neto suffered a knee injury which kept him out for the best part of a year, but he was sidelined again towards the end of 2022 for another five months. He will be leaving Wolves with still three years left on his contract, which meant a strong bargaining position for Wanderers to be in.\n\nOn Wolves' watch, Neto has broken into the Portugal senior team and went with them to the Euros in Germany this summer; the winger came off the bench to set up Francisco Conceicao who netted a stoppage time winner against Czech Republic. He will now head to Chelsea to work under Enzo Maresca.\n\nReports suggest that Neto was also the subject of interest and a player-plus-bid from Tottenham, with midfielder Oliver Skipp offered as a makeweight in the deal, but Chelsea - at the second attempt - have proved the victors in the battle for Neto, having finally relinquished Wolves' grasp on the player with an offer the club he's departing found suitable.\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

So I'm hoping that he stays. There's nothing going on at this moment from anybody. He's in a good spot, I've spoken to him about how we're going to play and how it suits him and what a big part he'll play in it.\n\n\"But of course, we're all grown-ups while you're having them conversations. If a massive bid comes from a top club then no one is going to stand in Pedro's way.\"\n\nAnd now the Blues have stumped up the cash to prise the Portugal international away from Molineux just one week before Wolves' Premier League opener at Arsenal, with a \u00a351million initial fee and a further \u00a33million in add-ons.\n\nSuper-agent Jorge Mendes was central to the agreement that will see Neto become Chelsea's latest signing in another hectic summer. The Blues have already completed deals for Tosin Adarabioyo, Omari Kellyman, Marc Guiu, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, Renato Veiga, Caleb Wiley, Filip Jorgensen and Aaron Anselmino.\n\nNeto had three years remaining on his deal in the Black Country, meaning Wolves were under no immediate pressure to sell. The 24-year-old scored two goals in 20 appearances last season, after suffering from two hamstring injuries, before featuring in all three of Portugal's group matches at Euro 2024.\n\nBoth Chelsea and Tottenham had player-plus-cash offers rejected by Wolves, with Spurs looking to include Oliver Skipp in the deal. However, Wolves ultimately held out for a record fee that eclipses the \u00a353m Manchester City paid for Matheus Nunes last summer.\n\nNeto becomes Wolves' second major sale this summer after defender Max Kilman made a \u00a340m move to West Ham. They have strengthened their squad with the loan signing of striker Jorgen Strand Larsen and the permanent additions of Tommy Doyle, Rodrigo Gomes and Pedro Lima.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Teenage KRC Genk goalkeeper Mike Penders is set to complete his move too, Chelsea bringing in yet another talented shot-stopper after luring Filip Jorgensen away from Villarreal.\n\nBut while Anselmino and Penders are very much signings with the long-term in mind, Pedro Neto will arrive at Stamford Bridge with the idea of immediately slotting into Maresca's first XI.\n\nThe 24-year-old speed-demon has spent the last five years at Wolverhampton Wanderers, joining from Lazio back in 2019.\n\nPedro Neto has blossomed into one of the Premier League's most fearsome wingers when fully fit since then, providing 11 assists in all competitions last season.\n\nIt emerged on Friday that Chelsea were closing in on a bolt-from-the-blue deal for Wolves' number seven.\n\nSources at the Molineux outfit have now confirmed to HITC that the fee will be \u00a354 million. As such, Neto will be the most expensive signing Chelsea have made this year, overtaking the fee they paid top-flight newcomers Leicester City to reunite Maresca with Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall.\n\nHITC can also reveal that Neto is set to undergo a medical at Chelsea imminently. The two-time European Champions hope to officially confirm the signing by Monday.\n\nA rather old-school winger who loves to race by the byline and whip crosses into the box with his favoured left boot, Neto will offer something different to Chelsea's attack.\n\nA new dimension, alongside a host of inverted widemen like Raheem Sterling, Noni Madueke and talisman Cole Palmer. What Neto's arrival means for Sterling and Madueke - not to mention the inconsistent Mykhaylo Mudryk - remains to be seen.\n\nThere will be some Chelsea supporters concerned, however, about Neto's worrisome injury record.\n\nHe missed four months of the 2023/24 campaign with a recurring hamstring issue. In total, since moving to England from Italy, Neto has been unavailable for no fewer than 112 matches.\n\nBut when he is free from those injury issues, Neto is the sort of game-changing forward capable of turning any match on it's head.\n\nSky Sports pundit Jamie Redknapp labelled Neto a 'world-class player' back in 2023.\n\nHis fearsome start to last season, meanwhile, had Wolves boss Gary O'Neil raving about the talent and work-rate of a player who, HITC understands, was also on the radars of Arsenal and Liverpool.\n\nMan City have also looked at him with Julian Alvarez agreeing an \u00a380 million move to Atletico Madrid.\n\n\"He has been absolutely incredible for the six or seven weeks I have been here,\" O'Neil told the BBC after Neto scored a fine goal against Luton Town last September.\n\nThat, largely due to those long spells on the sidelines, was Neto's first top-flight goal of the calendar year.\n\n\"His work rate, the way he trains, playing within the shape and structure and taking information on board...\" O'Neil added.\n\n\"He is incredibly talented and physically very gifted as well.\"\n\nWolves, at least, have Rodrigo Gomes ready to step up and potentially help offset Neto's departure. The \u00a312.7 million signing from Braga shares many similarities with the Chelsea-bound forward, and has dazzled during pre-season.", "source": {"uri": "hitc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HITC"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dan_owen@hitc.com", "name": "Dan Owen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Neto", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pedro Neto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzo_Maresca", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Enzo Maresca"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K.R.C._Genk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "K.R.C.

Chelsea have reportedly agreed a \u20ac60m deal with Wolves to sign Portuguese winger Pedro Neto. The deal, which was thought to have been agreed this Friday, is expected to be broken up into an initial \u20ac56m payment plus around \u20ac4m in add-ons, with the player himself understood to be travelling to London for a medical. Neto has also been of interest to Arsenal and Tottenham over the past 12 months. He has a current market value of \u20ac55m.\n\nThe 25 year old endured another injury hit campaign for Wolves last season, but did manage to register 11 assists and score three goals in 24 appearances. Neto has missed over 100 games through injury since 2021. The Portuguese winger, who has been capped 10 times by his country and was named in their Euro 2024 squad, will rival the likes of Cole Palmer, Noni Madueke, Mykhailo Mudryk and Raheem Sterling as wide options for Chelsea ahead of the new season. With the player being left-footed his more natural position could be argued to be off the right-wing, where Palmer shone last campaign.\n\nNeto would become Chelsea's ninth summer signing - with Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall (\u20ac35.4m), Filip Jorgensen (\u20ac24.5m), Omari Kellyman (\u20ac22.5m), Aaron Anselmino (\u20ac16.5m), Renato Veiga (\u20ac14m), Caleb Wiley (\u20ac10.1m), Marc Guiu (\u20ac6m) and Tosin Adarabioyo (free) already having been brought in. That means the Blues spending, should the \u20ac60m signing of Neto be confirmed, would go to \u20ac153.6m.

Neto has been on the radar of the Premier League's big spenders over the last five years since arriving at Wolves, although his injury record has limited his impact.\n\nArsenal had previously had their sights on Neto, two seasons ago, but Wolves were in a strong position with their player having signed a long-term contract until 2027 and the club having no intention to sell.\n\nHis stock has risen even further since with his displays last season when he recorded nine assists. He has long been tipped as the next Wolves player to move onto a bigger club after Matheus Nunes to City last summer and Liverpool landing Diogo Jota.\n\nChelsea have shaped their squad for the new season with Conor Gallagher agreeing to join Atletico Madrid for \u00a333.7 million, while Romelu Lukaku is poised to leave the club for the right offer.\n\nChelsea have informed Napoli that they want the full \u00a337.8 million clause in Lukaku's contract met and are currently not interested in a loan.

According to transfer insider Romano, the Blues firstly reached an agreement with his agent, Jorge Mendes, over the signing, before Wolves agreed to sell the winger.\n\nEarlier reports priced him at \u00a360million, but Romano states that the entire fee will be closer to \u00a354million.\n\nDespite there having been essentially no links between them and Neto, Romano states the Wolves man, who bagged three goals and 11 assists in all competitions last season, emerged as 'top of the list' for a new winger.\n\nMORE ON CHELSEA FROM F365\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Ranking Chelsea academy departees by club regret as Gallagher nears Atletico\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Samu Omorodion for Conor Gallagher should be the final straw for Chelsea fans\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Man Utd win title with Arsenal Lynx disaster last -

Romano's report states that Chelsea nearly met Wolves' internal valuation of the player, trigging their willingness to sell.\n\nAt 24 years old, Neto has been one of the Premier League's most productive chance providers from the wing in the past few years, with only injuries holding him back. According to Fbref's data, Neto contributed more than an assist every other match in the past year, which puts him in the 99th percentile amongst wingers in Europe.\n\nMORE: All the latest Chelsea news | Premier League schedule for 2024/25 | Latest Premier League top scorer rankings\n\nNeto is a prolific distributor from wide areas, producing 6.83 crosses per 90 minutes, putting him in the 94th percentile amongst European-based wingers. He can also progress the ball forward effectively, with 3.86 carries into the final third putting him in the 96th percentile.\n\nThere are two big question marks surrounding his arrival at Stamford Bridge. First, Chelesa's chance creation was already in the Premier League's top five last season as they bagged 77 goals on 80.88 xG according to UnderStat.com. The squad is bursting at the seams with wingers who create chances but don't score them, as Noni Madueke, Mykhaylo Mudrik, and Raheem Sterling already in the mix. Finishing was a larger concern, as Nicolas Jackson was poor in front of net and new arrival Marc Guiu is still just 18 years old.\n\nThen, there's Neto's lengthy injury history to worry about. The Portuguese international has missed an incredible 112 games since joining Wolves in the summer of 2019 with various injuries, including two different absences last season both due to hamstring issues. It means that Neto has played in under 63% of Wolves' matches since he joined the club. Neto has also made just 10 international appearances since debuting for Portugal four years ago, while being unavailable due to injury in 23 others.\n\nIt's a significant risk, but one with strong upside if Chelsea can manage to keep him on the pitch effectively.

Neto is set to undergo a medical soon ahead of completing a move that seemingly came out of nowhere.\n\nHowever, as with most transfers, that is not the case.

The Portuguese winger was a menace on the counter-attack for Wolves and really put the Blues to the sword on that particular day.\n\nChelsea have been after a winger all summer-long. They were in negotiations with Crystal Palace for around a month as they looked to sign Michael Olise but pulled out of the deal due to the Frenchman's wage demands. Olise has since signed for Bayern Munich.\n\nREAD MORE: Chelsea set to seal sensational tenth summer signing after huge \u00a351m transfer agreement\n\nREAD MORE: Raheem Sterling makes Enzo Maresca and Chelsea prediction after Mauricio Pochettino admission\n\nNico Williams from Athletic Bilbao is another winger the Blues have looked at but again, his wage demands are deemed as too extortionate.

Wolves signed Neto from Lazio for \u00a318 million in 2019.\n\nThe 24-year-old had been linked with a move to Arsenal this summer, with Mikel Arteta seeking competition for Bukayo Saka on the right side of attack.\n\nThe chase was never likely to be an easy one, with Liverpool and Manchester City both credited with an interest.\n\nBut Chelsea have beaten all three teams to the deal, with The Athletic reporting that Neto will undergo a medical at Cobham before finalising his move to Stamford Bridge.\n\nIt is a blow to Arteta, who has completed two permanent signings this summer in the form of goalkeeper David Raya - whose loan deal from Brentford was turned into a permanent one - and defender Riccardo Calafiori.\n\nNow, Gunners fans have a theory on who Arsenal might go for next - Chelsea winger Mykhailo Mudryk.\n\nChelsea beat Arsenal to the signing of Mudryk in January 2023, with Shakhtar Donetsk's president confirming the Blues submitted a stronger offer.\n\nThe Ukrainian signed a seven-year contract at Stamford Bridge, but struggled for form during his first 12 months at the club.\n\nHe began to show glimpses of what he was capable of under Mauricio Pochettino towards the end of the campaign, but it remains to be seen whether yet another managerial change - and the signing of Neto - will stunt that progress.\n\nOne fan wrote on Twitter: \"This is just a hunch, but I do wonder with Neto going to Chelsea, if we will go for Mudryk. Clearly is loved a lot at Arsenal, for how much we were willing to push the boat for him.\"\n\nA second said: \"Would be crazy if Arteta pushes for Arsenal to sign Mudryk on a reduced fee. You can feel it in the air.\"\n\nAnd a third stated: \"Arsenal should go for Mudryk at \u00a330 million, nothing more. There is still a player there.\"", "source": {"uri": "sportbible.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.sportbible.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Neto", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pedro Neto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikel_Arteta", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mikel Arteta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.S._Lazio", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S.S.

Neto has also been of interest to Tottenham this summer.\n\nNeto had an excellent season for Wolves last season, scoring three goals and registering 11 assists in an injury-hit campaign which saw him miss three months of the season with two different hamstring blows.\n\nThe Portuguese winger, who has been capped 10 times by his country and was named in their Euro 2024 squad, is set to join Cole Palmer, Noni Madueke, Mykhailo Mudryk and Raheem Sterling as wide options ahead of the new season.\n\nNeto would become Chelsea's ninth summer signing - with Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, Filip Jorgensen, Omari Kellyman, Aaron Anselmino, Renato Veiga, Caleb Wiley, Marc Guiu and Tosin Adarabioyo adding to Enzo Maresca's squad for the new season.\n\nThe Blues are also set to sign Atletico Madrid striker Samu Omorodion in a \u00a334.5m deal, with midfielder Conor Gallagher set to move in the opposite direction in a separate \u00a336m transfer.\n\nChelsea have also held an interest in Celtic midfielder Matt O'Riley as a potential replacement for Gallagher.\n\nIf Maresca is going to build his Chelsea team in a similar mould to Pep Guardiola at Man City and Mikel Arteta at Arsenal, then Neto is a must-buy.\n\nBoth Guardiola and Arteta rely on \"one-on-one explorers\" down the flanks - Bukayo Saka, Jeremy Doku, Gabriel Martinelli and Jack Grealish spring to mind - and even over an injury-hit spell at Wolves, Neto has proven to be one of the best-attacking wingers in the Premier League in individual running battles.\n\nLast season, Gary O'Neil took the shackles off Neto. \"Don't turn it down, let's go every single time. Don't care if you lose it, test him. Let's go,\" said O'Neil last season when asked about his individual instructions to the Portuguese winger.\n\nAnd Neto obliged. The 24-year-old was constantly involved in one-on-one battles last season but most crucially, there was end product too. Only Kevin De Bruyne averaged more assists per 90 minutes than Neto, who has the luxury of being equally effective on either flank.\n\nWith Mudryk, Madueke and Sterling also capable of one-on-one effectiveness, Chelsea look like they have an array of wingers to complement the aggressive style of play Maresca wants.\n\nMiserable pre-season and 44 players - Maresca's problems stack up\n\nThe approach of a new Premier League season often brings hope, optimism and excitement. But in Chelsea's case, is it already time to worry?\n\nIt may only be pre-season but just one win from their five friendlies in the USA will not have been the start Maresca, preparing for his first campaign as a top-flight head coach, was searching for.\n\nThe Italian named strong sides in those games yet saw his new team concede 12 goals. The visit of Inter Milan - the runaway Serie A winners last season - in Chelsea's final pre-season match on Sunday is a daunting prospect.\n\nAfter guiding Leicester to the Championship title in his only full season as a head coach, Maresca has been thrown into the deep end at Stamford Bridge.\n\nThe performances have been as disappointing as the results, with Chelsea's haphazard attempts to build play from the back contributing to a number of their opponents' goals.\n\nOff the pitch, Maresca had to reintegrate Enzo Fernandez into Chelsea's dressing room following the racist video he posted on social media, while fans' favourite Gallagher is headed for the exit door as the Blues' sporting directors continue their youth-orientated overhaul of the squad.\n\nYet another busy summer means Chelsea's own website lists 44 players among their first-team squad. But if Maresca is hoping for some respite after a tumultuous pre-season, he'll be disappointed - Manchester City are the opponents for their Premier League opener, live on Sky Sports on August 18.\n\nBut who will be part of the squad to face the champions? Sky Sports tries to provide some clarity - and you can cast your vote too...\n\nRead Joe Shread's full feature and have your say on the Chelsea squad here.\n\nWhen does the summer transfer window open and close?\n\nThe 2024 summer transfer window officially closes on August 30 at 11pm UK time in the Premier League and 11.30pm in Scotland.\n\nThe Premier League has brought forward Deadline Day to link up with the other major leagues in Europe. The closing dates were set following discussions with the leagues in England, Germany, Italy, Spain and France.", "source": {"uri": "skysports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SkySports"},

Neto is expected to complete his medical in London shortly ahead of the move to Stamford Bridge.\n\nThe approach by Chelsea for the winger has come somewhat out of the blue considering the wide areas are not considered to be particularly desperate areas for strengthening. Last season, Neto bagged nine assists in 20 Premier League appearances but his momentum was cut short twice due to two serious hamstring injuries.\n\nWhile Neto has been a star for Wolves, his boss recently told the Express and Star podcast that he would not stand in Neto's way should a 'massive bid' be made for the forward - hinting the Molineux outfit must be rather pleased with the fee they are getting for the winger. \"I don't feel either way about it. I know how good he is and how well he would do at a big club but I want our team here to be successful so I'm hoping that he stays,\" O'Neil explained, speaking at the end of July.\n\n\"There's nothing going on at this moment from anybody. He's in a good spot. We're all grown-ups and we know this could change very quickly.\n\n\"If a massive bid comes in from a top club, nobody is going to stand in his way. But it's still my duty, to him and everybody, to make sure he's ready to play for us.\n\nREAD MORE: Chelsea set to seal sensational tenth signing\n\nREAD MORE: Guardiola's Neto verdict vindicates Chelsea plan\n\n\"I'm confident that he will be here because we haven't had anything really that makes the club think that he won't be. But we know lots of business can be done late, even up to the last couple of hours. So until the windows closed, there's always a chance either way.\"\n\nWhile O'Neil does not want to stand in the way of a player's development, he did stress that a replacement must be lined up before Neto's departure can be given the green light. \"We were aware of the Max Kilman (to West Ham) stuff really early,\" he added.\n\n\"Although it took some time to be concluded, we were in a position where we felt it would get done so we were able to do some bits before. With the financial situation, sometimes we have to wait for it to be done to get others.\n\n\"That's the key with anyone that leaves, might be Pedro or anyone, if it's with one minute to go in the window and we can't replace them, he won't be able to go. If anyone's thinking of nicking our best players, we're not going to let people leave unless we have good replacements that we can get in to help us.\"", "source": {"uri": "football.london", "dataType": "news", "title": "footballlondon"}, "authors": [{"uri": "josh_holland@football.london", "name": "Josh Holland", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "jack_flintham@football.london", "name": "Jack Flintham", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Neto", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pedro Neto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_O'Neil", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gary O'Neil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molineux_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Molineux Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamford_Bridge_(stadium)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stamford Bridge (stadium)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Express_&_Star", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Express & Star"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Kilman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Max Kilman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i2-prod.football.london/incoming/article29710668.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-1709917629.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9804496", "eventUri": "eng-9804496", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

Six of those - Filip Joergensen, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, Marc Guiu, Omari Kellyman, Renato Veiga and Tosin Adarabioyo - have selected their new numbers, with Levi Colwill and Wesley Fofana also changing theirs.\n\nThat leaves few numbers for new signings, with only three from 1-30 available.

Neto is not an out-and-out No.9, but neither were Khalid Boulahrouz or Steve Sidwell, and the winger previously wore the number in 2018 while in Lazio's under-19s team when he primarily played through the middle.\n\nHowever, he has predominantly worn the number seven on his shirt during his time at Wolves, aside from having the No. 11 on his back for two under-21s matches last year while returning from injury. Neto has also worn those traditional numbers for a wide player for Portugal, the latter for their under-17s, while seven has been his shirt of choice in the senior side.\n\nHe has also worn 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 23 and 25, but all of those are unavailable at Chelsea. After breaking through at Braga, the youngster wore No. 71 in their B team and kept it into the first team. That could be an option; only Charlie Webster has worn that number before, during the 2021/22 season.\n\nBut the best bet is that Neto will take No. 30, which he chose after signing for Lazio and has been available at Chelsea since last summer after Carney Chukwuemeka changed to 17.\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

The Portuguese is set to undergo a medical at Stamford Bridge and will join Tosin Adarabioyo, Marc Guiu, Caleb Wiley, Renato Veiga, Aaron Anselmino, Omari Kellyman, Filip Jorgensen and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall as the new arrivals at the club so far this summer.\n\nThe transfer spend has led to some questions being asked over how Chelsea can continue to splash out on transfer fees, given the Premier League's Profitability and Sustainability Rules (PSRs).\n\nOur Business of Football writer Dave Powell has explained how it all works, as he said: \"Chelsea continue to play the long game when it comes to their financial position and PSR.\n\n\"The sale of tangible assets such as the hotels at Stamford Bridge, allied with the sale of a number of players for high profit mean that they just avoided a PSR problem with the Premier League for the most recently published financial period, and with the sale of the women's team to a related entity, they have likely done enough to remain PSR compliant for 2023/24.\n\n\"But with every Chelsea addition comes the questions around how they are able to afford such spending.\n\nREAD MORE: Wolves stance on Pedro Neto to Chelsea transfer revealed after 'massive bid' verdict delivered\n\nREAD MORE: Pep Guardiola's five-word Pedro Neto verdict vindicates Chelsea transfer plan\n\n\"It is a calculated bet for Chelsea, but a risky one nonetheless. They know they need to be back in the riches of the Champions League soon, and that they need the Enzo Maresca project to work. They cannot have major tumult on the player side given money invested in putting together the squad.\n\n\"Should the Pedro Neto deal go through for a guaranteed \u00a351.4m plus add-ons, then it would take Chelsea's spending to \u00a3162m having paid money for Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, Filip Jorgensen, Omari Kellyman, Renato Veiga, Aaron Anselmino, Caleb Wiley, and Marc Guiu. Should they land Samu Omorodion then that would take that sum to around \u00a3194m.\n\n\"But Chelsea are seeing this as a play for the long run, and they know that from an accounting standpoint the money that they are set to bring in from the sales of Ian Maatsen, Lewis Hall, Omari Hutchinson, and Conor Gallagher, when that deal is done, will bring in \u00a3119m in profit for the Stamford Bridge club. There have also been high-profile departures of high-earning players such as Thiago Silva and Hakim Ziyech that will offset some of the bump in payroll that will arrive.\n\n\"To look at it from Chelsea's point of view, say that the Omorodion deal gets done as well as Neto, then using the five-year maximum period that contracts can be amortised over, Chelsea would be adding around \u00a338.5m per annum on to their amortisation costs, which is how transfers are accounted for. They would likely have a lot of transfer payables which could impact cash flow, but that can be aided by either owner funding or external financing.\n\n\"But with \u00a3119m landing onto their accounts in pure accounting profit due to the players leaving for money all being academy graduates, Chelsea will have breathing space when it comes to finding ways to generate additional revenue in other areas, and they will be hoping that the investment, while a risk, allows for qualification for the Champions League in 2025, something that could yield more than \u00a3100m with a good run in an expanded competition.\n\n\"It is a gamble, but it is one Chelsea feel that they can afford due to the huge amount of profit they have been able to generate through graduate sales.\"\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

transfer news: Wolves 'rejected' bid for Neto before Chelsea deal", "body": "you have updates\n\nTottenham Hotspur reportedly attempted to sign Wolverhampton Wanderers winger Pedro Neto before a deal was agreed with Chelsea.\n\nDespite suffering a number of injuries over recent seasons, Neto has been frequently linked with a transfer to a bigger club in the Premier League.\n\nThat is a consequence of his impact when fit, with two goals and nine assists coming from just 20 outings during the 2023-24 campaign.\n\nWolves have been in no rush to cash in on their most prized asset, yet widespread reports emerged on Friday afternoon that Chelsea would be signing the Portugal international.\n\nThe West Londoners have allegedly agreed to pay Wolves a fee of almost \u00a354m, including add-ons, for the playmaker, who will now undergo a medical.\n\nHowever, it could have seemingly been a different story had Spurs succeeded with their own offer for Neto in recent days.\n\nSpurs made part-exchange bid\n\nAccording to the Express & Star, Spurs proposed a player-plus-cash deal for Neto that was ultimately rejected.\n\nWolves were allegedly presented with the opportunity to sign midfielder Oliver Skipp as part of the discussions that were held between the relevant parties.\n\nInstead, officials at the West Midlands outfit opted against substantially reducing the fee that they would recoup and proceeded with a club-record sale with Chelsea.\n\nThere is no indication as to whether Skipp would have accepted a move to Molineux, although he remains down the midfield pecking order at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\n\nWhile Spurs are well stocked for options on the flanks, Neto would have likely got the nod over the likes of Brennan Johnson, Dejan Kulusevski and Timo Werner when fit.\n\nMoney being allocated elsewhere...\n\nDespite having money to spend this summer, it is highly unlikely that Spurs would have splurged well in excess of \u00a3100m on just two players at this stage of the transfer window.\n\nSpurs are now allegedly preparing to sign Bournemouth forward Dominic Solanke in a deal that could be worth \u00a365m, providing that the player's release clause is met.\n\nRather than another winger, Spurs arguably require a player of Solanke's stature down the centre of their frontline having failed to find a suitable alternative to Harry Kane last summer.\n\nbody check tags ::", "source": {"uri": "amp.sportsmole.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "amp.sportsmole.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri": "darren_plant@amp.sportsmole.co.uk", "name":

And sometimes they don't even need a player for that position!\n\nThere is a running 'joke' that Behdad Eghbali and Todd Boehly's transfer shortlist derives from social media rumours and we are totally on board with this being their legitimate philosophy in the market. Banter or not, they definitely have Fabrizio Romano's notifications turned on.\n\nFollowing the Neto 'Here we go!', we have looked at six examples of them buying a player, seemingly because Premier League rivals are interested.\n\nPedro Neto (Hijacked from Arsenal, Man City, Newcastle and Tottenham)\n\nChelsea will reportedly sign Wolves winger Pedro Neto, which has come slightly out of the blue. There has been a tonne of Premier League interest in the Portuguese international with Arsenal, Manchester City and Tottenham reluctant to bite the bullet due to his injury record. Transfer-happy Chelsea have decided it's worth the risk and will apparently be paying Gary O'Neil's side \u00a354million for Neto's services.\n\nWith no disrespect to Wolves intended, we must admit it will be fun to see Neto plying his trade for a bigger club, especially considering so many have been sniffing around in recent years.\n\nThe 24-year-old can play through the middle or on either wing and is very dangerous on his day. Chelsea will be hoping to see his day more frequently than Wolves did, because those injuries have been a real pain. Literally.\n\nWhere does Neto fit in at Chelsea? Cole Palmer has the right nailed down unless Enzo Maresca plans to make him a false-nine/centre-forward or a No. 10. The left is there for the taking and feels like the natural choice with Mykhaylo Mudryk and Raheem Sterling failing to shine. Surely he will play there, even if he was predominantly a right-winger for Wolves. Let's wait and see, I guess.\n\nTosin Adarabioyo (Hijacked from Newcastle)\n\nPoor Newcastle were closing in on the signing of a player in a position in which they desperately need reinforcements before bloody Chelsea swooped in and agreed a deal to sign them. The Magpies were recently left peeved by Eghbali and Boehly's transfer philosophy, missing out on Tosin Adarabioyo on a free transfer.\n\nThey have suffered fitness problems in that position but Chelsea have copious central defenders already at their disposal. Wesley Fofana will be fit for the start of next season and Trevoh Chalobah is arguably better than Tosin. We completely understand the financial logic of signing Tosin for nothing and selling Chalobah for pure profit, but that doesn't mean it can't p*ss us off. Because it has.\n\nNewcastle should absolutely go in for Chalobah if they fail to land Marc Guehi from Crystal Palace. And if they do get Guehi, then Palace should go for Chalobah.\n\nCHELSEA CONTENT FROM LAST SUMMER ON F365\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Is Man City new boy Mateo Kovacic the luckiest footballer alive? What a result he's had here\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Christopher Nkunku has all the tricks to stand out in the Chelsea circus...\n\nMykhaylo Mudryk (Hijacked from Arsenal)\n\nMykhaylo Mudryk to Arsenal was the story of the 2022 January transfer window; those rumours fed our families for months before Chelsea decided they wanted a piece.\n\nThe Gunners have been very reluctant to pay over the odds for players since Mikel Arteta's arrival in 2019 and with Mudryk they came nowhere near to meeting Shakhtar Donetsk's asking price. Chelsea met it at the first attempt, such is their newfound ruthlessness.\n\nArsenal's top transfer target had been taken away from them in the blink of an eye. But they got Leandro Trossard instead for a third of what Chelsea paid for Mudryk. They won.\n\nMarc Cucurella (Hijacked from Man City)\n\nManchester City have tricked Manchester United into buying players before and looking back, they might have pulled the same stunt on Chelsea in Boehly's first summer at Stamford Bridge.\n\nHow would Marc Cucurella have even fitted in this City team? Would he have fallen out of favour by January or been the difference between a treble and quadruple? Could he have been the clutch player against Nathan Jones' side on that November evening? Maybe City would have won the Premier League more comfortably. He would have played left-back at Nottingham Forest, for a start.\n\nAnyway, City's reported interest in Cucurella was thwarted after Chelsea joined the race, spunking more than \u00a360m on the Spaniard when they already had Ben Chilwell as their first-choice left-back/left-wing-back. Lewis Hall and Ian Maatsen - who proved he is good enough at Borussia Dortmund in the second half of 2023/24 and was recently signed by Aston Villa - were also right there.\n\nHindsight is a wonderful thing but Cucurella has flopped at Chelsea and was the first of many rash signings Boehly nabbed from a Premier League rival. At least Euro 2024 showed he is actually a pretty good footballer.\n\nRomeo Lavia and Moises Caicedo (Hijacked from Liverpool)\n\nIt was Liverpool's turn to be left stunned by Chelsea's transfer window brashness last August when the Blues beat them to the signatures of both Moises Caicedo and Romeo Lavia. The former was also linked with Arsenal before they signed Declan Rice but Chelsea's interest was long-standing and they were desperate for a midfield player of that calibre and profile.\n\nHowever, Brighton and Liverpool agreed a fee and Caicedo easily could have moved to Anfield. He was adamant he was going to Chelsea and when they got their fingers out, the Blues made it happen, successfully hijacking the Reds to get someone they desperately needed.\n\nLavia, though? Not so much. Yes, he has great potential. Yes, he proved at Southampton that he can rock it with the big boys in Our League. But this deal felt like another case of Chelsea flexing their financial muscles at the expense of a rival, rather than vastly improving the squad.\n\nAt least young Lavia fits the profile that aligns with Boehly and Eghbali's *genuine* transfer philosophy.\n\nThe Tyler Adams saga is worth a brief mention. Liverpool were also reportedly in for him before Chelsea agreed to sign him from Leeds United. When it became clear they could land Caicedo and Lavia, the Londoners uncharacteristically showed some restraint and backed out of a deal.

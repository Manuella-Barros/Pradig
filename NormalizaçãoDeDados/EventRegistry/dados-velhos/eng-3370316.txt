The dirt road leading to the home was so damaging to vehicles if they did not slow down that it provided those buying drugs ample opportunity to flee into the surrounding woods, the state said in a release.\n\n\"One or two properties with criminal activity can bring down an entire neighborhood and cause innocent residents in the area to live their lives in fear,\" said state Attorney General Denn. \"That's why our office has worked so hard over the last year to target such properties.\"\n\nOTHER CLOSURES: DOJ permanently closes Gold Club outside Wilmington\n\nThe order - granted by a judge on July 7 - banned Frank Lovett, Latasha Lovett, Annette Stevens, Lucy Lovett, Charles Lovett and Taquen Owens from the property and declared the property be shut down for a period of two years, according to the state. The Lovetts came into the property after James Lovett Sr. died and the title to the property passed to his children, according to court documents.\n\nFrank Lovett has pending criminal charges for organized crime and racketeering, drug dealing, conspiracy and possession of drug paraphernalia. Owens, who lived in the property until he was arrested in Sept. 2015, is being held at Sussex Correctional Institution near Georgetown.\n\nTroopers and members of the Kent County Governor's Task Force barricaded the home on August 4 and posted a sign declaring it a criminal nuisance property after escorting occupants out of the home.\n\nFive other properties were also targeted in recent months, including:\n\n1107 Washington Street, New Castle, which involved a home known as \"a den of illicit drug use and prostitution,\" according to the state. The property has since been sold to new owners.16 Defoe Circle, Bear, which police and prosecutors said was \"the site of drug and gun activity and over 50 police calls in the past four years.\" 121 E. Lockwood Street, Middletown, which police said was the \"alleged site of drug dealing and gun activity.\"The Water Lily, 867 N. Broad Street, Middletown, which was a massage parlor where suspected prostitution occurred, the state said.2614 Thatcher Street, Wilmington, which the state said was a drug dealing property.\n\nContact Brittany Horn at (302) 324-2771 or bhorn@delawareonline.com.

If approved, the bump-outs would be part of a larger project to rebuild Main Street in Newark.\n\nIn recent years, bump-outs have been adopted by planners in numerous U.S. cities, including in Philadelphia.\n\nAs part of the Newark project, Main Street between Marrows Road and the CSX freight tracks also will be completely repaved, and its curb ramps rebuilt to comply with standards set by the Americans With Disabilities Act.\n\nDelDOT for years had planned to repave the street as part of its regular maintenance of state roadways, said George LeCates, designer for DelDOT's pavement management team.\n\nThe cost of the project with the bump-outs has not yet been determined, but it is scheduled to begin next May and end in June 2019, he said.\n\nThe year-long construction period irritates some business owners who expressed fear at Tuesday's meeting that potential customers will avoid the Main Street commercial corridor during the work, LeCates said.\n\nIf the project does not include bump-outs, it likely could be completed in the span of a summer, when most University of Delaware students are not on campus, he added.\n\nSTORY: Political duo's Wilmington home faces sheriff's sale\n\nSTORY: Superfund dollars could help Newark water cleanup\n\nEarly in 2017, Newark officials approached the transportation department with the proposal for bump-outs. Because the repaving project already was scheduled, officials decided to combine plans.\n\n\"We put in an application to the Transportation Alternatives Program. It's a grant program administered by DelDOT, and we were awarded the grant up to a million dollars at a four-to-one match,\" Coleman said. \"We would put up $200,000 and get $800,000.\"\n\nNewark and DelDOT will use public feedback to decide on the final plans this fall.\n\nThe proposal likely will be discussed on Monday during a Newark city public works department budget hearing, Coleman said.\n\n\"We're going to price out each option and see what can be done with the money that's available through the grant,\" he said. \"We'll be probably bringing a more detailed proposal to them in the next month or two.\"\n\nAnyone interested in formally commenting should do so in writing. Comments can be mailed to DelDOT, at P.O. Box 778, Dover, DE 19903.\n\nContact Karl Baker at kbaker@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2329.

Operators of such sites insisted they offered games of skill, not gambling. Despite the protests, the services quietly exited the state.\n\nNow all three services are set to return this month thanks to legislation signed into law by Gov. John Carney.\n\nThe legislation legalizes daily online fantasy sports but also hits them with some of the toughest taxes in fees in the nation. Fantasy sports site operators will pay both an $50,000 annual fee and taxes on their gross revenue in the state of either 15.5 percent or the highest current fantasy sports tax rate in the country.\n\nSTORY: Indian River tax increases take seniors by surprise\n\nIn addition, the law added a number of consumer protections, including truth-in-advertising language, the banning of betting on college or amateur sports and the requirement that operators ensure all players are 18 years of age or older.\n\n\"We find that it mirrors legislation across the country,\" Nigel Eccles, CEO of New York-based FanDuel, told The News Journal. \"It ensures that we are protecting player money and ensures only people over 18 join. These are things that we are doing anyway.\"\n\nBoston-based DraftKings, a FanDuel rival, echoed similar sentiments, calling the legislation \"common sense.\"\n\n\"DraftKings is looking forward to returning to Delaware, the 14th state to pass fantasy sports legislation,\" said Tim Parilla, DraftKings' general counsel in a statement. \"We are extremely grateful to Governor Carney and the members of the legislature for their support.\"\n\nBUSINESS: Harvey Hanna to buy former Fisker site, sources say; plans include job creation\n\nThe law returns to Delaware an industry that reached nearly $3 billion in annual revenue last year and could reach as much as $5.3 billion by 2020, according to a study by Juniper Research, a British consumer data group.\n\nBut that number could be conservative. Ellers & Krejcik Gaming of Santa Ana, California, estimates daily fantasy sports revenue could top $8 billion by 2020.\n\nFor daily fantasy sports businesses, returning to a former market is better than expanding into a new one. FanDuel operates in about 40 states across the country but was recently forced out of seven states after Justice Departments raised similar concerns as Delaware.\n\n\"I think it's important to get back to the states where we already operated because we already have customers there,\" he said.\n\nThe timing of daily fantasy sports returning to Delaware could not be better. Late summer gives the operators of such websites time to capitalize on the lucrative NFL season starting in about three weeks.\n\nSTORY: New Rehoboth Mayor Paul Kuhns takes pro-business line\n\nIn fact, Eccles said FanDuel will be using the next few weeks to reach out to its former Delaware customers to get them on board before the NFL season starts.\n\n\"Going live [in Delaware] before the start of football season is absolutely critical for us,\" he said.\n\nDaily fantasy sports companies are not the only ones ramping up activity in Delaware because of this bill. Arlene Simon, executive director of the Delaware Council on Gambling Problems, a nonprofit that helps gambling addicts, is also taking extra steps to deal with daily fantasy sports returning to Delaware.\n\nSimon said the organization has brought in fantasy sports experts to train its counselors on recognizing and helping those who may become addicted to such games. The group will also add a section on fantasy sports to its website.\n\nThere has been a recent uptick in the number of calls that the Delaware Council on Gambling Problems has received to help with fantasy sports addiction, Simon said. She said her group has even received calls from parents asking the organization to reach out to their children.\n\n\"It's not as high as casino or lottery, but we have had a number of cases in recent years of people that have had serious trouble with fantasy sports,\" she said. \"It's mostly younger people.\"\n\nContact Jeff Mordock at (302) 324-2786, on Twitter @JeffMordockTNJ or

The ads will run in both English and Spanish, the campaign said.\n\n\"Four years ago, we were shut down. Stadiums were empty. Trump failed us,\" the narrator says, showing huge sporting arenas with vacant rows in a jab at former President Donald Trump's leadership during the Covid pandemic.\n\n\"But then Joe Biden took over. He reopened the country and got us back on track,\" the ad goes on to say, touting job creation during the Biden administration and highlighting efforts to try to make communities safer from gun violence.\n\n\"Trump talks and talks. Joe Biden gets s--- done,\" it ends, with a superimposed red card over Trump's face and the expletive bleeped out. The commercial is set to air on radio and digital platforms in battlegrounds, as well.\n\n\"Our campaign knows the power of showing up to earn the Latino vote, and today's historic announcement to organize and mobilize around Copa Am\u00e9rica is a perfect example of doing that important work,\" said Biden-Harris 2024 campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez.\n\nShe added, \"Throughout the next few weeks, we will harness the energy of Copa to mobilize and reach the Latino voters who will decide this election in their communities, on the airwaves, and at Copa matches -- all with a simple message: President Biden has had our back for his whole career and is fighting for our community every single day, while Donald Trump has spent every chance he gets fighting for himself, while attacking and failing our community.\"\n\nThe Biden campaign has poured millions of dollars into various ad campaigns in recent months, most recently announcing a $50 million investment highlighting Trump's recent felony conviction. But the race remains very close, including among Latino voters.\n\nAn NBC News poll in January found that the two candidates were virtually tied among Latinos (Trump 42%, Biden 41%), but Biden's approval rating among Latinos had slipped compared to 2020. Biden fared better in a poll from Pew Research in April, in which Biden won 52% of Latino supporters to Trump's 44%.\n\nThroughout the Copa Am\u00e9rica tournament, it will try to take advantage of high-visibility moments around the dozens of games to stand up digital billboards and run ads at bus stops, the official added.\n\nThe campaign will also begin selling campaign swag in the style of classic soccer jerseys.\n\nThe re-election effort will also host watch parties with top surrogates at various campaign offices in battleground states to recruit volunteers. In a first-of-its kind plan, the campaign will also sponsor organizing events at sports bars and restaurants showing the games, starting in Nevada and Arizona.\n\nThe campaign will also offer bilingual toolkits for voters and organizers to host watch parties at home, complete with \"half-time\" and \"cervecita break\" conversation guides, \"to engage their guests around how President Biden is delivering for Latino families compared to Trump's anti-Latino agenda,\" the campaign said Thursday.\n\nCopa Am\u00e9rica is scheduled every four years, but it rarely takes place outside South America. Television viewership in the U.S. could exceed 100 million people, which was the number reached in 2016 when it was last hosted in U.S. stadiums and when it aired on Fox and Univision. The final is likely to be the most-watched Spanish-language TV program of the year ahead of the November election, experts estimate.\n\nThe U.S. men's national team plays its first game Sunday, against Bolivia. Its next match in the group stage is against Panama on June 27, just hours before the first general election debate, both in Atlanta. The Biden campaign plans to organize watch parties around the occasion, hoping people will view both events.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [],

These pop-up events will first take place in key swing states like Arizona and Nevada. The campaign will also host watch parties and plans to give out watch party toolkits for volunteers wanting to host their own.\n\nAccording to a UCLA study, Latino voters showed a 30.9% increase in voter turnout from the 2016 to 2020 presidential elections, with around 16.6 million Latino voters nationwide. The study also found that Latino voters supported Biden by wide margins across the country, consistent with those won by Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012.\n\nWhile numbers Latino voters seemed to swing left in 2020, a poll from advocacy group Voto Latino and polling firm Greenberg Quinlan Rosner projected one-fifth of Latino voters would prefer a third-party candidate over Biden or Trump.\n\nThe polling also found that in a head-to-head matchup among swing-state Latinos, Biden leads Trump 59% to 39%.\n\n\"Most prognosticators suggest that 2024 will be a pure turnout election. Both campaigns are approaching the race as if there are few truly undecided voters between Biden and Trump, so the winner will be whoever best turns out his base,\" President and Chief Executive Officer of Voto Latino Maria Teresa Kumar said in her USA Today Op-ed.\n\nThe Biden-Harris 2024 campaign will host organizing events surrounding the tournament with hopes of engaging voters ahead of November.\n\nCopa Am\u00e9rica 2024 kicks off Thursday night as defending champion Argentina takes on Canada at Mercedes Benz Stadium in Atlanta. Messi and Argentina will fight to be back-to-back Copa Am\u00e9rica champs.\n\nThe tournament kicked off in 1916 and is the oldest international soccer tournament in the world.

Despite economists saying most traditional indicators are actually quite rosy, polling indicates voters disagree with that sentiment.\n\nIn the back half of the ad, a ref's whistle blares and Trump is handed a red card. For the pre-'90s-kid crowd who're less fluent in soccer lingo, that's what the zebras raise in the air when they see an ejection-worthy penalty \u00e0 la targeting in American football.\n\nThe closing line is reminiscent of the Trans Am-waxing Uncle Joe of The Onion fame: \"Trump talks and talks. Joe Biden gets shit done.\"\n\nThe ad flight coincides with the kickoff of Copa Am\u00e9rica, the top tourney for men's soccer national teams in the Western Hemisphere and an event expected to draw as many as 200 million American eyeballs, many of which belong to Hispanic voters. A Biden-Harris news release noted that the U.S. is home to 60 million-plus fans of the Mexican national team El Tri. The campaign also pointed to the success of the Apple+ show Ted Lasso as evidence the soccer bloc is a demo worth tapping into.\n\n\"Our campaign knows the power of showing up to earn the Latino vote, and today's historic announcement to organize and mobilize around Copa Am\u00e9rica is a perfect example of doing that important work,\" said Biden-Harris 2024 Campaign Manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez.\n\n\"Throughout the next few weeks, we will harness the energy of Copa to mobilize and reach the Latino voters who will decide this election in their communities, on the airwaves, and at Copa matches -- all with a simple message: President Biden has had our back for his whole career and is fighting for our community every single day, while Donald Trump has spent every chance he gets fighting for himself, while attacking and failing our community.\"\n\nCoincidentally, the ad is also rolling out at a time when Biden-Harris 2024 could use a goal or two in the fight for Hispanic voters. Democrats used to have the bloc on lock more so than Argentina's national team had the Copa Am\u00e9rica (they've got the most tourney wins at 15), but recent elections show some slices of the Hispanic electorate are flocking away from the blue team.\n\nThere's evidence of that in Florida especially, where the past two cycles have seen the GOP flip the script among Hispanic voters, especially Cuban American and Venezuelan American voters, with whom Republicans' hard-line rhetoric on those dictatorial regimes resonates.\n\nWhile Biden-Harris has better odds of reversing the trend than Team USA has of winning the cup this year (they're at +1200 for those looking for a risky bet), recent polling doesn't paint a pretty picture. An Equis poll released earlier this week shows more Hispanic voters nationwide think Trump is the better candidate on immigration issues, 41%-38%, while a whopping 72% say they agree (either \"very\" or \"somewhat\") with the statement, \"Biden and Democrats make promises about immigration reform during the campaign but fail to deliver once they have won.\"\n\n_____\n\nBiden-Harris 2024 isn't the only campaign looking to woo Copa Am\u00e9rica viewers.\n\nU.S. Sen. Rick Scott launched a Spanish-language soccer-themed ad for his re-election campaign alongside the tournament's kickoff.\n\nThe ad, which was part of a statewide six-figure buy, depicts a soccer match in which Scott, part of the \"Liberty\" team, is being compared to his opponent, Democratic former U.S. Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell.\n\nThe ad highlights Scott's accomplishments as Florida Governor, including being the first Governor to reduce state debt in 20 years, over 100 tax cuts that saved taxpayers nearly $10 billion and working with the Legislature to create more jobs.\n\nThe ad compares these achievements to Murarsel-Powell, listed as the captain of \"The Socialists\" team, saying that she is a representation of the extreme left, an ally to socialism and alleges she's a fan of tax increases and open borders.\n\n\"There are families from all over Latin America who came to Florida fleeing socialism and know all too well what is at stake in this race,\" the ad says.\n\n\"Sen. Scott has been clear that socialism has no place in America. He remains committed to standing with every Floridian who wants a freer and more prosperous future, while Socialist Debbie's record in Congress has made it clear which 'squad' she is on. Voters rejected her back then and will do so again this November.\"\n\nThe ad will run during every game of the Copa Am\u00e9rica tournament on TV and digital platforms.\n\nIn recent polling from Florida Atlantic University, Scott leads Murarsel-Powell by 2 percentage points, a significant drop from the 16-point lead he held last month. Murarsel-Powell got a confidence boost from the favorable poll, saying that it shows that she can go the distance in a head-to-head with Scott.\n\n-- \"'The Daily Show' going live with Jon Stewart at political conventions\" via Rick Porter of The Hollywood Reporter\n\n-- \"These 25 rainbow-flag waving companies donated $18M to anti-gay politicians since the last election\" via Judd Legum, Tesnim Zekeria and Rebecca Crosby of Popular Information\n\n-- \"Mucarsel-Powell makes her case for the U.S. Senate in Tampa\" via Mitch Perry of the Florida Phoenix\n\n-- \"DeSantis' vetoes anger the arts community as state funding gets wiped out\" via Gabrielle Russon of Florida Politics\n\n-- \"Prince's 'Purple Rain' is being adapted for the stage. It's not as easy as you'd think\" via David Browne of Rolling Stone\n\n\"This isn't like that. ... it just kind of smacks of, I don't know, underhandedness coming at the last minute.\"\n\nLook to your left, then look to your right. If you see one of these people at your happy hour haunt, flag down the bartender and put one of these on your tab. Recipes included, just in case the Cocktail Codex fell into the well.\n\nDemocrats blasted U.S. Sen. Scott as a hypocrite for saying he supported in vitro fertilization during a Thursday news conference. While the giant inflatable IUD was the star of the show, the cocktail world hasn't embraced non-hormonal birth control just yet so Florida's junior Senator will have to settle for a Jagged Little Pill instead.\n\nPlayhouses and troupes across the state are feeling the pain after the Governor poured red ink on state funding for the arts. Help them keep their chins up with a Show Must Go On.\n\nState Attorney Brian Kramer announced he wouldn't bite on the questionable and deeply flawed investigation into Jacksonville dentist Howard Fetner. That earns him a Bloody Tooth -- the drinkable one, not the kind that requires an emergency trip to your local DDS.\n\nThe biggest soccer tournament in the western hemisphere kicks off this weekend as the Copa America opens in the United States for the second time. The United States Men's National Team opens group play on Sunday against Bolivia in Group C (6 p.m. ET, Fox).\n\nThe Copa America was also held in the United States in 2016. The event is typically held in South America.\n\nThe USMNT warmed up for the Copa America with friendlies against Colombia and Brazil, losing to Colombia 5-1 before earning the first draw against Brazil in team history.\n\nThe matchup against Bolivia will be held at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nThe U.S. and Bolivia have met eight times since 1993, with each side winning two matches and drawing the remaining four. Sunday's matchup marks the second meeting in the Copa America. In 1995, the U.S. lost to Bolivia 1-0 in Uruguay.\n\nThe USMNT is ranked 11th in the FIFA World Rankings. Bolivia is ranked 85th and tuned up for the Copa America with losses to Mexico, Ecuador and Colombia. Bolivia won the Copa America title in 1963.\n\nAmong the Americans to watch is captain Christian Pulisic, who scored the only goal of the match against Brazil. Pulisic scored 12 goals and assisted on eight more with AC Milan of the Italian Serie A. He has scored 29 goals in 68 caps for the USMNT since making his debut in 2016. His first goal came in a friendly against Bolivia, when he became the youngest player to score for the USMNT in the modern era.", "source": {"uri": "floridapolitics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Florida Politics - Campaigns & Elections.

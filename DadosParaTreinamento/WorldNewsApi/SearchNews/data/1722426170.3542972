{"id": 243301258, "title": "Retired SNP MP Douglas Chapman\u2019s unfinished business on Rosyth-Europe ferry", "text": "Retired SNP MP Douglas Chapman says he has unfinished business over the stalled project to reintroduce a ferry between Rosyth and Europe. The outgoing Dunfermline nationalist has been a vocal supporter of the plans for a freight and passenger link between Fife and the continent. But the scheme \u2013 which it was hoped would be up and running by now \u2013 has hit stumbling blocks since neither Holyrood or Westminster have coughed up funding. In January, we revealed the programme needed between just \u00a35 and \u00a310 million to get it up and running. That\u2019s been hugely disappointing for ferry operators DFDS, who have been behind the project. Mr Chapman says he shares their frustration as he makes his exit from parliament after representing Dunfermline and West Fife for nine years. \u201cIt\u2019s unfinished business as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d he says. \u201cThe last few years have been exceptionally frustrating.\u201d Mr Chapman is worried DFDS will only tolerate delays so long before giving up on the scheme, despite the company\u2019s enthusiasm. He says: \u201cIt\u2019s got a certain shelf-life before they run out of patience and maybe turn their attention to other projects.\u201d But he is still hopeful, adding: \u201cI still remain confident that it will happen, because it makes economic sense. \u201cI\u2019m hoping we can find some new funding, if there\u2019s a change of government in London.\u201d The departing Dunfermline MP blames Westminster for funding obstacles, saying: \u201cHad we not had years of austerity, this is something the SNP government would be keen to support.\u201d But budgets to construct two long-delayed CalMac ferries have soared well past \u00a3300 million. Earlier this year Deputy First Minister Kate Forbes said her party should keep the project alive, before she returned to government. Ptarmigan Shipping director Derek Sloan says the delays were frustrating given the proposals have already \u201ccome so far\u201d. \u201cIf something\u2019s not done in the near future this opportunity will probably be lost,\u201d he warns. He adds: \u201cI feel sorry for Douglas, because he\u2019s put a lot of effort in trying to get the project high up the agenda.\u201d A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: \u201cWe\u2019ve always made clear our support for the development of Scotland\u2019s ports and the potential for new direct freight and passenger ferry services linking Scotland to Europe. \u201cThe Scottish Government cannot subsidise routes in ways which would be anti-competitive beyond considering the availability of limited grant funding opportunities for freight initiatives. \u201cWe\u2019ve been clear throughout our discussions that any new service will be required to be delivered on a commercial basis.\u201d Mid Scotland and Fife Tory MSP Murdo Fraser said: \u201cEveryone is keen to see direct ferry routes restored from Fife to Europe, so it is deeply disappointing to see this former SNP MP reach for the usual tactic of blaming Westminster.\u201d Reflecting on his Westminster career, Mr Chapman believes he has plenty to be proud of as he leaves office \u2013 particularly constituency work he has done. The former Dunfermline MP \u2013 who was at the centre of an apparent plot to oust him before he retired \u2013 has mostly taken a backseat from campaigning. He still expects his party to do well on July 4, saying: \u201cI think the SNP will probably do better than some of the polls are predicting.\u201d Mr Chapman tells us he has been enjoying his \u201cfreedom and independence\u201d out of office \u2013 joking \u201cmaybe that\u2019ll happen for Scotland one day\u201d. During his time as an MP Mr Chapman briefly served as the SNP\u2019s treasurer. He quit in 2021, citing a lack of necessary information to do the job properly. Since then former SNP chief Peter Murrell \u2013 married to Nicola Sturgeon \u2013 has been charged by police over a long-running investigation into party finances. On his time in the treasurer role, Mr Chapman says: \u201cIt seems a long time ago now.\u201d The outgoing MP, aged 69, doesn\u2019t expect to be back in parliament again \u2013 and says he\u2019s ready to move on from Westminster. But pressed on an unlikely return for the Holyrood election in 2026, he says: \u201cIt\u2019s not part of my plans. But you never say never.\u201d", "summary": "Plans to introduce a passenger link between Fife and Dunkirk are on hold - to the frustration of Mr Chapman.", "url": "https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/politics/5025403/snp-douglas-chapman-rosyth-ferry/", "image": "https://www.thecourier.co.uk/thecourier/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2021/05/DOUGLAS-CHAPMAN-4.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 04:00:15", "author": "Justin Bowie", "authors": ["Justin Bowie"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.44}

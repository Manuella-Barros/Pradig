The group is among those that have rapidly pushed into the increasingly lucrative migrant smuggling industry amid a historic wave of migration to the U.S.\n\nThe cartel is based in the southern state of Guerrero and is often known as \"The New Michoacan Family,\" to distinguish it from an older gang that was largely expelled from the western state of Michoacan in the mid-2010s.\n\nIn 2022, the Biden administration sanctioned leaders of the cartel, known as the Hurtado brothers, for manufacturing \"rainbow\" fentanyl pills, which the US Treasury Department said was \"part of a deliberate effort to drive addiction amongst kids.\"\n\nYellen\u00b4s trip also comes after President Joe Biden signed into law the FEND off Fentanyl Act as part of the supplemental spending package signed in April, which among other things, declares that the international trafficking of fentanyl is a national emergency.\n\nFentanyl, a powerful opioid, is the deadliest drug in the U.S. today. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that drug overdose deaths in the U.S. have increased more than sevenfold from 2015 to 2021.\n\nMexico and China are the primary sources of fentanyl and fentanyl-related substances trafficked directly into the U.S., according to the Drug Enforcement Administration, which is tasked with combating illicit drug trafficking. Nearly all the precursor chemicals that are needed to make fentanyl come from China.\n\nJanetsky contributed to this report from Mexico City.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

Yellen also introduced measures to help banks report suspicious transactions linked to fentanyl precursors from China.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Thursday announced new sanctions on leaders of a Mexican drug cartel involved in trafficking fentanyl and its pre-cursor chemicals into the U.S. as part of a broader push to try to stem the flow of the deadly synthetic opioid. Yellen announced the sanctions against eight leaders of the La Nueva Familia Michoacana cartel during a trip to Georgia, a key battleground state in the Nov. 5 presidential election.\n\nIn addition to fentanyl, Treasury said La Nueva Familia Michoacana traffics cocaine and methamphetamines into the U.S. and smuggles migrants across the southern U.S. border. Two of the sanctions targets, Rodolfo Maldonado Bustos and Euchlides Chamacho Goicochea, were separately charged by a federal grand jury with crimes related to heroin trafficking, the U.S. Department of Justice office in Atlanta said. Both of the men are fugitives believed to be residing in Mexico, it said.\n\nThe Treasury said Bustos, aka \"Don Jose,\" is next in line to the co-leaders of La Nueva Familia Michoacana, while Goicochea works closely with Bustos to distribute drugs in Atlanta and Houston, among other areas. The sanctions cut the targets off from the dollar-based financial system and freeze any assets that they may have in the U.S. or in U.S.-based institutions.\n\nYellen also announced a new supplemental advisory to banks from the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) to help them identify and report suspicious transactions related to procurements of fentanyl precursor chemicals and manufacturing equipment by Mexico-based criminal organizations from China. Reporting of such transactions will help FinCEN and partner agencies track down traffickers, Yellen said, calling it an \"important step\" in the fight against fentanyl and other synthetic opioids.\n\n\"This allows us to follow the money behind the illicit fentanyl supply chain and go after the criminals perpetrating and profiting off of the opioid epidemic,\" Yellen said at the Richard B. Russell Federal Building in Atlanta. The new guidance includes \"red flags\" for banks and other counterparties, including transactions linked to chemical and pharmaceutical companies in China or Hong Kong, or a vendor on an e-commerce or \"darknet\" site using Chemical Abstracts Service numbers to identify offerings.\n\nMexican companies with little or no online presence or that predominantly do business with Chinese chemical or pharmaceutical companies also should be treated with suspicion, according to the guidance. Yellen also called for increased cooperation with Mexico on curbing trafficking of fentanyl and its precursor chemicals, and said the Biden administration would emphasize this in its engagement with Mexican President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum.\n\nYellen traveled to Mexico in December to try to boost cooperation to counter fentanyl flow into the United States, including through a new counter-fentanyl \"strike force\" that includes all U.S. Treasury resources, including the Internal Revenue Service's Criminal Investigations unit. In November, U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed in a meeting near San Francisco to cooperate on curbing illicit trade in fentanyl precursors. But in April, a U.S. congressional committee's investigation found that China was directly subsidizing production of these chemicals through tax rebates.\n\n(This story has not been edited by

Salwan Georges/The Washington Post\n\nWASHINGTON -- In Atlanta to promote the Biden administration's efforts to quell the import of illegal drugs into the U.S., Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen announced new sanctions against members of a Mexican drug cartel accused of trafficking fentanyl, cocaine, meth and migrants through the southern border.\n\nIncluded in the sanctions are eight members of the La Nueva Familia Michoacana drug cartel, a notoriously violent group that wars for territorial control with a slate of other Mexican cartels.\n\nAlso Thursday, Yellen issued an advisory to banks to help them identify and report suspicious transactions related to the sale an purchase of chemicals and equipment used to manufacture fentanyl and other synthetic opioids.\n\n\"Combatting the trafficking of fentanyl is a significant challenge,\" she said in a speech at the Richard B. Russell Federal Building in Atlanta Thursday afternoon. \"It will not be solved overnight. But let me be clear: The president and I will do everything we can to combat this crisis.\"\n\nLa Nueva Familia Michoacana is among Mexico's most powerful drug cartels, dominating big chunks of southern and central Mexico, especially areas known for drug production. It's known for manufacturing and distributing drugs like fentanyl and methamphetamine. The group is among those that have rapidly pushed into the increasingly lucrative migrant smuggling industry amid a historic wave of migration to the U.S.\n\nThe cartel is based in the southern state of Guerrero and is often known as \"The New Michoacan Family,\" to distinguish it from an older gang that was largely expelled from the western state of Michoacan in the mid-2010s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2022, the Biden administration sanctioned leaders of the cartel, known as the Hurtado brothers, for manufacturing \"rainbow\" fentanyl pills, which the US Treasury Department said was \"part of a deliberate effort to drive addiction amongst kids.\"\n\nYellen's trip also comes after President Biden signed into law the FEND off Fentanyl Act as part of the supplemental spending package signed in April, which among other things, declares that the international trafficking of fentanyl is a national emergency.\n\nFentanyl, a powerful opioid, is the deadliest drug in the U.S. today. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that drug overdose deaths in the U.S. have increased more than sevenfold from 2015 to 2021.\n\nMexico and China are the primary sources of fentanyl and fentanyl-related substances trafficked directly into the U.S., according to the Drug Enforcement Administration, which is tasked with combating illicit drug trafficking. Nearly all the precursor chemicals that are needed to make fentanyl come from China.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nComments are not available on this story.\n\nSend questions/comments to the

(Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images/TNS)\n\nStanding alongside local and federal law enforcement, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Thursday morning announced major steps to combat the opioid crisis, including sanctions taken against several people affiliated with a Mexican criminal organization officials say is known for trafficking fentanyl and other drugs into the United States and Georgia.\n\nSpeaking at the Richard B. Russell Federal Building in downtown Atlanta, Yellen said the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control had sanctioned eight people associated with La Nueva Familia Michoacana, a violent cartel that has started to produce the drug across several cities in Mexico in recent years. In many cases, its members force people to enter the United States illegally and sell the drugs under threat to their lives and families, officials said, noting that metro Atlanta has been a big hub for them.\n\n\"The leaders we're targeting have carried out heinous acts, from controlling drug routes, to arms trafficking, to money laundering, to murder. Two of those designated have been indicted by courts here in Georgia, including on charges of heroin conspiracy and money laundering,\" Yellen said. \"Our sanctions will cut off the cartel leaders from their ill-gotten money and make it harder for them to bring deadly fentanyl to our streets.\"\n\nYellen also detailed a new advisory issued by the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network that provides information and guidance to U.S. financial institutions, so they can identity and report financial transitions of material used to make fentanyl and other synthetic opioids.\n\nBy letting regional and local banks share that information, Yellen said, the department will be able to track illegal drug money and go after criminals profiting from it. The effort will expand to 10 cities across the United States by the end of this year.\n\nTypically, major cartels rely on shell companies to launder and store their profits, officials said. The Corporate Transparency Act, which went into effect in January, requires many companies to report who owns or controls them, which helps to combat \"illicit finance.\"\n\n\"Our work with partners and at home is rooted in the understanding that cartels that peddle fentanyl operate in many respects like other businesses: They rely on access to banking systems and to the U.S. dollar to make payroll and finance purchases,\" Yellen said. \"This means the Treasury Department has a unique ability to disrupt and degrade their operations. We're particularly focused on two areas related to today's actions: sanctions and partnerships with financial institutions.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden has made the opioid crisis a priority after drug overdose deaths related to fentanyl and other synthetic opioids have skyrocketed in recent years. More than 1 million people have died of drug overdoses across the U.S. since 2022, most related to fentanyl and other synthetic opioids.\n\n\"Combatting the trafficking of fentanyl is a significant challenge. It will not be solved overnight,\" Yellen said. \"But let me be clear: The president and I will do everything we can to combat this crisis.\"\n\nIn Georgia, overdose deaths involving fentanyl increased 200% between 2019 to 2021, Yellen said. She called those numbers \"staggering, almost unimaginable.\" Last year, an Atlanta Journal-Constitution investigation found that Georgia prisoners are increasingly dying from using all manner of drugs, including meth and fentanyl.\n\nBut Yellen said strides have been made.\n\nIn the past two years, law enforcement has seized more fentanyl at ports of entry than the previous five years combined, officials said. Gov. Brian Kemp recently signed a bill into law making naloxone, an opioid-reversal drug, more readily available in schools and government buildings. Yellen also launched the Counter-Fentanyl Strike Force last year, which uses the Treasury's expertise to help fight financial crime.\n\nOutside of the U.S., an effort has been made to strengthen cooperation with China, a key source of the chemicals used to manufacture fentanyl. Yellen said a collaboration with Mexico was also \"crucial,\" and stressed the importance of sharing information with financial institutions on both sides of the border. Other Mexican cartels targeted by the U.S. law enforcement in recent months included CJNG and Sinaloa Cartel.\n\nThursday's visit was Yellen's second to Atlanta this year. In March, she toured a solar cell manufacturing plant in Norcross to highlight the Biden administration's clean energy policies.", "source": {"uri": "stripes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Stars

According to the Treasury Department, he is known as \"El Medico\" (\"The Doctor\") for the violent and surgical manner in which he tortures and kills those who cross the high-ranking members of the cartel.\n\nThe group is also known for human smuggling, with La Nueva Familia Michoacana staging videos in which participants falsely claim to be under interrogation in order to win U.S. asylum. The participants then pay money to the cartel, officials said in a statement.\n\n\"La Nueva Familia Michoacana is one of the most powerful and violent cartels in Mexico and has become a priority focus of the Mexican government in recent years,\" the Treasury Department said while announcing the sanctions.\n\nLast year, the cartel was accused of suspected of leaving a severed human leg found hanging from a pedestrian bridge Wednesday in Toluca, just west of Mexico City. At the bridge, the trunk of the body was left on the street below, near the city's center, along with handwritten signs signed by the Familia Michoacana.\n\nIn 2022, the U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions on the Familia Michoacana, accusing the cartel of manufacturing \"rainbow\" fentanyl pills purportedly aimed at children.\n\nIn addition to the OFAC actions, the U.S. Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network released an advisory of red flags and trends intended to help U.S. financial institutions detect signs of the illicit fentanyl supply chain.\n\n\"The opioid crisis, and especially the rise of synthetic opioids like fentanyl, has devastated communities and claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans,\" Secretary Yellen said in a statement Thursday. \"Treasury has unique capabilities and expertise to target the financial flows of these cartels who are poisoning our communities, and going after them is a top priority for me and the Department.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sanctions", "type": "wiki",

Both of the men are fugitives believed to be residing in Mexico, it said.\n\nThe Treasury said Bustos, aka \"Don Jose,\" is next in line to the co-leaders of La Nueva Familia Michoacana, while Goicochea works closely with Bustos to distribute drugs in Atlanta and Houston, among other areas.\n\nThe sanctions cut the targets off from the dollar-based financial system and freeze any assets that they may have in the U.S. or in U.S.-based institutions.\n\nYellen also announced a new supplemental advisory to banks from the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) to help them identify and report suspicious transactions related to procurements of fentanyl precursor chemicals and manufacturing equipment by Mexico-based criminal organizations from China.\n\nReporting of such transactions will help FinCEN and partner agencies track down traffickers, Yellen said, calling it an \"important step\" in the fight against fentanyl and other synthetic opioids.\n\n\"This allows us to follow the money behind the illicit fentanyl supply chain and go after the criminals perpetrating and profiting off of the opioid epidemic,\" Yellen said at the Richard B. Russell Federal Building in Atlanta.\n\nThe new guidance includes \"red flags\" for banks and other counterparties, including transactions linked to chemical and pharmaceutical companies in China or Hong Kong, or a vendor on an e-commerce or \"darknet\" site using Chemical Abstracts Service numbers to identify offerings.\n\nMexican companies with little or no online presence or that predominantly do business with Chinese chemical or pharmaceutical companies also should be treated with suspicion, according to the guidance.\n\nYellen also called for increased cooperation with Mexico on curbing trafficking of fentanyl and its precursor chemicals, and said the Biden administration would emphasize this in its engagement with Mexican President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum.\n\nYellen traveled to Mexico in December to try to boost cooperation to counter fentanyl flow into the United States, including through a new counter-fentanyl \"strike force\" that includes all U.S. Treasury resources, including the Internal Revenue Service's Criminal Investigations unit.\n\nIn November, U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed in a meeting near San Francisco to cooperate on curbing illicit trade in fentanyl precursors. But in April, a U.S. congressional committee's investigation found that China was directly subsidizing production of these chemicals through tax rebates.\n\n(Reporting by David Lawder in Washington

Russell Federal Building in downtown Atlanta, Yellen said the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control had sanctioned eight people associated with La Nueva Familia Michoacana, a violent cartel that has started to produce the drug across several cities in Mexico in recent years. In many cases, its members force people to enter the United States illegally and sell the drugs under threat to their lives and families, officials said, noting that metro Atlanta has been a big hub for them.\n\n\"The leaders we're targeting have carried out heinous acts, from controlling drug routes, to arms trafficking, to money laundering, to murder. Two of those designated have been indicted by courts here in Georgia, including on charges of heroin conspiracy and money laundering,\" Yellen said. \"Our sanctions will cut off the cartel leaders from their ill-gotten money and make it harder for them to bring deadly fentanyl to our streets.\"\n\nYellen also detailed a new advisory issued by the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network that provides information and guidance to U.S. financial institutions, so they can identity and report financial transitions of material used to make fentanyl and other synthetic opioids.\n\nBy letting regional and local banks share that information, Yellen said, the department will be able to track illegal drug money and go after criminals profiting from it. The effort will expand to 10 cities across the United States by the end of this year.\n\nTypically, major cartels rely on shell companies to launder and store their profits, officials said. The Corporate Transparency Act, which went into effect in January, requires many companies to report who owns or controls them, which helps to combat \"illicit finance.\"\n\n\"Our work with partners and at home is rooted in the understanding that cartels that peddle fentanyl operate in many respects like other businesses: They rely on access to banking systems and to the U.S. dollar to make payroll and finance purchases,\" Yellen said. \"This means the Treasury Department has a unique ability to disrupt and degrade their operations. We're particularly focused on two areas related to today's actions: sanctions and partnerships with financial institutions.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden has made the opioid crisis a priority after drug overdose deaths related to fentanyl and other synthetic opioids have skyrocketed in recent years. More than 1 million people have died of drug overdoses across the U.S. since 2022, most related to fentanyl and other synthetic opioids.\n\n\"Combatting the trafficking of fentanyl is a significant challenge. It will not be solved overnight,\" Yellen said. \"But let me be clear: The president and I will do everything we can to combat this crisis.\"\n\nIn Georgia, overdose deaths involving fentanyl increased 200% between 2019 to 2021, Yellen said. She called those numbers \"staggering, almost unimaginable.\" Last year, an Atlanta Journal-Constitution investigation found that Georgia prisoners are increasingly dying from using all manner of drugs, including meth and fentanyl.\n\nBut Yellen said strides have been made.\n\nIn the past two years, law enforcement has seized more fentanyl at ports of entry than the previous five years combined, officials said. Gov. Brian Kemp recently signed a bill into law making naloxone, an opioid-reversal drug, more readily available in schools and government buildings. Yellen also launched the Counter-Fentanyl Strike Force last year, which uses the Treasury's expertise to help fight financial crime.\n\nOutside of the U.S., an effort has been made to strengthen cooperation with China, a key source of the chemicals used to manufacture fentanyl. Yellen said a collaboration with Mexico was also \"crucial,\" and stressed the importance of sharing information with financial institutions on both sides of the border. Other Mexican cartels targeted by the U.S. law enforcement in recent months included CJNG and Sinaloa Cartel.\n\nThursday's visit was Yellen's second to Atlanta this year. In March, she toured a solar cell manufacturing plant in Norcross to highlight the Biden administration's clean energy policies.", "source": {"uri": "kansascity.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

In addition to drug trafficking, La Nueva Familia Michoacana is responsible for the illicit smuggling of migrants from Mexico to the United States, according to the Treasury. La Nueva Familia Michoacana is one of the most powerful and violent cartels in Mexico and has become a top priority of the Mexican government.\n\nHistorically, La Nueva Familia Michoacana primarily trafficked methamphetamine. However, in recent years, it has expanded into trafficking fentanyl, obtaining the necessary precursor chemicals, purchasing critical pill pressing machines, and then producing fentanyl throughout Mexico, including Mexico City, Pineda, Santa Teresa, Ciudad Altamirano, Tejupilco, Arcelia, Cuernavaca, Culiac\u00e1n, Guadalajara and Toluca, Mexico, according to the Treasury, which has acted in coordination with Mexican authorities.\n\nLa Nueva Familia Michoacana sends fentanyl and other drugs to the United States through Nuevo Laredo and Tamaulipas/Reynosa along the southern border of Texas, using buses, among other means of transportation. Once the drugs are in the United States, they are shipped to various cities across the country, including Atlanta, Houston, Dallas, Tulsa, Chicago and Charlotte.\n\nIn addition to drugs, the cartel also engages in illegal human trafficking. According to the Treasury, in exchange for money, members of La Nueva Familia Michoacana upload photos and videos in which people appear under interrogation or in danger of being murdered. With these photos or videos in hand, individuals falsely declare to U.S. immigration officials their supposed need to seek asylum in the United States.\n\nLa Nueva Familia Michoacana is also known for forcing people to enter the United States illegally with drugs in order to sell them in the country. If they do not follow the order, the cartel threatens to kill them and their family. La Nueva Familia Michoacana also uses tobacco industry workers to introduce narcotics into the United States.\n\nThe Treasury sanctioned Johnny Hurtado Olascoaga and Jos\u00e9 Alfredo Hurtado Olascoaga, the two co-leaders of the cartel, in November 2022, and continued to target their allies. Now it has sanctioned new members of the organization, including Rodolfo Maldonado Bustos, the next in line of command. He controls the drug routes that pass from Ciudad Altamirano to the Zihuatanejo-L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas area. On April 23, 2017, a federal grand jury from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia presented an indictment against him on two counts of conspiracy related to heroin trafficking.\n\nAlso sanctioned is Josu\u00e9 Ram\u00edrez Carrera, the financial leader and next in line after Maldonado Bustos, who controls the laundering of drug money through used clothing businesses. He is also involved in arms trafficking, where he directs people throughout the Rio Grande Valley to hide weapons inside packages of used clothing bound for Mexico City, according to the Treasury.\n\nThe sanctions also affect other lieutenants and hitmen of the cartel: Josu\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Hern\u00e1ndez, David Dur\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez, Kevin Arzate G\u00f3mez, Euclides Camacho Goicochea, Lucio Ochoa Lagunes and Uriel Tabares Mart\u00ednez. The latter is a hitman who works directly for the cartel's co-leaders and has a leadership role in the Guerrero/Ciudad Altamirano region of Mexico. He is known as \"The Doctor\" for the violent and surgical way in which he tortures and murders those who cross paths with high-ranking members of the La Nueva Familia Michoacana cartel.\n\nThe sanctions entail the freezing of all assets of the targeted individuals and a veto on U.S. and U.S.-based transactions with the sanctioned individuals. These sanctions make money laundering somewhat more difficult, but since these are organizations operating outside the law, they are of limited effectiveness in curbing their activity.\n\nSince 2019, Mexican cartels have been the main suppliers of illicit fentanyl and other synthetic opioids in the United States. They purchase precursor chemicals and manufacturing equipment from suppliers based in China, and through intermediaries acquire chemicals to synthesize illicit fentanyl and other synthetic opioids in clandestine laboratories in Mexico. They then traffic these highly addictive and deadly drugs, primarily across the southwest border of the United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 107,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2023, and more than 74,000 of those deaths were related to synthetic opioids, primarily illicitly manufactured fentanyl.\n\n\"The opioid crisis, and especially the rise of synthetic opioids like fentanyl, has devastated communities and claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans. President Biden and I are committed to using every tool we have to target illicit fentanyl and its precursor chemicals so we can disrupt these deadly supply chains,\" said Secretary Yellen in a statement released on Thursday. \"Treasury has unique capabilities and expertise to target the financial flows of these cartels who are poisoning our communities, and going after them is a top priority for me and the Department.\"", "source": {"uri": "english.elpais.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EL PA\u00cdS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "miguel_jimenez@english.elpais.com", "name": "Miguel

At the same time, the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network issued an advisory highlighting new information for U.S. banks and financial institutions to look for.\n\nBanks are to make a Suspicious Activity Report to law enforcement if they see activity that indicates the purchase of chemicals or tools associated with making fentanyl.\n\n\"Treasury has unique capabilities and expertise to target the financial flows of these cartels who are poisoning our communities, and going after them is a top priority for me and the Department,\" Ms. Yellen said.\n\nOver the past two years, the Treasury Department has sanctioned more than 250 targets for involvement in drug trafficking activities at all stages of the supply chain, from major cartel leaders to under-the-radar labs, transportation networks, and chemical suppliers, she said.\n\nLa Nueva Familia Michoacana buys chemicals and pill press machines to make fentanyl throughout Mexico, then sends fentanyl and other drugs to the United States through Nuevo Laredo and Tamaulipas/Reynosa into Texas on buses and other means of transportation, according to a Treasury statement.\n\nOnce in the United States, the drugs are sent to cities including Tulsa, Oklahoma; Charlotte, North Carolina; and Atlanta, Houston, Dallas, and Chicago.\n\nLa Nueva Familia Michoacana also engages in human smuggling for a price, staging photos depicting people in danger of being murdered, the Treasury said, so people can falsely seek asylum in the United States.\n\nThe group also forces individuals to enter the United States illegally with drugs to be sold, and threatens to murder their families is they don't sell the drugs. Workers in the tobacco industry are often used to smuggle narcotics into the country, the Treasury said.\n\nThe sanctions arose from a collaboration between the Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia, and in coordination with the Government of Mexico, including La Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera (UIF), Mexico's financial intelligence unit.\n\nThe Treasury provided names and descriptions of the eight sanctioned men.\n\nRodolfo Maldonado Bustos is a member of La Nueva Familia Michoacana cartel and is next-in-line to Johnny Hurtado Olascoaga and Jose Alfredo Hurtado Olascoaga, the two co-leaders, both of whom OFAC designated for sanctions in 2022. Mr. Bustos controls drug routes, according to the Treasury statement. On April 23, 2017, a grand jury in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia returned an indictment against Mr. Bustos on two counts of heroin conspiracy charges.\n\nJosue Ramirez Carrera is a financial leader and third-in-line in La Nueva Familia Michoacana. Mr. Carrera allegedly controls laundering drug money for the cartel through a used clothing business and is involved in arms trafficking. The Treasury says he directs people along the Rio Grande Valley to conceal weapons in packs of used clothing destined for Mexico City.\n\nJosue Lopez Hernandez is a lieutenant for La Nueva Familia Michoacana and has significant regional connections with other cartels.\n\nDavid Duran Alvarez is a lieutenant for La Nueva Familia Michoacana and is known to send various drugs to Houston, Texas, the Treasury said.\n\nUriel Tabares Martinez is an assassin, according to the Treasury statement, and he works directly for Johnny Hurtado Olascoaga and Jose Alfredo Hurtado Olascoaga.\n\nKevin Arzate Gomez is a lieutenant for La Nueva Familia Michoacana and has contacts and associates along the U.S.-Mexico border. He negotiates on behalf of the cartel to have drugs enter the United States and allegedly assists in getting the money from those drugs sales back to Mexico.\n\nEuclides Camacho Goicochea works with Mr. Bustos and Uriel Tabares Martinez. He allegedly moves a significant amount of drugs, particularly methamphetamine, to Houston and Atlanta, among other areas. On Aug. 23, 2017, a grand jury in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia returned an indictment against Mr. Goicochea on two counts of heroin conspiracy charges and one count of money laundering.\n\nLucio Ochoa Lagunes is a lieutenant for La Nueva Familia Michoacana and allegedly works directly for Jose Hurtado Olascoaga.", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news",

La Nueva Familia Michoacana is involved in significant fentanyl, cocaine, and methamphetamine trafficking and migrant smuggling into the United States.\n\nSynthetic drug traffickers pose a significant worldwide threat to health and security, and they exacerbate the overdose epidemic in the United States. Our sanctions authorities help sever criminal entities' ties to the United States' financial system, disrupting their networks' operations.\n\nThese actions are a core component of President Biden's strengthened whole-of-government approach to safeguard lives and dismantle the transnational criminal organizations responsible for the illicit distribution of fentanyl and other dangerous synthetic drugs. To accelerate and strengthen international action to respond to emerging synthetic drug threats, Secretary Blinken launched the Global Coalition to Address Synthetic Drug Threats. The coalition has grown to include over 1,500 participants from 156 countries and 15 international organizations.\n\n/Public Release.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 608 points, or 1.5%, as of 10:15 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 3.4% lower.\n\nA report showing hiring by U.S. employers slowed last month by much more than economists expected sent fear through markets, with both stocks and bond yields dropping sharply. It followed a batch of weaker-than-expected reports on the economy from a day earlier, including a worsening for U.S. manufacturing activity, which has been one of the areas most hurt by high rates.\n\nIt was just a couple days ago that U.S. stock indexes jumped to their best day in months after Fed Chair Jerome Powell gave the clearest indication yet that inflation has slowed enough for cuts to rates to begin in September.\n\nNow, worries are rising the Fed kept its main interest rate at a two-decade high for too long in its zeal to stifle inflation. A rate cut would make it easier for U.S. households and companies to borrow money and support the economy, but it could take months to a year for the full effects to filter through.\n\n\"The Fed is seizing defeat from the jaws of victory,\" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. \"Economic momentum has slowed so much that a rate cut in September will be too little and too late. They'll have to do something bigger than\" the traditional cut of a quarter of a percentage point \"to avert a recession.\"\n\nTraders are now betting on a nearly two-in-three chance that the Fed will cut its main interest rate by half a percentage point in September, according to data from CME Group. That's even though Powell said on Wednesday that such a deep reduction is \"not something we're thinking about right now.\"\n\nU.S. stocks had already appeared to be headed for losses before the disappointing jobs report thudded onto Wall Street.\n\nSeveral big technology companies turned in underwhelming profit reports, which continued a mostly dispiriting run that began last week with results from Tesla and Alphabet.\n\nAmazon fell 12.1% after reporting weaker revenue for the latest quarter than expected. The retail giant also gave a forecast for operating profit for the summer that fell short of analysts' expectations.\n\nIntel dropped even more, 29.3%, after the chip company's profit for the latest quarter fell well short of forecasts. It also suspended its dividend payment and said it expects to lose money in the third quarter, when analysts were expecting a profit.\n\nApple was holding steadier, up 1.4%, after reporting better profit and revenue than expected.\n\nApple and a handful of other Big Tech stocks known as the \" Magnificent Seven \" have been the main reasons the S&P 500 has set dozens of records this year, in part on a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. But their momentum turned last month on worries investors had taken their prices too high and expectations for their profit gains are growing too difficult to meet.\n\nHelpfully for Wall Street, other areas of the stock market beaten down by high interest rates were rebounding at the same time, particularly smaller companies. But they tumbled too on Friday on worries that a fragile economy could undercut their profits.\n\nThe Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks dropped 3.9%, more than the rest of the market.\n\nIn the bond market, Treasury yields fell sharply as traders raised their expectations for how deeply the Federal Reserve would have to cut interest rates. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 3.81% from 3.98% late Thursday and from 4.70% in April.\n\nThe yield on the two-year Treasury, which more closely follows expectations for Fed action, fell to 3.89% from 4.15% late Thursday and is back to where it was in May 2023.\n\nAmid all the fear, some voices on Wall Street were still advising caution.\n\n\"While worries of a policy mistake are rising, one negative miss shouldn't lead to overreaction,\" according to Lara Castleton, U.S. head of portfolio construction and strategy at Janus Henderson Investors.\n\nShe points out the U.S. economy is still growing, and inflation is still coming down. The S&P 500, meanwhile, isn't far off its record set two weeks ago. \"Equities selling off should be seen as a normal reaction, especially considering the high valuations in many pockets of the market. It's a good reminder for investors to focus on the earnings of companies going forward.\"\n\nIn stock markets abroad, Japan's Nikkei 225 dropped 5.8%. It's been struggling since the Bank of Japan raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday. The hike pushed the value of the Japanese yen higher against the U.S. dollar, potentially hurting profits for exporters and deflating a boom in tourism.\n\nChinese stocks extended losses this week as investors registered disappointment with the government's latest efforts to spur growth through various piecemeal measures, instead of hoped-for infusions of broader stimulus.\n\nStock indexes also fell across much of Europe.\n\nThe nerve-wracking week for markets has come even as central banks in Japan, the United States and England acted pretty much as expected. Japan raised its benchmark rate, the Fed stood pat and the Bank of England lowered its key rate for the first time in more than four years.\n\nCommodity prices have also had a rough ride, with oil prices surging after the killings of leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah that fueled fears conflict in the Middle East might escalate into a wider war. But prices fell back Thursday and Friday on worries about the economy. A barrel of benchmark U.S. crude tumbled 3.5% Friday to $73.62 and brought its loss for the week to 4.6%.\n\nAP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.\n\nMore from this

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 775 points, or 1.9%, with a little more than an hour remaining in trading, and the Nasdaq composite was 2.6% lower as a sell-off for stocks whipped all the way around the world back to Wall Street.\n\nA report showing hiring by U.S. employers slowed last month by much more than economists expected sent fear through markets, with both stocks and bond yields dropping sharply. It followed a batch of weaker-than-expected reports on the economy from a day earlier, including a worsening for U.S. manufacturing activity, which has been one of the areas hurt most by high rates.\n\nIt was just a couple days ago that U.S. stock indexes jumped to their best day in months after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave the clearest indication yet that inflation has slowed enough for cuts to rates to begin in September.\n\nNow, worries are rising the Fed may have kept its main interest rate at a two-decade high for too long. A rate cut would make it easier for U.S. households and companies to borrow money and boost the economy, but it could take months to a year for the full effects to filter through.\n\n\"The Fed is seizing defeat from the jaws of victory,\" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. \"Economic momentum has slowed so much that a rate cut in September will be too little and too late. They'll have to do something bigger than\" the traditional cut of a quarter of a percentage point \"to avert a recession.\"\n\nTraders are now betting on a nearly three-in-four chance that the Fed will cut its main interest rate by half a percentage point in September, according to data from CME Group. That's even though Powell said Wednesday that such a deep reduction is \"not something we're thinking about right now.\"\n\nOf course, the U.S. economy is still growing, and a recession is far from a certainty. The Fed has been clear about the tightrope it's walking since it started hiking rates sharply in March 2022: Being too aggressive would choke the economy, but going too soft would give inflation more oxygen and hurt everyone.\n\nWhile refusing to claim victory on either the jobs or the inflation fronts on Wednesday, before the discouraging economic reports hit, Powell said Fed officials \"have a lot of room to respond if we were to see weakness\" in the job market after hiking its main rate so high.\n\n\"Certainly today's job data feeds the weakening economy narrative, but I believe the market is overreacting at this point and pricing too much in on rate cuts at this stage,\" said Nate Thooft, senior portfolio manager at Manulife Investment Management. \"Yes, the economy is weakening, but I am not convinced there is enough evidence that the data so far is a death knell for the economy.\"\n\nU.S. stocks had already appeared to be headed for losses Friday before the disappointing jobs report thudded onto Wall Street.\n\nSeveral big technology companies turned in underwhelming profit reports, which continued a mostly dispiriting run that began last week with results from Tesla and Alphabet.\n\nAmazon fell 9.2% after reporting weaker revenue for the latest quarter than expected. The retail and tech giant also gave a forecast for operating profit for the summer that fell short of analysts' expectations.\n\nIntel dropped even more, 26.7% and on pace for its worst day in 50 years, after the chip company's profit for the latest quarter fell well short of forecasts. It also suspended its dividend payment and said it expects to lose money in the third quarter, when analysts were expecting a profit.\n\nApple was holding steadier, up 2.2%, after reporting better profit and revenue than expected.\n\nApple and a handful of other Big Tech stocks known as the \" Magnificent Seven \" have been the main reasons the S&P 500 has set dozens of records this year, in part on a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. But their momentum turned last month on worries investors had taken their prices too high and expectations for future growth are too difficult to meet.\n\nFriday's losses for tech stocks dragged the Nasdaq composite down by more than 10% from its record set in the middle of last month.\n\nHelpfully for Wall Street, other areas of the stock market beaten down by high interest rates had been rebounding last month when tech stocks were regressing, particularly smaller companies. But they tumbled too Friday on worries that a fragile economy could undercut their profits.\n\nThe Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks dropped 3.6%, more than the rest of the market.\n\nIn the bond market, Treasury yields fell sharply as traders raised their expectations for how deeply the Federal Reserve would have to cut interest rates. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 3.79% from 3.98% late Thursday and from 4.70% in April.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, Japan's Nikkei 225 dropped 5.8%. It's been struggling since the Bank of Japan raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday. The hike pushed the value of the Japanese yen higher against the U.S. dollar, potentially hurting profits for exporters and deflating a boom in tourism.\n\nChinese stocks fell week as investors registered disappointment with the government's latest efforts to spur growth through various piecemeal measures, instead of hoped-for infusions of broader stimulus, while stock indexes dropped by more than 1% across much of Europe.\n\nCommodity prices have also had a rough ride this week. Oil prices surged after the killings of leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah that fueled fears that a widening conflict in the Middle East could disrupt the flow of crude.\n\nBut prices fell back Thursday and Friday on worries that a weakening economy will burn less fuel. A barrel of benchmark U.S. crude tumbled back below $74 Friday after coming into the week above $77.\n\nAP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.", "source": {"uri":

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 610 points, or 1.5%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 2.4% as a sell-off for stocks whipped all the way around the world back to Wall Street.\n\nA report showing hiring by U.S. employers slowed last month by much more than economists expected sent fear through markets, with both stocks and bond yields dropping sharply. It followed a batch of weaker-than-expected reports on the economy from a day earlier, including a worsening for U.S. manufacturing activity, which has been one of the areas hurt most by high rates.\n\nIt was just a couple days ago that U.S. stock indexes jumped to their best day in months after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave the clearest indication yet that inflation has slowed enough for cuts to rates to begin in September.\n\nNow, worries are rising the Fed may have kept its main interest rate at a two-decade high for too long. A rate cut would make it easier for U.S. households and companies to borrow money and boost the economy, but it could take months to a year for the full effects to filter through.\n\n\"The Fed is seizing defeat from the jaws of victory,\" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. \"Economic momentum has slowed so much that a rate cut in September will be too little and too late. They'll have to do something bigger than\" the traditional cut of a quarter of a percentage point \"to avert a recession.\"\n\nTraders are now betting on a 70% probability that the Fed will cut its main interest rate by half a percentage point in September, according to data from CME Group. That's even though Powell said Wednesday that such a deep reduction is \"not something we're thinking about right now.\"\n\nOf course, the U.S. economy is still growing, and a recession is far from a certainty. The Fed has been clear about the tightrope it's walking since it started hiking rates sharply in March 2022: Being too aggressive would choke the economy, but going too soft would give inflation more oxygen.\n\nWhile refusing to claim victory on either the jobs or the inflation fronts on Wednesday, before the discouraging economic reports hit, Powell said Fed officials \"have a lot of room to respond if we were to see weakness\" in the job market after hiking its main rate so high.\n\n\"Certainly today's job data feeds the weakening economy narrative, but I believe the market is overreacting at this point and pricing too much in on rate cuts at this stage,\" said Nate Thooft, senior portfolio manager at Manulife Investment Management. \"Yes, the economy is weakening, but I am not convinced there is enough evidence that the data so far is a death knell for the economy.\"\n\nU.S. stocks had already appeared to be headed for losses Friday before the disappointing jobs report thudded onto Wall Street.\n\nSeveral big technology companies turned in underwhelming profit reports, which continued a mostly dispiriting run that began last week with results from Tesla and Alphabet.\n\nAmazon fell 8.8% after reporting weaker revenue for the latest quarter than expected. The retail and tech giant also gave a forecast for operating profit for the summer that fell short of analysts' expectations.\n\nIntel dropped even more, 26.1%, for its worst day in 50 years, after the chip company's profit for the latest quarter fell well short of forecasts. It also suspended its dividend payment and forecast a loss for the third quarter, when analysts were expecting a profit.\n\nApple held steadier, up 0.7%, after reporting better profit and revenue than expected.\n\nApple and a handful of other Big Tech stocks known as the \" Magnificent Seven \" were the main reasons the S&P 500 set dozens of records this year, in part on a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. But their momentum turned last month on worries investors had taken their prices too high.\n\nFriday's losses for tech stocks dragged the Nasdaq composite 10% below its record set last month. That level of drop is what traders call a \"correction.\"\n\nHelpfully for Wall Street, other areas of the stock market beaten down by high interest rates began rebounding sharply last month when tech stocks were regressing, particularly smaller companies. But they tumbled too Friday on worries that a fragile economy could undercut their profits.\n\nThe Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks dropped 3.5%, more than the rest of the market.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 fell 100.12 points to 5,346.56. The Dow dropped 610.71 to 39.737.26, and the Nasdaq composite fell 417.98 to 16,776.16.\n\nIn the bond market, Treasury yields fell sharply as traders forecasted deeper cuts to rates coming from the Federal Reserve. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 3.79% from 3.98% late Thursday and from 4.70% in April.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, Japan's Nikkei 225 dropped 5.8%. It's been struggling since the Bank of Japan raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday. The hike pushed up the value of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar, which could hurt profits for exporters and deflate a boom in tourism.\n\nChinese stocks fell as investors registered disappointment with the government's latest efforts to spur growth through various piecemeal measures, instead of hoped-for infusions of broader stimulus, while stock indexes dropped by more than 1% across much of Europe.\n\nCommodity prices also had a rough ride this week. Oil prices leaped after the killings of leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah fueled fears that a widening conflict in the Middle East could disrupt the flow of crude.\n\nBut prices fell back Thursday and Friday on worries that a weakening economy would burn less fuel. A barrel of benchmark U.S. crude dropped back below $74 Friday after coming into the week above $77.\n\nAP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.\n\nMore from this

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 610 points, or 1.5%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 2.4% as a sell-off for stocks whipped all the way around the world back to Wall Street.\n\nA report showing hiring by U.S. employers slowed last month by much more than economists expected sent fear through markets, with both stocks and bond yields dropping sharply. It followed a batch of weaker-than-expected reports on the economy from a day earlier, including a worsening for U.S. manufacturing activity, which has been one of the areas hurt most by high rates.\n\nIt was just a couple days ago that U.S. stock indexes jumped to their best day in months after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave the clearest indication yet that inflation has slowed enough for cuts to rates to begin in September.\n\nNow, worries are rising the Fed may have kept its main interest rate at a two-decade high for too long. A rate cut would make it easier for U.S. households and companies to borrow money and boost the economy, but it could take months to a year for the full effects to filter through.\n\n\"The Fed is seizing defeat from the jaws of victory,\" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. \"Economic momentum has slowed so much that a rate cut in September will be too little and too late. They'll have to do something bigger than\" the traditional cut of a quarter of a percentage point \"to avert a recession.\"\n\nTraders are now betting on a 70% probability that the Fed will cut its main interest rate by half a percentage point in September, according to data from CME Group. That's even though Powell said Wednesday that such a deep reduction is \"not something we're thinking about right now.\"\n\nOf course, the U.S. economy is still growing, and a recession is far from a certainty. The Fed has been clear about the tightrope it's walking since it started hiking rates sharply in March 2022: Being too aggressive would choke the economy, but going too soft would give inflation more oxygen.\n\nWhile refusing to claim victory on either the jobs or the inflation fronts on Wednesday, before the discouraging economic reports hit, Powell said Fed officials \"have a lot of room to respond if we were to see weakness\" in the job market after hiking its main rate so high.\n\n\"Certainly today's job data feeds the weakening economy narrative, but I believe the market is overreacting at this point and pricing too much in on rate cuts at this stage,\" said Nate Thooft, senior portfolio manager at Manulife Investment Management. \"Yes, the economy is weakening, but I am not convinced there is enough evidence that the data so far is a death knell for the economy.\"\n\nU.S. stocks had already appeared to be headed for losses Friday before the disappointing jobs report thudded onto Wall Street.\n\nSeveral big technology companies turned in underwhelming profit reports, which continued a mostly dispiriting run that began last week with results from Tesla and Alphabet.\n\nAmazon fell 8.8% after reporting weaker revenue for the latest quarter than expected. The retail and tech giant also gave a forecast for operating profit for the summer that fell short of analysts' expectations.\n\nIntel dropped even more, 26.1%, for its worst day in 50 years, after the chip company's profit for the latest quarter fell well short of forecasts. It also suspended its dividend payment and forecast a loss for the third quarter, when analysts were expecting a profit.\n\nApple held steadier, up 0.7%, after reporting better profit and revenue than expected.\n\nApple and a handful of other Big Tech stocks known as the \"Magnificent Seven\" were the main reasons the S&P 500 set dozens of records this year, in part on a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. But their momentum turned last month on worries investors had taken their prices too high.\n\nFriday's losses for tech stocks dragged the Nasdaq composite 10% below its record set last month. That level of drop is what traders call a \"correction.\"\n\nHelpfully for Wall Street, other areas of the stock market beaten down by high interest rates began rebounding sharply last month when tech stocks were regressing, particularly smaller companies. But they also tumbled Friday on worries that a fragile economy could undercut their profits.\n\nThe Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks dropped 3.5%, more than the rest of the market.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 fell 100.12 points to 5,346.56. The Dow dropped 610.71 to 39.737.26, and the Nasdaq composite fell 417.98 to 16,776.16.\n\nIn the bond market, Treasury yields fell sharply as traders forecasted deeper cuts to rates coming from the Federal Reserve. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell from 3.98% late Thursday to 3.79%, continuing its drop from April's 4.70%.\n\nCommodity prices also had a rough ride this week. Oil prices leaped after the killings of leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah fueled fears that a widening conflict in the Middle East could disrupt the flow of crude.\n\nBut prices fell back Thursday and Friday on worries that a weakening economy would burn less fuel. A barrel of benchmark U.S. crude dropped back below $74 Friday after coming into the week above $77.\n\nInformation for this article was contributed by Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach of The Associated

It followed a batch of weaker-than-expected reports on the economy from a day earlier, including a worsening for U.S. manufacturing activity, which has been one of the areas hurt most by high rates.\n\nIt was just a couple days ago that U.S. stock indexes jumped to their best day in months after Fed Chair Jerome Powell gave the clearest indication yet that inflation has slowed enough for cuts to rates to begin in September.\n\nNow, worries are rising the Fed kept its main interest rate at a two-decade high for too long in its zeal to stifle inflation. A rate cut would make it easier for U.S. households and companies to borrow money and support the economy, but it could take months to a year for the full effects to filter through.\n\n\"The Fed is seizing defeat from the jaws of victory,\" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. \"Economic momentum has slowed so much that a rate cut in September will be too little and too late. They'll have to do something bigger than\" the traditional cut of a quarter of a percentage point \"to avert a recession.\"\n\nTraders are now betting on a roughly two-in-three chance that the Fed will cut its main interest rate by half a percentage point in September, according to data from CME Group.

It also suspended its dividend payment and said it expects to lose money in the third quarter, when analysts were expecting a profit.\n\nApple was holding steadier, up 2.4%, after reporting better profit and revenue than expected.\n\nApple and a handful of other Big Tech stocks known as the \" Magnificent Seven \" have been the main reasons the S&P 500 has set dozens of records this year, in part on a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. But their momentum turned last month on worries investors had taken their prices too high and expectations for their profit gains are growing too difficult to meet.\n\nFriday's losses for tech stocks dragged the Nasdaq composite down by more than 10% from its record set in the middle of last month.\n\nHelpfully for Wall Street, other areas of the stock market beaten down by high interest rates had been rebounding at the same time tech stocks were regressing, particularly smaller companies. But they tumbled too Friday on worries that a fragile economy could undercut their profits.\n\nThe Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks dropped 4.2%, more than the rest of the market.\n\nIn the bond market, Treasury yields fell sharply as traders raised their expectations for how deeply the Federal Reserve would have to cut interest rates. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 3.82% from 3.98% late Thursday and from 4.70% in April.\n\nAmid all the fear, some voices on Wall Street were still advising caution.\n\n\"While worries of a policy mistake are rising, one negative miss shouldn't lead to overreaction,\" according to Lara Castleton, U.S. head of portfolio construction and strategy at Janus Henderson Investors.\n\nShe points out the U.S. economy is still growing, and inflation is still coming down. The S&P 500, meanwhile, isn't far off its record set two weeks ago. \"Equities selling off should be seen as a normal reaction, especially considering the high valuations in many pockets of the market. It's a good reminder for investors to focus on the earnings of companies going forward.\"\n\nIn stock markets abroad, Japan's Nikkei 225 dropped 5.8%. It's been struggling since the Bank of Japan raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday. The hike pushed the value of the Japanese yen higher against the U.S. dollar, potentially hurting profits for exporters and deflating a boom in tourism.\n\nChinese stocks extended losses this week as investors registered disappointment with the government's latest efforts to spur growth through various piecemeal measures, instead of hoped-for infusions of broader stimulus, and stock indexes fell across much of Europe.\n\nCommodity prices have also had a rough ridet this week. Oil prices surged after the killings of leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah that fueled fears that a widening conflict in the Middle East could disrupt the flow of crude.\n\nBut prices fell back Thursday and Friday on worries that a weakening economy will burn less fuel. A barrel of benchmark U.S. crude tumbled 3.4% Friday to $73.73 and brought its loss for the week to 4.5%.\n\nAP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.", "source": {"uri":

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 775 points, or 1.9%, with a little more than an hour remaining in trading, and the Nasdaq composite was 2.6% lower as a sell-off for stocks whipped all the way around the world back to Wall Street.\n\nA report showing hiring by U.S. employers slowed last month by much more than economists expected sent fear through markets, with both stocks and bond yields dropping sharply. It followed a batch of weaker-than-expected reports on the economy from a day earlier, including a worsening for U.S. manufacturing activity, which has been one of the areas hurt most by high rates.\n\nIt was just a couple days ago that U.S. stock indexes jumped to their best day in months after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave the clearest indication yet that inflation has slowed enough for cuts to rates to begin in September.\n\nNow, worries are rising the Fed may have kept its main interest rate at a two-decade high for too long. A rate cut would make it easier for U.S. households and companies to borrow money and boost the economy, but it could take months to a year for the full effects to filter through.\n\n\"The Fed is seizing defeat from the jaws of victory,\" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. \"Economic momentum has slowed so much that a rate cut in September will be too little and too late. They'll have to do something bigger than\" the traditional cut of a quarter of a percentage point \"to avert a recession.\"\n\nTraders are now betting on a nearly three-in-four chance that the Fed will cut its main interest rate by half a percentage point in September, according to data from CME Group. That's even though Powell said Wednesday that such a deep reduction is \"not something we're thinking about right now.\"\n\nOf course, the U.S. economy is still growing, and a recession is far from a certainty. The Fed has been clear about the tightrope it's walking since it started hiking rates sharply in March 2022: Being too aggressive would choke the economy, but going too soft would give inflation more oxygen and hurt everyone.\n\nWhile refusing to claim victory on either the jobs or the inflation fronts on Wednesday, before the discouraging economic reports hit, Powell said Fed officials \"have a lot of room to respond if we were to see weakness\" in the job market after hiking its main rate so high.\n\n\"Certainly today's job data feeds the weakening economy narrative, but I believe the market is overreacting at this point and pricing too much in on rate cuts at this stage,\" said Nate Thooft, senior portfolio manager at Manulife Investment Management. \"Yes, the economy is weakening, but I am not convinced there is enough evidence that the data so far is a death knell for the economy.\"\n\nU.S. stocks had already appeared to be headed for losses Friday before the disappointing jobs report thudded onto Wall Street.\n\nSeveral big technology companies turned in underwhelming profit reports, which continued a mostly dispiriting run that began last week with results from Tesla and Alphabet.\n\nAmazon fell 9.2% after reporting weaker revenue for the latest quarter than expected. The retail and tech giant also gave a forecast for operating profit for the summer that fell short of analysts' expectations.\n\nIntel dropped even more, 26.7% and on pace for its worst day in 50 years, after the chip company's profit for the latest quarter fell well short of forecasts. It also suspended its dividend payment and said it expects to lose money in the third quarter, when analysts were expecting a profit.\n\nApple was holding steadier, up 2.2%, after reporting better profit and revenue than expected.\n\nApple and a handful of other Big Tech stocks known as the \" Magnificent Seven \" have been the main reasons the S&P 500 has set dozens of records this year, in part on a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. But their momentum turned last month on worries investors had taken their prices too high and expectations for future growth are too difficult to meet.\n\nFriday's losses for tech stocks dragged the Nasdaq composite down by more than 10% from its record set in the middle of last month.\n\nHelpfully for Wall Street, other areas of the stock market beaten down by high interest rates had been rebounding last month when tech stocks were regressing, particularly smaller companies. But they tumbled too Friday on worries that a fragile economy could undercut their profits.\n\nThe Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks dropped 3.6%, more than the rest of the market.\n\nIn the bond market, Treasury yields fell sharply as traders raised their expectations for how deeply the Federal Reserve would have to cut interest rates. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 3.79% from 3.98% late Thursday and from 4.70% in April.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, Japan's Nikkei 225 dropped 5.8%. It's been struggling since the Bank of Japan raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday. The hike pushed the value of the Japanese yen higher against the U.S. dollar, potentially hurting profits for exporters and deflating a boom in tourism.\n\nChinese stocks fell week as investors registered disappointment with the government's latest efforts to spur growth through various piecemeal measures, instead of hoped-for infusions of broader stimulus, while stock indexes dropped by more than 1% across much of Europe.\n\nCommodity prices have also had a rough ride this week. Oil prices surged after the killings of leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah that fueled fears that a widening conflict in the Middle East could disrupt the flow of crude.\n\nBut prices fell back Thursday and Friday on worries that a weakening economy will burn less fuel. A barrel of benchmark U.S. crude tumbled back below $74 Friday after coming into the week above $77.\n\nAP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.\n\nMore from this section\n\nSET Enterprises launches 340b covered entity suspicious purchase identification service for pharmaceutical and biological manufacturers\n\nFestival on L.

But their momentum turned last month on worries investors had taken their prices too high and expectations for their profit gains had grown too difficult to meet.\n\nHelpfully for Wall Street, other areas of the stock market that had been beaten down by high interest rates were rebounding at the same time, particularly smaller companies. But they tumbled too on Friday on worries that a fragile economy could undercut their profits.\n\nThe Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks dropped 3.7%, more than the rest of the market.\n\nIn the bond market, Treasury yields fell sharply as traders raised their expectations for how deeply the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates at its next meeting in September. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 3.85% from 3.98% late Thursday and from 4.70% in April.\n\nAmid all the fear, some voices on Wall Street were still advising caution.\n\n\"While worries of a policy mistake are rising, one negative miss shouldn't lead to overreaction,\" according to Lara Castleton, U.S. head of portfolio construction and strategy at Janus Henderson Investors.\n\nShe points out that the U.S. economy is still growing, and inflation is still coming down. The S&P 500, meanwhile, isn't far off its record set two weeks ago. \"Equities selling off should be seen as a normal reaction, especially considering the high valuations in many pockets of the market. It's a good reminder for investors to focus on the earnings of companies going forward.\"\n\nIn stock markets abroad, Japan's Nikkei 225 dropped 5.8%, back to where it was trading in January before it surged to an all-time high last month. Japanese stocks have been struggling after the Bank of Japan raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday. That pushed the value of the Japanese yen higher against the U.S. dollar, potentially hurting profits for exporters and deflating a boom in tourism.\n\nChinese stocks extended losses this week as investors registered disappointment with the government's latest efforts to spur growth through various piecemeal measures, instead of hoped-for infusions of broader stimulus.\n\nStock indexes also fell across much of Europe.\n\nThe nerve-wracking week for markets has come even as central banks in Japan, the United States and England acted pretty much as expected. Japan raised its benchmark rate, the Fed stood pat and the Bank of England lowered its key rate for the first time in more than four years.\n\nCommodity prices have also had a rough ride, with oil prices surging after the killings of leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah that fueled fears conflict in the Middle East might escalate into a wider war. But prices fell back Thursday and Friday on worries about the economy.\n\nAP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news",

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was reeling by 864 points, or 2.2%, as of 11:40 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite slid 2.7%.\n\nThe drops were just the latest in a global sell-off that began last week. Japan's Nikkei 225 helped start Monday by plunging 12.4% for its worst day since the Black Monday crash of 1987.\n\nIt was the first chance for traders in Tokyo to react to Friday's report showing U.S. employers slowed their hiring last month by much more than economists expected. That was the latest piece of data on the U.S. economy to come in weaker than expected, and it's all raised fear the Federal Reserve has pressed the brakes on the U.S. economy by too much for too long through high interest rates in hopes of stifling inflation.\n\nProfessional investors cautioned that some technical factors could be amplifying the action in markets, but the losses were still neck-snapping. South Korea's Kospi index careened 8.8% lower, stock markets across Europe sank more than 2% and bitcoin dropped below $55,000 from more than $61,000 on Friday.\n\nEven gold, which has a reputation for offering safety during tumultuous times, slipped 1%.\n\nThat's in part because traders began wondering if the damage has been so severe that the Federal Reserve will have to cut interest rates in an emergency meeting, before its next scheduled decision on Sept. 18. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which closely tracks expectations for the Fed, briefly sank below 3.70% during the morning from 3.88% late Friday and from 5% in April. It later recovered and pulled back to 3.90%.\n\n\"The Fed could ride in on a white horse to save the day with a big rate cut, but the case for an inter-meeting cut seems flimsy,\" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. \"Those are usually reserved for emergencies, like COVID, and an unemployment rate of 4.3% doesn't really seem like an emergency.\"\n\nThe U.S. economy is still growing, and a recession is far from a certainty. The Fed has been clear about the tightrope it began walking when it started hiking rates sharply in March 2022: Being too aggressive would choke the economy, but going too soft would give inflation more oxygen and hurt everyone.\n\nGoldman Sachs economist David Mericle sees a higher chance of a recession within the next 12 months following Friday's jobs report. But he still sees only a 25% probability of that, up from 15%, in part \"because the data look fine overall\" and he does not \"see major financial imbalances.\"\n\nSome of Wall Street's recent declines may also simply be air coming out of a stock market that romped to dozens of all-time highs this year, in part on a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology and hopes for coming cuts to interest rates. Critics have been saying for a while that the stock market looked expensive after prices rose faster than corporate profits.\n\n\"Markets tend to move higher like they're climbing stairs, and they go down like they're falling out a window,\" according to JJ Kinahan, CEO of IG North America. He chalks much of the recent worries to euphoria around AI subsiding and \"a market that was ahead of itself.\"\n\nProfessional investors also pointed to the Bank of Japan's move last week to raise its main interest rate from nearly zero. Such a move helps boost the value of the Japanese yen, but it could also force traders to scramble out of deals where they borrowed money for virtually no cost in Japan and invested it elsewhere around the world.\n\nU.S. stocks pared their losses Monday after a report said growth for U.S. services businesses was a touch stronger than expected. Growth was led by businesses in the arts, entertainment and recreation businesses, along with accommodations and food services, according to the Institute for Supply Management. Treasury yields also pared their drops following the better-than-expected data.\n\nStill, stocks of companies whose profits are most closely tied to the economy's strength took sharp losses on the fears about a slowdown. The small companies in the Russell 2000 index dropped 3.7%, further dousing what had been a revival for it and other beaten-down areas of the market.\n\nMaking things worse for Wall Street, Big Tech stocks also tumbled as the market's most popular trade for much of this year continued to unravel. Apple, Nvidia and a handful of other Big Tech stocks known as the \" Magnificent Seven \" had propelled the S&P 500 to records this year, even as high interest rates weighed down much of the rest of the stock market.\n\nBut Big Tech's momentum turned last month on worries investors had taken their prices too high and expectations for future growth are becoming too difficult to meet. A set of underwhelming profit reports that began with updates from Tesla and Alphabet added to the pessimism and accelerated the declines.\n\nApple fell 3.2% Monday after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it had slashed its ownership stake in the iPhone maker.\n\nNvidia, the chip company that's become the poster child of Wall Street's AI bonanza, fell even more, 5%. Analysts cut their profit forecasts over the weekend for the company after a report from The Information said Nvidia's new AI chip is delayed. The recent selling has trimmed Nvidia's gain for the year to nearly 106% from 170% in the middle of June.\n\nBecause the Magnificent Seven companies are the market's biggest by market value, the movements for their stocks carry much more weight on the S&P 500 and other indexes.\n\nWorries outside corporate profits, interest rates and the economy are also weighing on the market. The Israel-Hamas war may be worsening, which beyond its human toll could also cause sharp swings for the price of oil. That's adding to broader worries about potential hotspots around the world, while upcoming U.S. elections could further scramble things.\n\nWall Street has been concerned about how policies coming out of November could impact markets, but the sharp swings for stock prices could affect the election itself.\n\nThe threat of a recession is likely to put Vice President Kamala Harris on the defensive. But slower growth could also further reduce inflation and force former President Donald Trump to pivot from his current focus on higher prices to outlining ways to revive the economy.\n\nAP Business Writers Elaine Kurtenbach, Matt Ott and Christopher Rugaber contributed.\n\nMore from this section\n\nMCT Reports a 6% Mortgage Lock Volume Decrease in Latest Report\n\nCooking with Bears?

The Fed has been clear about the tightrope it began walking when it started hiking rates sharply in March 2022: Being too aggressive would choke the economy, but going too soft would give inflation more oxygen and hurt everyone.\n\nGoldman Sachs economist David Mericle sees a higher chance of a recession within the next 12 months following Friday's jobs report. But he still sees only a 25% probability of that, up from 15%, in part \"because the data look fine overall\" and he does not \"see major financial imbalances.\"\n\nSome of Wall Street's recent declines may simply be air coming out of a stock market that romped to dozens of all-time highs this year, in part on a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology and hopes for coming cuts to interest rates. Critics have been saying for a while that the stock market looked expensive after prices rose faster than corporate profits.\n\n\"Markets tend to move higher like they're climbing stairs, and they go down like they're falling out a window,\" according to JJ Kinahan, CEO of IG North America, who chalks much of the recent worries to euphoria around AI subsiding amid \"a market that was ahead of itself.\"\n\nU.S. stocks briefly pared their losses a bit Monday after a report said growth for U.S. services businesses was a touch stronger than expected. Growth was led by businesses in the arts, entertainment and recreation businesses, along with accommodations and food services, according to the Institute for Supply Management. Treasury yields also pared their drops following the better-than-expected data.\n\nStill, stocks of companies whose profits are most closely tied to the economy's strength took heavy losses on the fears about a slowdown. The small companies in the Russell 2000 index dropped 4.3%, further dousing what had been a revival for it and other beaten-down areas of the market.\n\nMaking things worse for Wall Street, Big Tech stocks also tumbled sharply as the market's most popular trade for much of this year continued to unravel. Apple, Nvidia and a handful of other Big Tech stocks known as the \" Magnificent Seven \" had propelled the S&P 500 to records this year, even as high interest rates weighed down much of the rest of the stock market.\n\nBut Big Tech's momentum turned last month on worries investors had taken their prices too high and expectations for future growth are becoming too difficult to meet. A set of underwhelming profit reports that began with updates from Tesla and Alphabet added to the pessimism and accelerated the declines.\n\nApple fell 5.1% Monday after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it had slashed its ownership stake in the iPhone maker.\n\nNvidia, the chip company that's become the poster child of Wall Street's AI bonanza, fell even more, 7.7%. Analysts cut their profit forecasts over the weekend for the company after a report from The Information said Nvidia's new AI chip is delayed. It has trimmed its gain for the year to 100% from 170% in the middle of June.\n\nBecause the Magnificent Seven companies have grown to be the market's biggest by market value, the movements for their stocks carry much more weight on the S&P 500 and other indexes.\n\nWorries outside corporate profits, interest rates and the economy are also weighing on the market. The Israel-Hamas war may be worsening, which beyond its human toll could also cause sharp swings for the price of oil. That's adding to broader worries about potential hotspots around the world, while upcoming U.S. elections could further scramble things.\n\nWall Street has been concerned about how policies coming out of November could impact markets, but the sharp swings for stock prices could also affect the election itself.\n\nThe market turmoil and concerns about a weakening economy are likely to scramble a presidential race that has so far been focused mostly on immigration and inflation.\n\nThe threat of a recession is likely to put Vice President Kamala Harris on the defensive. But slower growth could also further reduce inflation and force former President Donald Trump to pivot from his current focus on higher prices to outlining ways to revive the economy.\n\nAP Business

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was reeling by 1,009 points, or 2.5%, with a little more than an hour remaining in trading, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.8%.\n\nThe drops were just the latest in a global sell-off that began last week. Japan's Nikkei 225 helped start Monday by plunging 12.4% for its worst day since the Black Monday crash of 1987.\n\nIt was the first chance for traders in Tokyo to react to Friday's report showing U.S. employers slowed their hiring last month by much more than economists expected. That was the latest piece of data on the U.S. economy to come in weaker than expected, and it's all raised fear the Federal Reserve has pressed the brakes on the U.S. economy by too much for too long through high interest rates in hopes of stifling inflation.\n\nProfessional investors cautioned that some technical factors could be amplifying the action in markets, and that the drops may be overdone, but the losses were still neck-snapping. South Korea's Kospi index careened 8.8% lower, and bitcoin dropped below $54,000 from more than $61,000 on Friday.\n\nEven gold, which has a reputation for offering safety during tumultuous times, slipped about 1%.\n\nThat's in part because traders began wondering if the damage has been so severe that the Federal Reserve will have to cut interest rates in an emergency meeting, before its next scheduled decision on Sept. 18.

South Korea's Kospi index careened 8.8% lower, stock markets across Europe sank more than 2% and bitcoin dropped 7%.\n\nEven gold, which has a reputation for offering safety during tumultuous times, slipped 1.7%.\n\nThat's in part because traders are wondering if the damage has been so severe that the Federal Reserve will have to cut interest rates in an emergency meeting, before its next scheduled decision on Sept. 18. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which closely tracks expectations for the Fed, briefly dropped below 3.70% during the morning from 3.88% late Friday and from 5% in April. It later recovered and pulled back to 3.88%.\n\n\"The Fed could ride in on a white horse to save the day with a big rate cut, but the case for an inter-meeting cut seems flimsy,\" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. \"Those are usually reserved for emergencies, like COVID, and an unemployment rate of 4.3% doesn't really seem like an emergency.\"\n\n\"The Fed could respond by stopping\" the shrinking of its holdings of Treasurys and other bonds, he said. \"That could at least by a symbolic action that they're not blind to what's going on.\"\n\nOf course, the U.S. economy is still growing, and a recession is far from a certainty. The Fed has been clear about the tightrope it began walking when it started hiking rates sharply in March 2022: Being too aggressive would choke the economy, but going too soft would give inflation more oxygen and hurt everyone.\n\nGoldman Sachs economist David Mericle sees a higher chance of a recession within the next 12 months following Friday's jobs report. But he still sees only a 25% probability of that, up from 15%, in part \"because the data look fine overall\" and he does not \"see major financial imbalances.\"\n\nSome of Wall Street's recent declines may simply be air coming out of a stock market that romped to dozens of all-time highs this year, in part on a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology and hopes for coming cuts to interest rates. Critics have been saying for a while that the stock market looked expensive after prices rose faster than corporate profits.\n\n\"Markets tend to move higher like they're climbing stairs, and they go down like they're falling out a window,\" according to JJ Kinahan, CEO of IG North America, who chalks much of the recent worries to euphoria around AI subsiding amid \"a market that was ahead of itself.\"\n\nU.S. stocks briefly pared their losses a bit Monday after a report said growth for U.S. services businesses was a touch stronger than expected. Growth was led by businesses in the arts, entertainment and recreation businesses, along with accommodations and food services, according to the Institute for Supply Management. Treasury yields also pared their drops following the better-than-expected data.\n\nStill, stocks of companies whose profits are most closely tied to the economy's strength took heavy losses on the fears about a slowdown. The small companies in the Russell 2000 index dropped 4.3%, further dousing what had been a revival for it and other beaten-down areas of the market.\n\nMaking things worse for Wall Street, Big Tech stocks also tumbled sharply as the market's most popular trade for much of this year continued to unravel. Apple, Nvidia and a handful of other Big Tech stocks known as the \" Magnificent Seven \" had propelled the S&P 500 to records this year, even as high interest rates weighed down much of the rest of the stock market.\n\nBut Big Tech's momentum turned last month on worries investors had taken their prices too high and expectations for future growth are becoming too difficult to meet. A set of underwhelming profit reports that began with updates from Tesla and Alphabet added to the pessimism and accelerated the declines.\n\nApple fell 5.1% Monday after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it had slashed its ownership stake in the iPhone maker.\n\nNvidia, the chip company that's become the poster child of Wall Street's AI bonanza, fell even more, 7.7%. Analysts cut their profit forecasts over the weekend for the company after a report from The Information said Nvidia's new AI chip is delayed. It has trimmed its gain for the year to 100% from 170% in the middle of June.\n\nBecause the Magnificent Seven companies have grown to be the market's biggest by market value, the movements for their stocks carry much more weight on the S&P 500 and other indexes.\n\nWorries outside corporate profits, interest rates and the economy are also weighing on the market. The Israel-Hamas war may be worsening, which beyond its human toll could also cause sharp swings for the price of oil. That's adding to broader worries about potential hotspots around the world, while upcoming U.S. elections could further scramble things.\n\nWall Street has been concerned about how policies coming out of November could impact markets, but the sharp swings for stock prices could also affect the election itself.\n\nThe market turmoil and concerns about a weakening economy are likely to scramble a presidential race that has so far been focused mostly on immigration and inflation.\n\nThe threat of a recession is likely to put Vice President Kamala Harris on the defensive. But slower growth could also further reduce inflation and force former President Donald Trump to pivot from his current focus on higher prices to outlining ways to revive the economy.\n\nAP Business

It's one area of the economy hurt most by high rates, and the Institute for Supply Management report helped extinguish gains for U.S. stock indexes early in the morning.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 494.82 points, or 1.2%, to 40,347.97. The Nasdaq composite sank 405.25 points, or 2.3%, to 17,194.15.\n\nIn the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury slumped to 3.97% from 4.04% late Wednesday.\n\nOther reports showed that the number of U.S. workers applying for jobless benefits hit its highest level in about a year and that productivity of U.S. workers improved in the spring.\n\nTogether, the data likely remove upward pressure on inflation and give more leeway for the Fed to cut interest rates. Yields sank the prior day after Fed Chair Jerome Powell gave the clearest indication yet that inflation may have slowed enough for rate cuts to begin in September.\n\nBut the data also raised worries that the Fed may have held rates too high for too long in its zeal to stifle inflation.\n\nThe Fed kept its main interest rate at a two-decade high for roughly a year, making it more expensive to borrow to buy a house, car or anything on credit cards. It could take months to a year for the full effects of a rate cut to filter out into the economy.\n\n\"Markets are thinking maybe the Federal Reserve should have cut yesterday,\" said Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group.\n\nStocks of companies whose profits are most closely tied to the economy's strength had some of Wall Street's sharper drops. Energy stocks in the S&P 500 fell 2.6%, for example, while industrial companies in the index weakened by 1.8%.\n\nThe small stocks in the Russell 2000 index dropped 3%.\n\nThe S&P 500 would have dropped more Thursday if not for Meta Platforms. The company behind Facebook and Instagram climbed 4.8% after reporting profit and revenue for the latest quarter that topped analysts' expectations.\n\nU.K. chip company ARM Holdings delivered better profit and revenue for the latest quarter than expected, but its U.S.-listed shares nevertheless tumbled 15.7%.\n\nAmazon and Apple fell at least 1.6% as investors waited for their latest profit reports, which arrived after trading ended for the day.\n\nStock indexes were weaker across much of Europe and Asia.", "source": {"uri": "omaha.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Omaha.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock market index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Supply_Management", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Institute for Supply Management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dow Jones Industrial Average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of the Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bond market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Cox", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Cox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/omaha.com/content/tncms/custom/image/9595a7a2-2379-11e7-b3c5-13eacc36a918.jpg?resize=600%2C315", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9785897", "eventUri": "eng-9785897", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 216, "relevance": 1}

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was reeling by 1,009 points, or 2.5%, with a little more than an hour remaining in trading, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.8%.\n\nThe drops were just the latest in a global sell-off that began last week.

He chalks much of the recent worries to euphoria around AI subsiding, with pressure rising on companies to show how AI is turning into profits, and \"a market that was ahead of itself.\"\n\nThe only way for stocks to look less expensive is either for prices to fall or for their profits to strengthen. Hope is still high for the latter, with growth for S&P 500 profits this past quarter looking to be the strongest since 2021.\n\nProfessional investors also pointed to the Bank of Japan's move last week to raise its main interest rate from nearly zero. Such a move helps boost the value of the Japanese yen, but it could also force traders to scramble out of deals where they borrowed money for virtually no cost in Japan and invested it elsewhere around the world.\n\nU.S. stocks pared their losses Monday after a report said growth for U.S. services businesses was a touch stronger than expected. Growth was led by arts, entertainment and recreation businesses, along with accommodations and food services, according to the Institute for Supply Management. Treasury yields also pared their drops following the better-than-expected data.\n\nStill, stocks of companies whose profits are most closely tied to the economy's strength took sharp losses on the fears about a slowdown. The small companies in the Russell 2000 index dropped 3.7%, further dousing what had been a revival for it and other beaten-down areas of the market.\n\nMaking things worse for Wall Street, Big Tech stocks also tumbled as the market's most popular trade for much of this year continued to unravel. Apple, Nvidia and a handful of other Big Tech stocks known as the \" Magnificent Seven \" had propelled the S&P 500 to records this year, even as high interest rates weighed down much of the rest of the stock market.\n\nBut Big Tech's momentum turned last month on worries investors had taken their prices too high and expectations for future growth are becoming too difficult to meet. A set of underwhelming profit reports that began with updates from Tesla and Alphabet added to the pessimism and accelerated the declines.\n\nApple fell 6.5% Monday after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it had slashed its ownership stake in the iPhone maker.\n\nNvidia, the chip company that's become the poster child of Wall Street's AI bonanza, fell even more, 7.2%. Analysts cut their profit forecasts over the weekend for the company after a report from The Information said Nvidia's new AI chip is delayed. The recent selling has trimmed Nvidia's gain for the year to 101.1% from 170% in the middle of June.\n\nBecause the Magnificent Seven companies are the market's biggest by market value, the movements for their stocks carry much more weight on the S&P 500 and other indexes.\n\nWorries outside corporate profits, interest rates and the economy are also weighing on the market.

But slower growth could also further reduce inflation and force former President Donald Trump to pivot from his current focus on higher prices to outlining ways to revive the economy.\n\n\"It comes down to jobs,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial.

Growth was led by businesses in the arts, entertainment and recreation businesses, along with accommodations and food services, according to the Institute for Supply Management. Treasury yields also pared their drops following the better-than-expected data.\n\nStill, stocks of companies whose profits are most closely tied to the economy's strength took heavy losses on the fears about a slowdown. The small companies in the Russell 2000 index dropped 4.3%, further dousing what had been a revival for it and other beaten-down areas of the market.\n\nMaking things worse for Wall Street, Big Tech stocks also tumbled sharply as the market's most popular trade for much of this year continued to unravel. Apple, Nvidia and a handful of other Big Tech stocks known as the \" Magnificent Seven \" had propelled the S&P 500 to records this year, even as high interest rates weighed down much of the rest of the stock market.\n\nBut Big Tech's momentum turned last month on worries investors had taken their prices too high and expectations for future growth are becoming too difficult to meet. A set of underwhelming profit reports that began with updates from Tesla and Alphabet added to the pessimism and accelerated the declines.\n\nApple fell 5.1% Monday after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it had slashed its ownership stake in the iPhone maker.\n\nNvidia, the chip company that's become the poster child of Wall Street's AI bonanza, fell even more, 7.7%.

The Israeli war on Gaza may be worsening, which beyond its human toll could also cause sharp swings for the price of oil. That's adding to broader worries about potential hotspots around the world, while upcoming US elections could further scramble things.\n\nWall Street has been concerned about how policies coming out of November could impact markets, but the sharp swings for stock prices could also affect the election itself.\n\nThe market turmoil and concerns about a weakening economy are likely to scramble a presidential race that has so far been focused mostly on immigration and inflation.\n\nThe threat of a recession is likely to put Vice President Kamala Harris on the defensive. But slower growth could also further reduce inflation and force former President Donald Trump to pivot from his current focus on higher prices to outlining ways to revive the economy.", "source":

Manufacturing has been one of areas of the economy hurt most by high rates, and the report from the Institute for Supply Management helped extinguish what had been gains for U.S. stock indexes early in the morning.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 494 points, or 1.2%, and had been down more than 700 points earlier in the day, while the Nasdaq composite sank 2.3%.\n\nThe action was even stronger in the bond market, where the yield on the 10-year Treasury tumbled below 4%, back to where it was in February. Besides the soft manufacturing data, reports earlier in the morning showed that the number of U.S. workers applying for unemployment benefits hit its highest level in about a year and that productivity for U.S. workers improved during the spring.\n\nTogether, the data likely removes upward pressure on inflation and gives more leeway for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. A day earlier, yields sank after Fed Chair Jerome Powell gave the clearest indication yet that inflation may have slowed enough for an easing of rates to begin in September.\n\nBut the data also raised worries that the Fed may have held rates too high for too long in its zeal to stifle inflation. The Fed has been keeping its main interest rate at a two-decade high for roughly a year, and that has made it more expensive to borrow to buy a house, car or anything on credit cards. And it could take months to a year for the full effects of a rate cut to filter out into the economy.\n\n\"Markets are thinking maybe the Federal Reserve should have cut yesterday,\" according to Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group.\n\nStocks of companies whose profits are most closely tied to the economy's strength had some of Wall Street's sharper drops. Energy stocks in the S&P 500 fell 2.6%, for example, while industrial companies in the index weakened by 1.8%.\n\nThe small stocks in the Russell 2000 index dropped 3%. They had soared more than the rest of the market last month on hopes that the economy would remain solid as interest rates come down, a potent cocktail for them.\n\nThe weak economic numbers raise the stakes for an already highly anticipated employment report coming Friday.\n\nEconomists expect it to show a slight slowdown in U.S. hiring last month, and Wall Street's hope is for a Goldilocks type of reading that is neither so hot that it puts upward pressure on inflation nor so cold that it worsens worries about a possible recession.\n\nBut the figures could be skewed by the effects of Hurricane Beryl, warns Kevin Khang, senior international economist at Vanguard. It could mean a headline number that looks worse than underlying fundamentals suggest.\n\nThe S&P 500 would have dropped even more Thursday if not for Meta Platforms.\n\nThe company behind Facebook and Instagram climbed 4.8% after reporting profit and revenue for the latest quarter that topped analysts' expectations.\n\nUncertainty was high heading into its report after other members of the highly influential group of stocks known as the Magnificent Seven had underwhelmed investors. This handful of tech stocks drove the S&P 500 to dozens of records this year, in part on the frenzy around artificial intelligence technology. But their momentum turned last month on worries investors had taken their prices too high and expectations for their profit gains had grown too difficult to meet.\n\nAmazon and Apple, which like Meta Platforms are also members of the Magnificent Seven, were two of the heaviest weights on the S&P 500. Each fell at least 1.6% as investors waited for their latest profit reports, which arrived after trading ended for the day.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 fell 75.62 points to 5,446.68. The Dow dropped 494.82 to 40,347.97, and the Nasdaq tumbled 405.25 to 17,194.15.\n\nIn the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury slumped from 4.04% late Wednesday and from 4.70% in April to 3.97%.\n\nInformation for this article was contributed by Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott of The Associated Press.\n\nA pair of traders work at the post of specialist James Denaro, right, on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Wednesday, July 31, 2024.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was reeling by 864 points, or 2.2%, as of 1:25 p.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite slid 2.8%.\n\nALSO READ: This job can pay $100K with no degree, and 1,800 spots are available. Hiring opens for 4 days.\n\nThe drops were just the latest in a global sell-off that began last week. Japan's Nikkei 225 helped start Monday by plunging 12.4% for its worst day since the Black Monday crash of 1987.\n\nIt was the first chance for traders in Tokyo to react to Friday's report showing U.S. employers slowed their hiring last month by much more than economists expected. That was the latest piece of data on the U.S. economy to come in weaker than expected, and it's all raised fear the Federal Reserve has pressed the brakes on the U.S. economy by too much for too long through high interest rates in hopes of stifling inflation.\n\nProfessional investors cautioned that some technical factors could be amplifying the action in markets, but the losses were still neck-snapping. South Korea's Kospi index careened 8.8% lower, stock markets across Europe sank more than 1% and bitcoin dropped below $55,000 from more than $61,000 on Friday.\n\nEven gold, which has a reputation for offering safety during tumultuous times, slipped 1%.\n\nThat's in part because traders began wondering if the damage has been so severe that the Federal Reserve will have to cut interest rates in an emergency meeting, before its next scheduled decision on Sept. 18. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which closely tracks expectations for the Fed, briefly sank below 3.70% during the morning from 3.88% late Friday and from 5% in April. It later recovered and pulled back to 3.93%.\n\nALSO READ: These are the jobs paying over $100K in the Charlotte area\n\n\"The Fed could ride in on a white horse to save the day with a big rate cut, but the case for an inter-meeting cut seems flimsy,\" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. \"Those are usually reserved for emergencies, like COVID, and an unemployment rate of 4.3% doesn't really seem like an emergency.\"\n\nThe U.S. economy is still growing, and a recession is far from a certainty. The Fed has been clear about the tightrope it began walking when it started hiking rates sharply in March 2022: Being too aggressive would choke the economy, but going too soft would give inflation more oxygen and hurt everyone.\n\nGoldman Sachs economist David Mericle sees a higher chance of a recession within the next 12 months following Friday's jobs report. But he still sees only a 25% probability of that, up from 15%, in part \"because the data look fine overall\" and he does not \"see major financial imbalances.\"\n\nSome of Wall Street's recent declines may also simply be air coming out of a stock market that romped to dozens of all-time highs this year, in part on a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology and hopes for coming cuts to interest rates. Critics have been saying for a while that the stock market looked expensive after prices rose faster than corporate profits.\n\nALSO READ: CMS to lose federal funding for 722 jobs\n\n\"Markets tend to move higher like they're climbing stairs, and they go down like they're falling out a window,\" according to JJ Kinahan, CEO of IG North America. He chalks much of the recent worries to euphoria around AI subsiding and \"a market that was ahead of itself.\"\n\nProfessional investors also pointed to the Bank of Japan's move last week to raise its main interest rate from nearly zero. Such a move helps boost the value of the Japanese yen, but it could also force traders to scramble out of deals where they borrowed money for virtually no cost in Japan and invested it elsewhere around the world.\n\nU.S. stocks pared their losses Monday after a report said growth for U.S. services businesses was a touch stronger than expected. Growth was led by businesses in the arts, entertainment and recreation businesses, along with accommodations and food services, according to the Institute for Supply Management. Treasury yields also pared their drops following the better-than-expected data.\n\nStill, stocks of companies whose profits are most closely tied to the economy's strength took sharp losses on the fears about a slowdown. The small companies in the Russell 2000 index dropped 2.8%, further dousing what had been a revival for it and other beaten-down areas of the market.\n\nALSO READ: Dozens of jobs in limbo amid changeover at Charlotte Douglas International Airport\n\nMaking things worse for Wall Street, Big Tech stocks also tumbled as the market's most popular trade for much of this year continued to unravel. Apple, Nvidia and a handful of other Big Tech stocks known as the \" Magnificent Seven \" had propelled the S&P 500 to records this year, even as high interest rates weighed down much of the rest of the stock market.\n\nBut Big Tech's momentum turned last month on worries investors had taken their prices too high and expectations for future growth are becoming too difficult to meet. A set of underwhelming profit reports that began with updates from Tesla and Alphabet added to the pessimism and accelerated the declines.\n\nApple fell 3.9% Monday after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it had slashed its ownership stake in the iPhone maker.\n\nNvidia, the chip company that's become the poster child of Wall Street's AI bonanza, fell even more, 5.5%. Analysts cut their profit forecasts over the weekend for the company after a report from The Information said Nvidia's new AI chip is delayed. The recent selling has trimmed Nvidia's gain for the year to 104% from 170% in the middle of June.\n\nBecause the Magnificent Seven companies are the market's biggest by market value, the movements for their stocks carry much more weight on the S&P 500 and other indexes.\n\nALSO READ: How much does Charlotte contribute to the state's economy?\n\nWorries outside corporate profits, interest rates and the economy are also weighing on the market. The Israel-Hamas war may be worsening, which beyond its human toll could also cause sharp swings for the price of oil. That's adding to broader worries about potential hotspots around the world, while upcoming U.S. elections could further scramble things.\n\nWall Street has been concerned about how policies coming out of November could impact markets, but the sharp swings for stock prices could affect the election itself.\n\nThe threat of a recession is likely to put Vice President Kamala Harris on the defensive. But slower growth could also further reduce inflation and force former President Donald Trump to pivot from his current focus on higher prices to outlining ways to revive the economy.\n\nA strong jobs market supports consumer spending, which drives economic growth. The link between employment and spending will remain a key focus heading into the U.S. presidential election, said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial.\n\n\"It comes down to jobs,\" she said. \"When we get to election day, the unemployment rate is going to be extremely important.\"", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Japan's Nikkei 225 helped start Monday by plunging 12.4% for its worst day since the Black Monday crash of 1987.\n\nIt was the first chance for traders in Tokyo to react to Friday's report showing U.S. employers slowed their hiring last month by much more than economists expected. That was the latest piece of data on the U.S. economy to come in weaker than expected, and it's all raised fear the Federal Reserve has pressed the brakes on the U.S. economy by too much for too long through high interest rates in hopes of stifling inflation.\n\nLosses elsewhere in the world were nearly as neck-snapping.

The Fed has been clear about the tightrope it began walking when it started hiking rates sharply in March 2022: Being too aggressive would choke the economy, but going too soft would give inflation more oxygen and hurt everyone.\n\nAfter leaving the federal funds rate steady last week, before several discouraging economic reports hit, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said officials \"have a lot of room to respond if we were to see weakness\" in the job market after raising their main rate to the highest level in more than two decades.\n\nGoldman Sachs economist David Mericle sees a higher chance of a recession following Friday's jobs report. But he still sees only a 25% probability of that, up from 15%, in part \"because the data look fine overall\" and he does not \"see major financial imbalances.\"\n\nSome of Wall Street's recent declines may simply be air coming out of a stock market that romped to dozens of all-time highs this year, in part on a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology and hopes for coming cuts to interest rates. Critics have been saying for a while that the stock market looked expensive after prices rose faster than corporate profits.\n\nU.S. stocks pared their losses a bit Monday morning after a report said growth for U.S. services businesses was a touch stronger than expected. Growth was led by businesses in the arts, entertainment and recreation businesses, along with accommodations and food services, according to the Institute for Supply Management.\n\nStill, stocks of companies whose profits are most closely tied to the economy's strength took heavy losses on the fears about a slowdown. The small companies in the Russell 2000 index dropped 4.4%, further dousing what had been a revival for it and other beaten-down areas of the market.\n\nMaking things worse for Wall Street, Big Tech stocks also tumbled sharply as the market's most popular trade for much of this year continued to unravel. Apple, Nvidia and a handful of other Big Tech stocks known as the \" Magnificent Seven \" had propelled the S&P 500 to records this year, even as high interest rates weighed down much of the rest of the stock market.\n\nBut Big Tech's momentum turned last month on worries investors had taken their prices too high and expectations for future growth are becoming too difficult to meet. A set of underwhelming profit reports that began with updates from Tesla and Alphabet added to the pessimism and accelerated the declines.\n\nApple fell 5% Monday after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it had slashed its ownership stake in the iPhone maker.\n\nNvidia, the chip company that's become the poster child of Wall Street's AI bonanza, fell even more, 9.1%. Analysts cut their profit forecasts over the weekend for the company after a report from The Information said Nvidia's new AI chip is delayed. It has trimmed its gain for the year to 97% from 170% in the middle of June.\n\nBecause the Magnificent Seven companies have grown to be the market's biggest by market value, the movements for their stocks carry much more weight on the S&P 500 and other indexes.\n\nWorries outside corporate profits, interest rates and the economy are also weighing on the market. The Israel-Hamas war may be worsening, which beyond its human toll could also cause sharp swings for the price of oil. That's adding to broader worries about potential hotspots around the world, while upcoming U.S. elections could further scramble things.\n\nWall Street has been concerned about how policies coming out of November could impact markets, but the sharp swings for stock prices could also affect the election itself.", "source": {"uri": "13wmaz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WMAZ"}, "authors": [],

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 481 points, or 1.2%, as of 9:35 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 2.6% lower.\n\nA report showing hiring by U.S. employers slowed last month by much more than economists expected sent fear through markets, with both stocks and bond yields dropping sharply. It followed a batch of weaker-than-expected reports on the economy from a day earlier, including a worsening for U.S. manufacturing activity, which has been one of the areas most hurt by high rates.\n\nIt was just a couple days ago that U.S. stock indexes jumped to their best day in months after Fed Chair Jerome Powell gave the clearest indication yet that inflation has slowed enough for cuts to interest rates to begin in September. Now, worries are rising that the Fed kept its main interest rate at a two-decade high for too long in its zeal to stifle inflation. A rate cut could take months to a year to filter through the economy.\n\n\"The Fed is seizing defeat from the jaws of victory,\" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. \"Economic momentum has slowed so much that a rate cut in September will be too little and too late. They'll have to do something bigger than\" the traditional cut of a quarter of a percentage point \"to avert a recession.\"\n\nU.S. stocks had already appeared to be headed for losses before the disappointing jobs report thudded onto Wall Street.\n\nSeveral big technology companies turned in underwhelming profit reports, which continued a dispiriting run that began last week with results from Tesla and Alphabet.\n\nAmazon fell 10% after reporting weaker revenue for the latest quarter than expected. The retail giant also gave a forecast for operating profit for the summer that fell short of analysts' expectations.\n\nIntel fell even more, 27.7%, after the chip company's profit for the latest quarter fell well short of forecasts. It also suspended its dividend payment and said it expects to lose money in the third quarter, when analysts were expecting a profit.\n\nApple was holding a bit steadier, up 0.7%, after reporting better profit and revenue than expected.\n\nApple and a handful of other Big Tech stocks known as the \" Magnificent Seven \" have been the main reasons the S&P 500 has set dozens of records this year, in part on the frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. But their momentum turned last month on worries investors had taken their prices too high and expectations for their profit gains had grown too difficult to meet.\n\nHelpfully for Wall Street, other areas of the stock market that had been beaten down by high interest rates were rebounding at the same time, particularly smaller companies. But they tumbled too on Friday on worries that a fragile economy could undercut their profits.\n\nThe Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks dropped 3.7%, more than the rest of the market.\n\nIn the bond market, Treasury yields fell sharply as traders raised their expectations for how deeply the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates at its next meeting in September. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 3.85% from 3.98% late Thursday and from 4.70% in April.\n\nAmid all the fear, some voices on Wall Street were still advising caution.\n\n\"While worries of a policy mistake are rising, one negative miss shouldn't lead to overreaction,\" according to Lara Castleton, U.S. head of portfolio construction and strategy at Janus Henderson Investors.\n\nShe points out that the U.S. economy is still growing, and inflation is still coming down. The S&P 500, meanwhile, isn't far off its record set two weeks ago. \"Equities selling off should be seen as a normal reaction, especially considering the high valuations in many pockets of the market. It's a good reminder for investors to focus on the earnings of companies going forward.\"\n\nIn stock markets abroad, Japan's Nikkei 225 dropped 5.8%, back to where it was trading in January before it surged to an all-time high last month. Japanese stocks have been struggling after the Bank of Japan raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday. That pushed the value of the Japanese yen higher against the U.S. dollar, potentially hurting profits for exporters and deflating a boom in tourism.\n\nChinese stocks extended losses this week as investors registered disappointment with the government's latest efforts to spur growth through various piecemeal measures, instead of hoped-for infusions of broader stimulus.\n\nStock indexes also fell across much of Europe.\n\nThe nerve-wracking week for markets has come even as central banks in Japan, the United States and England acted pretty much as expected. Japan raised its benchmark rate, the Fed stood pat and the Bank of England lowered its key rate for the first time in more than four years.\n\nCommodity prices have also had a rough ride, with oil prices surging after the killings of leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah that fueled fears conflict in the Middle East might escalate into a wider war. But prices fell back Thursday and Friday on worries about the economy.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1,092 points, or 2.7%, as of 10:40 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.6%.\n\nThe drops were just the latest in a sell-off that swept the Earth. Japan's Nikkei 225 helped start Monday by plunging 12.4% for its worst day since the Black Monday crash of 1987.\n\nIt was the first chance for traders in Tokyo to react to Friday's report showing U.S. employers slowed their hiring last month by much more than economists expected. That was the latest piece of data on the U.S. economy to come in weaker than expected, and it's all raised fear the Federal Reserve has pressed the brakes on the U.S. economy by too much for too long through high interest rates in hopes of stifling inflation.\n\nLosses elsewhere in the world were nearly as neck-snapping. South Korea's Kospi index careened 8.8% lower, stock markets across Europe sank more than 2% and bitcoin dropped 7%.\n\nEven gold, which has a reputation for offering safety during tumultuous times, slipped 1.7%.\n\nThat's in part because traders are wondering if the damage has been so severe that the Federal Reserve will have to cut interest rates in an emergency meeting, before its next scheduled decision on Sept. 18. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which closely tracks expectations for the Fed, briefly dropped below 3.70% during the morning from 3.88% late Friday and from 5% in April. It later recovered and pulled back to 3.88%.\n\n\"The Fed could ride in on a white horse to save the day with a big rate cut, but the case for an inter-meeting cut seems flimsy,\" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. \"Those are usually reserved for emergencies, like COVID, and an unemployment rate of 4.3% doesn't really seem like an emergency.\"\n\n\"The Fed could respond by stopping\" the shrinking of its holdings of Treasurys and other bonds, he said. \"That could at least by a symbolic action that they're not blind to what's going on.\"\n\nOf course, the U.S. economy is still growing, and a recession is far from a certainty. The Fed has been clear about the tightrope it began walking when it started hiking rates sharply in March 2022: Being too aggressive would choke the economy, but going too soft would give inflation more oxygen and hurt everyone.\n\nGoldman Sachs economist David Mericle sees a higher chance of a recession within the next 12 months following Friday's jobs report. But he still sees only a 25% probability of that, up from 15%, in part \"because the data look fine overall\" and he does not \"see major financial imbalances.\"\n\nSome of Wall Street's recent declines may simply be air coming out of a stock market that romped to dozens of all-time highs this year, in part on a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology and hopes for coming cuts to interest rates. Critics have been saying for a while that the stock market looked expensive after prices rose faster than corporate profits.\n\n\"Markets tend to move higher like they're climbing stairs, and they go down like they're falling out a window,\" according to JJ Kinahan, CEO of IG North America, who chalks much of the recent worries to euphoria around AI subsiding amid \"a market that was ahead of itself.\"\n\nU.S. stocks briefly pared their losses a bit Monday after a report said growth for U.S. services businesses was a touch stronger than expected. Growth was led by businesses in the arts, entertainment and recreation businesses, along with accommodations and food services, according to the Institute for Supply Management. Treasury yields also pared their drops following the better-than-expected data.\n\nStill, stocks of companies whose profits are most closely tied to the economy's strength took heavy losses on the fears about a slowdown. The small companies in the Russell 2000 index dropped 4.3%, further dousing what had been a revival for it and other beaten-down areas of the market.\n\nMaking things worse for Wall Street, Big Tech stocks also tumbled sharply as the market's most popular trade for much of this year continued to unravel. Apple, Nvidia and a handful of other Big Tech stocks known as the \" Magnificent Seven \" had propelled the S&P 500 to records this year, even as high interest rates weighed down much of the rest of the stock market.\n\nBut Big Tech's momentum turned last month on worries investors had taken their prices too high and expectations for future growth are becoming too difficult to meet. A set of underwhelming profit reports that began with updates from Tesla and Alphabet added to the pessimism and accelerated the declines.\n\nApple fell 5.1% Monday after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it had slashed its ownership stake in the iPhone maker.\n\nNvidia, the chip company that's become the poster child of Wall Street's AI bonanza, fell even more, 7.7%. Analysts cut their profit forecasts over the weekend for the company after a report from The Information said Nvidia's new AI chip is delayed. It has trimmed its gain for the year to 100% from 170% in the middle of June.\n\nBecause the Magnificent Seven companies have grown to be the market's biggest by market value, the movements for their stocks carry much more weight on the S&P 500 and other indexes.\n\nWorries outside corporate profits, interest rates and the economy are also weighing on the market. The Israel-Hamas war may be worsening, which beyond its human toll could also cause sharp swings for the price of oil. That's adding to broader worries about potential hotspots around the world, while upcoming U.S. elections could further scramble things.\n\nWall Street has been concerned about how policies coming out of November could impact markets, but the sharp swings for stock prices could also affect the election itself.\n\nThe market turmoil and concerns about a weakening economy are likely to scramble a presidential race that has so far been focused mostly on immigration and inflation.\n\nThe threat of a recession is likely to put Vice President Kamala Harris on the defensive. But slower growth could also further reduce inflation and force former President Donald Trump to pivot from his current focus on higher prices to outlining ways to revive the economy.\n\n___\n\nAP

The S&P 500 sank 2.1% in midday trading Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 763 points, and the Nasdaq composite slid 2.4%. That followed a 12.4% plunge for Japan's Nikkei 225, its worst day since 1987. Stocks and Treasury yields pared their losses after a report showed U.S. services businesses are continuing to grow. But worries are still high after Friday's report showed U.S. employers pulled back on hiring last month by more than expected.\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Nearly everything on Wall Street is tumbling Monday as fear about a slowing U.S. economy worsens and sets off another sell-off for financial markets around the world.\n\nThe S&P 500 was down by 2.1% in midday trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was reeling by 763 points, or 1.9%, as of 12:20 p.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite slid 2.4%.\n\nThe drops were just the latest in a global sell-off that began last week. Japan's Nikkei 225 helped start Monday by plunging 12.4% for its worst day since the Black Monday crash of 1987.\n\nIt was the first chance for traders in Tokyo to react to Friday's report showing U.S. employers slowed their hiring last month by much more than economists expected. That was the latest piece of data on the U.S. economy to come in weaker than expected, and it's all raised fear the Federal Reserve has pressed the brakes on the U.S. economy by too much for too long through high interest rates in hopes of stifling inflation.\n\nProfessional investors cautioned that some technical factors could be amplifying the action in markets, but the losses were still neck-snapping. South Korea's Kospi index careened 8.8% lower, stock markets across Europe sank more than 2% and bitcoin dropped below $55,000 from more than $61,000 on Friday.\n\nEven gold, which has a reputation for offering safety during tumultuous times, slipped 1%.\n\nThat's in part because traders began wondering if the damage has been so severe that the Federal Reserve will have to cut interest rates in an emergency meeting, before its next scheduled decision on Sept. 18. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which closely tracks expectations for the Fed, briefly sank below 3.70% during the morning from 3.88% late Friday and from 5% in April. It later recovered and pulled back to 3.93%.\n\n\"The Fed could ride in on a white horse to save the day with a big rate cut, but the case for an inter-meeting cut seems flimsy,\" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. \"Those are usually reserved for emergencies, like COVID, and an unemployment rate of 4.3% doesn't really seem like an emergency.\"\n\nThe U.S. economy is still growing, and a recession is far from a certainty. The Fed has been clear about the tightrope it began walking when it started hiking rates sharply in March 2022: Being too aggressive would choke the economy, but going too soft would give inflation more oxygen and hurt everyone.\n\nGoldman Sachs economist David Mericle sees a higher chance of a recession within the next 12 months following Friday's jobs report. But he still sees only a 25% probability of that, up from 15%, in part \"because the data look fine overall\" and he does not \"see major financial imbalances.\"\n\nSome of Wall Street's recent declines may also simply be air coming out of a stock market that romped to dozens of all-time highs this year, in part on a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology and hopes for coming cuts to interest rates. Critics have been saying for a while that the stock market looked expensive after prices rose faster than corporate profits.\n\n\"Markets tend to move higher like they're climbing stairs, and they go down like they're falling out a window,\" according to JJ Kinahan, CEO of IG North America. He chalks much of the recent worries to euphoria around AI subsiding and \"a market that was ahead of itself.\"\n\nProfessional investors also pointed to the Bank of Japan's move last week to raise its main interest rate from nearly zero. Such a move helps boost the value of the Japanese yen, but it could also force traders to scramble out of deals where they borrowed money for virtually no cost in Japan and invested it elsewhere around the world.\n\nU.S. stocks pared their losses Monday after a report said growth for U.S. services businesses was a touch stronger than expected. Growth was led by businesses in the arts, entertainment and recreation businesses, along with accommodations and food services, according to the Institute for Supply Management. Treasury yields also pared their drops following the better-than-expected data.\n\nStill, stocks of companies whose profits are most closely tied to the economy's strength took sharp losses on the fears about a slowdown. The small companies in the Russell 2000 index dropped 2.8%, further dousing what had been a revival for it and other beaten-down areas of the market.\n\nMaking things worse for Wall Street, Big Tech stocks also tumbled as the market's most popular trade for much of this year continued to unravel. Apple, Nvidia and a handful of other Big Tech stocks known as the \" Magnificent Seven \" had propelled the S&P 500 to records this year, even as high interest rates weighed down much of the rest of the stock market.\n\nBut Big Tech's momentum turned last month on worries investors had taken their prices too high and expectations for future growth are becoming too difficult to meet. A set of underwhelming profit reports that began with updates from Tesla and Alphabet added to the pessimism and accelerated the declines.\n\nApple fell 3.7% Monday after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it had slashed its ownership stake in the iPhone maker.\n\nNvidia, the chip company that's become the poster child of Wall Street's AI bonanza, fell even more, 6%. Analysts cut their profit forecasts over the weekend for the company after a report from The Information said Nvidia's new AI chip is delayed. The recent selling has trimmed Nvidia's gain for the year to nearly 104% from 170% in the middle of June.\n\nBecause the Magnificent Seven companies are the market's biggest by market value, the movements for their stocks carry much more weight on the S&P 500 and other indexes.\n\nWorries outside corporate profits, interest rates and the economy are also weighing on the market. The Israel-Hamas war may be worsening, which beyond its human toll could also cause sharp swings for the price of oil. That's adding to broader worries about potential hotspots around the world, while upcoming U.S. elections could further scramble things.\n\nWall Street has been concerned about how policies coming out of November could impact markets, but the sharp swings for stock prices could affect the election itself.\n\nThe threat of a recession is likely to put Vice President Kamala Harris on the defensive. But slower growth could also further reduce inflation and force former President Donald Trump to pivot from his current focus on higher prices to outlining ways to revive the economy.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Elaine Kurtenbach, Matt Ott and Christopher Rugaber contributed.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was reeling by 864 points, or 2.2%, as of 11:40 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite slid 2.7%.\n\nThe drops were just the latest in a global sell-off that began last week. Japan\u00b4s Nikkei 225 helped start Monday by plunging 12.4% for its worst day since the Black Monday crash of 1987.\n\nIt was the first chance for traders in Tokyo to react to Friday\u00b4s report showing U.S. employers slowed their hiring last month by much more than economists expected. That was the latest piece of data on the U.S. economy to come in weaker than expected, and it\u00b4s all raised fear the Federal Reserve has pressed the brakes on the U.S. economy by too much for too long through high interest rates in hopes of stifling inflation.\n\nProfessional investors cautioned that some technical factors could be amplifying the action in markets, but the losses were still neck-snapping. South Korea\u00b4s Kospi index careened 8.8% lower, stock markets across Europe sank more than 2% and bitcoin dropped below $55,000 from more than $61,000 on Friday.\n\nEven gold, which has a reputation for offering safety during tumultuous times, slipped 1%.\n\nSpecialist Dilip Patel works at his post on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Monday, Aug. 5, 2024. Nearly everything on Wall Street is tumbling as fear about a slowing U.S. economy worsens and sets off another sell-off for financial markets around the world.(AP Photo/Richard Drew)\n\nThat\u00b4s in part because traders began wondering if the damage has been so severe that the Federal Reserve will have to cut interest rates in an emergency meeting, before its next scheduled decision on Sept. 18. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which closely tracks expectations for the Fed, briefly sank below 3.70% during the morning from 3.88% late Friday and from 5% in April. It later recovered and pulled back to 3.90%.\n\n\"The Fed could ride in on a white horse to save the day with a big rate cut, but the case for an inter-meeting cut seems flimsy,\" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. \"Those are usually reserved for emergencies, like COVID, and an unemployment rate of 4.3% doesn\u00b4t really seem like an emergency.\"\n\nThe U.S. economy is still growing, and a recession is far from a certainty. The Fed has been clear about the tightrope it began walking when it started hiking rates sharply in March 2022: Being too aggressive would choke the economy, but going too soft would give inflation more oxygen and hurt everyone.\n\nGoldman Sachs economist David Mericle sees a higher chance of a recession within the next 12 months following Friday\u00b4s jobs report. But he still sees only a 25% probability of that, up from 15%, in part \"because the data look fine overall\" and he does not \"see major financial imbalances.\"\n\nSome of Wall Street's recent declines may also simply be air coming out of a stock market that romped to dozens of all-time highs this year, in part on a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology and hopes for coming cuts to interest rates. Critics have been saying for a while that the stock market looked expensive after prices rose faster than corporate profits.\n\n\"Markets tend to move higher like they\u00b4re climbing stairs, and they go down like they\u00b4re falling out a window,\" according to JJ Kinahan, CEO of IG North America. He chalks much of the recent worries to euphoria around AI subsiding and \"a market that was ahead of itself.\"\n\nProfessional investors also pointed to the Bank of Japan's move last week to raise its main interest rate from nearly zero. Such a move helps boost the value of the Japanese yen, but it could also force traders to scramble out of deals where they borrowed money for virtually no cost in Japan and invested it elsewhere around the world.\n\nU.S. stocks pared their losses Monday after a report said growth for U.S. services businesses was a touch stronger than expected. Growth was led by businesses in the arts, entertainment and recreation businesses, along with accommodations and food services, according to the Institute for Supply Management. Treasury yields also pared their drops following the better-than-expected data.\n\nStill, stocks of companies whose profits are most closely tied to the economy\u00b4s strength took sharp losses on the fears about a slowdown. The small companies in the Russell 2000 index dropped 3.7%, further dousing what had been a revival for it and other beaten-down areas of the market.\n\nMaking things worse for Wall Street, Big Tech stocks also tumbled as the market\u00b4s most popular trade for much of this year continued to unravel. Apple, Nvidia and a handful of other Big Tech stocks known as the \" Magnificent Seven \" had propelled the S&P 500 to records this year, even as high interest rates weighed down much of the rest of the stock market.\n\nBut Big Tech\u00b4s momentum turned last month on worries investors had taken their prices too high and expectations for future growth are becoming too difficult to meet. A set of underwhelming profit reports that began with updates from Tesla and Alphabet added to the pessimism and accelerated the declines.\n\nApple fell 3.2% Monday after Warren Buffett\u00b4s Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it had slashed its ownership stake in the iPhone maker.\n\nNvidia, the chip company that\u00b4s become the poster child of Wall Street\u00b4s AI bonanza, fell even more, 5%. Analysts cut their profit forecasts over the weekend for the company after a report from The Information said Nvidia\u00b4s new AI chip is delayed. The recent selling has trimmed Nvidia's gain for the year to nearly 106% from 170% in the middle of June.\n\nBecause the Magnificent Seven companies are the market\u00b4s biggest by market value, the movements for their stocks carry much more weight on the S&P 500 and other indexes.\n\nWorries outside corporate profits, interest rates and the economy are also weighing on the market. The Israel-Hamas war may be worsening, which beyond its human toll could also cause sharp swings for the price of oil. That\u00b4s adding to broader worries about potential hotspots around the world, while upcoming U.S. elections could further scramble things.\n\nWall Street has been concerned about how policies coming out of November could impact markets, but the sharp swings for stock prices could affect the election itself.\n\nThe threat of a recession is likely to put Vice President Kamala Harris on the defensive. But slower growth could also further reduce inflation and force former President Donald Trump to pivot from his current focus on higher prices to outlining ways to revive the economy.\n\nAP Business Writers Elaine Kurtenbach, Matt Ott and Christopher Rugaber contributed.\n\nFILE - Trader John Romolo works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Aug. 2, 2024.

Richard Drew/Associated Press\n\nNEW YORK -- Nearly everything on Wall Street is tumbling Monday as fear about a slowing U.S. economy worsens and sets off another sell-off for financial markets around the world.\n\nThe S&P 500 was down by 3.1% in morning trading, coming off its worst week in more than three months.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 996 points, or 2.5%, as of 9:50 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.8%.\n\nThe drops were just the latest in a sell-off that swept the Earth. Japan's Nikkei 225 helped start Monday by plunging 12.4% for its worst day since the Black Monday crash of 1987.\n\nIt was the first chance for traders in Tokyo to react to Friday's report showing U.S. employers slowed their hiring last month by much more than economists expected. That was the latest piece of data on the U.S. economy to come in weaker than expected, and it's all raised fear the Federal Reserve has pressed the brakes on the U.S. economy by too much for too long through high interest rates in hopes of stifling inflation.\n\nLosses elsewhere in the world were nearly as neck-snapping. South Korea's Kospi index careened 8.8% lower, stock markets across Europe sank roughly 3% and bitcoin dropped 12%.\n\nEven gold, which has a reputation for offering safety during tumultuous times, slipped 1.6%.\n\nThat's in part because traders are wondering if the damage has been so severe that the Federal Reserve will have to cut interest rates in an emergency meeting, before its next scheduled decision on Sept. 18. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which closely tracks expectations for the Fed, fell to 3.79% from 3.88% late Friday and from 5% in April.\n\n\"The Fed could ride in on a white horse to save the day with a big rate cut, but the case for an inter-meeting cut seems flimsy,\" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. \"Those are usually reserved for emergencies, like COVID, and an unemployment rate of 4.3% doesn't really seem like an emergency.\"\n\n\"The Fed could respond by stopping\" the shrinking of its holdings of Treasurys and other bonds, which could put less upward pressure on longer-term yields, he said. \"That could at least by a symbolic action that they're not blind to what's going on.\"\n\nOf course, the U.S. economy is still growing, and a recession is far from assured. The Fed has been clear about the tightrope it began walking when it started hiking rates sharply in March 2022: Being too aggressive would choke the economy, but going too soft would give inflation more oxygen and hurt everyone.\n\nAfter leaving the federal funds rate steady last week, before several discouraging economic reports hit, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said officials \"have a lot of room to respond if we were to see weakness\" in the job market after raising their main rate to the highest level in more than two decades.\n\nGoldman Sachs economist David Mericle sees a higher chance of a recession following Friday's jobs report. But he still sees only a 25% chance of that, up from 15%, in part \"because the data look fine overall\" and he does not \"see major financial imbalances.\"\n\nStill, stocks of companies whose profits are most closely tied to the economy's strength took heavy losses on the fears about a sharp slowdown. The small companies in the Russell 2000 index dropped 5.5%, further dousing what had been a revival for it and other beaten-down areas of the market.\n\nMaking things worse for Wall Street, Big Tech stocks also tumbled sharply as the market's most popular trade for much of this year continued to unravel. Apple, Nvidia and a handful of other Big Tech stocks known as the \" Magnificent Seven \" had propelled the S&P 500 to dozens of all-time highs this year, in part on a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. They were so strong that they overshadowed weakness for areas of the stock market weighed down by high interest rates.\n\nBut Big Tech's momentum turned last month on worries investors had taken their prices too high and expectations for future growth are becoming too difficult to meet. A set of underwhelming profit reports from Tesla and Alphabet added to the pessimism and accelerated the declines.\n\nApple fell 4.6% Monday after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it had slashed its ownership stake in the iPhone maker.\n\nNvidia, the chip company that's become the poster child of Wall Street's AI bonanza, fell even more, 8.3%. Analysts cut their profit forecasts over the weekend for the company after a report from The Information said Nvidia's new AI chip is delayed. It has trimmed its gain for the year to 98.7% from 170% in the middle of June.\n\nBecause the Magnificent Seven companies have grown to be the market's biggest by market value, the movements for their stocks carry much more weight on the S&P 500 and other indexes.\n\nWorries outside corporate profits, interest rates and the economy are also weighing on the market. The Israel-Hamas war may be worsening, which beyond its human toll could also cause sharp swings for the price of oil. That's adding to broader worries about potential hotspots around the world, while upcoming U.S. elections could further scramble things.\n\nAP Business Writers Elaine Kurtenbach and Matt Ott

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 610 points, or 1.5%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 2.4% as a sell-off for stocks whipped all the way around the world back to Wall Street.\n\nA report showing hiring by U.S. employers slowed last month by much more than economists expected sent fear through markets, with both stocks and bond yields dropping sharply. It followed a batch of weaker-than-expected reports on the economy from a day earlier, including a worsening for U.S. manufacturing activity, which has been one of the areas hurt most by high rates.\n\nIt was just a couple days ago that U.S. stock indexes jumped to their best day in months after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave the clearest indication yet that inflation has slowed enough for cuts to rates to begin in September.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nValparaiso University to eliminate 30 academic programs Mind on Money: For the economy, time will tell Pierogi Fest grew from one vendor who sold out in an hour to a wall-to-wall crush of starch-seeking revelers, expects record attendance UPDATE: Valpo woman identified as deceased in fatal U.S. 20 crash Portillo's set to open Orland Park drive-thru by 2025 Region native captures Olympic medal in Paris Police release photos of woman sought in check scam Davich: 'Mr. Safety' killed at dangerous bike trail intersection in Region 5-year-old dies after being found in pool, Griffith police say 24-Hour Pierogi People: Annual Whiting festival elevates the dumpling to an artform NWI Business Ins and Outs: Cajun Express, Fuerte Restaurant, Frankie's Philly Steak, The Waxi Taxi, Phenix Salon Suites and Boot Barn opening Pastor seeks to dump video of him allegedly battering child Former U.S. Steel South Works site to be transformed into quantum computing park Man found in Region basement beaten with ax handle, cops say State police arrest 19 during blitzes on I-94, I-65, department says\n\nNow, worries are rising the Fed may have kept its main interest rate at a two-decade high for too long. A rate cut would make it easier for U.S. households and companies to borrow money and boost the economy, but it could take months to a year for the full effects to filter through.\n\n\"The Fed is seizing defeat from the jaws of victory,\" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. \"Economic momentum has slowed so much that a rate cut in September will be too little and too late. They'll have to do something bigger than\" the traditional cut of a quarter of a percentage point \"to avert a recession.\"\n\nTraders are now betting on a 70% probability that the Fed will cut its main interest rate by half a percentage point in September, according to data from CME Group. That's even though Powell said Wednesday that such a deep reduction is \"not something we're thinking about right now.\"\n\nOf course, the U.S. economy is still growing, and a recession is far from a certainty. The Fed has been clear about the tightrope it's walking since it started hiking rates sharply in March 2022: Being too aggressive would choke the economy, but going too soft would give inflation more oxygen.\n\nWhile refusing to claim victory on either the jobs or the inflation fronts on Wednesday, before the discouraging economic reports hit, Powell said Fed officials \"have a lot of room to respond if we were to see weakness\" in the job market after hiking its main rate so high.\n\n\"Certainly today's job data feeds the weakening economy narrative, but I believe the market is overreacting at this point and pricing too much in on rate cuts at this stage,\" said Nate Thooft, senior portfolio manager at Manulife Investment Management. \"Yes, the economy is weakening, but I am not convinced there is enough evidence that the data so far is a death knell for the economy.\"\n\nU.S. stocks had already appeared to be headed for losses Friday before the disappointing jobs report thudded onto Wall Street.\n\nSeveral big technology companies turned in underwhelming profit reports, which continued a mostly dispiriting run that began last week with results from Tesla and Alphabet.\n\nAmazon fell 8.8% after reporting weaker revenue for the latest quarter than expected. The retail and tech giant also gave a forecast for operating profit for the summer that fell short of analysts' expectations.\n\nIntel dropped even more, 26.1%, for its worst day in 50 years, after the chip company's profit for the latest quarter fell well short of forecasts. It also suspended its dividend payment and forecast a loss for the third quarter, when analysts were expecting a profit.\n\nApple held steadier, up 0.7%, after reporting better profit and revenue than expected.\n\nApple and a handful of other Big Tech stocks known as the \" Magnificent Seven \" were the main reasons the S&P 500 set dozens of records this year, in part on a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. But their momentum turned last month on worries investors had taken their prices too high.\n\nFriday's losses for tech stocks dragged the Nasdaq composite 10% below its record set last month. That level of drop is what traders call a \"correction.\"\n\nHelpfully for Wall Street, other areas of the stock market beaten down by high interest rates began rebounding sharply last month when tech stocks were regressing, particularly smaller companies. But they tumbled too Friday on worries that a fragile economy could undercut their profits.\n\nThe Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks dropped 3.5%, more than the rest of the market.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 fell 100.12 points to 5,346.56. The Dow dropped 610.71 to 39.737.26, and the Nasdaq composite fell 417.98 to 16,776.16.\n\nIn the bond market, Treasury yields fell sharply as traders forecasted deeper cuts to rates coming from the Federal Reserve. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 3.79% from 3.98% late Thursday and from 4.70% in April.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, Japan's Nikkei 225 dropped 5.8%. It's been struggling since the Bank of Japan raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday. The hike pushed up the value of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar, which could hurt profits for exporters and deflate a boom in tourism.\n\nChinese stocks fell as investors registered disappointment with the government's latest efforts to spur growth through various piecemeal measures, instead of hoped-for infusions of broader stimulus, while stock indexes dropped by more than 1% across much of Europe.\n\nCommodity prices also had a rough ride this week. Oil prices leaped after the killings of leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah fueled fears that a widening conflict in the Middle East could disrupt the flow of crude.\n\nBut prices fell back Thursday and Friday on worries that a weakening economy would burn less fuel. A barrel of benchmark U.S. crude dropped back below $74 Friday after coming into the week above $77.\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nThe business news you

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was reeling by 763 points, or 1.9 per cent, as of 12:20 p.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite slid 2.4 per cent.\n\nThe drops were just the latest in a global sell-off that began last week. Japan's Nikkei 225 helped start Monday by plunging 12.4 per cent for its worst day since the Black Monday crash of 1987.\n\nIt was the first chance for traders in Tokyo to react to Friday's report showing U.S. employers slowed their hiring last month by much more than economists expected. That was the latest piece of data on the U.S. economy to come in weaker than expected, and it's all raised fear the Federal Reserve has pressed the brakes on the U.S. economy by too much for too long through high interest rates in hopes of stifling inflation.\n\nProfessional investors cautioned that some technical factors could be amplifying the action in markets, but the losses were still neck-snapping. South Korea's Kospi index careened 8.8 per cent lower, stock markets across Europe sank more than 2 per cent and bitcoin dropped below US$55,000 from more than US$61,000 on Friday.\n\nEven gold, which has a reputation for offering safety during tumultuous times, slipped one per cent.\n\nThat's in part because traders began wondering if the damage has been so severe that the Federal Reserve will have to cut interest rates in an emergency meeting, before its next scheduled decision on Sept. 18. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which closely tracks expectations for the Fed, briefly sank below 3.70 per cent during the morning from 3.88 per cent late Friday and from 5 per cent in April. It later recovered and pulled back to 3.93 per cent.\n\n\"The Fed could ride in on a white horse to save the day with a big rate cut, but the case for an inter-meeting cut seems flimsy,\" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. \"Those are usually reserved for emergencies, like COVID, and an unemployment rate of 4.3 per cent doesn't really seem like an emergency.\"\n\nThe U.S. economy is still growing, and a recession is far from a certainty. The Fed has been clear about the tightrope it began walking when it started hiking rates sharply in March 2022: Being too aggressive would choke the economy, but going too soft would give inflation more oxygen and hurt everyone.\n\nGoldman Sachs economist David Mericle sees a higher chance of a recession within the next 12 months following Friday's jobs report. But he still sees only a 25 per cent probability of that, up from 15 per cent, in part \"because the data look fine overall\" and he does not \"see major financial imbalances.\"\n\nSome of Wall Street's recent declines may also simply be air coming out of a stock market that romped to dozens of all-time highs this year, in part on a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology and hopes for coming cuts to interest rates. Critics have been saying for a while that the stock market looked expensive after prices rose faster than corporate profits.\n\n\"Markets tend to move higher like they're climbing stairs, and they go down like they're falling out a window,\" according to JJ Kinahan, CEO of IG North America. He chalks much of the recent worries to euphoria around AI subsiding and \"a market that was ahead of itself.\"\n\nProfessional investors also pointed to the Bank of Japan's move last week to raise its main interest rate from nearly zero. Such a move helps boost the value of the Japanese yen, but it could also force traders to scramble out of deals where they borrowed money for virtually no cost in Japan and invested it elsewhere around the world.\n\nU.S. stocks pared their losses Monday after a report said growth for U.S. services businesses was a touch stronger than expected. Growth was led by businesses in the arts, entertainment and recreation businesses, along with accommodations and food services, according to the Institute for Supply Management.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 956 points, or 2.4%, as of 10:10 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite slid 4%.\n\nThe drops were just the latest in a sell-off that swept the Earth. Japan's Nikkei 225 helped start Monday by plunging 12.4% for its worst day since the Black Monday crash of 1987.\n\nIt was the first chance for traders in Tokyo to react to Friday's report showing U.S. employers slowed their hiring last month by much more than economists expected.

The Fed has been clear about the tightrope it began walking when it started hiking rates sharply in March 2022: Being too aggressive would choke the economy, but going too soft would give inflation more oxygen and hurt everyone.\n\nAfter leaving the federal funds rate steady last week, before several discouraging economic reports hit, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said officials \"have a lot of room to respond if we were to see weakness\" in the job market after raising their main rate to the highest level in more than two decades.\n\nGoldman Sachs economist David Mericle sees a higher chance of a recession following Friday's jobs report. But he still sees only a 25% probability of that, up from 15%, in part \"because the data look fine overall\" and he does not \"see major financial imbalances.\"\n\nSome of Wall Street's recent declines may simply be air coming out of a stock market that romped to dozens of all-time highs this year, in part on a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology and hopes for coming cuts to interest rates. Critics have been saying for a while that the stock market looked expensive after prices rose faster than corporate profits.\n\nU.S. stocks pared their losses a bit Monday morning after a report said growth for U.S. services businesses was a touch stronger than expected. Growth was led by businesses in the arts, entertainment and recreation businesses, along with accommodations and food services, according to the Institute for Supply Management.\n\nStill, stocks of companies whose profits are most closely tied to the economy's strength took heavy losses on the fears about a slowdown. The small companies in the Russell 2000 index dropped 4.4%, further dousing what had been a revival for it and other beaten-down areas of the market.\n\nMaking things worse for Wall Street, Big Tech stocks also tumbled sharply as the market's most popular trade for much of this year continued to unravel.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1,197 points, or 3%, as of 9:35 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite slid 5.5% to pull it 15% below its record set last month.\n\nThe drops were just the latest in a sell-off that swept the Earth. Japan's Nikkei 225 helped start Monday by plunging 12.4% for its worst day since the Black Monday crash of 1987.\n\nIt was the first chance for traders in Tokyo to react to Friday's report showing U.S. employers slowed their hiring last month by much more than economists expected. That was the latest piece of data on the U.S. economy to come in weaker than expected, and it's all raised fear the Federal Reserve has pressed the brakes on the U.S. economy by too much for too long through high interest rates in hopes of stifling inflation.\n\nLosses elsewhere in the world were nearly as neck-snapping. South Korea's Kospi index careened 8.8% lower, stock markets across Europe sank roughly 3% and bitcoin dropped 12%.\n\nEven gold, which has a reputation for offering safety during tumultuous times, slipped nearly 2%.\n\nThat's in part because traders are wondering if the damage has been so severe that the Federal Reserve will have to cut interest rates in an emergency meeting, before its next scheduled decision on Sept. 18. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which closely tracks expectations for the Fed, fell to 3.74% from 3.88% late Friday and from 5% in April.\n\n\"The Fed could ride in on a white horse to save the day with a big rate cut, but the case for an inter-meeting cut seems flimsy,\" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. \"Those are usually reserved for emergencies, like COVID, and an unemployment rate of 4.3% doesn't really seem like an emergency.\"\n\n\"The Fed could respond by stopping\" the shrinking of its holdings of Treasurys and other bonds, which could put less upward pressure on longer-term yields, he said. \"That could at least by a symbolic action that they're not blind to what's going on.\"\n\nOf course, the U.S. economy is still growing, and a recession is far from assured. The Fed has been clear about the tightrope it began walking when it started hiking rates sharply in March 2022: Being too aggressive would choke the economy, but going too soft would give inflation more oxygen and hurt everyone.\n\nAfter leaving the federal funds rate steady last week, before several discouraging economic reports hit, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said officials \"have a lot of room to respond if we were to see weakness\" in the job market after raising their main rate to the highest level in more than two decades.\n\nGoldman Sachs economist David Mericle sees a higher chance of a recession following Friday's jobs report. But he still sees only a 25% chance of that, up from 10%, in part \"because the data look fine overall\" and he does not \"see major financial imbalances.\"\n\nStill, stocks of companies whose profits are most closely tied to the economy's strength took heavy losses on the fears about a sharp slowdown. The small companies in the Russell 2000 index dropped 5.5%, further dousing what had been a revival for it and other beaten-down areas of the market.\n\nMaking things worse for Wall Street, Big Tech stocks also tumbled sharply as the market's most popular trade for much of this year continued to unravel. Apple, Nvidia and a handful of other Big Tech stocks known as the \" Magnificent Seven \" had propelled the S&P 500 to dozens of all-time highs this year, in part on a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. They were so strong that they overshadowed weakness for areas of the stock market weighed down by high interest rates.\n\nBut Big Tech's momentum turned last month on worries investors had taken their prices too high and expectations for future growth are becoming too difficult to meet. A set of underwhelming profit reports from Tesla and Alphabet added to the pessimism and accelerated the declines.\n\nApple fell 6.8% Monday after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it had slashed its ownership stake in the iPhone maker.\n\nNvidia, the chip company that's become the poster child of Wall Street's AI bonanza, fell even more, 11%. Analysts cut their profit forecasts over the weekend for the company after a report from The Information said Nvidia's new AI chip is delayed. It has trimmed its gain for the year to 92.7% from 170% in the middle of June.\n\nBecause the Magnificent Seven companies have grown to be the market's biggest by market value, the movements for their stocks carry much more weight on the S&P 500 and other indexes. Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon were the heaviest weights on the S&P 500.\n\nWorries outside corporate profits, interest rates and the economy are also weighing on the market. The Israel-Hamas war may be worsening, which beyond its human toll could also cause sharp swings for the price of oil. That's adding to broader worries about potential hotspots around the world, while upcoming U.S. elections could further scramble things.\n\nAP Business Writers Elaine Kurtenbach and Matt Ott contributed.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2024 BY CHANNEL 3000.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 956 points, or 2.4%, as of 10:10 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite slid 4%.\n\nThe drops were just the latest in a sell-off that swept the Earth. Japan's Nikkei 225 helped start Monday by plunging 12.4% for its worst day since the Black Monday crash of 1987.\n\nIt was the first chance for traders in Tokyo to react to Friday's report showing U.S. employers slowed their hiring last month by much more than economists expected. That was the latest piece of data on the U.S. economy to come in weaker than expected, and it's all raised fear the Federal Reserve has pressed the brakes on the U.S. economy by too much for too long through high interest rates in hopes of stifling inflation.\n\nMore financial news: Bezos picks up a cool $5 billion selling Amazon stock\n\nLosses elsewhere in the world were nearly as neck-snapping. South Korea's Kospi index careened 8.8% lower, stock markets across Europe sank more than 2% and bitcoin dropped 9.5%.\n\nEven gold, which has a reputation for offering safety during tumultuous times, slipped 1.4%.\n\nThat's in part because traders are wondering if the damage has been so severe that the Federal Reserve will have to cut interest rates in an emergency meeting, before its next scheduled decision on Sept. 18. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which closely tracks expectations for the Fed, fell to 3.81% from 3.88% late Friday and from 5% in April.\n\n\"The Fed could ride in on a white horse to save the day with a big rate cut, but the case for an inter-meeting cut seems flimsy,\" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. \"Those are usually reserved for emergencies, like COVID, and an unemployment rate of 4.3% doesn't really seem like an emergency.\"\n\n\"The Fed could respond by stopping\" the shrinking of its holdings of Treasurys and other bonds, he said. \"That could at least by a symbolic action that they're not blind to what's going on.\"\n\nOf course, the U.S. economy is still growing, and a recession is far from a certainty. The Fed has been clear about the tightrope it began walking when it started hiking rates sharply in March 2022: Being too aggressive would choke the economy, but going too soft would give inflation more oxygen and hurt everyone.\n\nAfter leaving the federal funds rate steady last week, before several discouraging economic reports hit, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said officials \"have a lot of room to respond if we were to see weakness\" in the job market after raising their main rate to the highest level in more than two decades.\n\nMore financial news in Washington State: The other side of repealing the Washington capital gains tax\n\nGoldman Sachs economist David Mericle sees a higher chance of a recession following Friday's jobs report. But he still sees only a 25% probability of that, up from 15%, in part \"because the data look fine overall\" and he does not \"see major financial imbalances.\"\n\nSome of Wall Street's recent declines may simply be air coming out of a stock market that romped to dozens of all-time highs this year, in part on a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology and hopes for coming cuts to interest rates. Critics have been saying for a while that the stock market looked expensive after prices rose faster than corporate profits.\n\nU.S. stocks pared their losses a bit Monday morning after a report said growth for U.S. services businesses was a touch stronger than expected. Growth was led by businesses in the arts, entertainment and recreation businesses, along with accommodations and food services, according to the Institute for Supply Management.\n\nStill, stocks of companies whose profits are most closely tied to the economy's strength took heavy losses on the fears about a slowdown. The small companies in the Russell 2000 index dropped 4.4%, further dousing what had been a revival for it and other beaten-down areas of the market.\n\nMaking things worse for Wall Street, Big Tech stocks also tumbled sharply as the market's most popular trade for much of this year continued to unravel. Apple, Nvidia and a handful of other Big Tech stocks known as the \"Magnificent Seven\" had propelled the S&P 500 to records this year, even as high interest rates weighed down much of the rest of the stock market.\n\nBut Big Tech's momentum turned last month on worries investors had taken their prices too high and expectations for future growth are becoming too difficult to meet. A set of underwhelming profit reports that began with updates from Tesla and Alphabet added to the pessimism and accelerated the declines.\n\nMore financial news: Amazon says this year's Prime Day was its biggest ever\n\nApple fell 5% Monday after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it had slashed its ownership stake in the iPhone maker.\n\nNvidia, the chip company that's become the poster child of Wall Street's AI bonanza, fell even more, 9.1%. Analysts cut their profit forecasts over the weekend for the company after a report from The Information said Nvidia's new AI chip is delayed. It has trimmed its gain for the year to 97% from 170% in the middle of June.\n\nBecause the Magnificent Seven companies have grown to be the market's biggest by market value, the movements for their stocks carry much more weight on the S&P 500 and other indexes.\n\nWorries outside corporate profits, interest rates and the economy are also weighing on the market. The Israel-Hamas war may be worsening, which beyond its human toll could also cause sharp swings for the price of oil. That's adding to broader worries about potential hotspots around the world, while upcoming U.S. elections could further scramble things.\n\nWall Street has been concerned about how policies coming out of November could impact markets, but the sharp swings for stock prices could also affect the election itself.", "source": {"uri": "mynorthwest.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "My Northwest"},

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was reeling by 864 points, or 2.2%, as of 11:40 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite slid 2.7%.\n\nThe drops were just the latest in a global sell-off that began last week. Japan's Nikkei 225 helped start Monday by plunging 12.4% for its worst day since the Black Monday crash of 1987.\n\nIt was the first chance for traders in Tokyo to react to Friday's report showing U.S. employers slowed their hiring last month by much more than economists expected. That was the latest piece of data on the U.S. economy to come in weaker than expected, and it's all raised fear the Federal Reserve has pressed the brakes on the U.S. economy by too much for too long through high interest rates in hopes of stifling inflation.\n\nProfessional investors cautioned that some technical factors could be amplifying the action in markets, but the losses were still neck-snapping. South Korea's Kospi index careened 8.8% lower, stock markets across Europe sank more than 2% and bitcoin dropped below $55,000 from more than $61,000 on Friday.\n\nEven gold, which has a reputation for offering safety during tumultuous times, slipped 1%.\n\nThat's in part because traders began wondering if the damage has been so severe that the Federal Reserve will have to cut interest rates in an emergency meeting, before its next scheduled decision on Sept. 18. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which closely tracks expectations for the Fed, briefly sank below 3.70% during the morning from 3.88% late Friday and from 5% in April. It later recovered and pulled back to 3.90%.\n\n\"The Fed could ride in on a white horse to save the day with a big rate cut, but the case for an inter-meeting cut seems flimsy,\" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. \"Those are usually reserved for emergencies, like COVID, and an unemployment rate of 4.3% doesn't really seem like an emergency.\"\n\nThe U.S. economy is still growing, and a recession is far from a certainty. The Fed has been clear about the tightrope it began walking when it started hiking rates sharply in March 2022: Being too aggressive would choke the economy, but going too soft would give inflation more oxygen and hurt everyone.\n\nGoldman Sachs economist David Mericle sees a higher chance of a recession within the next 12 months following Friday's jobs report. But he still sees only a 25% probability of that, up from 15%, in part \"because the data look fine overall\" and he does not \"see major financial imbalances.\"\n\nSome of Wall Street's recent declines may also simply be air coming out of a stock market that romped to dozens of all-time highs this year, in part on a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology and hopes for coming cuts to interest rates. Critics have been saying for a while that the stock market looked expensive after prices rose faster than corporate profits.\n\n\"Markets tend to move higher like they're climbing stairs, and they go down like they're falling out a window,\" according to JJ Kinahan, CEO of IG North America. He chalks much of the recent worries to euphoria around AI subsiding and \"a market that was ahead of itself.\"\n\nProfessional investors also pointed to the Bank of Japan's move last week to raise its main interest rate from nearly zero. Such a move helps boost the value of the Japanese yen, but it could also force traders to scramble out of deals where they borrowed money for virtually no cost in Japan and invested it elsewhere around the world.\n\nU.S. stocks pared their losses Monday after a report said growth for U.S. services businesses was a touch stronger than expected. Growth was led by businesses in the arts, entertainment and recreation businesses, along with accommodations and food services, according to the Institute for Supply Management. Treasury yields also pared their drops following the better-than-expected data.\n\nStill, stocks of companies whose profits are most closely tied to the economy's strength took sharp losses on the fears about a slowdown. The small companies in the Russell 2000 index dropped 3.7%, further dousing what had been a revival for it and other beaten-down areas of the market.\n\nMaking things worse for Wall Street, Big Tech stocks also tumbled as the market's most popular trade for much of this year continued to unravel. Apple, Nvidia and a handful of other Big Tech stocks known as the \" Magnificent Seven \" had propelled the S&P 500 to records this year, even as high interest rates weighed down much of the rest of the stock market.\n\nBut Big Tech's momentum turned last month on worries investors had taken their prices too high and expectations for future growth are becoming too difficult to meet. A set of underwhelming profit reports that began with updates from Tesla and Alphabet added to the pessimism and accelerated the declines.\n\nApple fell 3.2% Monday after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it had slashed its ownership stake in the iPhone maker.\n\nNvidia, the chip company that's become the poster child of Wall Street's AI bonanza, fell even more, 5%. Analysts cut their profit forecasts over the weekend for the company after a report from The Information said Nvidia's new AI chip is delayed. The recent selling has trimmed Nvidia's gain for the year to nearly 106% from 170% in the middle of June.\n\nBecause the Magnificent Seven companies are the market's biggest by market value, the movements for their stocks carry much more weight on the S&P 500 and other indexes.\n\nWorries outside corporate profits, interest rates and the economy are also weighing on the market. The Israel-Hamas war may be worsening, which beyond its human toll could also cause sharp swings for the price of oil. That's adding to broader worries about potential hotspots around the world, while upcoming U.S. elections could further scramble things.\n\nWall Street has been concerned about how policies coming out of November could impact markets, but the sharp swings for stock prices could affect the election itself.\n\nThe threat of a recession is likely to put Vice President Kamala Harris on the defensive. But slower growth could also further reduce inflation and force former President Donald Trump to pivot from his current focus on higher prices to outlining ways to revive the economy.\n\n___\n\nAP

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 956 points, or 2.4 per cent, as of 10:10 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite slid 4 per cent.\n\nThe drops were just the latest in a sell-off that swept the Earth. Japan's Nikkei 225 helped start Monday by plunging 12.4 per cent for its worst day since the Black Monday crash of 1987.\n\nIt was the first chance for traders in Tokyo to react to Friday's report showing U.S. employers slowed their hiring last month by much more than economists expected. That was the latest piece of data on the U.S. economy to come in weaker than expected, and it's all raised fear the Federal Reserve has pressed the brakes on the U.S. economy by too much for too long through high interest rates in hopes of stifling inflation.\n\nLosses elsewhere in the world were nearly as neck-snapping. South Korea's Kospi index careened 8.8 per cent lower, stock markets across Europe sank more than 2 per cent and bitcoin dropped 9.5 per cent.\n\nEven gold, which has a reputation for offering safety during tumultuous times, slipped 1.4 per cent.\n\nThat's in part because traders are wondering if the damage has been so severe that the Federal Reserve will have to cut interest rates in an emergency meeting, before its next scheduled decision on Sept. 18. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which closely tracks expectations for the Fed, fell to 3.81 per cent from 3.88 per cent late Friday and from 5 per cent in April.\n\n\"The Fed could ride in on a white horse to save the day with a big rate cut, but the case for an inter-meeting cut seems flimsy,\" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. \"Those are usually reserved for emergencies, like COVID, and an unemployment rate of 4.3 per cent doesn't really seem like an emergency.\"\n\n\"The Fed could respond by stopping\" the shrinking of its holdings of Treasurys and other bonds, he said. \"That could at least by a symbolic action that they're not blind to what's going on.\"\n\nOf course, the U.S. economy is still growing, and a recession is far from a certainty. The Fed has been clear about the tightrope it began walking when it started hiking rates sharply in March 2022: Being too aggressive would choke the economy, but going too soft would give inflation more oxygen and hurt everyone.\n\nAfter leaving the federal funds rate steady last week, before several discouraging economic reports hit, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said officials \"have a lot of room to respond if we were to see weakness\" in the job market after raising their main rate to the highest level in more than two decades.\n\nGoldman Sachs economist David Mericle sees a higher chance of a recession following Friday's jobs report. But he still sees only a 25 per cent probability of that, up from 15 per cent, in part \"because the data look fine overall\" and he does not \"see major financial imbalances.\"\n\nSome of Wall Street's recent declines may simply be air coming out of a stock market that romped to dozens of all-time highs this year, in part on a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology and hopes for coming cuts to interest rates. Critics have been saying for a while that the stock market looked expensive after prices rose faster than corporate profits.\n\nU.S. stocks pared their losses a bit Monday morning after a report said growth for U.S. services businesses was a touch stronger than expected. Growth was led by businesses in the arts, entertainment and recreation businesses, along with accommodations and food services, according to the Institute for Supply Management.\n\nStill, stocks of companies whose profits are most closely tied to the economy's strength took heavy losses on the fears about a slowdown. The small companies in the Russell 2000 index dropped 4.4 per cent, further dousing what had been a revival for it and other beaten-down areas of the market.\n\nMaking things worse for Wall Street, Big Tech stocks also tumbled sharply as the market's most popular trade for much of this year continued to unravel. Apple, Nvidia and a handful of other Big Tech stocks known as the \" Magnificent Seven \" had propelled the S&P 500 to records this year, even as high interest rates weighed down much of the rest of the stock market.\n\nBut Big Tech's momentum turned last month on worries investors had taken their prices too high and expectations for future growth are becoming too difficult to meet. A set of underwhelming profit reports that began with updates from Tesla and Alphabet added to the pessimism and accelerated the declines.\n\nApple fell 5% Monday after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it had slashed its ownership stake in the iPhone maker.\n\nNvidia, the chip company that's become the poster child of Wall Street's AI bonanza, fell even more, 9.1%. Analysts cut their profit forecasts over the weekend for the company after a report from The Information said Nvidia's new AI chip is delayed. It has trimmed its gain for the year to 97% from 170% in the middle of June.\n\nBecause the Magnificent Seven companies have grown to be the market's biggest by market value, the movements for their stocks carry much more weight on the S&P 500 and other indexes.\n\nWorries outside corporate profits, interest rates and the economy are also weighing on the market. The Israel-Hamas war may be worsening, which beyond its human toll could also cause sharp swings for the price of oil. That's adding to broader worries about potential hotspots around the world, while upcoming U.S. elections could further scramble things.\n\nWall Street has been concerned about how policies coming out of November could impact markets, but the sharp swings for stock prices could also affect the election itself.\n\n------", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV News"},

The Dow Jones industrial average lost 1.5 per cent, and the Nasdaq composite fell 2.4 per cent.\n\nCanada's main stock index, the S&P/TSX composite, fell 2.1 per cent on Friday as major energy, technology and industrial stocks all tumbled, marking its steepest drop since mid-February.\n\nA report showing hiring by U.S. employers slowed last month by much more than economists expected sent fear through markets, with both stocks and bond yields dropping sharply.\n\nIt followed a batch of weaker-than-expected reports on the economy from a day earlier, including worsening U.S. manufacturing activity, which has been one of the areas hurt most by high interest rates.\n\nIt was just a couple of days ago that U.S. stock indexes jumped to their best day in months after Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell gave the clearest indication yet that inflation has slowed enough for rate cuts to begin in September.\n\nNow, worries are rising that the Fed may have kept its main interest rate at a two-decade high for too long. A rate cut would make it easier for U.S. households and companies to borrow money and boost the economy, but it could take months to a year for the full effects to filter through.\n\n\"The Fed is seizing defeat from the jaws of victory,\" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. \"Economic momentum has slowed so much that a rate cut in September will be too little and too late.\"\n\nJacobsen said the U.S. central bank will have to \"do something bigger\" than the traditional cut of a quarter of a percentage point in order to avert a recession.\n\nTraders are now betting on a nearly three-in-four chance that the Fed will cut its main interest rate by half a percentage point in September, according to data from CME Group. That's even though Powell said Wednesday that such a deep reduction is \"not something we're thinking about right now.\"\n\nOf course, the U.S. economy is still growing, and a recession is far from a certainty. The Fed has been clear about the tightrope it's walking since it started hiking rates sharply in March 2022: Being too aggressive would choke the economy, but going too soft would give inflation more oxygen and hurt everyone.\n\nWhile refusing to claim victory on either the jobs or the inflation front on Wednesday, before the discouraging economic reports hit, Powell said Fed officials \"have a lot of room to respond if we were to see weakness\" in the job market after hiking its main rate so high.\n\n\"Yes, the economy is weakening, but I am not convinced there is enough evidence that the data so far is a death knell for the economy,\" said Nathan Thooft, senior portfolio manager at Manulife Investment Management.\n\nU.S. stocks had already appeared to be headed for losses on Friday before the disappointing jobs report thudded onto Wall Street.\n\nSeveral big technology companies turned in underwhelming profit reports.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1,197 points, or 3%, as of 9:35 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite slid 5.5% to pull it 15% below its record set last month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe drops were just the latest in a sell-off that swept the Earth. Japan's Nikkei 225 helped start Monday by plunging 12.4% for its worst day since the Black Monday crash of 1987.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was the first chance for traders in Tokyo to react to Friday's report showing U.S. employers slowed their hiring last month by much more than economists expected.\n\nBusiness Briefing\n\nBecome a business insider with the latest news.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nOr with:\n\nGoogleFacebook\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nThat was the latest piece of data on the U.S. economy to come in weaker than expected, and it's all raised fear the Federal Reserve has pressed the brakes on the U.S. economy by too much for too long through high interest rates in hopes of stifling inflation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLosses elsewhere in the world were nearly as neck-snapping. South Korea's Kospi index careened 8.8% lower, stock markets across Europe sank roughly 3% and bitcoin dropped 12%.\n\nEven gold, which has a reputation for offering safety during tumultuous times, slipped nearly 2%.\n\nThat's in part because traders are wondering if the damage has been so severe that the Federal Reserve will have to cut interest rates in an emergency meeting, before its next scheduled decision on Sept. 18. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which closely tracks expectations for the Fed, fell to 3.74% from 3.88% late Friday and from 5% in April.\n\nAdvertisementAdvertisement\n\n\"The Fed could ride in on a white horse to save the day with a big rate cut, but the case for an inter-meeting cut seems flimsy,\" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. \"Those are usually reserved for emergencies, like COVID, and an unemployment rate of 4.3% doesn't really seem like an emergency.\"\n\n\"The Fed could respond by stopping\" the shrinking of its holdings of Treasurys and other bonds, which could put less upward pressure on longer-term yields, he said. \"That could at least by a symbolic action that they're not blind to what's going on.\"\n\nOf course, the U.S. economy is still growing, and a recession is far from assured. The Fed has been clear about the tightrope it began walking when it started hiking rates sharply in March 2022: Being too aggressive would choke the economy, but going too soft would give inflation more oxygen and hurt everyone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter leaving the federal funds rate steady last week, before several discouraging economic reports hit, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said officials \"have a lot of room to respond if we were to see weakness\" in the job market after raising their main rate to the highest level in more than two decades.\n\nGoldman Sachs economist David Mericle sees a higher chance of a recession following Friday's jobs report. But he still sees only a 25% chance of that, up from 10%, in part \"because the data look fine overall\" and he does not \"see major financial imbalances.\"\n\nStill, stocks of companies whose profits are most closely tied to the economy's strength took heavy losses on the fears about a sharp slowdown. The small companies in the Russell 2000 index dropped 5.5%, further dousing what had been a revival for it and other beaten-down areas of the market.\n\nMaking things worse for Wall Street, Big Tech stocks also tumbled sharply as the market's most popular trade for much of this year continued to unravel. Apple, Nvidia and a handful of other Big Tech stocks known as the \"Magnificent Seven\" had propelled the S&P 500 to dozens of all-time highs this year, in part on a frenzy around artificial intelligence technology. They were so strong that they overshadowed weakness for areas of the stock market weighed down by high interest rates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Big Tech's momentum turned last month on worries investors had taken their prices too high and expectations for future growth are becoming too difficult to meet. A set of underwhelming profit reports from Tesla and Alphabet added to the pessimism and accelerated the declines.\n\nApple fell 6.8% Monday after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it had slashed its ownership stake in the iPhone maker.\n\nNvidia, the chip company that's become the poster child of Wall Street's AI bonanza, fell even more, 11%. Analysts cut their profit forecasts over the weekend for the company after a report from The Information said Nvidia's new AI chip is delayed. It has trimmed its gain for the year to 92.7% from 170% in the middle of June.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause the Magnificent Seven companies have grown to be the market's biggest by market value, the movements for their stocks carry much more weight on the S&P 500 and other indexes. Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon were the heaviest weights on the S&P 500.\n\nWorries outside corporate profits, interest rates and the economy are also weighing on the market. The Israel-Hamas war may be worsening, which beyond its human toll could also cause sharp swings for the price of oil. That's adding to broader worries about potential hotspots around the world, while upcoming U.S. elections could further scramble things.\n\nRelated StoriesView MoreWeak US hiring in July slams global

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1,092 points, or 2.7%, as of 10:40 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.6%.\n\nThe drops were just the latest in a sell-off that swept the Earth. Japan's Nikkei 225 helped start Monday by plunging 12.4% for its worst day since the Black Monday crash of 1987.\n\nIt was the first chance for traders in Tokyo to react to Friday's report showing U.S. employers slowed their hiring last month by much more than economists expected. That was the latest piece of data on the U.S. economy to come in weaker than expected, and it's all raised fear the Federal Reserve has pressed the brakes on the U.S. economy by too much for too long through high interest rates in hopes of stifling inflation.\n\nLosses elsewhere in the world were nearly as neck-snapping. South Korea's Kospi index careened 8.8% lower, stock markets across Europe sank more than 2% and bitcoin dropped 7%.\n\nEven gold, which has a reputation for offering safety during tumultuous times, slipped 1.7%.\n\nRelated Story: Newsom Brags About CA's Economy, but Unemployment Tells a Different Story\n\nThat's in part because traders are wondering if the damage has been so severe that the Federal Reserve will have to cut interest rates in an emergency meeting, before its next scheduled decision on Sept. 18. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which closely tracks expectations for the Fed, briefly dropped below 3.70% during the morning from 3.88% late Friday and from 5% in April. It later recovered and pulled back to 3.88%.\n\n\"The Fed could ride in on a white horse to save the day with a big rate cut, but the case for an inter-meeting cut seems flimsy,\" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. \"Those are usually reserved for emergencies, like COVID, and an unemployment rate of 4.3% doesn't really seem like an emergency.\"\n\n\"The Fed could respond by stopping\" the shrinking of its holdings of Treasurys and other bonds, he said. \"That could at least by a symbolic action that they're not blind to what's going on.\"\n\nOf course, the U.S. economy is still growing, and a recession is far from a certainty. The Fed has been clear about the tightrope it began walking when it started hiking rates sharply in March 2022: Being too aggressive would choke the economy, but going too soft would give inflation more oxygen and hurt everyone.\n\nGoldman Sachs economist David Mericle sees a higher chance of a recession within the next 12 months following Friday's jobs report. But he still sees only a 25% probability of that, up from 15%, in part \"because the data look fine overall\" and he does not \"see major financial imbalances.\"\n\nRelated Story: Stock Market Today: Dow Drops 900 on Weak Jobs Data as a Global Sell-Off Whips ...\n\nSome of Wall Street's recent declines may simply be air coming out of a stock market that romped to dozens of all-time highs this year, in part on a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology and hopes for coming cuts to interest rates. Critics have been saying for a while that the stock market looked expensive after prices rose faster than corporate profits.\n\n\"Markets tend to move higher like they're climbing stairs, and they go down like they're falling out a window,\" according to JJ Kinahan, CEO of IG North America, who chalks much of the recent worries to euphoria around AI subsiding amid \"a market that was ahead of itself.\"\n\nU.S. stocks briefly pared their losses a bit Monday after a report said growth for U.S. services businesses was a touch stronger than expected. Growth was led by businesses in the arts, entertainment and recreation businesses, along with accommodations and food services, according to the Institute for Supply Management. Treasury yields also pared their drops following the better-than-expected data.\n\nStill, stocks of companies whose profits are most closely tied to the economy's strength took heavy losses on the fears about a slowdown. The small companies in the Russell 2000 index dropped 4.3%, further dousing what had been a revival for it and other beaten-down areas of the market.\n\nMaking things worse for Wall Street, Big Tech stocks also tumbled sharply as the market's most popular trade for much of this year continued to unravel. Apple, Nvidia and a handful of other Big Tech stocks known as the \"Magnificent Seven\" had propelled the S&P 500 to records this year, even as high interest rates weighed down much of the rest of the stock market.\n\nRelated Story: Stock Market Today: Wall Street Slumps and 10-Year Yield Tumbles Below 4% on ...\n\nBut Big Tech's momentum turned last month on worries investors had taken their prices too high and expectations for future growth are becoming too difficult to meet. A set of underwhelming profit reports that began with updates from Tesla and Alphabet added to the pessimism and accelerated the declines.\n\nApple fell 5.1% Monday after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it had slashed its ownership stake in the iPhone maker.\n\nNvidia, the chip company that's become the poster child of Wall Street's AI bonanza, fell even more, 7.7%. Analysts cut their profit forecasts over the weekend for the company after a report from The Information said Nvidia's new AI chip is delayed. It has trimmed its gain for the year to 100% from 170% in the middle of June.\n\nBecause the Magnificent Seven companies have grown to be the market's biggest by market value, the movements for their stocks carry much more weight on the S&P 500 and other indexes.\n\nWorries outside corporate profits, interest rates and the economy are also weighing on the market. The Israel-Hamas war may be worsening, which beyond its human toll could also cause sharp swings for the price of oil. That's adding to broader worries about potential hotspots around the world, while upcoming U.S. elections could further scramble things.\n\nWall Street has been concerned about how policies coming out of November could impact markets, but the sharp swings for stock prices could also affect the election itself.\n\nThe market turmoil and concerns about a weakening economy are likely to scramble a presidential race that has so far been focused mostly on immigration and inflation.\n\nThe threat of a recession is likely to put Vice President Kamala Harris on the defensive. But slower growth could also further reduce inflation and force former President Donald Trump to pivot from his current focus on higher prices to outlining ways to revive the economy.", "source":

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 864 points, or 2.2%, as of 1:25 p.m. ET, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 2.8%.\n\nThe declines are just the latest in a series of global selloffs that began last week.

He attributes much of the recent concern to euphoria over the decline of AI and a market that has rushed.\n\nProfessional investors also pointed to the Bank of Japan's decision last week to raise its main interest rate from near zero. Such a move helps bolster the yen's value, but it could also force traders to hastily exit trades in which they borrowed money at near zero cost in Japan and invested it elsewhere in the world.\n\nU.S. stocks pared losses Monday after a report showed growth in U.S. services businesses was slightly stronger than expected. Growth was led by companies in the arts, entertainment and recreation sector, as well as accommodation and food services, according to the Institute for Supply Management. Treasury yields also pared losses after better-than-expected data.\n\nShares of companies whose profits are closely tied to the strength of the economy, however, suffered heavy losses on fears of a slowdown. Smaller companies in the Russell 2000 index fell 2.8%, further weakening what had been a rally for them and other struggling sectors of the market.\n\nTo top it all off, stocks of big tech companies have also fallen, as the most popular markets for much of this year have continued to slump. Apple, Nvidia and a handful of other big tech stocks, known as the \"Magnificent Seven,\" have propelled the S&P 500 to record highs this year, even as high interest rates have weighed on much of the rest of the stock market.\n\nBut in the past month, big tech companies have seen their momentum accelerate as they worry that investors have bid up their prices too much and that expectations for future growth are becoming too difficult to meet. A string of disappointing earnings reports, starting with updates from Tesla and Alphabet, added to the pessimism and accelerated the declines.\n\nApple fell 3.9% on Monday after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway revealed it had reduced its stake in the iPhone maker.\n\nNvidia, the chip company that has become Wall Street's poster child for artificial intelligence, fell even more, down 5.5%. Analysts cut their profit forecasts for the company over the weekend after a report from The Information said Nvidia's new AI chip was delayed. The recent selloff cut Nvidia's gain for the year to 104%, down from 170% in mid-June.\n\nSince they are the seven largest companies in the market by market value, their stock movements carry much more weight on the S&P 500 and other indexes.\n\nConcerns about corporate profits, interest rates and the economy are also weighing on the market. The war between Israel and Hamas could escalate, which, beyond its human toll, could also cause sharp swings in the price of oil. This is in addition to broader concerns about potential flashpoints around the world, while the upcoming US elections could further muddy the waters.\n\nWall Street is worried about the impact that policies implemented in November could have on markets, but the wild swings in stock prices could affect the election itself.\n\nThe threat of a recession could put Vice President Kamala Harris on the defensive. But slower growth could also further reduce inflation and force former President Donald Trump to shift his current focus from fighting rising prices to setting policies to revive the economy.\n\nA strong jobs market supports consumer spending, which drives economic growth. The link between jobs and spending will remain a focal point as the U.S. presidential election approaches, said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial.\n\n\"It all comes down to jobs,\" she said. \"When we get to election day, the unemployment rate is going to be extremely high.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Business reporters Elaine Kurtenbach, Matt Ott, Christopher Rugaber and Damian J.

The Fed has been clear about the tightrope it began walking when it started hiking rates sharply in March 2022: Being too aggressive would choke the economy, but going too soft would give inflation more oxygen and hurt everyone.\n\nGoldman Sachs economist David Mericle sees a higher chance of a recession within the next 12 months following Friday's jobs report. But he still sees only a 25% probability of that, up from 15%, in part \"because the data look fine overall\" and he does not \"see major financial imbalances.\"\n\nSome of Wall Street's recent declines may also simply be air coming out of a stock market that romped to dozens of all-time highs this year, in part on a frenzy around artificial intelligence technology and hopes for coming cuts to interest rates. Critics have been saying for a while that the stock market looked expensive after prices rose faster than corporate profits.\n\n\"Markets tend to move higher like they're climbing stairs, and they go down like they're falling out a window,\" according to JJ Kinahan, CEO of IG North America. He chalks much of the recent worries to euphoria around AI subsiding and \"a market that was ahead of itself.\"\n\nProfessional investors also pointed to the Bank of Japan's move last week to raise its main interest rate from nearly zero. Such a move helps boost the value of the Japanese yen, but it could also force traders to scramble out of deals where they borrowed money for virtually no cost in Japan and invested it elsewhere around the world.\n\nUS stocks pared their losses Monday after a report said growth for US services businesses was a touch stronger than expected. Growth was led by businesses in the arts, entertainment and recreation businesses, along with accommodations and food services, according to the Institute for Supply Management. Treasury yields also pared their drops following the better-than-expected data.\n\nStill, stocks of companies whose profits are most closely tied to the economy's strength took sharp losses on the fears about a slowdown. The small companies in the Russell 2000 index dropped 3.7%, further dousing what had been a revival for it and other beaten-down areas of the market.\n\nMaking things worse for Wall Street, Big Tech stocks also tumbled as the market's most popular trade for much of this year continued to unravel. Apple, Nvidia and a handful of other Big Tech stocks known as the \" Magnificent Seven \" had propelled the S&P 500 to records this year, even as high interest rates weighed down much of the rest of the stock market.\n\nBut Big Tech's momentum turned last month on worries investors had taken their prices too high and expectations for future growth are becoming too difficult to meet. A set of underwhelming profit reports that began with updates from Tesla and Alphabet added to the pessimism and accelerated the declines.\n\nApple fell 3.2% Monday after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it had slashed its ownership stake in the iPhone maker.\n\nNvidia, the chip company that's become the poster child of Wall Street's AI bonanza, fell even more, 5%. Analysts cut their profit forecasts over the weekend for the company after a report from The Information said Nvidia's new AI chip is delayed. The recent selling has trimmed Nvidia's gain for the year to nearly 106% from 170% in the middle of June.\n\nBecause the Magnificent Seven companies are the market's biggest by market value, the movements for their stocks carry much more weight on the S&P 500 and other indexes.\n\nWorries outside corporate profits, interest rates and the economy are also weighing on the market. The Israel-Hamas war may be worsening, which beyond its human toll could also cause sharp swings for the price of oil. That's adding to broader worries about potential hotspots around the world, while upcoming U.S. elections could further scramble things.\n\nWall Street has been concerned about how policies coming out of November could impact markets, but the sharp swings for stock prices could affect the election itself.\n\nThe threat of a recession is likely to put Vice President Kamala Harris on the defensive. But slower growth could also further reduce inflation and force former President Donald Trump to pivot from his current focus on higher prices to outlining ways to revive the economy.", "source": {"uri": "nationthailand.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Nation Thailand"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wealth management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oxygen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goldman Sachs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Japan", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of the Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Supply_Management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Institute for Supply Management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japanese yen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Price of oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://media.nationthailand.com/uploads/images/md/2024/08/SQROfWk6UEo2xwsoJJwp.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9785897", "eventUri": "eng-9785897", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

World shares have tumbled on Friday, with Japan's Nikkei 225 index slumping 5.8% as investors panicked over signs of weakness in the US economy\n\nA global sell-off for stocks has hit Wall Street again on Friday, with concerns about whether the US economy's growth can be sustained until the Federal Reserve reduces interest rates.\n\nThe S&P 500 was down by 1.6% in early trading, potentially marking its first consecutive loss of more than 1% since April. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen by 481 points, or 1.2%, as of 9.35 Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was down by 2.6%.\n\nA report revealing that hiring by US employers slowed significantly more than economists had predicted last month sent shockwaves through markets, causing both stocks and bond yields to plummet. This followed a series of weaker-than-expected reports on the economy from the previous day, including a decline in US manufacturing activity, which has been one of the sectors most affected by high rates.\n\nJust a few days ago, US stock indexes experienced their best day in months after Fed Chair Jerome Powell gave the strongest indication yet that inflation has slowed enough for cuts to interest rates to begin in September. Now, there are increasing concerns that the Fed maintained its main interest rate at a two-decade high for too long in its efforts to curb inflation.\n\nA rate cut could take anywhere from several months to a year to impact the economy. \"The Fed is seizing defeat from the jaws of victory,\" Brian Jacobsen, the chief economist at Annex Wealth Management, remarked. \"Economic momentum has slowed so much that a rate cut in September will be too little and too late. They'll have to do something bigger than\" the usual cut of a quarter of a percentage point \"to avert a recession.\"\n\nBefore the disheartening jobs report landed on Wall Street, US stocks seemed poised for losses. A slew of major tech companies delivered lacklustre profit reports, adding to the gloom that started last week with Tesla and Alphabet's figures.\n\nAmazon saw a 10% drop after reporting lower revenue than anticipated for the most recent quarter. The e-commerce behemoth also projected an operating profit for the summer that didn't meet analysts' forecasts.\n\nIntel took an even more significant hit, plunging 27.7%, as the chipmaker's profit fell massively below estimates for the latest quarter. It went as far as suspending its dividend and warning of expected losses in the third quarter, despite analyst predictions of profit.\n\nApple, however, managed a slight gain of 0.7%, having declared better-than-expected profit and revenue. Apple and a select group of other Big Tech stocks, known as the \" Magnificent Seven \", have been the primary drivers behind the S&P 500 setting numerous records this year, largely due to the hype surrounding artificial intelligence technology. However, their momentum took a hit last month amid concerns that their prices had soared too high and profit expectations had become too challenging to meet.\n\nIn a fortunate turn for Wall Street, other sectors of the stock market that had suffered due to high interest rates were making a comeback, particularly smaller companies. But they also took a tumble on Friday over fears that a fragile economy could dent their profits.\n\nThe Russell 2000 index, which tracks smaller stocks, fell by 3.7%, outpacing the rest of the market. Over in the bond market, Treasury yields saw a sharp decline as traders increased their predictions for how much the Federal Reserve would slash interest rates at its next meeting in September. The yield on the 10-year Treasury dropped to 3.85% from 3.98% late Thursday, and down from 4.70% in April.\n\nDespite the widespread fear, some voices on Wall Street were still advocating for caution. \"While worries of a policy mistake are rising, one negative miss shouldn't lead to overreaction,\" said Lara Castleton, US head of portfolio construction and strategy at Janus Henderson Investors.\n\nShe highlights that the US economy continues to expand and inflation is on the decline. Not far behind its peak from a fortnight ago, the S&P 500 faces a dip. \"Equities selling off should be seen as a normal reaction, especially considering the high valuations in many pockets of the market. It's a good reminder for investors to focus on the earnings of companies going forward.\"\n\nOverseas markets are also feeling the pinch, with Japan's Nikkei 225 tumbling by 5.8%, regressing to January levels before last month's all-time high. The Bank of Japan's rate hike on Wednesday has triggered struggles for Japanese stocks, boosting the yen against the dollarbad news for exporters and tourism.\n\nWhile Chinese equities continue their slide this week, hope fades in response to insufficient governmental steps to bolster the economysmall-scale actions rather than substantial stimulus injections disappoint investors.\n\nStocks took a hit throughout much of Europe as well. Markets worldwide have been put through the wringer despite anticipated moves by central banks in Japan, the US, and England. With Japan bumping up its rate, the Fed holding steady, and the Bank of England cutting its main rate for the first time in over four years, it's been a tense week.\n\nCommodity prices have also experienced turbulence, with oil prices skyrocketing following the assassinations of leaders from Hamas and Hezbollah, stoking fears that conflict in the Middle East could escalate into a broader war. However, prices receded on Thursday and Friday due to concerns about the economy.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.5 percent, and the Nasdaq composite fell 2.4 percent as a global financial sell-off whipped all the way around the world back to Wall Street.\n\nA report showing hiring by U.S. employers slowed last month by much more than expected sent fear through markets, with both stocks and bond yields dropping sharply.\n\nIt followed a batch of weaker-than-expected reports on the economy from a day earlier, including one about the softening state of U.S. manufacturing activity, which has been one of the areas hurt most by high rates.\n\nIt was just a couple days ago that U.S. stock indexes jumped to their best day in months after the head of the Federal Reserve gave the clearest indication yet that inflation has slowed enough for cuts to rates to begin in September.\n\nNow, worries are rising the Fed may have kept its main interest rate at a two-decade high for too long. A rate cut would make it easier for U.S. households and companies to borrow money and boost the economy, but it could take months to a year for the full effects to filter through.\n\n\"The Fed is seizing defeat from the jaws of victory,\" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. \"Economic momentum has slowed so much that a rate cut in September will be too little and too late. They'll have to do something bigger than\" the traditional cut of a quarter of a percentage point \"to avert a recession.\"\n\nTraders are now betting on a 70 percent probability that the Fed will cut its main interest rate by half a percentage point in September, according to data from CME Group. That's even though Jerome Powell, the central bank's chairman, said Wednesday that such a deep reduction is \"not something we're thinking about right now.\"\n\nThe U.S. economy is still growing, and a recession is far from a certainty. The Fed has been clear about the tightrope it's walking since it started hiking rates sharply in March 2022: Being too aggressive would choke the economy, but going too soft would give inflation more oxygen.\n\nWhile refusing to claim victory on either the jobs or the inflation fronts on Wednesday, before the discouraging economic reports hit, Powell said Fed officials \"have a lot of room to respond if we were to see weakness\" in the job market after hiking its main rate so high.\n\n\"Certainly today's job data feeds the weakening economy narrative, but I believe the market is overreacting at this point and pricing too much in on rate cuts at this stage,\" said Nate Thooft, senior portfolio manager at Manulife Investment Management. \"Yes, the economy is weakening, but I am not convinced there is enough evidence that the data so far is a death knell for the economy.\"\n\nMarkets likely panicked in part Friday because when the unemployment ticked up to 4.3 percent last month -- the highest since October 2021 -- it set off the so-called Sahm Rule.\n\nNamed for former Fed economist Claudia Sahm, it holds that a recession is almost always underway already if the three-month average unemployment rate rises by half a percentage point from its low of the past year. It's been triggered in every U.S. recession since 1970.\n\nBut Sahm herself doubts that a recession is \"imminent.'' Speaking before the numbers came out Friday, she said: \"If the Sahm Rule were to trigger, it would join the ever-growing group of indicators, rules of thumb, that weren't up to the task.''\n\nToday's Top Headlines\n\nStory continues below\n\nAn abandoned 120-foot US Navy ship is stuck in a Johns Island creek.

The retail and tech giant also gave a forecast for operating profit for the summer that fell short of expectations.\n\nIntel dropped even more, 26.1 percent, for its worst day in 50 years, after the chip company's profit for the latest quarter fell well short of forecasts. It also suspended its dividend and forecast a loss for the third quarter, when analysts were expecting a profit.\n\nApple held steadier, rising slightly after reporting stronger profits and sales.\n\nApple and a handful of other Big Tech stocks known as the \"Magnificent Seven\" were the main reasons the S&P 500 set dozens of records this year, in part on a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. But their momentum turned last month on worries investors had taken their prices too high.\n\nFriday's losses for tech stocks dragged the Nasdaq composite 10 percent below its record set last month into what traders call \"correction\" territory.\n\nHelpfully for Wall Street, other areas of the stock market beaten down by high interest rates began rebounding sharply last month when tech stocks were regressing, particularly smaller companies. But they tumbled, too, Friday on worries that a fragile economy could undercut their profits. The Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks dropped 3.5 percent, more than the rest of the market.\n\nIn the bond market, Treasury yields fell sharply as traders forecasted deeper cuts to rates coming from the Federal Reserve. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 3.79%, down from 4.70% in April.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, Japan's Nikkei 225 dropped 5.8 percent. It's been struggling since the Bank of Japan raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday. The hike pushed up the value of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar, which could hurt profits for exporters and hurt tourism.\n\nCommodity prices also had a rough ride this week. Oil prices leaped after the killings of leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah fueled fears that a widening conflict in the Middle East could disrupt the flow of crude.\n\nBut prices fell back Thursday and Friday on worries that a weakening economy would burn less fuel. A barrel of benchmark U.S. crude dropped back below $74 Friday after coming into the week above $77.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.", "source": {"uri":

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 996 points, or 2.5 per cent, as of 9:50 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.8 per cent.\n\nThe drops were just the latest in a sell-off that swept the Earth. Japan's Nikkei 225 helped start Monday by plunging 12.4 per cent for its worst day since the Black Monday crash of 1987.\n\nIt was the first chance for traders in Tokyo to react to Friday's report showing U.S. employers slowed their hiring last month by much more than economists expected. That was the latest piece of data on the U.S. economy to come in weaker than expected, and it's all raised fear the Federal Reserve has pressed the brakes on the U.S. economy by too much for too long through high interest rates in hopes of stifling inflation.\n\nLosses elsewhere in the world were nearly as neck-snapping. South Korea's Kospi index careened 8.8 per cent lower, stock markets across Europe sank roughly 3 per cent and bitcoin dropped 12 per cent.\n\nEven gold, which has a reputation for offering safety during tumultuous times, slipped 1.6 per cent.\n\nThat's in part because traders are wondering if the damage has been so severe that the Federal Reserve will have to cut interest rates in an emergency meeting, before its next scheduled decision on Sept. 18. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which closely tracks expectations for the Fed, fell to 3.79 per cent from 3.88 per cent late Friday and from 5 per cent in April.\n\n\"The Fed could ride in on a white horse to save the day with a big rate cut, but the case for an inter-meeting cut seems flimsy,\" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. \"Those are usually reserved for emergencies, like COVID, and an unemployment rate of 4.3 per cent doesn't really seem like an emergency.\"\n\n\"The Fed could respond by stopping\" the shrinking of its holdings of Treasurys and other bonds, which could put less upward pressure on longer-term yields, he said. \"That could at least by a symbolic action that they're not blind to what's going on.\"\n\nOf course, the U.S. economy is still growing, and a recession is far from assured. The Fed has been clear about the tightrope it began walking when it started hiking rates sharply in March 2022: Being too aggressive would choke the economy, but going too soft would give inflation more oxygen and hurt everyone.\n\nAfter leaving the federal funds rate steady last week, before several discouraging economic reports hit, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said officials \"have a lot of room to respond if we were to see weakness\" in the job market after raising their main rate to the highest level in more than two decades.\n\nGoldman Sachs economist David Mericle sees a higher chance of a recession following Friday's jobs report. But he still sees only a 25 per cent chance of that, up from 15 per cent, in part \"because the data look fine overall\" and he does not \"see major financial imbalances.\"\n\nStill, stocks of companies whose profits are most closely tied to the economy's strength took heavy losses on the fears about a sharp slowdown. The small companies in the Russell 2000 index dropped 5.5 per cent, further dousing what had been a revival for it and other beaten-down areas of the market.\n\nMaking things worse for Wall Street, Big Tech stocks also tumbled sharply as the market's most popular trade for much of this year continued to unravel. Apple, Nvidia and a handful of other Big Tech stocks known as the \" Magnificent Seven \" had propelled the S&P 500 to dozens of all-time highs this year, in part on a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. They were so strong that they overshadowed weakness for areas of the stock market weighed down by high interest rates.\n\nBut Big Tech's momentum turned last month on worries investors had taken their prices too high and expectations for future growth are becoming too difficult to meet. A set of underwhelming profit reports from Tesla and Alphabet added to the pessimism and accelerated the declines.\n\nApple fell 4.6 per cent Monday after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it had slashed its ownership stake in the iPhone maker.\n\nNvidia, the chip company that's become the poster child of Wall Street's AI bonanza, fell even more, 8.3 per cent. Analysts cut their profit forecasts over the weekend for the company after a report from The Information said Nvidia's new AI chip is delayed. It has trimmed its gain for the year to 98.7 per cent from 170 per cent in the middle of June.\n\nBecause the Magnificent Seven companies have grown to be the market's biggest by market value, the movements for their stocks carry much more weight on the S&P 500 and other indexes.\n\nWorries outside corporate profits, interest rates and the economy are also weighing on the market. The Israel-Hamas war may be worsening, which beyond its human toll could also cause sharp swings for the price of oil.

US stock prices and bond yields plummeted in the aftermath of the report, days after a raft of disappointing US economic reports a day earlier, including a further deterioration in US factory activity, which has been one of the areas hit hardest by high rates.\n\nJust a couple days ago, US stock indexes soared to their best day in months when Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave the clearest sign that, with inflation finally cooling, rate cuts could come as soon as next month.\n\nNow, fears that the Fed has held its key interest rate too high for too long are growing. A rate cut would make it cheaper for US households and companies to borrow, a shot in the arm for the economy, but it takes months to a year for the effects to be fully felt.\n\n'The Fed is snatching defeat from the jaws of victory,' said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management: 'Economic momentum has slowed so much that a September cut will be too little and too late. They'll have to do something bigger than' a quarter point to avert a recession.\n\nSpeculators see a 70 per cent chance that the Fed will lower its benchmark rate by 50 basis points in September even if Powell said Wednesday 'that's not something we're thinking about right now'. -- Data from CME Group shows that traders are betting on a 70 per cent probability that the US central bank will reduce its main interest rate by half a percentage point in September, even though the Fed's new boss Powell said Wednesday that such a deep reduction 'is not something we're thinking about right now'. --\n\nAfter all, the US economy is still growing, and a recession is hardly guaranteed. From the moment it began jacking up rates in March 2022, the Fed has been telling us it's walking a tightrope: too much and you choke the economy, too little and you give the inflation problem more to feed on.\n\nWhile refusing to declare victory on either the jobs front or on inflation - which was before Thursday's dismal economic news - Powell said Fed policymakers 'have a lot of room to respond if we were to see weakness' in the job market following the Fed's aggressive hike of its key rate.\n\n'Yes, that's very supportive of the narrative that the economy is weakening. But I think the market is overdoing it at this point and people are freaking out too much about the now-' Nate Thooft, senior portfolio manager at Manulife Investment Management, told the Financial Times. 'Yes, the economy is weakening, but I don't think the evidence is there yet that the data to date is a sure sign of the death of the economy.'\n\nStocks in the US had looked ready for a losing session anyway Friday before the ugly jobs report landed on Wall Street.\n\nThere, a long list of big tech firms posted lacklustre earnings reports - a continuation of a generally unpleasant run that began last week with numbers from Tesla and Alphabet.\n\nAmazon tumbled 8.8 per cent after the retail and tech behemoth provided weaker-than-expected revenue for the latest quarter and issued a profit forecast for the summer that similarly failed to live up to analysts' expectations.\n\nIntel fell yet more, 26.1 per cent - its worst day in half a century - after the second largest chip company by market value reported that its profit for the latest quarter missed estimates. It also announced that it would, reported the Los Angeles Times, 'suspend its quarterly dividend and forecast a loss for the third quarter, when analysts had projected a profit'.\n\nApple held steadier, up 0.7%, after reporting better profit and revenue than expected.\n\nApple and six other Big Tech stocks in what Wall Street calls the 'Magnificent Seven' have powered the S \u0333P \u0333 500 to dozens of records this year on growing enthusiasm about artificial-intelligence technology. But that wind at their backs suddenly died down in September as investors grown fearful that it would hurt take prices too high.\n\nFriday's tech-sector selloff sent the Nasdaq composite down 10 per cent from its all-time peak set last month - a decline traditionally called a 'correction'.\n\nHelpfully for Wall Street, sectors of the stock market crushed by high interest rates began rebounding hard last month even as tech stocks were spectacularly retreating, especially smaller companies. But they too swooned on Friday as worries took hold that a weak economy might derail their profits.\n\nThe Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks lost 3.5 per cent, worse than the rest of the market.\n\nIn the end, the S&P 500 dropped 100.12 points to 5,346.56, the Dow came down 610.71 to 39,737.26, and the Nasdaq composite fell 417.98 to 16,776.16.\n\nYields on Treasuries sank in the bond market, with traders anticipating further rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve. The yield on the 10-year Treasury dropped from 3.98 per cent late Thursday, and from 4.70 per cent in April.\n\nOverseas, stocks in Japan's Nikkei 225 dropped 5.8 per cent. It's been struggling after the Bank of Japan raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday, a move that boosted the Japanese yen against the US dollar and could erode profits for exporters. It could also deflate a boom in tourism from abroad.\n\nChinese stocks tumbled as investors digested the government's latest efforts to revive demand through a raft of piecemeal measures rather than the hoped-for injections of broader stimulus, while stock indexes fell by more than 1 per cent range across much of Europe.\n\nCommodity prices also had a rollercoaster ride this week: a spike in the price of oil came after the killings of two leaders of terrorist middle eastern groups, Hamas and Hezbollah, rejuvenated fears of a wider Middle East conflict strangling the world's oil supply.\n\nHowever, prices retreated Thursday and Friday as investors worried that a slowing economy would burn less crude. A barrel of benchmark US crude on Friday again fell below $74 after opening the week above $77.", "source": {"uri": "en.paperblog.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Paperblog"}, "authors": [],

Worried about a slowing U.S. economy, investors sent the market in Japan to its worst day in decades and have sliced billions in market value off some of the world's biggest technology companies. They've turned a relatively calm year in markets on its head.\n\nFor most of the year, investors worldwide drove stock markets higher, convinced that central banks were successfully, if haltingly, getting inflation under control, and buoyed by a healthy U.S. economy and the promise of artificial intelligence.\n\nBy June Nvidia, the leader in AI chipmaking, had joined Apple and Microsoft as $3 trillion companies. In mid-July, the S&P 500, Nasdaq composite and Japan's Nikkei 225 had risen to all-time highs. Investors believed that the high interest rates put in place by the U.S. Federal Reserve were taming inflation without causing a sharp slowdown in the U.S. economy, the world's largest.\n\nThat confidence has taken a hit the past few days. Investors are listening to warnings that Nvidia and other Big Tech stocks have gotten too expensive, and that massive spending on AI might not turn into profits for a while. Weak readings on the job market, manufacturing and construction last week sparked worries about a U.S. recession and criticism that the Fed waited too long to cut rates. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan has started raising rates, causing turmoil in Japan's markets.\n\nOn Friday, the Nasdaq composite went into a correction, which is a 10 per cent decline from its most recent high. On Monday, the Nikkei plunged more than 12 per cent, its worst drop since 1987. By midday in the U.S., the S&P 500 was down 2.2 per cent and, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had dropped 2 per cent. Oil and other commodities prices fell because of the economic worries.\n\nTraders in the U.S. are betting the Federal Reserve will have to cut rates by half a percentage point in September instead of the usual quarter point. Some are calling for an emergency rate cut. However, there are opposing voices saying the sell-off is actually a good thing because stock prices had risen too high.\n\nHere's a look at what's driving the turbulence in markets:\n\nThough the Fed hasn't raised its benchmark rate in a year, interest rates remain at more than two-decade highs after the U.S. central bank raised them 11 times beginning in 2022 in an effort to get inflation down to its 2 per cent target. Part of the Fed's goal was to cool a red-hot labour market that rebounded after the pandemic recession with the rest of the U.S. economy.\n\nInvestors thought the Fed and other central banks were on track, even though inflation remained somewhat above their targets. The European Central Bank and the Bank of England cut once, and the Fed has signalled it was prepared to start cutting rates in September.\n\nThere had been some pockets of weakness in the U.S. economy, particularly spending by lower-income Americans, but overall the economy still grew at a rate of 2.8 per cent in the second quarter. Then came last week's economic reports.\n\nOn Friday, the government's monthly report on the job market showed a significant slowdown in hiring by U.S. employers. Worries that the Fed may have kept the brakes on the economy too long spread through the markets. Reports on manufacturing and construction were also weak.\n\nWhile technology stocks have been the biggest winners in the market's runup this year, members of the highly influential group of stocks known as the \" Magnificent Seven \" underwhelmed investors in their latest earnings reports.\n\nThis handful of Big Tech stocks drove the S&P 500 to dozens of records this year, in part due to the frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. But their momentum turned last month on worries investors had taken their prices too high and expectations for their profit gains had grown too difficult to meet, particularly with regard to artificial intelligence.\n\nApple AAPL-Q fell 5 per cent Monday after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it had slashed its ownership stake in the iPhone maker. Nvidia NVDA-Q lost more than $238 billion in market value Thursday and Friday and the stock was down another 7 per cent Monday.\n\nThe Nikkei suffered its worst two-day decline ever, dropping 18.2 per cent in the last two trading sessions. The wave of selling hit all sorts of companies, including Toyota, Honda and computer chip maker Tokyo Electron.\n\nShare prices have fallen in Tokyo since the Bank of Japan raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday.\n\nAnalysts said factor one factor contributing to the falling share prices was carry trades. That when investors borrow money from a country with low interest rates and a relatively weak currency, like Japan, and invest those funds in places that will yield a high return. But the higher interest rates, plus a stronger Japanese yen, could force investors to selling stocks to repay those loans.\n\nThe yen rose to 143.25 for one U.S. dollar on Wednesday morning. It had topped 160 in the spring.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1,197 points, or 3%, as of 9:35 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite slid 5.5% to pull it 15% below its record set last month.\n\nThe drops were just the latest in a sell-off that swept the Earth. Japan's Nikkei 225 helped start Monday by plunging 12.4% for its worst day since the Black Monday crash of 1987.\n\nIt was the first chance for traders in Tokyo to react to Friday's report showing U.S. employers slowed their hiring last month by much more than economists expected. That was the latest piece of data on the U.S. economy to come in weaker than expected, and it's all raised fear the Federal Reserve has pressed the brakes on the U.S. economy by too much for too long through high interest rates in hopes of stifling inflation.\n\nLosses elsewhere in the world were nearly as neck-snapping. South Korea's Kospi index careened 8.8% lower, stock markets across Europe sank roughly 3% and bitcoin dropped 12%.\n\nEven gold, which has a reputation for offering safety during tumultuous times, slipped nearly 2%.\n\nThat's in part because traders are wondering if the damage has been so severe that the Federal Reserve will have to cut interest rates in an emergency meeting, before its next scheduled decision on Sept. 18. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which closely tracks expectations for the Fed, fell to 3.74% from 3.88% late Friday and from 5% in April.\n\n\"The Fed could ride in on a white horse to save the day with a big rate cut, but the case for an inter-meeting cut seems flimsy,\" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. \"Those are usually reserved for emergencies, like COVID, and an unemployment rate of 4.3% doesn't really seem like an emergency.\"\n\n\"The Fed could respond by stopping\" the shrinking of its holdings of Treasurys and other bonds, which could put less upward pressure on longer-term yields, he said. \"That could at least by a symbolic action that they're not blind to what's going on.\"\n\nOf course, the U.S. economy is still growing, and a recession is far from assured. The Fed has been clear about the tightrope it began walking when it started hiking rates sharply in March 2022: Being too aggressive would choke the economy, but going too soft would give inflation more oxygen and hurt everyone.\n\nAfter leaving the federal funds rate steady last week, before several discouraging economic reports hit, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said officials \"have a lot of room to respond if we were to see weakness\" in the job market after raising their main rate to the highest level in more than two decades.\n\nGoldman Sachs economist David Mericle sees a higher chance of a recession following Friday's jobs report. But he still sees only a 25% chance of that, up from 10%, in part \"because the data look fine overall\" and he does not \"see major financial imbalances.\"\n\nStill, stocks of companies whose profits are most closely tied to the economy's strength took heavy losses on the fears about a sharp slowdown. The small companies in the Russell 2000 index dropped 5.5%, further dousing what had been a revival for it and other beaten-down areas of the market.\n\nMaking things worse for Wall Street, Big Tech stocks also tumbled sharply as the market's most popular trade for much of this year continued to unravel. Apple, Nvidia and a handful of other Big Tech stocks known as the \" Magnificent Seven \" had propelled the S&P 500 to dozens of all-time highs this year, in part on a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. They were so strong that they overshadowed weakness for areas of the stock market weighed down by high interest rates.\n\nBut Big Tech's momentum turned last month on worries investors had taken their prices too high and expectations for future growth are becoming too difficult to meet. A set of underwhelming profit reports from Tesla and Alphabet added to the pessimism and accelerated the declines.\n\nApple fell 6.8% Monday after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it had slashed its ownership stake in the iPhone maker.\n\nNvidia, the chip company that's become the poster child of Wall Street's AI bonanza, fell even more, 11%. Analysts cut their profit forecasts over the weekend for the company after a report from The Information said Nvidia's new AI chip is delayed. It has trimmed its gain for the year to 92.7% from 170% in the middle of June.\n\nBecause the Magnificent Seven companies have grown to be the market's biggest by market value, the movements for their stocks carry much more weight on the S&P 500 and other indexes. Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon were the heaviest weights on the S&P 500.\n\nWorries outside corporate profits, interest rates and the economy are also weighing on the market. The Israel-Hamas war may be worsening, which beyond its human toll could also cause sharp swings for the price of oil. That's adding to broader worries about potential hotspots around the world, while upcoming U.S. elections could further scramble things.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Elaine Kurtenbach and Matt Ott

Market heavyweight and omputer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. lost 5.3%.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng index lost 2.1% to 16,945.51 and the S&P/ASX 200 in Australia declined 1.3% to 7,725.40. South Korea's Kospi declined 3.4% to 2,570.64.\n\nOn Friday, the S&P 500 sank 1.8% for its first back-to-back losses of at least 1% since April. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 610 points, or 1.5%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 2.4% as stocks retreated around the world and back to Wall Street.\n\nFriday's losses for tech stocks dragged the Nasdaq composite 10% below its record set last month. That level of drop is what traders call a \"correction.\"\n\nThe rout began just a couple days after U.S. stock indexes had jumped to their best day in months after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave the clearest indication yet that inflation has slowed enough for cuts to rates to begin in September.\n\nNow, worries are rising the Fed may have kept its main interest rate at a two-decade high for too long, raising risks of a recession in the world's largest economy. A rate cut would make it easier for U.S. households and companies to borrow money and boost the economy, but it could take months to a year for the full effects to filter through.\n\nWorries over weakness in the U.S. economy and volatile markets have rippled around the world, even though the U.S. economy is still growing, and a recession is far from a certainty.\n\nThe Nikkei 225 dropped 5.8% on Friday. It has struggled since the Bank of Japan raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday and is now at about the level it was when the year began.\n\nThe sell-offs on Friday and Monday were among the worst ever for the index, which saw its biggest rout during the market meltdowns of Black Monday in October 1987.\n\nThe modest rate hike, to just 0.25% from 0.1%, pushed up the value of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar, which could hurt profits for exporters and deflate a boom in tourism. But worries over the U.S. economy seem to be a larger factor driving investors to dump stocks.\n\nEarly Monday, the dollar was trading at 145.50 yen. That's sharply below its level of over 160 yen a few weeks ago.\n\nChinese stocks fell Friday as investors registered disappointment with the government's latest efforts to spur growth through various piecemeal measures, instead of hoped-for infusions of broader stimulus, while stock indexes dropped by more than 1% across much of Europe.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news",

Worried about a slowing U.S. economy, investors sent the market in Japan to its worst day in decades and have sliced billions in market value off some of the world's biggest technology companies. They've turned a relatively calm year in markets on its head.\n\nFor most of the year, investors worldwide drove stock markets higher, convinced that central banks were successfully, if haltingly, getting inflation under control, and buoyed by a healthy U.S. economy and the promise of artificial intelligence.\n\nWATCH: Economist says Federal Reserve too slow to cut interest rates and weakening the economy\n\nBy June Nvidia, the leader in AI chipmaking, had joined Apple and Microsoft as $3 trillion companies. In mid-July, the S&P 500, Nasdaq composite and Japan's Nikkei 225 had risen to all-time highs. Investors believed that the high interest rates put in place by the U.S. Federal Reserve were taming inflation without causing a sharp slowdown in the U.S. economy, the world's largest.\n\nThat confidence has taken a hit the past few days. Investors are listening to warnings that Nvidia and other Big Tech stocks have gotten too expensive, and that massive spending on AI might not turn into profits for a while. Weak readings on the job market, manufacturing and construction last week sparked worries about a U.S. recession and criticism that the Fed waited too long to cut rates. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan has started raising rates, causing turmoil in Japan's markets.\n\nOn Friday, the Nasdaq composite went into a correction, which is a 10% decline from its most recent high. On Monday, the Nikkei plunged more than 12%, its worst drop since 1987. By midday in the U.S., the S&P 500 was down 2.2% and, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had dropped 2%. Oil and other commodities prices fell because of the economic worries.\n\nTraders in the U.S. are betting the Federal Reserve will have to cut rates by half a percentage point in September instead of the usual quarter point. Some are calling for an emergency rate cut. However, there are opposing voices saying the sell-off is actually a good thing because stock prices had risen too high.\n\nHere's a look at what's driving the turbulence in markets:\n\nInflation and central banks\n\nThough the Fed hasn't raised its benchmark rate in a year, interest rates remain at more than two-decade highs after the U.S. central bank raised them 11 times beginning in 2022 in an effort to get inflation down to its 2% target. Part of the Fed's goal was to cool a red-hot labor market that rebounded after the pandemic recession with the rest of the U.S. economy.\n\nInvestors thought the Fed and other central banks were on track, even though inflation remained somewhat above their targets. The European Central Bank and the Bank of England cut once, and the Fed has signaled it was prepared to start cutting rates in September.\n\nAnxiety over the U.S. economy\n\nThere had been some pockets of weakness in the U.S. economy, particularly spending by lower-income Americans, but overall the economy still grew at a rate of 2.8% in the second quarter. Then came last week's economic reports.\n\nOn Friday, the government's monthly report on the job market showed a significant slowdown in hiring by U.S. employers. Worries that the Fed may have kept the brakes on the economy too long spread through the markets. Reports on manufacturing and construction were also weak.\n\nBig Tech\n\nWhile technology stocks have been the biggest winners in the market's runup this year, members of the highly influential group of stocks known as the \" Magnificent Seven \" underwhelmed investors in their latest earnings reports.\n\nThis handful of Big Tech stocks drove the S&P 500 to dozens of records this year, in part due to the frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. But their momentum turned last month on worries investors had taken their prices too high and expectations for their profit gains had grown too difficult to meet, particularly with regard to artificial intelligence.\n\nApple fell 5% Monday after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it had slashed its ownership stake in the iPhone maker. Nvidia lost more than $238 billion in market value Thursday and Friday and the stock was down another 7% Monday.\n\nJapan's slump\n\nThe Nikkei suffered its worst two-day decline ever, dropping 18.2% in the last two trading sessions. The wave of selling hit all sorts of companies, including Toyota, Honda and computer chip maker Tokyo Electron.\n\nShare prices have fallen in Tokyo since the Bank of Japan raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday.\n\nAnalysts said factor one factor contributing to the falling share prices was carry trades. That when investors borrow money from a country with low interest rates and a relatively weak currency, like Japan, and invest those funds in places that will yield a high return. But the higher interest rates, plus a stronger Japanese yen, could force investors to selling stocks to repay those loans.\n\nThe yen rose to 143.25 for one U.S. dollar on Wednesday morning.

Some are calling for an emergency rate cut. However, there are opposing voices saying the sell-off is actually a good thing because stock prices had risen too high.\n\nHere's a look at what's driving the turbulence in markets:\n\nInflation and central banks\n\nThough the Fed hasn't raised its benchmark rate in a year, interest rates remain at more than two-decade highs after the U.S. central bank raised them 11 times beginning in 2022 in an effort to get inflation down to its 2% target. Part of the Fed's goal was to cool a red-hot labor market that rebounded after the pandemic recession with the rest of the U.S. economy.\n\nInvestors thought the Fed and other central banks were on track, even though inflation remained somewhat above their targets. The European Central Bank and the Bank of England cut once, and the Fed has signaled it was prepared to start cutting rates in September.\n\nAnxiety over the U.S. economy\n\nThere had been some pockets of weakness in the U.S. economy, particularly spending by lower-income Americans, but overall the economy still grew at a rate of 2.8% in the second quarter. Then came last week's economic reports.\n\nOn Friday, the government's monthly report on the job market showed a significant slowdown in hiring by U.S. employers. Worries that the Fed may have kept the brakes on the economy too long spread through the markets. Reports on manufacturing and construction were also weak.\n\nBig Tech\n\nWhile technology stocks have been the biggest winners in the market's runup this year, members of the highly influential group of stocks known as the \" Magnificent Seven \" underwhelmed investors in their latest earnings reports.\n\nThis handful of Big Tech stocks drove the S&P 500 to dozens of records this year, in part due to the frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. But their momentum turned last month on worries investors had taken their prices too high and expectations for their profit gains had grown too difficult to meet, particularly with regard to artificial intelligence.\n\nApple fell 5% Monday after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it had slashed its ownership stake in the iPhone maker. Nvidia lost more than $238 billion in market value Thursday and Friday and the stock was down another 7% Monday.\n\nJapan's slump\n\nThe Nikkei suffered its worst two-day decline ever, dropping 18.2% in the last two trading sessions. The wave of selling hit all sorts of companies, including Toyota, Honda and computer chip maker Tokyo Electron.\n\nShare prices have fallen in Tokyo since the Bank of Japan raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday.\n\nAnalysts said factor one factor contributing to the falling share prices was carry trades. That when investors borrow money from a country with low interest rates and a relatively weak currency, like Japan, and invest those funds in places that will yield a high return. But the higher interest rates, plus a stronger Japanese yen, could force investors to selling stocks to repay those loans.\n\nThe yen rose to 143.25 for one U.S. dollar on Wednesday morning. It had topped 160 in the spring.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

World shares began trading mixed on Monday, July 15, 2024, after China reported that its economy expanded at a lower-than-forecast 4.7% annual pace in the last quarter.\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Nearly everything on Wall Street is tumbling Monday as fear about a slowing U.S. economy worsens and sets off another sell-off for financial markets around the world.\n\nThe S&P 500 was down by 4% in early trading, coming off its worst week in more than three months. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1,197 points, or 3%, as of 9:35 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite slid 5.5% to pull it 15% below its record set last month.\n\nThe drops were just the latest in a sell-off that swept the Earth. Japan's Nikkei 225 helped start Monday by plunging 12.4% for its worst day since the Black Monday crash of 1987.\n\nIt was the first chance for traders in Tokyo to react to Friday's report showing U.S. employers slowed their hiring last month by much more than economists expected. That was the latest piece of data on the U.S. economy to come in weaker than expected, and it's all raised fear the Federal Reserve has pressed the brakes on the U.S. economy by too much for too long through high interest rates in hopes of stifling inflation.\n\nLosses elsewhere in the world were nearly as neck-snapping. South Korea's Kospi index careened 8.8% lower, stock markets across Europe sank roughly 3% and bitcoin dropped 12%.\n\nEven gold, which has a reputation for offering safety during tumultuous times, slipped nearly 2%.\n\nThat's in part because traders are wondering if the damage has been so severe that the Federal Reserve will have to cut interest rates in an emergency meeting, before its next scheduled decision on Sept. 18. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which closely tracks expectations for the Fed, fell to 3.74% from 3.88% late Friday and from 5% in April.\n\n\"The Fed could ride in on a white horse to save the day with a big rate cut, but the case for an inter-meeting cut seems flimsy,\" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. \"Those are usually reserved for emergencies, like COVID, and an unemployment rate of 4.3% doesn't really seem like an emergency.\"\n\n\"The Fed could respond by stopping\" the shrinking of its holdings of Treasurys and other bonds, which could put less upward pressure on longer-term yields, he said. \"That could at least by a symbolic action that they're not blind to what's going on.\"\n\nOf course, the U.S. economy is still growing, and a recession is far from assured. The Fed has been clear about the tightrope it began walking when it started hiking rates sharply in March 2022: Being too aggressive would choke the economy, but going too soft would give inflation more oxygen and hurt everyone.\n\nAfter leaving the federal funds rate steady last week, before several discouraging economic reports hit, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said officials \"have a lot of room to respond if we were to see weakness\" in the job market after raising their main rate to the highest level in more than two decades.\n\nGoldman Sachs economist David Mericle sees a higher chance of a recession following Friday's jobs report. But he still sees only a 25% chance of that, up from 10%, in part \"because the data look fine overall\" and he does not \"see major financial imbalances.\"\n\nStill, stocks of companies whose profits are most closely tied to the economy's strength took heavy losses on the fears about a sharp slowdown. The small companies in the Russell 2000 index dropped 5.5%, further dousing what had been a revival for it and other beaten-down areas of the market.\n\nMaking things worse for Wall Street, Big Tech stocks also tumbled sharply as the market's most popular trade for much of this year continued to unravel. Apple, Nvidia and a handful of other Big Tech stocks known as the \" Magnificent Seven \" had propelled the S&P 500 to dozens of all-time highs this year, in part on a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. They were so strong that they overshadowed weakness for areas of the stock market weighed down by high interest rates.\n\nBut Big Tech's momentum turned last month on worries investors had taken their prices too high and expectations for future growth are becoming too difficult to meet. A set of underwhelming profit reports from Tesla and Alphabet added to the pessimism and accelerated the declines.\n\nApple fell 6.8% Monday after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it had slashed its ownership stake in the iPhone maker.\n\nNvidia, the chip company that's become the poster child of Wall Street's AI bonanza, fell even more, 11%. Analysts cut their profit forecasts over the weekend for the company after a report from The Information said Nvidia's new AI chip is delayed. It has trimmed its gain for the year to 92.7% from 170% in the middle of June.\n\nBecause the Magnificent Seven companies have grown to be the market's biggest by market value, the movements for their stocks carry much more weight on the S&P 500 and other indexes. Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon were the heaviest weights on the S&P 500.\n\nWorries outside corporate profits, interest rates and the economy are also weighing on the market. The Israel-Hamas war may be worsening, which beyond its human toll could also cause sharp swings for the price of oil. That's adding to broader worries about potential hotspots around the world, while upcoming U.S. elections could further scramble things.\n\nAP Business Writers Elaine Kurtenbach and Matt Ott

Here's what to know about how we got here", "body": "Markets on Wall Street and around the world are in a mini-panic. Worried about a slowing U.S. economy, investors sent the market in Japan to its worst day in decades and have sliced billions in market value off some of the world's biggest technology companies. They've turned a relatively calm year in markets on its head.For most of the year, investors worldwide drove stock markets higher, convinced that central banks were successfully, if haltingly, getting inflation under control, and buoyed by a healthy U.S. economy and the promise of artificial intelligence.By June Nvidia, the leader in AI chipmaking, had joined Apple and Microsoft as $3 trillion companies. In mid-July, the S&P 500, Nasdaq composite and Japan's Nikkei 225 had risen to all-time highs. Investors believed that the high interest rates put in place by the U.S. Federal Reserve were taming inflation without causing a sharp slowdown in the U.S. economy, the world's largest.That confidence has taken a hit the past few days. Investors are listening to warnings that Nvidia and other Big Tech stocks have gotten too expensive, and that massive spending on AI might not turn into profits for a while. Weak readings on the job market, manufacturing and construction last week sparked worries about a U.S. recession and criticism that the Fed waited too long to cut rates. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan has started raising rates, causing turmoil in Japan's markets.On Friday, the Nasdaq composite went into a correction, which is a 10% decline from its most recent high. On Monday, the Nikkei plunged more than 12%, its worst drop since 1987. By midday in the U.S., the S&P 500 was down 2.2% and, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had dropped 2%. Oil and other commodities prices fell because of the economic worries.Traders in the U.S. are betting the Federal Reserve will have to cut rates by half a percentage point in September instead of the usual quarter point. Some are calling for an emergency rate cut. However, there are opposing voices saying the sell-off is actually a good thing because stock prices had risen too high.Here's a look at what's driving the turbulence in markets:Inflation and central banksThough the Fed hasn't raised its benchmark rate in a year, interest rates remain at more than two-decade highs after the U.S. central bank raised them 11 times beginning in 2022 in an effort to get inflation down to its 2% target. Part of the Fed's goal was to cool a red-hot labor market that rebounded after the pandemic recession with the rest of the U.S. economy.Investors thought the Fed and other central banks were on track, even though inflation remained somewhat above their targets. The European Central Bank and the Bank of England cut once, and the Fed has signaled it was prepared to start cutting rates in September.Anxiety over the U.S. economyThere had been some pockets of weakness in the U.S. economy, particularly spending by lower-income Americans, but overall the economy still grew at a rate of 2.8% in the second quarter. Then came last week's economic reports.On Friday, the government's monthly report on the job market showed a significant slowdown in hiring by U.S. employers. Worries that the Fed may have kept the brakes on the economy too long spread through the markets. Reports on manufacturing and construction were also weak.Big TechWhile technology stocks have been the biggest winners in the market's runup this year, members of the highly influential group of stocks known as the \"Magnificent Seven\" underwhelmed investors in their latest earnings reports.This handful of Big Tech stocks drove the S&P 500 to dozens of records this year, in part due to the frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. But their momentum turned last month on worries investors had taken their prices too high and expectations for their profit gains had grown too difficult to meet, particularly with regard to artificial intelligence.Apple fell 5% Monday after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it had slashed its ownership stake in the iPhone maker. Nvidia lost more than $238 billion in market value Thursday and Friday and the stock was down another 7% Monday.Japan's slumpThe Nikkei suffered its worst two-day decline ever, dropping 18.2% in the last two trading sessions. The wave of selling hit all sorts of companies, including Toyota, Honda and computer chip maker Tokyo Electron.Share prices have fallen in Tokyo since the Bank of Japan raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday.Analysts said factor one factor contributing to the falling share prices was carry trades. That when investors borrow money from a country with low interest rates and a relatively weak currency, like Japan, and invest those funds in places that will yield a high return. But the higher interest rates, plus a stronger Japanese yen, could force investors to selling stocks to repay those loans.The yen rose to 143.25 for one U.S. dollar on Wednesday morning. It had topped 160 in the spring.\n\nMarkets on Wall Street and around the world are in a mini-panic. Worried about a slowing U.S. economy, investors sent the market in Japan to its worst day in decades and have sliced billions in market value off some of the world's biggest technology companies. They've turned a relatively calm year in markets on its head.\n\nFor most of the year, investors worldwide drove stock markets higher, convinced that central banks were successfully, if haltingly, getting inflation under control, and buoyed by a healthy U.S. economy and the promise of artificial intelligence.\n\nBy June Nvidia, the leader in AI chipmaking, had joined Apple and Microsoft as $3 trillion companies. In mid-July, the S&P 500, Nasdaq composite and Japan's Nikkei 225 had risen to all-time highs. Investors believed that the high interest rates put in place by the U.S. Federal Reserve were taming inflation without causing a sharp slowdown in the U.S. economy, the world's largest.\n\nThat confidence has taken a hit the past few days. Investors are listening to warnings that Nvidia and other Big Tech stocks have gotten too expensive, and that massive spending on AI might not turn into profits for a while. Weak readings on the job market, manufacturing and construction last week sparked worries about a U.S. recession and criticism that the Fed waited too long to cut rates. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan has started raising rates, causing turmoil in Japan's markets.\n\nOn Friday, the Nasdaq composite went into a correction, which is a 10% decline from its most recent high. On Monday, the Nikkei plunged more than 12%, its worst drop since 1987. By midday in the U.S., the S&P 500 was down 2.2% and, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had dropped 2%. Oil and other commodities prices fell because of the economic worries.\n\nTraders in the U.S. are betting the Federal Reserve will have to cut rates by half a percentage point in September instead of the usual quarter point. Some are calling for an emergency rate cut. However, there are opposing voices saying the sell-off is actually a good thing because stock prices had risen too high.\n\nHere's a look at what's driving the turbulence in markets:\n\nInflation and central banks\n\nThough the Fed hasn't raised its benchmark rate in a year, interest rates remain at more than two-decade highs after the U.S. central bank raised them 11 times beginning in 2022 in an effort to get inflation down to its 2% target. Part of the Fed's goal was to cool a red-hot labor market that rebounded after the pandemic recession with the rest of the U.S. economy.\n\nInvestors thought the Fed and other central banks were on track, even though inflation remained somewhat above their targets. The European Central Bank and the Bank of England cut once, and the Fed has signaled it was prepared to start cutting rates in September.\n\nAnxiety over the U.S. economy\n\nThere had been some pockets of weakness in the U.S. economy, particularly spending by lower-income Americans, but overall the economy still grew at a rate of 2.8% in the second quarter. Then came last week's economic reports.\n\nOn Friday, the government's monthly report on the job market showed a significant slowdown in hiring by U.S. employers. Worries that the Fed may have kept the brakes on the economy too long spread through the markets. Reports on manufacturing and construction were also weak.\n\nBig Tech\n\nWhile technology stocks have been the biggest winners in the market's runup this year, members of the highly influential group of stocks known as the \"Magnificent Seven\" underwhelmed investors in their latest earnings reports.\n\nThis handful of Big Tech stocks drove the S&P 500 to dozens of records this year, in part due to the frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. But their momentum turned last month on worries investors had taken their prices too high and expectations for their profit gains had grown too difficult to meet, particularly with regard to artificial intelligence.\n\nApple fell 5% Monday after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it had slashed its ownership stake in the iPhone maker. Nvidia lost more than $238 billion in market value Thursday and Friday and the stock was down another 7% Monday.\n\nJapan's slump\n\nThe Nikkei suffered its worst two-day decline ever, dropping 18.2% in the last two trading sessions. The wave of selling hit all sorts of companies, including Toyota, Honda and computer chip maker Tokyo Electron.\n\nShare prices have fallen in Tokyo since the Bank of Japan raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday.\n\nAnalysts said factor one factor contributing to the falling share prices was carry trades. That when investors borrow money from a country with low interest rates and a relatively weak currency, like Japan, and invest those funds in places that will yield a high return.

Japan's Nikkei 225 helped start Monday by plunging 12.4 percent for its worst day since the Black Monday crash of 1987.\n\nIt was the first chance for traders in Tokyo to react to Friday's report showing US employers slowed their hiring last month by much more than economists expected. That was the latest piece of data on the US economy to come in weaker than expected, and it's all raised fear the Federal Reserve has pressed the brakes on the US economy by too much for too long through high interest rates in hopes of stifling inflation.\n\nLosses elsewhere in the world were nearly as neck-snapping. South Korea's Kospi index careened 8.8 percent lower, stock markets across Europe sank roughly 3 percent and bitcoin dropped 12 percent.\n\nEven gold, which has a reputation for offering safety during tumultuous times, slipped 1.6 percent.\n\nThat's in part because traders are wondering if the damage has been so severe that the Federal Reserve will have to cut interest rates in an emergency meeting, before its next scheduled decision on Sept. 18. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which closely tracks expectations for the Fed, fell to 3.79 percent from 3.88 percent late Friday and from 5 percent in April.\n\n\"The Fed could ride in on a white horse to save the day with a big rate cut, but the case for an inter-meeting cut seems flimsy,\" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. \"Those are usually reserved for emergencies, like COVID, and an unemployment rate of 4.3 percent doesn't really seem like an emergency.\"\n\n\"The Fed could respond by stopping\" the shrinking of its holdings of Treasurys and other bonds, which could put less upward pressure on longer-term yields, he said. \"That could at least by a symbolic action that they're not blind to what's going on.\"\n\nOf course, the US economy is still growing, and a recession is far from assured. The Fed has been clear about the tightrope it began walking when it started hiking rates sharply in March 2022: Being too aggressive would choke the economy, but going too soft would give inflation more oxygen and hurt everyone.\n\nAfter leaving the federal funds rate steady last week, before several discouraging economic reports hit, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said officials \"have a lot of room to respond if we were to see weakness\" in the job market after raising their main rate to the highest level in more than two decades.\n\nGoldman Sachs economist David Mericle sees a higher chance of a recession following Friday's jobs report. But he still sees only a 25 percent chance of that, up from 15 percent, in part \"because the data look fine overall\" and he does not \"see major financial imbalances.\"\n\nStill, stocks of companies whose profits are most closely tied to the economy's strength took heavy losses on the fears about a sharp slowdown. The small companies in the Russell 2000 index dropped 5.5 percent, further dousing what had been a revival for it and other beaten-down areas of the market.\n\nMaking things worse for Wall Street, Big Tech stocks also tumbled sharply as the market's most popular trade for much of this year continued to unravel. Apple, Nvidia and a handful of other Big Tech stocks known as the \"Magnificent Seven\" had propelled the S&P 500 to dozens of all-time highs this year, in part on a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. They were so strong that they overshadowed weakness for areas of the stock market weighed down by high interest rates.\n\nBut Big Tech's momentum turned last month on worries investors had taken their prices too high and expectations for future growth are becoming too difficult to meet. A set of underwhelming profit reports from Tesla and Alphabet added to the pessimism and accelerated the declines.\n\nApple fell 4.6 percent Monday after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it had slashed its ownership stake in the iPhone maker.\n\nNvidia, the chip company that's become the poster child of Wall Street's AI bonanza, fell even more, 8.3 percent. Analysts cut their profit forecasts over the weekend for the company after a report from The Information said Nvidia's new AI chip is delayed. It has trimmed its gain for the year to 98.7 percent from 170 percent in the middle of June.\n\nBecause the Magnificent Seven companies have grown to be the market's biggest by market value, the movements for their stocks carry much more weight on the S&P 500 and other indexes.\n\nWorries outside corporate profits, interest rates and the economy are also weighing on the market. The Israel-Hamas war may be worsening, which beyond its human toll could also cause sharp swings for the price of oil. That's adding to broader worries about potential hotspots around the world, while upcoming US elections could further scramble things.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news",

By about an hour after trading began, the index was down 5.3%, or about 1,900 points, at 34,010.69.\n\nStocks tumbled Friday on worries the U.S. economy could be cracking under the weight of high interest rates meant to tame inflation.\n\nA report showing hiring by U.S. employers slowed last month by much more than expected has convulsed financial markets, vanquishing the euphoria that had taken the Nikkei to all-times highs of over 42,000 in recent weeks.\n\nThe S&P 500 sank 1.8% on Friday for its first back-to-back losses of at least 1% since April. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 610 points, or 1.5%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 2.4% as stocks retreated around the world and back to Wall Street.\n\nThe rout began just a couple days after U.S. stock indexes had jumped to their best day in months after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave the clearest indication yet that inflation has slowed enough for cuts to rates to begin in September.\n\nA board above the trading floor shows the closing number for the Dow Jones industrial average, at the New York Stock Exchange, Friday, Aug. 2, 2024.

A rate cut would make it easier for U.S. households and companies to borrow money and boost the economy, but it could take months to a year for the full effects to filter through.\n\nWorries over weakness in the U.S. economy and volatile markets have rippled around the world, even though the U.S. economy is still growing, and a recession is far from a certainty.\n\nThe Nikkei 225 dropped 5.8% on Friday. It has struggled since the Bank of Japan raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday. The hike pushed up the value of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar, which could hurt profits for exporters and deflate a boom in tourism.\n\nEarly Monday, the dollar was trading at 145.50 yen. That's sharply below its level of over 160 yen a few weeks ago.\n\nChinese stocks fell Friday as investors registered disappointment with the government\u00b4s latest efforts to spur growth through various piecemeal measures, instead of hoped-for infusions of broader stimulus, while stock indexes dropped by more than 1% across much of Europe.\n\nFILE - People pass the New York Stock Exchange on July 31, 2024 in New York.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 996 points, or 2.5%, as of 9:50 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.8%.\n\nThe drops were just the latest in a sell-off that swept the Earth. Japan's Nikkei 225 helped start Monday by plunging 12.4% for its worst day since the Black Monday crash of 1987.\n\nIt was the first chance for traders in Tokyo to react to Friday's report showing U.S. employers slowed their hiring last month by much more than economists expected. That was the latest piece of data on the U.S. economy to come in weaker than expected, and it's all raised fear the Federal Reserve has pressed the brakes on the U.S. economy by too much for too long through high interest rates in hopes of stifling inflation.\n\nLosses elsewhere in the world were nearly as neck-snapping. South Korea's Kospi index careened 8.8% lower, stock markets across Europe sank roughly 3% and bitcoin dropped 12%.\n\nEven gold, which has a reputation for offering safety during tumultuous times, slipped 1.6%.\n\nThat's in part because traders are wondering if the damage has been so severe that the Federal Reserve will have to cut interest rates in an emergency meeting, before its next scheduled decision on Sept. 18. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which closely tracks expectations for the Fed, fell to 3.79% from 3.88% late Friday and from 5% in April.\n\n\"The Fed could ride in on a white horse to save the day with a big rate cut, but the case for an inter-meeting cut seems flimsy,\" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. \"Those are usually reserved for emergencies, like COVID, and an unemployment rate of 4.3% doesn't really seem like an emergency.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"The Fed could respond by stopping\" the shrinking of its holdings of Treasurys and other bonds, which could put less upward pressure on longer-term yields, he said. \"That could at least by a symbolic action that they're not blind to what's going on.\"\n\nOf course, the U.S. economy is still growing, and a recession is far from assured. The Fed has been clear about the tightrope it began walking when it started hiking rates sharply in March 2022: Being too aggressive would choke the economy, but going too soft would give inflation more oxygen and hurt everyone.\n\nAfter leaving the federal funds rate steady last week, before several discouraging economic reports hit, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said officials \"have a lot of room to respond if we were to see weakness\" in the job market after raising their main rate to the highest level in more than two decades.\n\nGoldman Sachs economist David Mericle sees a higher chance of a recession following Friday's jobs report. But he still sees only a 25% chance of that, up from 15%, in part \"because the data look fine overall\" and he does not \"see major financial imbalances.\"\n\nStill, stocks of companies whose profits are most closely tied to the economy's strength took heavy losses on the fears about a sharp slowdown. The small companies in the Russell 2000 index dropped 5.5%, further dousing what had been a revival for it and other beaten-down areas of the market.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nMaking things worse for Wall Street, Big Tech stocks also tumbled sharply as the market's most popular trade for much of this year continued to unravel. Apple, Nvidia and a handful of other Big Tech stocks known as the \" Magnificent Seven \" had propelled the S&P 500 to dozens of all-time highs this year, in part on a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. They were so strong that they overshadowed weakness for areas of the stock market weighed down by high interest rates.\n\nBut Big Tech's momentum turned last month on worries investors had taken their prices too high and expectations for future growth are becoming too difficult to meet. A set of underwhelming profit reports from Tesla and Alphabet added to the pessimism and accelerated the declines.\n\nApple fell 4.6% Monday after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it had slashed its ownership stake in the iPhone maker.\n\nNvidia, the chip company that's become the poster child of Wall Street's AI bonanza, fell even more, 8.3%. Analysts cut their profit forecasts over the weekend for the company after a report from The Information said Nvidia's new AI chip is delayed. It has trimmed its gain for the year to 98.7% from 170% in the middle of June.\n\nBecause the Magnificent Seven companies have grown to be the market's biggest by market value, the movements for their stocks carry much more weight on the S&P 500 and other indexes.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nWorries outside corporate profits, interest rates and the economy are also weighing on the market. The Israel-Hamas war may be worsening, which beyond its human toll could also cause sharp swings for the price of oil. That's adding to broader worries about potential hotspots around the world, while upcoming U.S. elections could further scramble things.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Elaine Kurtenbach and Matt Ott

Worried about a slowing US economy, investors sent the market in Japan to its worst day in decades and have sliced billions in market value off some of the world's biggest technology companies. They've turned a relatively calm year in markets on its head.\n\nFor most of the year, investors worldwide drove stock markets higher, convinced that central banks were successfully, if haltingly, getting inflation under control, and buoyed by a healthy US economy and the promise of artificial intelligence.\n\nAlso Read | Bangladesh Unrest: West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee Appeals to People To Maintain Peace in State.\n\nBy June Nvidia, the leader in AI chipmaking, had joined Apple and Microsoft as USD 3 trillion companies. In mid-July, the S and P 500, Nasdaq composite and Japan's Nikkei 225 had risen to all-time highs. Investors believed that the high interest rates put in place by the US Federal Reserve were taming inflation without causing a sharp slowdown in the US economy, the world's largest.\n\nThat confidence has taken a hit the past few days. Investors are listening to warnings that Nvidia and other Big Tech stocks have gotten too expensive, and that massive spending on AI might not turn into profits for a while. Weak readings on the job market, manufacturing and construction last week sparked worries about a US recession and criticism that the Fed waited too long to cut rates. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan has started raising rates, causing turmoil in Japan's markets.\n\nAlso Read | Bangladesh Unrest: Indian Cultural Centre Vandalised by Unruly Mob, 4 Hindu Temples Suffer Minor Damages Across Country.\n\nOn Friday, the Nasdaq composite went into a correction, which is a 10 per cent decline from its most recent high. On Monday, the Nikkei plunged more than 12 per cent, its worst drop since 1987.\n\nBy midday in the US, the S and P 500 was down 2.2 per cent and, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had dropped 2 per cent. Oil and other commodities prices fell because of the economic worries.\n\nTraders in the US are betting the Federal Reserve will have to cut rates by half a percentage point in September instead of the usual quarter point. Some are calling for an emergency rate cut. However, there are opposing voices saying the sell-off is actually a good thing because stock prices had risen too high.\n\nHere's a look at what's driving the turbulence in markets:\n\nInflation and central banks\n\nThough the Fed hasn't raised its benchmark rate in a year, interest rates remain at more than two-decade highs after the US central bank raised them 11 times beginning in 2022 in an effort to get inflation down to its 2 per cent target.\n\nPart of the Fed's goal was to cool a red-hot labour market that rebounded after the pandemic recession with the rest of the US economy.\n\nInvestors thought the Fed and other central banks were on track, even though inflation remained somewhat above their targets. The European Central Bank and the Bank of England cut once, and the Fed has signalled it was prepared to start cutting rates in September.\n\nAnxiety over the US economy\n\nThere had been some pockets of weakness in the US economy, particularly spending by lower-income Americans, but overall the economy still grew at a rate of 2.8 per cent in the second quarter. Then came last week's economic reports.\n\nOn Friday, the government's monthly report on the job market showed a significant slowdown in hiring by US employers. Worries that the Fed may have kept the brakes on the economy too long spread through the markets. Reports on manufacturing and construction were also weak.\n\nBig Tech\n\nWhile technology stocks have been the biggest winners in the market's runup this year, members of the highly influential group of stocks known as the \"Magnificent Seven\" underwhelmed investors in their latest earnings reports.\n\nThis handful of Big Tech stocks drove the S and P 500 to dozens of records this year, in part due to the frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. But their momentum turned last month on worries investors had taken their prices too high and expectations for their profit gains had grown too difficult to meet, particularly with regard to artificial intelligence.\n\nApple fell 5 per cent on Monday after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it had slashed its ownership stake in the iPhone maker. Nvidia lost more than USD 238 billion in market value Thursday and Friday and the stock was down another 7 per cent on Monday.\n\nJapan's slump\n\nThe Nikkei suffered its worst two-day decline ever, dropping 18.2 per cent in the last two trading sessions. The wave of selling hit all sorts of companies, including Toyota, Honda and computer chip maker Tokyo Electron.\n\nShare prices have fallen in Tokyo since the Bank of Japan raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday.\n\nAnalysts said factor one factor contributing to the falling share prices was carry trades. That when investors borrow money from a country with low interest rates and a relatively weak currency, like Japan, and invest those funds in places that will yield a high return. But the higher interest rates, plus a stronger Japanese yen, could force investors to selling stocks to repay those loans.\n\nThe yen rose to 143.25 for one US dollar on Wednesday morning. It had topped 160 in the spring.

About an hour after the start of trading, the index had fallen 5.3%, or about 1,900 points, to 34,010.69.\n\nStock prices fell on Friday on concerns that the U.S. economy could buckle under the pressure of high interest rates meant to curb inflation.\n\nA report showed that U.S. employer employment slowed much more than expected last month, rattling financial markets and destroying the euphoria that had propelled the Nikkei to record highs of over 42,000 in recent weeks.\n\nThe S&P500 fell for the first time on Friday, down 1.8% consecutive losses of at least 1% since April. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 610 points, or 1.5%, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 2.4% as stocks globally and back on Wall Street fell.\n\nThe defeat had just begun a few days later U.S. stock indexes rose to their best day in months after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell gave the clearest signal yet that inflation had eased enough to cut interest rates in September.\n\nNow, concerns are mounting that the Fed may have kept its key interest rate at a two-decade high for too long, raising the risk of a recession in the world's largest economy. A rate cut would make it easier for American households and businesses to borrow money and boost the economy, but the full effects could take months to a year to sink in.\n\nConcerns about the weakness of the US economy and unstable markets are spreading around the world, even though the US economy is still growing and a recession is far from certain.\n\nThe Nikkei 225 fell 5.8% on Friday, as the index has struggled since the Bank of Japan reference rate on Wednesday. The increase pushed up the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar, which could hurt exporters' profits and dampen a tourism boom.\n\nOn Monday morning, the dollar was trading at 145.50 yen, well down from the level of over 160 yen a few weeks ago.\n\nChinese stocks fell on Friday as investors were disappointed with the the latest efforts of the government to stimulate growth with a variety of piecemeal measures, rather than the hoped-for broader stimulus, while stock indices in much of Europe fell by more than 1%.", "source": {"uri": "nybreaking.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NY Breaking News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nikkei", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Nikkei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stock market index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikkei_225", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nikkei 225"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangkok", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangkok"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangkok"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq_Composite", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq Composite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dow Jones Industrial Average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Japan", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japanese yen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stimulus (economics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://nybreaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Japans-Nikkei-225-index-plunges-nearly-7-as-global-sell-offs.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9785897", "eventUri": "eng-9785897", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

Worried about a slowing U.S. economy, investors sent the market in Japan to its worst day in decades and have sliced billions in market value off some of the world's biggest technology companies. They've turned a relatively calm year in markets on its head.\n\nFor most of the year, investors worldwide drove stock markets higher, convinced that central banks were successfully, if haltingly, getting inflation under control, and buoyed by a healthy U.S. economy and the promise of artificial intelligence.\n\nBy June Nvidia, the leader in AI chipmaking, had joined Apple and Microsoft as $3 trillion companies. In mid-July, the S&P 500, Nasdaq composite and Japan's Nikkei 225 had risen to all-time highs. Investors believed that the high interest rates put in place by the U.S. Federal Reserve were taming inflation without causing a sharp slowdown in the U.S. economy, the world's largest.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nOld Pink fire was due to arson, investigators find; person of interest identified Caesars Sportsbook promo code PLAYS1000 for NFL Hall Of Fame Game: $1,000 bonus for Bears vs. Texans 'Time is an enemy': Costco unlikely before 2026, Station Twelve a question mark and Boulevard Mall languishes Camp observations: Bills run game, pass defense show out at Highmark practice Price hike: Seat prices doubling at new Bills stadium for some club season ticket holders Wegmans loses its crown as top supermarket Bills camp observations: Coach Sean McDermott concerned about number of injuries PolitiFact: Tenney claims that Biden executive order requires federal employees to break law Alan Pergament: As of September, all three local broadcast affiliates will have 7 p.m. newscasts Jiri Kulich must 'tear up the league' with Amerks before his Sabres call comes 'A dangerous situation': Safety fixes sought after Tonawanda crash kills teen bicyclist Police take shooting suspects into custody after chase over Skyway Bills punting competition ends as team adds another safety to roster NJ developer plans overhaul of Gateway Building property in Hamburg Sabres Mailbag: Can Lindy Ruff make Buffalo one of NHL's top defensive teams?\n\nThat confidence has taken a hit the past few days. Investors are listening to warnings that Nvidia and other Big Tech stocks have gotten too expensive, and that massive spending on AI might not turn into profits for a while. Weak readings on the job market, manufacturing and construction last week sparked worries about a U.S. recession and criticism that the Fed waited too long to cut rates. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan has started raising rates, causing turmoil in Japan's markets.\n\nOn Friday, the Nasdaq composite went into a correction, which is a 10% decline from its most recent high. On Monday, the Nikkei plunged more than 12%, its worst drop since 1987. By midday in the U.S., the S&P 500 was down 2.2% and, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had dropped 2%. Oil and other commodities prices fell because of the economic worries.\n\nTraders in the U.S. are betting the Federal Reserve will have to cut rates by half a percentage point in September instead of the usual quarter point. Some are calling for an emergency rate cut. However, there are opposing voices saying the sell-off is actually a good thing because stock prices had risen too high.\n\nHere's a look at what's driving the turbulence in markets:\n\nInflation and central banks\n\nThough the Fed hasn't raised its benchmark rate in a year, interest rates remain at more than two-decade highs after the U.S. central bank raised them 11 times beginning in 2022 in an effort to get inflation down to its 2% target.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite fell 3.4%, the S&P 500 was down by 2.9% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.9%.\n\nEarlier Monday, Japan's Nikkei 225 plunged 12.4% for its worst day since the crash of 1987. South Korea's benchmark Kospi lost 8%. The losses cascaded through Europe, with London's FTSE 100 down 2% in its worst day of trading since January.\n\nTech stocks in the U.S. sustained some of the heaviest losses as investors worried that spending on AI might not bring results soon. Nvidia Inc. lost more than 6%, Apple was down 4.4% as Berkshire Hathaway cut its stake in the iPhone maker, and Microsoft fell 3.4%.\n\nInvestors worldwide reacted to the Labor Department's report of weaker-than-expected hiring in July. It prompted concerns that the Federal Reserve has kept interest rates too high for too long to bring down inflation that soared to a 40-year high under the Biden-Harris administration. The jobless rate in July rose to 4.3%, the highest since October 2021.\n\nEconomic anxieties highlighted by the massive sell-off are rapidly gaining renewed prominence in the presidential campaign.\n\nPresident Biden, returning to the White House Monday from a weekend at his home in Delaware, didn't respond to reporters' shouted questions about the stock market. Vice President Kamala Harris, who quickly captured the Democratic nomination after Mr. Biden dropped out of the race, was huddled in meetings with advisers as she prepared to announce her selection of a running mate.\n\nHer opponent, former President Donald Trump, blamed Ms. Harris and the president, signaling the renewed importance of the economy and high prices as major campaign themes.\n\n\"Of course there is a massive market downturn,\" Mr. Trump said on social media. \"Voters have a choice -- Trump prosperity, or the Kamala crash & great depression of 2024.\"\n\nSen. Tom Cotton, Arkansas Republican, posted on X: \"If you think the economy is bad today, putting a San Francisco socialist in charge would make it much worse.\"\n\nMs. Harris has been trying to calibrate her economic message as she takes the reins of Democrats' campaign. \"Bidenomics\" has not sat well with voters who, despite a good jobs picture for the last few years, have faced punishing price increases that canceled out wage gains.\n\nSen. J.D. Vance of Ohio, the GOP vice presidential nominee, will hold a campaign event in Philadelphia on Tuesday hours before Ms. Harris introduces her running mate to Democratic voters in the city. The Trump campaign gave a preview of Mr. Vance's visit, saying, \"The stock market is crashing because of weak and failed Kamala Harris' policies ... In weak, failed, and dangerously liberal Kamala Harris' America, families are struggling to afford the basics and stay safe.\"\n\nThe Trump campaign said Pennsylvania families have had to pay an average of $958 more per month due to higher prices.\n\nOn Wall Street, some traders began wondering if the damage has been so severe that the Fed will have to cut interest rates in an emergency meeting, before its next scheduled decision on Sept. 18. The central bank took no action on rates at its meeting last month.\n\n\"The Fed could ride in on a white horse to save the day with a big rate cut, but the case for an inter-meeting cut seems flimsy,\" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. \"Those are usually reserved for emergencies, like COVID, and an unemployment rate of 4.3% doesn't really seem like an emergency.\"\n\nSome of Wall Street's recent declines may also simply be air coming out of a stock market that romped to dozens of all-time highs this year, in part on a frenzy around artificial intelligence technology and hopes for coming cuts to interest rates. Critics have been saying for a while that the stock market looked expensive after prices rose faster than corporate profits.\n\n\"Markets tend to move higher like they're climbing stairs, and they go down like they're falling out a window,\" according to J.J. Kinahan, CEO of IG North America. He chalks much of the recent worries to euphoria around AI subsiding and \"a market that was ahead of itself.\"\n\nProfessional investors also pointed to the Bank of Japan's move last week to raise its main interest rate from nearly zero. Such a move helps boost the value of the Japanese yen, but it could also force traders to scramble out of deals where they borrowed money for virtually no cost in Japan and invested it elsewhere around the world.\n\nThere was some positive economic news Monday, with a report saying growth for U.S. services businesses was slightly stronger than expected. Growth was led by businesses in the arts, entertainment and recreation businesses, along with accommodations and food services, according to the Institute for Supply Management. Treasury yields also pared their drops following the better-than-expected data.\n\nOthers pointed to second-quarter growth of 2.8% in the U.S. which was much stronger than expected.\n\nFor most of the year, investors worldwide drove stock markets higher, convinced that central banks were successfully, if haltingly, getting inflation under control, and buoyed by a healthy U.S. economy and the promise of artificial intelligence.\n\nBy June, Nvidia, the leader in AI chipmaking, had joined Apple and Microsoft as $3 trillion companies. In mid-July, the S&P 500, Nasdaq composite and Japan's Nikkei 225 had risen to all-time highs. Investors believed that the high interest rates put in place by the U.S. Federal Reserve were taming inflation without causing a sharp slowdown in the U.S. economy, the world's largest.\n\nThat confidence has taken a hit the past few days. Investors are listening to warnings that Nvidia and other Big Tech stocks have gotten too expensive, and that massive spending on AI might not turn into profits for a while.\n\nAs the markets plummeted Monday, several online brokerage firms including Charles Schwab, Fidelity and Vanguard appeared to be down for thousands of users.\n\nUser reports appeared to peak around and just before 10 a.m. EDT, data from outage tracker Downdectector shows. Some frustrated customers online said that they were unable to log in or access their account balances.\n\n\"Due to a technical issue, some clients may have difficulty logging in to Schwab platforms,\" Charles Schwab wrote on social media platform X Monday morning. \"Please accept our apologies as our teams work to resolve the issue as quickly as possible.\"\n\nBy mid-day, Schwab confirmed that the issue had been resolved.\n\nA Fidelity spokesperson told The Associated Press via email Monday that the company was aware of some customers experiencing \"intermittent issues\" earlier in the day, but said that this is now resolved.\n\nVanguard did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nAt its peak, Charles Schwab saw nearly 15,000 outage reports from users around 9:50 a.m. EDT, per Downdetector. Fidelity and Vanguard saw another 3,800 and 2,900, respectively, closer to 10 a.m. EDT. User reports appeared to fall notably for all three platforms about an hour later.", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dave_boyer@washingtontimes.com", "name": "Dave Boyer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Labor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Labor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTSE_100_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FTSE 100 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikkei_225", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nikkei 225"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dow Jones Industrial Average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

The yield on the two-year Treasury, which closely tracks expectations for the Fed, fell to 3.74 per cent from 3.88 per cent late Friday and from 5 per cent in April.\n\n\"The Fed could ride in on a white horse to save the day with a big rate cut, but the case for an inter-meeting cut seems flimsy,\" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. \"Those are usually reserved for emergencies, like COVID, and an unemployment rate of 4.3 per cent doesn't really seem like an emergency.\"\n\n\"The Fed could respond by stopping\" the shrinking of its holdings of Treasury and other bonds, which could put less upward pressure on longer-term yields, he said. \"That could at least be a symbolic action that they're not blind to what's going on.\"\n\nOf course, the US economy is still growing, and a recession is far from assured. The Fed has been clear about the tightrope it began walking when it started hiking rates sharply in March 2022: Being too aggressive would choke the economy, but going too soft would give inflation more oxygen and hurt everyone.\n\nAfter leaving the federal funds rate steady last week, before several discouraging economic reports hit, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said officials \"have a lot of room to respond if we were to see weakness\" in the job market after raising their main rate to the highest level in more than two decades.\n\nGoldman Sachs economist David Mericle sees a higher chance of a recession following Friday's jobs report. But he still sees only a 25 per cent chance of that, up from 10 per cent, in part \"because the data look fine overall\" and he does not \"see major financial imbalances.\"\n\nStill, stocks of companies whose profits are most closely tied to the economy's strength took heavy losses on the fears about a sharp slowdown. The small companies in the Russell 2000 index dropped 5.5 per cent, further dousing what had been a revival for it and other beaten-down areas of the market.\n\nMaking things worse for Wall Street, Big Tech stocks also tumbled sharply as the market's most popular trade for much of this year continued to unravel. Apple, Nvidia and a handful of other Big Tech stocks known as the \"Magnificent Seven\" had propelled the S&P 500 to dozens of all-time highs this year, in part on a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. They were so strong that they overshadowed weakness for areas of the stock market weighed down by high interest rates.\n\nBut Big Tech's momentum turned last month on worries investors had taken their prices too high and expectations for future growth are becoming too difficult to meet. A set of underwhelming profit reports from Tesla and Alphabet added to the pessimism and accelerated the declines.\n\nApple fell 6.8 per cent Monday after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it had slashed its ownership stake in the iPhone maker.\n\nNvidia, the chip company that's become the poster child of Wall Street's AI bonanza, fell even more, 11 per cent. Analysts cut their profit forecasts over the weekend for the company after a report from The Information said Nvidia's new AI chip is delayed. It has trimmed its gain for the year to 92.7 per cent from 170 per cent in the middle of June.", "source": {"uri": "afr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian Financial Review"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of the Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wealth management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal funds rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goldman Sachs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2361%2C$multiply_3%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_379%2C$y_215/t_crop_custom/c_scale%2Cw_800%2Cq_88%2Cf_jpg/t_afr_no_label_no_age_social_wm/61a4d2d3f70f924e25d27edce5da7c49e8803642", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9785897", "eventUri": "eng-9785897", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-18", "textStart": 305, "textEnd": 313}], "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

That's the weakest reading since December and the second-weakest since March 2020, when the pandemic was just beginning in the West.\n\nThe June figure was also revised down to 179,000 from the previously healthy figure of 206,000.\n\nWhen factoring in the number of people entering the labor force, the U.S. unemployment rate rose to 4.3% in July, worse than the 4.1% Wall Street had expected.\n\nAnd they have deepened fears that the world's largest economy is heading into recession.\n\nSuch fears began to spread on Wednesday evening when the Federal Reserve decided not to cut interest rates from the 5.25% to 5.5% range it has maintained since July, and some figures the next day suggested U.S. manufacturing activity would decline in July.\n\nThis has already sent U.S. stocks tumbling even before the jobs data was released. All major U.S. stock indexes fell on Thursday, with the most important index, the S&P 500, down 2.5%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 1.9%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq down 3.3%, and the Russell 2000, a major index of smaller U.S. companies, down 3%.\n\nThe declines were compounded this afternoon as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq showed signs of a third straight week of losses. The indexes, which had been dragged down by mixed trading updates from big tech companies, have now reached levels last seen in May and are officially in \"correction\" territory.\n\nThat is, it is down more than 10% from its most recent high in July.\n\nSome individual stocks fell even more sharply, with Snapchat parent Snap at one point down 30% and chipmaker Intel down 28%. Shares in Nasdaq-listed British chip designer Arm Holdings fell another 6%, losing a quarter of its market value this week. Amazon, one of the tech giants whose trading updates left Wall Street in shock overnight, fell 12%.\n\nOther asset classes are also falling. Oil prices, which are expected to fall in the event of a U.S. recession, are expected to fall for the fourth straight week, with Brent crude hitting $77.70 a barrel this afternoon, the lowest level since the first week of June.\n\nOn the positive side, gold, a traditional safe haven for investors, is close to its all-time high of $2,483.60 set on July 17 this afternoon.\n\nAnd US Treasury bonds (US government IOUs) have also surged. The yield on the 2-year Treasury note, which closely tracks interest rates (and falls as prices rise), fell below 4% for the first time since May, while the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 3.79% at one point, the last time it was at a level since December.\n\nMarket commentators and economists now expect the Fed to cut rates next month.\n\n\"Oh my goodness, did the Fed make a policy mistake? The weakness in the labor market is now more apparent, with job gains falling below the 150,000 threshold considered consistent with a strong economy,\" said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at fund manager Principal Asset Management.\n\n\"With a September rate cut set to happen, the Fed will be hoping it's not too late to act this time around.\"\n\nMichael Brown, market analyst at trading platform Pepperstone, said: \"The July U.S. jobs report showed that labor market conditions continue to cool. There is little in the report that will convince the Federal Reserve to meet its first open market committee of the cycle. [interest rate] \"As hinted at in this week's statement, there will be cuts at the next meeting in September.\"\n\nMeanwhile, European stocks were already down on Thursday and continued to fall today. The FTSE-100 is down 2.15% since Wednesday evening, slightly behind some of its continental peers with greater exposure to technology stocks. Paris' CAC-40 is down 3.1% over the past two sessions, while Germany's DAX is down 4.1%. Italy's MIB is down 5.3% over the same period, while the Netherlands' AEX, an index led by ASML, the world's largest maker of equipment used to make chips, is down 3.9%.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Asia Pacific region, Japanese stocks saw very aggressive selling.\n\nThat's largely due to the yen's surge against the greenback after the Bank of Japan's surprise rate hike on Wednesday. The yen's weakness, which hit a 38-year low against the dollar in June, has been a key driver of Japanese stocks this year, and the currency's surge has upended the market. The Nikkei 225 index, which includes Japan's major blue-chip companies, was already down on Thursday and today fell 5.8%, its biggest one-day drop since March 2020. The Nikkei, which hit a record high earlier this year, is now down 12% since July 12.\n\nMeanwhile, the Topix, a broad index of Japanese stocks, fell 6.2%, its biggest daily decline since 2016.\n\nWhat's interesting about this selloff is that in recent years, when central banks like the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England kept their policy rates at ultra-low levels, bad news about the economy was seen as good news for the market, as it suggested that central banks would keep rates low for longer.\n\nBut everything changed in December 2021 when the Bank of Korea became the first major central bank in the world to raise interest rates, followed by the Federal Reserve.\n\nNow, with interest rates \"normalizing\" for more than two years, bad news about the economy is again being seen as bad news for the markets.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors":

Chipmaker Nvidia fell 5.6%.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1,238 points in early trading, but pared some of those losses by early afternoon, when it was down 800 points, or 2%, as of 12:05 p.m. ET.\n\nMarkets recovered some of their early losses as Wall Street digested data from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) services index on Monday, which showed that employment in services picked up in July.\n\n\"The details of the ISM report are encouraging, with economic activity, new orders and employment all rebounding sharply in July,\" Oxford Economics said in a research note Monday. The report \"is consistent with our view of an economy in transition rather than on the brink of collapse.\"\n\nWhat's Driving Stocks Down?\n\nStocks began to lose ground Thursday after weak manufacturing and construction reports fueled fears that the U.S. economy may finally buckle under pressure from high interest rates.\n\nOn Friday, government data showed that hiring last month was much weaker than expected, reinforcing Wall Street fears that a \"soft landing\" in which the U.S. economy might avoid a recession despite 23-year high interest rates could instead turn into a hard landing.\n\n\"The main driver of resistance is the slowing economy,\" Paul Christopher, Wells Fargo's head of global investment strategy, wrote in a report. \"Investors have watched household financial stress worsen over the past two years, but during that time, job growth has remained above its December 2009-December 2019 average of 180,000 new jobs per month.\"\n\nBut Friday's jobs report showed employers added just 114,000 new jobs last month, far fewer than the 175,000 jobs economists had expected, he noted.\n\nTechnology stocks have been hit particularly hard in recent weeks as investors shun artificial intelligence companies amid questions about when the emerging sector will generate profits.\n\n\"It's been a tough few weeks for the AI group as financial results have been released,\" wrote analysts at Melius Research. \"Microsoft, Meta, Google and Amazon have all been asked about the benefits of AI investments. While it's pretty clear that they all need to keep spending, the market remains skeptical about their pace.\"\n\nFinancial Advisor Discusses Stock Market Drop as Unemployment Rate Rises 07:48\n\nThe market rout spread to Asian and European markets, with Japan's benchmark stock index plunging 12.4% on Monday. The Nikkei fell 5.8% on Friday, its worst two-day decline in history.\n\nStocks in Korea and Taiwan also fell sharply, with all three Asian markets hit by investors pulling back from AI-focused companies amid concerns the sector is overhyped.\n\nEuropean markets also opened lower on Monday, with Germany's DAX down 2.3% at 17,267.00 points. The CAC 40 in Paris lost 1.9% to 7,114.33 points and the FTSE 100 in London fell 2.1% to 8,004.19 points.\n\nDespite Monday's rout, U.S. stocks remain in positive territory for the year. The S&P 500, for example, is up 9% year-to-date, even after accounting for the stock market's three-day slide, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is still up 3%.\n\nWhen will the Fed cut rates?\n\nFaced with the disappointing economic data, Wall Street is concerned that the Federal Reserve has kept its benchmark interest rate too high for too long, raising the risk of a recession. The central bank kept the federal funds rate unchanged at its July 31 meeting to discuss the state of the economy and whether and when it should start cutting rates.\n\nLower interest rates would make it cheaper for U.S. households and businesses to borrow, but it may take time for the effects to be felt across the economy. On Monday, some investors called on the Fed to start cutting rates sooner rather than later to avoid an economic slowdown.\n\nHow likely is the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in September? 04:14\n\n\"The Federal Reserve must begin easing monetary policy more aggressively than previously anticipated to avoid an imminent recession in the world's largest economy,\" Nigel Green, CEO of deVere Group, an independent financial advisory and asset management firm, said in an email. \"The Fed was late at the start of the cycle, it can't afford to be late again.\"\n\nEconomists still don't expect a recession\n\nAlthough concerns about the weakness of the U.S. economy and market volatility have spread around the world, domestic economic activity remains strong, with many analysts saying a recession remains unlikely. Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist at Capital Economics, still expects a soft landing, while acknowledging that the risk of a deeper recession is increasing.\n\nThe economy has been picking up steam this year, with the country's gross domestic product surging to 2.8% in the second quarter, beating expectations. A recession is typically marked by two consecutive quarters of negative GDP. And while the July jobs report was disappointing, analysts point out that it only reflects one month of data, while noting that July's depressed hiring numbers may also have been affected by Hurricane Beryl.\n\n\"It can be wrong to draw too broad conclusions from a single data release,\" Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer for the Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, told investors in a research note. \"The number of people who reported being unable to work [in July] \"Due to the weather conditions, the number of displaced people rose to 436,000, compared to an average of 33,000 for the month of July since 2000.\"\n\nAimee Picchi is an associate editor at CBS MoneyWatch, where she covers business and personal finance.

Bill Plunkett at the Orange County Register has more.\n\nThis matches what Roberts said over the weekend, after Kershaw pitched two simulated innings facing hitters at Dodger Stadium.\n\n\"I thought Clayton was good. It was good to see him throw two innings. We accomplished what we wanted to,\" Roberts said Sunday. \"If all goes well, Clayton will start his rehab and go three innings.\"\n\nKershaw started a previous rehab assignment on June 19, when he struck out five batters in three innings for Low-A Rancho Cucamonga. His schedule was halted after feeling shoulder soreness after that start, and he was shut down from throwing for a week, during which he got pain-killing injections in his shoulder and got an MRI exam that showed no new damage.\n\nLast week at Dodger Stadium, Kershaw resumed throwing, and sounded like someone anxious to return to games that matter.\n\n\"You don't feel like you're doing what you're supposed to be doing. Even though it was kind of part of the deal with the surgery, you knew you'd be out for some time,\" Kershaw said on July 2. \"Being around it more now, getting closer, and kind of tasting being able to be back out there, each day is starting to be a little more tedious.\n\n\"I get it.

The left-hander threw a two-inning simulated game Sunday before the Dodgers' loss to the Milwaukee Brewers.\n\nManager Dave Roberts provided an update, and it was a promising one.\n\n\"It was good to see him throw two innings. We accomplished what we wanted to.\"\n\nFabian Ardaya of The Atheltic shared that Roberts said if everything goes well, Kershaw could only need two rehab starts before L.A. activates him.\n\nThe 36-year-old has been sidelined all season long after undergoing surgery on his left shoulder last November, and it seems like Kershaw could be ready to make his 2024 debut for the Dodgers at some point within the next month or so. It's unclear what type of role Kershaw could play for the Dodgers when he comes back, but one thing is for sure: L.A. will use him to ramp him up for postseason baseball.\n\nKershaw previously made a three-inning rehab start for Single-A Rancho Cucamonga on June 19, but he was subsequently shut down from throwing for the next week after experiencing lingering soreness in his shoulder.\n\nFor now that's all in the past. According to Roberts, Kershaw is in line to start Saturday with Triple-A Oklahoma City. The expectation for Kershaw is to pitch three innings. Two more starts could allow the Dodgers activate Kershaw off the 60-day IL as early as July 28.\n\nThe road to recovery has been long and rocky, but it's almost at its end. No. 22 could be on a big league mound soon.\n\nPhoto Credit: Kiyoshi Mio-USA TODAY Sports", "source": {"uri": "dodgersnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dodgers Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ricardo_sandoval@dodgersnation.com", "name": "Ricardo Sandoval", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clayton_Kershaw", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Clayton Kershaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Roberts_(pitcher)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dave Roberts (pitcher)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_and_Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Brewers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Brewers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Class A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Triple-A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://dodgersnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/USATSI_21601057_168396005_lowres.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713349", "eventUri": "eng-9713349", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 993, "textEnd": 1000}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-28", "textStart": 1386, "textEnd": 1393}], "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

The left-hander threw three innings for Single-A Rancho Cucamonga on June 19, but dealt with lingering soreness after the start and was shut down.\n\n\"Just some old-man shoulder, a little bit,\" he told the Los Angeles Times' Jack Harris when asked last week what happened. \"There's some wear and tear in there. But nothing new.\"\n\nFollowing the rehab start, Kershaw underwent an MRI which showed no damage in his left shoulder, met with orthopedic surgeon Dr. Neal ElAttrache and received \"some shots\" to reduce the soreness.\n\nKershaw, 36, started 24 games for the Dodgers last season, his 16th year in MLB, striking out 137 batters in 131 2/3 innings and compiling a 2.46 ERA. With Yoshinobu Yamamoto and Walker Buehler on the injured list, Dustin May's status for the season in question and Tony Gonsolin needing reconstructive elbow surgery, Kershaw's return would be welcome.\n\nThough with a 7 1/2-game lead in the National League West, he and the Dodgers can be patient with a recovery timeline.

The Dodgers are hopeful to receive some help in the form of Clayton Kershaw and Walker Buehler, both of whom are currently on the injured list.\n\nKershaw was making good progress in his recovery from left shoulder surgery but needed to pause the process after beginning a rehab assignment. He's since gotten back on track and is poised for a return to game action.\n\nAccording to Bill Plunkett of the Southern California News Group, Kershaw is scheduled to make a rehab start with Triple-A Oklahoma City on Saturday:\n\nLeft-hander Clayton Kershaw is scheduled to resume his minor-league injury rehabilitation assignment with Triple-A Oklahoma City on Saturday. Kershaw is expected to pitch three innings.\n\nThe Oklahoma City Baseball Club is facing Triple-A El Paso (San Diego Padres) affiliate at Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark in Kershaw's scheduled start.\n\nThe planned three innings are equal to that from Kershaw's first rehab start with Single-A Rancho Cucamonga last month. That was followed by lingering shoulder soreness that was treated with pain-killing injections and a brief stretch of being shut down from throwing.\n\nKershaw resumed a throwing program and successfully cleared hurdles of a bullpen session and facing batters in a simulated game.\n\nKershaw's minor setback should have a minimal effect the timeline for his return. While the Dodgers have stayed away from giving a date for Kershaw's return, he was always expected to come off the injured list after the All-Star break, and that remains a likely outcome barring further trouble.\n\nKershaw threw 36 pitches over three innings, allowed one run on two hits and finished with five strikeouts against one walk in his start for the Quakes.\n\nIncluding Saturday, he figures to make at least two more rehab starts before potentially joining the Dodgers rotation.", "source": {"uri": "s22927.pcdn.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dodger Blue"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sebastian_abdon_ibarra@s22927.pcdn.co", "name": "Sebastian Abd\u00f3n Ibarra", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clayton_Kershaw", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Clayton Kershaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Triple-A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walker_Buehler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Walker Buehler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chickasaw_Bricktown_Ballpark", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southern California"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Paso,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "El Paso, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "El Paso, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Class A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rancho_Cucamonga,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rancho Cucamonga, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rancho Cucamonga, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Officiating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://dodgerblue-com.exactdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Clayton-Kershaw3.jpg?strip=all&lossy=1&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713349", "eventUri": "eng-9713349", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

Don't know where he's at right now,\" Roberts explained.\n\n\"I still think that lat, just trying to make sure that we (don't rush it). He's interesting because he was still pitching with some soreness, but then there was a point that we had to IL him.\n\n\"And so if we're going to run the exercise of putting him on the IL, let's really put it to bed. And so that's what we're trying to do.

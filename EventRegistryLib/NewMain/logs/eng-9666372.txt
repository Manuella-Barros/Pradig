That according to findings of a report completed earlier this year by the nonprofit Hawai'i Land Trust (HILT) and Kah\u0101l\u0101wai Consulting LLC. The report studied the threat of accelerated land loss by local families and businesses.\n\nBy conducting a detailed analysis of Maui County property sales, assessments, and tax data, as well as reviewing studies on previous disasters in Florida, Louisiana, and California, the report shows that disaster-fueled real estate speculation can widen wealth inequality and drive displacement. Despite new regulation and a significant outpouring of public and private aid to counter immediate displacement, the Lahaina disaster may lead to increased real estate sales and accelerated land loss in the years to come.\n\nThe report estimates that, under a scenario with a 15% increase in average residential sales, as documented in other disaster-ravaged communities, Lahaina could see an estimated 6.5% of residential properties totaling $122 million change hands over the course of a year. Within 3 years, that equates to 20% turnover of ownership of at least $360 million in value.\n\n\"An estimated 95% of the lands affected by the Aug. 8 fire were residential and commercial parcels,\" the report states, with owner-occupied homes representing less than 25% of properties in West Maui. \"Maintaining the identity and character of Lahaina will be impossible if remaining local families and businesses are forced out by relentless pressure from offshore real estate investors.\"\n\nIn the six months after the wildfires, more than $25 million in real estate was sold in Lahaina, according to the report. During that same timeframe, communities from K\u0101'anapali to Kapalua saw more than $189 million in transactions.\n\nOrganizations like community land trusts, such as N\u0101 Hale o Maui and the Lahaina Community Land Trust (LCLT), work to uphold affordable, owner-occupied residential properties. They help maintain the culture and character of a place and avoid displacement due to investment forces from outside. Land trusts are a proven method to acquire and hold community interests in real estate, with successful initiatives in cities including New York City and Seattle. There are at least a dozen existing land trusts operating across Hawai'i.\n\nHILT is a 501(c)3 statewide nonprofit that protects, stewards, and connects people to the lands that sustain Hawai\u02bbi.\n\n\"Land trusts can help stabilize a community after a disaster, preserving the inseparable connection between people and \u02bb\u0101ina, ranging from affordable housing to commercial space to farmland to critical ecosystems,\" said 'Olu Campbell, President and CEO of HILT.\n\n\"The Lahaina Community Land Trust is grateful to HILT and Kah\u0101l\u0101wai Consulting for producing this report which shines a bright light on what a powerful force community land trusts can be for social justice, anti-displacement, and community empowerment. In our hardest times, we realize the strength we have as a community. We really are stronger together.\" said Mikey Burke, President of LCLT whose family survived the fire but lost their home in the disaster. \"LCLT is committed to preserving the identity of Lahaina by protecting land and holding space for local families to stay and have a future in Lahaina. The people are the spirit of this place, and that spirit is strong.\"\n\nThe report was funded by the KL Felicitas Foundation, which enables social entrepreneurs and enterprises worldwide to develop and grow sustainably. Kah\u0101l\u0101wai Consulting focuses on the management of environmental conflict. The report was prepared by its principal, Jonathan Likeke Scheuer, with the assistance of Maui-born and based associate Marina Starleaf Riker, who lost the home she was renting in the Kula fires.",

The other candidates are James Forrest and Tasha Kama.\n\nGo to Civil Beat's Election Guide for general information, and check out other candidates on the Primary Election Ballot.\n\n1. Clearly, Maui County faces big issues related to the fires. What's the primary thing Maui needs to do now to recover from the fires?\n\nWe need to provide sufficient long-term temporary housing that can be occupied by February when FEMA programs end, and continue working on permanent housing.\n\nThe focus must be on the west side because that is where Lahaina people want to return. And this means providing sufficient water and other infrastructure, which will require coordination with the state.\n\n2. What should Maui do to encourage people to stay? What can the county do to ensure that families aren't priced out?\n\nPeople will stay if they have homes that they can afford and jobs that pay a living wage. The council has budgeted more than $75 million in the upcoming budget to subsidize new workforce housing projects, including projects on the west side.\n\n3. Do you support the new state law that allows counties to regulate and even shut down short-term rentals? Why or why not?\n\nYes, because the counties should have \"home rule\" over this level of regulation; the state should not have the final say on whether or how these uses are allowed. It should be up to the counties.\n\nI have concerns over the proposed shutdown of short-term rentals, though, which is why the council will commission a study to analyze its potential impacts, both good and bad.\n\n4. What's your vision for Lahaina? How should it be rebuilt and who should decide?\n\nThe community, residents and property owners should decide in consultation with the county. The county's role would be in land use planning and the provision of adequate infrastructure.\n\nThe question of how Lahaina should be rebuilt should have been asked months ago so that a plan could be developed in case some properties cannot be redeveloped, such as those along the shoreline that are threatened by coastal erosion and sea level rise.\n\nMy vision is for Lahaina to retain and restore as much of its historic and cultural heritage as possible, and for it to continue to have a walkable, livable mix of residential, business, public and service uses that put the needs of our residents first.\n\n5. What should elected officials do to restore trust in county government?\n\nTrust has to be earned by your words and actions.\n\nEveryone, especially elected officials, must be true to their word. Elected officials in particular must tell \"the whole truth\" and not provide only selective information when responding to inquiries or requests, and must be responsive to the public.\n\n6. Do you think Maui County should do more to manage water resources? Why or why not?\n\nYes, absolutely.\n\nThe August 2024 wildfires and the need to rebuild and provide new temporary and permanent housing in Lahaina has shown the problem of our current regulatory framework where the county cannot just develop new water sources to meet our needs -- the state must approve.\n\nCounty officials have better awareness of the community's water needs, for housing, agriculture, subsistence, fire protection, cultural practices, recreation, etc., than officials on Oahu.\n\n7. What is the first thing Maui County should do to get in front of climate change rather than just reacting to it?\n\nWe face two immediate threats from climate change, both of which have already shown us that we cannot wait to act: wildfire hazards and coastal erosion/sea level rise.\n\nFor wildfire hazards, several key agencies have produced \"after action reports\" with findings and recommendations, many of which relate to being proactive and better prepared. These recommendations need to be put into effect, either through policy and practice or through law.\n\nFor coastal erosion/sea level rise, the rebuilding of Lahaina can show us how to build responsibly and resiliently, and these practices can be replicated county-wide.\n\nAdditionally, we need a comprehensive and realistic plan for existing coastal development that is imminently threatened.\n\n8. Homelessness is becoming more of an issue on Maui. What do you think needs to be changed to help people get into housing, and stay housed?\n\nWe need to learn from past mistakes and work collaboratively with housing developers on solutions that meet our residents' needs and the developer's bottom line.\n\nFor decades, our market and affordable housing supply kept up with demand through market forces and county workforce housing requirements. When these requirements became too strict, developers stopped building new homes. When the requirements were then loosened, we began to see new developments again.\n\nHowever, there is a temptation to impose additional requirements, with the well-intentioned goal of providing more housing at affordable and workforce rates; but such requirements will only result in another cycle of reduced supply.\n\n9. Traffic is getting worse on Maui, and different regions face different challenges. What would be your approach to improve Maui's transportation problems?\n\nSince our roadway system involves both county and state jurisdictions, this must be a collaborative effort. The Maui Metropolitan Planning Organization is the county's transportation planning agency that coordinates and schedules county, state and federal funding for county and state transportation projects.\n\nWe have many planned solutions for traffic congestion, such as new roads and improved roadway alignments, but are constrained by available funding.", "source": {"uri": "civilbeat.org",

The National Endowment for the Humanities has awarded a grant of $19,605.79 to the Foundation for Advancement in Conservation (FAIC) to deploy two of its National Heritage Responders (NHR) to the island of Maui. Malia Van Heukelem and Liane Na\u02bbauao, volunteer experts in cultural-heritage conservation and preservation, will help institutions damaged by the fires -- starting with the Lahaina Jodo Mission, a historic Buddhist temple.\n\nWildfires last August destroyed much of the historic town of Lahaina -- the first capital of the Hawaiian Kingdom -- on the northwest coast of Maui, killing more than 100 people. Many museums and heritage sites were critically damaged or destroyed, including all but one of the 14 historic sites owned or managed by the Lahaina Restoration Foundation.\n\nVan Heukelem and Na\u02bbauao, conservators based on the neighbouring island of Oahu, have been working remotely since last year to mitigate the situation in Lahaina through consultation sessions and webinars. Starting in July and continuing through spring 2025, they will travel to Lahaina six times to help affected institutions and historic sites, advising on best practices for storage of salvaged objects and their safe handling.\n\n\"As a National Heritage Responder for more than a decade and as a collections manager whose career began with emergency response, deploying to Lahaina is a meaningful opportunity to collaborate with the community to safeguard sites, artefacts and traditions,\" Van Heukelem said in a statement.\n\nHawaiiPicking up the pieces of Hawaii's heritage after the devastating Maui wildfiresTheo Morrison\n\n\"This collaboration is not only about preserving objects, but also ensuring that the next generation will get the chance to appreciate Lahaina's extraordinary history and culture,\" Lissa Rosenthal-Yoffe, executive director of FAIC, said in a statement.\n\nThe NHR programme started in part as a reaction to the damage caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita to New Orleans in 2005. Since then, teams of volunteers have worked on the ground in areas affected by floods, hurricanes and tropical storms across the US and in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake. There are currently 90 conservators, curators, librarians, archivists and other collections professionals actively serving as NHR volunteers -- with an additional 35 on reserve.", "source": {"uri": "theartnewspaper.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Art Newspaper"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Endowment_for_the_Humanities", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Endowment for the Humanities"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maui", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Maui"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maui"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahaina,_Hawaii", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lahaina, Hawaii"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lahaina, Hawaii"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wildfire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Institute_for_Conservation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Institute for Conservation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservation movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_work", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Remote work"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaiian_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hawaiian Kingdom"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_temple", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buddhist temple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservator-restorer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservator-restorer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oahu", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oahu"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oahu"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archivist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Archivist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Librarian", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Librarian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane Katrina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earthquake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiti", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Haiti"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Haiti"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Historic_Preservation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Historic Preservation", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Architecture/Preservation", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Architecture/Preservation", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/Organizations", "wgt": 14}], "image": "https://cdn.sanity.io/images/cxgd3urn/production/d5960cd849fc721e5a6bbab9c499429d4a5ae7d1-1600x1067.jpg?rect=0,53,1600,960&w=1200&h=720&q=85&fit=crop&auto=format", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666372", "eventUri": "eng-9666372", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Some think so. | Maui Now", "body": "Mikey Burke and her family get emotional when talking about the upcoming one-year mark of Aug. 8, the day a wildfire destroyed their home in Lahaina.\n\n\"It's a one-year commemoration, or a one-year observance,\" she said. \"It's hard to say 'anniversary.' You always think of anniversaries as something more cheerful.\"\n\nAs the mother of four children in the Kula Kaiapuni o Lahaina Hawaiian immersion program in state Department of Education schools in West Maui, Burke has strong thoughts on how the start of the 2024-25 academic year should be handled, namely that it shouldn't begin until after the emotional date of Aug. 8.\n\nOne Maui County Council member is asking the state to do just that. On Friday the council will vote on a resolution urging the DOE to push the start of the 2024-25 school year back one week -- from Aug. 5 to Aug. 12 -- to allow observance of the one-year mark of the deadly wildfires in Lahaina and Upcountry.\n\nReaction to the resolution, which was introduced by Council Member Tamara Paltin, who holds the West Maui residency seat, was positive from parents and students at the Maui County Hawaiian Canoe Association Moki Kalanikau Regatta at Kahului Harbor on Saturday. Resolutions don't have the same power as laws but are sometimes used by the council to urge action on certain issues.\n\nBurke, the president of the Lahaina Community Land Trust, is in full support of the resolution after hearing about it for the first time on Saturday.\n\n\"If you've ever lost someone very close to you it's not that particular day that is the one that is the most painful,\" Burke said. \"Oftentimes, it's the weeks or the season leading up to that day. So, to have the children start prior to the 8th with all of the sadness and emotion and anxiety of the day coming up I think is a disservice to them. They're not going to be in the right mindset, the families are not going to be in the right mindset, the teachers are not going to be in the right mindset because we are all focused on 8-8.\"\n\nBurke has four school-aged children -- Maleko, 14, an incoming freshman at Lahainaluna; twins Makoa and Kaleohano are 9 and entering fourth grade on the Princess Nahi'ena'ena Elementary School campus; and Kaimana, 7, is a second-grader.\n\nThey were among the thousands of West Maui residents who lost their homes in the Lahaina blaze, which claimed the lives of more than 100 people.\n\nKanoa Austin, a 12-year-old incoming seventh-grader at Kalama Intermediate School, said he is in favor of the resolution.\n\n\"I think it's good because if people are sad they would have time with their family to think about the fire,\" Austin said. \"I have a couple of friends who were in the fire, so they missed school and stuff. I think it is important. ... I think it would help everybody understand how it works, how the people who lost their homes feel.\"\n\nAustin and his mother Emalia Fisher live in Pukalani and did not lose their house in the fires. The first of three major brush fires on Aug. 8 started Upcountry, forcing evacuations, destroying 19 homes in Kula and knocking out water service for months.\n\n\"I support it, I think it will be good on the one-year anniversary to spend time with family,\" Fisher said. \"It's going to be a hard time for everyone, so I think to not be in school, get support and reflect back would be good.\"\n\nFisher added that Aug. 8 \"will be a hard day to process and I think they need support, especially the young ones just because it was such a bad day. So sad.\"\n\nFisher said she would be OK with school being extended into the summer if the resolution does lead to a change in the schedule. She said the change in the schedule would not cause her any problems with child care.\n\n\"I think there's a lot of options with camps and for people who work like myself,\" said Fisher, a single mother. \"Luckily we have family here who can help.\"\n\nMaui High School Principal Jamie Yap said Saturday via phone that the schedules are set more than a year in advance and changing now would present challenges to a schedule that is drawn up to include a week off between the first and second quarters in October, a two-week winter break from late December to early January and spring break in March.\n\nGraduations are set for 66 public high schools across the state in conjunction with the calendar that ends with the final day for students on May 30, 2025.\n\n\"There's a lot of implications for that if there's going to be a change,\" Yap said. \"First of all, the state determines the start date of school and that calendar has been out for over a year or close to a year so we can prepare for openings. So when I say there's implications, people have made plans for opening or professional development and so that may be a challenge if we change the date.\"\n\nMike Landes, the Maui chapter president for the Hawai'i State Teachers Association who teaches at Lahainaluna High School, said in a message to the Hawai'i Journalism Initiative that the issue is complex.\n\n\"August 8th is sure to be a day of remembrance and reverence, mourning the people and places we lost, honoring the past, and looking forward to a future that is worthy of this great community,\" Landes said. \"The day belongs to the community, and any events that happen that day should be focused on what the community wants and needs. I assume the state and county governments would want to collaborate with community leaders to assist them in planning for that day, and so I'm not surprised that folks would be thinking about what to do regarding the schools.\n\n\"Students and educators are part of the community, and should be able to join their families and friends in whatever services, memorials, or celebrations might happen that day. All members of the community should be able to.\"\n\nThe resolution reads, in part:\n\n\"Every effort should be made to allow students the opportunity to participate in commemorative events and healing activities related to the wildfires and to acknowledge the community's strength and resiliency ... deferring the first day of school to Monday, August 12, 2024, would provide a meaningful gesture of support and recognition for those affected by the wildfires and would allow a more gradual transition into the new school year.\"\n\nThe state DOE declined to officially comment on the matter on Tuesday afternoon, but did point out that state law requires 180 instructional days for students each academic year, the exact number that is provided in the current calendar. The calendars for school years 2023-24 and 2024-25 were approved by the Board of Education on Oct. 21, 2021.\n\nA DOE memo to the board on that date noted that \"having official school calendars established for multiple years assists schools, families, employees, and community organizations to plan for upcoming years.\"\n\n\"Educational implications have driven the design of the recommended calendars,\" the memo states. \"The proposed calendar supports student attendance by maximizing five-day weeks; ends the first semester by Winter Break to minimize learning loss and ensure that students are assessed by the teacher who has provided instruction and monitored progress for most of the semester; enables more opportunities for students to earn college credits; and provides teachers more opportunities for training and professional development at the UH over the summer.\"\n\nThe memo also notes that the calendars are consistent with current collective bargaining agreements, and that both the Hawai'i State Teachers Association and Hawai'i Government Employees Association were sent drafts and had no comments.\n\nIf the resolution passes on Friday, it will be sent to state education officials as well as Gov. Josh Green and Maui County Mayor Richard Bissen.\n\nFor more information on Friday's meeting and how to testify, visit mauicounty.us/agendas.", "source": {"uri": "mauinow.com", "dataType": "news",

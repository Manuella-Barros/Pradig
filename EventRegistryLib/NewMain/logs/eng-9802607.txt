Parts of Delhi reported strong winds up to 20 kmph on Thursday, India Meteorological Department's data shows.\n\nAnumita Roychowdhury, executive director for research and advocacy at Centre for Science and Environment, said: \"This is the result of intense and persistent rainfall during the monsoon months. This provides a breather before winter pollution builds up. This is the time to recalibrate action strategy for more sustained improvement in air quality.\"\n\nThough the capital experienced the lowest AQI on Thursday, it is yet to record a 'good' air day (when AQI is 50 or below) this year. Experts said in Delhi, monsoon months are the cleanest as meteorological conditions help disperse pollutants. However, after the monsoon is over and winter sets in, the pollution soars.\n\nDipankar Saha, former head of Central Pollution Control Board's (CPCB) air laboratory, said: \"Even rain is unable to help Delhi meet the national ambient air quality standards on most days in the monsoon season. On Thursday, PM10 was the lead pollutant, which shows that dust was high on a rainy day. Agencies have to work on the ground to cut down pollution at the source level.\"\n\nCPCB's data shows that between Jan 1 and Aug 8, Delhi saw 85 days when AQI was in the range of 201 and 500. However, the number of such days was lower last year during the same period as AQI surpassed 200 on 80 days.\n\nThe air quality of Delhi is likely to stay in the 'satisfactory' category till Aug 11, according to Air Quality Early Warning System (EWS), which is the forecasting body under the Union ministry of earth sciences.\n\nOn Thursday, some parts of Delhi saw light rain. Safdarjung and Lodhi Road logged 2.8mm and 2.7mm, respectively, between 8.30am and 5.30pm. Najafgarh got 87.5mm till 8.30am on Thursday. Palam got 41 mm between 8.30 am and 8.30 pm.\n\nLight rain is likely on Friday, and light to moderate showers are predicted from Saturday to Monday as the monsoon trough is expected to oscillate. IMD has issued a 'yellow' alert (be aware) for rain from Saturday to Monday.\n\nThe maximum temperature rose to 34.1 degrees Celsius, while the minimum temperature stood at 25.4.", "source": {"uri":

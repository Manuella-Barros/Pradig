The Special Judge while hearing the bail application in the case pertaining to the ED on May 2 deferred the hearing for May 6 to hear address both the cases. Today, the court will also hear K Kavitha's demand for physical appearance in the court. The court had reserved its verdict on K Kavitha's regular bail plea on April 24.\n\nEarlier, on April 8, the court had rejected K Kavitha's interim bail plea. During the hearing on the interim bail plea, the ED had said that K Kavitha cannot be given any concession in granting bail in the money laundering case because she is a woman. During the hearing, senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing on behalf of K Kavitha, had accused the ED of becoming a harassing agency rather than an investigating agency. Singhvi had said that the investigation in this case has been completely biased.\n\nK Kavitha is currently in judicial custody. She was also arrested by the CBI on April 11. According to the CBI, K Kavitha was also involved in the conspiracy in the Delhi Excise Scam case. Earlier, K Kavitha was in judicial custody in the money laundering case of the excise scam. The CBI had questioned K Kavitha in judicial custody on 6 April in this case. On 5 April, the court had allowed the CBI to question K Kavitha in judicial custody.\n\nThe ED arrested Kavitha on 15 March after conducting raids in Hyderabad. According to ED, Kavitha was associated with the liquor traders' lobby 'South Group'. ED had sent two summons to Kavitha for questioning, but Kavitha did not appear, after which she was arrested after raids.", "source": {"uri": "etvbharat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ETV Bharat News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "etv_bharat@etvbharat.com", "name": "Etv Bharat", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kavitha_(actress)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kavitha (actress)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Directorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Enforcement Directorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharat_Rashtra_Samithi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bharat Rashtra Samithi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaveri", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kaveri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Singhvi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Singhvi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Money laundering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detention_(imprisonment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detention (imprisonment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excise", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Excise"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://etvbharatimages.akamaized.net/etvbharat/prod-images/06-05-2024/1200-675-white-logo-1200-675.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541920", "eventUri": "eng-9541920", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-06", "textStart": 1526, "textEnd": 1533}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-05", "textStart": 1551, "textEnd": 1558}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-15", "textStart": 1661, "textEnd": 1669}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-02", "textStart": 435, "textEnd": 440}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 466, "textEnd": 471}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-24", "textStart": 664, "textEnd": 672}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-08", "textStart": 687, "textEnd": 694}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-11", "textStart": 1269, "textEnd": 1277}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

Chandrasekhar Rao, is in judicial custody till May 7.\n\nSpecial Judge Kaveri Baweja of the Rouse Avenue Court presided over the money laundering cases being probed by the CBI and the ED related to the alleged excise policy scam in Delhi.\n\nThe court noted that the investigation is in a very crucial stage on certain key aspects, including the involvement of public servants and private persons and to ascertain the flow of ill-gotten money (proceeds of crime).\n\nThe judge noted that prima facie, Kavitha appears to be the key conspirator of the criminal conspiracy hatched for the purpose of collection and payment of upfront money to the Aam Aadmi Party through the co-accused for getting favourable provisions in the now-scrapped Delhi Excise Policy 2021-22.\n\n\"Her role in demanding upfront money and the alleged payment thereof for favourable provisions in the excise policy has also been highlighted in the course of the arguments,\" the court noted.\n\nThe CBI submitted that though Kavitha is not named in the FIR, her role in the case emerged during the investigation, from the statements of witnesses and approvers, WhatsApp chats, and from the documents recovered during the probe pertaining to the transaction of money in the guise of a land deal.\n\n\"The said documents/materials are stated to reveal the role of the accused/applicant as one of the key conspirators in the case,\" the CBI argued while opposing the bail plea.\n\nKavitha had cited hypertension as a reason for bail, stressing the need for medical care after her arrest by the ED.\n\nOn this, the judge noted that the documents relied upon were found to be old medical records, i.e., from the year 2013 onwards, and her complaints have apparently been addressed.\n\n\"Moreover, other ailments from which the accused/applicant (Kavitha) is stated to be affected currently, as claimed, are not so serious or severe to direct her release on bail, either regular or interim,\" the judge noted.\n\nIt was submitted before that court that appropriate medical attention is being provided to her by the jail dispensary.\n\nThe CBI also took objection to the accused's bail plea saying that being a prominent politician and an influential person, Kavitha is likely to influence the witnesses and tamper with the evidence if released on bail, and may hamper the ongoing probe.\n\nKavitha was first arrested by the ED and later by the CBI on April 11 while she was in Tihar Jail.\n\nJudge Baweja had then sent her to CBI custody, noting that a \"detailed and sustained interrogation\" of the accused is necessary.\n\nNow, she is in judicial custody in the case being probed by both the agencies.", "source": {"uri": "ommcomnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Ommcom News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharat_Rashtra_Samithi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharat Rashtra Samithi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kavitha_(actress)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kavitha (actress)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._Kavitha", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "K.

Recently, the same court had directed the Tihar Jail Authorities to Produce K Kavitha and others through video conferencing.\n\nHowever now, the BRS leader K Kavitha will be produced physically before the court tomorrow. In the application filed by BRS Leader K Kavitha, she stated \"The applicant should be produced before this Court on May 7 in both the cases i.e., CBI and ED. It was submitted that the Applicant wishes to appear physically rather than appearing virtually in both cases. It is submitted that the Applicant was arrested on March 15 and since then been in the custody of ED/CBI. The custody expires on May 7, and the Respondent agency shall produce the Applicant on the same date before this Court. This Applicant wishes to appear physically.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, the Court had dismissed the bail petitions moved by K Kavitha in connection with Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Enforcement Directorate (ED) cases related to the Excise policy case. Through plea, K Kavitha alleged that the ruling party in the Centre is using investigative agencies to publicly connect the petitioner to the Delhi Excise policy so that further coercive actions can be taken against her. The investigating agencies are well aware that there is no substance to the allegation of the petitioner's involvement in the alleged scam.\n\nThe intention behind the purported investigation against the petitioner is not to ascertain her involvement in the alleged scam, since it is painfully clear that none exists. \"The political masterminds are well aware that if the petitioner can be connected to the alleged scam, it will bring her, and by logical implication, her father, the erstwhile Chief Minister of Telangana, into disrepute. The political mileage gained from such actions can be used in the general elections scheduled for 2024. This is the sole and singular motive of the purported investigation. This is political propaganda at its shameful lowest, even by the not-so-high standards in Indian politics,\" the bail plea stated.\n\nBRS leader K Kavitha was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate on March 15, 2024 and by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on April 11, 2024. Earlier, CBI through remand application stated that \"Kavitha Kalvakuntla was required to be arrested in the instant case to conduct her custodial interrogation for confronting her with the evidence and witnesses to unearth the larger conspiracy hatched among the accused, suspect persons regarding the formulation and implementation of the Excise Policy, as well as to establish the money trail of ill-gotten money generated and to establish the role of other accused/suspect persons, including public servants, as well as to unearth the facts which are in her exclusive knowledge.\"\n\n\"The CBI inquiry was recommended based on the findings of the Delhi Chief Secretary's report filed in July showing prima facie violations of the GNCTD Act 1991, Transaction of Business Rules (ToBR)-1993, Delhi Excise Act-2009, and Delhi Excise Rules-2010,\" officials said. The ED and the CBI had alleged that irregularities were committed while modifying the excise policy, undue favors were extended to license holders, the license fee was waived or reduced and the L-1 license was extended without the competent authority's approval.\n\nThe beneficiaries diverted \"illegal\" gains to the accused officials and made false entries in their books of account to evade detection, the probe agencies said. As per the allegations, the Excise Department had decided to refund the earnest money deposit of about Rs 30 crore to a successful tenderer against the set rules.\n\nEven though there was no enabling provision, a waiver on tendered license fees was allowed from December 28, 2021, to January 27, 2022, due to COVID-19, the probe agency said and there was an alleged loss of Rs 144.36 crore to the exchequer.

Kavitha's judicial custody in ED, CBI cases", "body": "New Delhi, May 7 (SocialNews.XYZ) A Delhi court on Tuesday extended Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) leader K. Kavitha's judicial custody in connection with the money laundering cases being probed by the CBI and the ED related to the alleged excise policy scam.\n\nSpecial Judge Kaveri Baweja of the Rouse Avenue Court extended Kavitha's custody till May 20 in the Enforcement Directorate (ED) case and till May 14 in the Central Bureau of Investigation's (CBI) case.\n\nShe also extended co-accused Chanpreet Singh's judicial custody in the case,\n\nThe ED had sought the extension of their custody.\n\nOn Monday, the same court denied regular bail to Kavitha in the case noting the gravity and seriousness of the offence, the nature of the allegations against her, and the offences invoked in the case. It noted that the investigation is in a very crucial stage on certain key aspects, including the involvement of public servants and private persons and ascertaining the flow of ill-gotten money (proceeds of crime).\n\nIt noted that prima facie, Kavitha, the daughter of BRS chief and former Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, appears to be the key conspirator of the criminal conspiracy hatched for the purpose of collection and payment of upfront money to the Aam Aadmi Party through the co-accused for getting favourable provisions in the now-scrapped Delhi Excise Policy 2021-22.\n\n\"Her role in demanding upfront money and the alleged payment thereof for favourable provisions in the excise policy has also been highlighted in the course of the arguments,\" the court said.\n\nThe CBI had submitted that though Kavitha is not named in the FIR, her role in the case emerged during the investigation, from the statements of witnesses and approvers, WhatsApp chats, and documents recovered during the probe pertaining to a money transaction in the guise of a land deal.\n\n\"The said documents/materials are stated to reveal the role of the accused/applicant as one of the key conspirators in the case,\" the CBI had argued while opposing the bail plea.

It was submitted that the Applicant wishes to appear physically rather than appearing virtually in both cases. It is submitted that the Applicant was arrested on March 15 and since then been in the custody of ED/CBI.

This Applicant wishes to appear physically.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, the Court had dismissed the bail petitions moved by K Kavitha in connection with Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Enforcement Directorate (ED) cases related to the Excise policy case.\n\nThrough plea, K Kavitha alleged that the ruling party in the Centre is using investigative agencies to publicly connect the petitioner to the Delhi Excise policy so that further coercive actions can be taken against her. The investigating agencies are well aware that there is no substance to the allegation of the petitioner's involvement in the alleged scam.\n\nThe intention behind the purported investigation against the petitioner is not to ascertain her involvement in the alleged scam, since it is painfully clear that none exists.\n\n\"The political masterminds are well aware that if the petitioner can be connected to the alleged scam, it will bring her, and by logical implication, her father, the erstwhile Chief Minister of Telangana, into disrepute. The political mileage gained from such actions can be used in the general elections scheduled for 2024. This is the sole and singular motive of the purported investigation. This is political propaganda at its shameful lowest, even by the not-so-high standards in Indian politics,\" the bail plea stated.\n\nBRS leader K Kavitha was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate on March 15, 2024 and by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on April 11, 2024.\n\nEarlier, CBI through remand application stated that \"Kavitha Kalvakuntla was required to be arrested in the instant case to conduct her custodial interrogation for confronting her with the evidence and witnesses to unearth the larger conspiracy hatched among the accused, suspect persons regarding the formulation and implementation of the Excise Policy, as well as to establish the money trail of ill-gotten money generated and to establish the role of other accused/suspect persons, including public servants, as well as to unearth the facts which are in her exclusive knowledge.\"\n\n\"The CBI inquiry was recommended based on the findings of the Delhi Chief Secretary's report filed in July showing prima facie violations of the GNCTD Act 1991, Transaction of Business Rules (ToBR)-1993, Delhi Excise Act-2009, and Delhi Excise Rules-2010,\" officials said.\n\nThe ED and the CBI had alleged that irregularities were committed while modifying the excise policy, undue favors were extended to license holders, the license fee was waived or reduced and the L-1 license was extended without the competent authority's approval.\n\nThe beneficiaries diverted \"illegal\" gains to the accused officials and made false entries in their books of account to evade detection, the probe agencies said.\n\nAs per the allegations, the Excise Department had decided to refund the earnest money deposit of about Rs 30 crore to a successful tenderer against the set rules.\n\nEven though there was no enabling provision, a waiver on tendered license fees was allowed from December 28, 2021, to January 27, 2022, due to COVID-19, the probe agency said and there was an alleged loss of Rs 144.36 crore to the exchequer.

K Kavitha is in judicial custody in two cases - corruption and money laundering - in connection with the Delhi liquor scam of the then excise policy. The cases are being investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED).\n\nThe 46-year-old K Kavitha was arrested by ED on March 15, 2024 from her home in Hyderabad's posh Banjara Hills. She has been in judicial custody ever since. K Kavitha is the daughter of former Telangana chief minister K Chandrashekar Rao.\n\nAs per Live Law, the CBI alleged that businessman Sarath Chandra Reddy participated in the liquor business in Delhi under the controversial excise policy on K Kavitha's behest. She had promised him contacts in the Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal-led Delhi government.\n\nFurther, Kavitha allegedly promised Reddy of helping him in the business, and asked him to pay Rs.25 crore at the rate of Rs.5 crore per zone in 2021 This was reportedly in exchange for the 5 retail zones allotted to him. Kavitha claimed to have paid Rs.100 crore upfront to Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) through Vijay Nair for getting preference in the excise policy.\n\nPTI reports that Kaveri Baweja, Special Judge for CBI and ED of Rouse Avenue Courts, dismissed Kavitha's bail applications in both cases, on grounds that the stage was not right to grant the relief.\n\nKavitha's lawyer Advocate Nitesh Rana opposed the police plea, saying the \"grounds were not sufficient to keep her in custody since she is no longer required for custodial interrogation\".\n\nThe CBI told the court on May 6 that K Kavitha was not required any further for custodial interrogation. The investigation agency had questioned the BRS leader in custody.\n\nKavitha was interrogated about the WhatsApp chats recovered from co-accused Buchi Babu's phone. She was also questioned about documents related to a controversial land deal, which resulted in an amount of Rs 100 crore being allegedly transferred to AAP to get the excise policy in favour of a particular liquor lobby.\n\nK Kavitha's judicial custody has been extended till May 7, 2024.

Singhvi had said that the investigation in this case has been completely biased.\n\nThe probing agency informed that Kavitha had threatened Sharath Chandra Reddy that if he fails to pay the said amount to the Aam Aadmi Party, his business in Telangana and Delhi will be harmed.\n\n\"Kavitha further told Sharath Chandra Reddy that the payments of upfront money of Rs 25 crore for wholesale business and Rs 5 crore for each retail zone were to be made to the Aam Aadmi Party for getting liquor business and the same was to be paid to her associates, Arun R Pillai and Abhishek Boinpally, who would in turn coordinate with Vijay Nair, who was a representative of (Delhi Chief Minister) Arvind Kejriwal,\" the CBI told the court.\n\nIt is pertinent to note that Reddy, who was an accused in a money-laundering case linked to the alleged liquor scam in Delhi, had turned an approver in the case that is being probed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED).", "source": {"uri": "andhrawatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Andhrawatch"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kavitha_(actress)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kavitha (actress)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Directorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Enforcement Directorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharat_Rashtra_Samithi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bharat Rashtra Samithi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liquor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaveri", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kaveri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Singhvi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Singhvi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tihar_Jail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tihar Jail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excise", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Excise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Senior counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aam_Aadmi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aam Aadmi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Money laundering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chief_ministers_of_Delhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "List of chief ministers of Delhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telangana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Telangana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Telangana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvind_Kejriwal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arvind Kejriwal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://andhrawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/K-Kavitha.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541920", "eventUri": "eng-9541920", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-15", "textStart": 411, "textEnd": 419}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-11", "textStart": 544, "textEnd": 552}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-08", "textStart": 661, "textEnd": 668}], "sentiment": -0.3568627450980392, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

Currently, Kavitha, the daughter of BRS supremo and former Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, is in judicial custody till May 7.\n\nSpecial Judge Kaveri Baweja of Rouse Avenue Court pronounced the order on her pleas.\n\nKavitha was first arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and later by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on April 11 while she was in Tihar Jail.\n\nJudge Baweja had then sent her to CBI's custody noting that a \"detailed and sustained interrogation\" of the accused is necessary.\n\nNow, she is in judicial custody in the case being probed by both the agencies. In her application, Kavitha has alleged that her arrest was politically motivated, aimed at depriving her and her party of a level playing field in the upcoming general elections.\n\nShe has asserted that her arrest by the CBI, just days before the commencement of the nomination exercise in Telangana, was orchestrated by the ruling party at the Centre to impede her election campaigning.\n\nShe has maintained that she has no connection to the Delhi excise policy and that the ruling party is using investigative agencies to tarnish her image and that of her father.\n\n\"The political masterminds are well aware that if the petitioner can be connected to the alleged scam, it will bring her, and by logical implication, her father, the erstwhile Hon'ble Chief Minister of Telangana, into disrepute,\" she has said.\n\n\"The ruling party in the Centre is using investigative agencies to publicly connect the petitioner to the Delhi excise policy so that further coercive actions can be taken against her,\" her application stated.\n\nMoreover, Kavitha has cited her medical condition, hypertension, as a reason for bail, stressing the need for medical care after her arrest by the ED.

The bench of Justice Swarna Kanta Sharma is scheduled to hear the matter on Friday. The bail petitions have been moved by Advocate Mohit Rao and Deepak Nagar representing her.\n\nKavitha through bail plea submitted that the entire ED case hinges upon statements made by the approver, witnesses or co-accused under Section 50 of the PMLA. The Prosecution Complaints do not put forth a single document that corroborates the statements. There is not a single piece of evidence that points to the guilt of the applicant.\n\nShe further stated that as the arrest of the applicant is illegal as section 19 of PMLA has not been complied with. Neither has any corroboration to the allegation of the actual cash transaction nor any money trail is forthcoming, therefore, the satisfaction of guilt as expressed in his arrest order is merely a sham and a pretence, she stated.\n\nOn May 6, the Rouse Avenue Court of Delhi dismissed the bail petitions moved by Bharatiya Rashtra Samithi (BRS) leader K Kavitha in connection with CBI and ED cases related to excise policy case.\n\nThrough plea, K Kavitha earlier alleged that the ruling party at the Centre is using investigative agencies to publicly connect the petitioner to the Delhi excise policy so that further coercive actions can be taken against her. The investigating agencies are well aware that there is no substance in the allegation of the petitioner's involvement in the alleged scam. The intention behind the purported investigation against the petitioner is not to ascertain her involvement in the alleged scam, since it is painfully clear that none exists.\n\nThe political masterminds are well aware that if the petitioner can be connected to the alleged scam, it will bring her, and by logical implication, her father, the erstwhile Chief Minister of Telangana, into disrepute. The political mileage gained from such actions can be used in the general elections scheduled for 2024. This is the sole and singular motive of the purported investigation. This is political propaganda at its shameful lowest, even by the not-so-high standards in Indian politics, stated bail plea.\n\nBRS leader K Kavitha was arrested by the ED on March 15, 2024 and by the CBI on April 11, 2024.\n\nEarlier, CBI through remand application stated that \"Kavitha Kalvakuntla was required to be arrested in the instant case to conduct her custodial interrogation for confronting her with the evidence and witnesses to unearth the larger conspiracy hatched among the accused, suspect persons regarding the formulation and implementation of the excise policy, as well as to establish the money trail of ill-gotten money generated and to establish the role of other accused/suspect persons, including public servants, as well as to unearth the facts which are in her exclusive knowledge.\"\n\nThe CBI inquiry was recommended based on the findings of the Delhi Chief Secretary's report filed in July showing prima facie violations of the GNCTD Act 1991, Transaction of Business Rules (ToBR)-1993, Delhi Excise Act-2009, and Delhi Excise Rules-2010, officials said.\n\nThe ED and the CBI had alleged that irregularities were committed while modifying the excise policy, undue favours were extended to licence holders, the licence fee was waived or reduced and the L-1 licence was extended without the competent authority's approval.\n\nThe beneficiaries diverted \"illegal\" gains to the accused officials and made false entries in their books of account to evade detection, the probe agencies said. As per the allegations, the excise department had decided to refund the earnest money deposit of about Rs 30 crore to a successful tenderer against the set rules.\n\nEven though there was no enabling provision, a waiver on tendered licence fees was allowed from December 28, 2021, to January 27, 2022, due to COVID-19, the probe agency said and there was an alleged loss of Rs 144.36 crore to the exchequer.

It observed that Kavitha \"prima facie appears as that of key conspirator\" who had sought \"favourable provisions in the Delhi Excise Policy 2021-22\".\n\nThe court, in both the orders, rejected the counsel's argument that the case against Kavitha was based only on the statements of approvers, co-accused and associates/relatives, who were unworthy of reliance. It said that this could not be a ground for granting bail at this stage.\n\nThe court agreed with the submissions of both the agencies that in the present case, public interest should take precedence over personal liberty as the gravity of the alleged offences were economic that tended to affect the economic system of the country.\n\nOn the CBI case, the court said that it found no merit in the arguments of the counsel that Kavitha was arrested to deny her and BRS a \"level playing field\" in the elections.\n\nFurther, the ground that the accused is a \"star campaigner\" of her party \"cannot be a valid ground for bail,\" it said.\n\nThe court said that there was a likelihood that Kavitha may influence witnesses and potential witnesses as she had been confronted with sensitive documents and statement during her investigation and was aware of the evidence collected by the CBI.\n\nThe court also noted that CBI had expressed an apprehension that she may threaten witnesses, keeping in mind the fact that she had threatened Sharath Chandra Reddy, when he showed reluctance to pay the demanded money. This was revealed during investigation, CBI said.\n\nThe court also said that it did not \"subscribe\" to the argument that Kavitha should get bail on the basis of parity as a co-accused. The court said her role could not be equated with other co-accused.\n\nThe court, while rejecting the bail in the ED case, said that there appeared to be prima facie a case indicating Kavitha's involvement in the alleged offences.\n\nThe court noted that Kavitha was in discussion with Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and former deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on the excise policy through Vijay Nair, who proposed that if she paid Rs100 crore to them, the excise policy would be changed for her benefit.\n\nThe court said that she was also not entitled to the relief under the first proviso to Section 45 of the PML Act, 2002, which states that a person, who is under the age of sixteen years or is a woman or is sick or infirm (or is accused either on his own or along with other co-accused of money laundering a sum of less than Rs 1 crore) may be released on bail, if the court so directs.\n\nThe court also refused her bail on medical grounds stating that the documents relied upon were old medical records from 2013 onwards and her complaints have apparently been addressed.", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of

denies bail to BRS leader K Kavitha in excise policy case", "body": "Special judge Kaveri Baweja dismissed the two bail applications moved by the 46-year-old MLC from Nizamabad.\n\nShe had filed the bail application in the ED case on March 23 and in the CBI case on April 15.\n\nKavitha had approached the court seeking relief on the grounds that all the rules and principles of natural justice were violated when she was arrested by the CBI.\n\nIt was also pointed out that when ED had arrested her, it was after sunset and no transit remand was taken to produce her before the Delhi Rouse Avenue court despite arresting her from her Hyderabad residence.\n\nIt was argued on behalf of her that initially, CBI was issuing summons to her under section 160 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) in the capacity of a witness.\n\nHowever, in February 2024, she was served a notice under section 41A CrPC, as a suspect in the case.\n\nKavitha's counsels had further averred that she was apprehended by the agency based on the statements made by the other co-accused in the matter which were recorded months before she was arrested, pointing out that there was no necessity to arrest her as the agency had procured evidence earlier, but she was arrested now.\n\nIt was further pointed out that she is a star campaigner for her party in the upcoming Lok Sabha polls in Telangana and if bail is not granted, she will be devoid of her right.\n\nCBI had opposed the plea stating that she was arrested after following the due process of law.\n\nIt was claimed by the agency that they had gone and interrogated her while she was in judicial custody with the permission of the court and then arrested her, which was also done after taking permission.\n\nAlso Read: K Chandrashekar Rao denies daughter K Kavitha's role in Delhi excise policy case, calls it 'scam created by Modi'\n\nED, on the other hand, stated that she was arrested from Hyderabad at 5:20pm and the sunset took place at 6:26pm at the exact latitude and longitude, at the place where she was arrested pointing out to the fact that she was arrested before sunset.\n\nThey also stated that ED being a central agency is not bound by territorial jurisdiction unlike the state police, and no transit remand was required as Kavitha was produced before the court within the stipulated time of 24 hours of her arrest.\n\nThe agencies had also said that she is one of the key conspirators and does not satisfy the triple test for the grant of bail further highlighting that she was actively involved in destruction of mobile phone and influencing the witnesses.\n\nSpecial judge Baweja had earlier on April 8 dismissed an interim bail application moved by her citing her minor son's examination while noting that the materials placed on record show her \"active involvement\" in the offence and that she was involved in destruction of evidence and influencing the witnesses.\n\nThe daughter of Telangana's former chief minister, K Chandrashekhar Rao, was arrested by the CBI on April 11, while she was lodged in Tihar Jail under judicial custody in the parallel case registered by the ED.\n\nShe was initially apprehended by ED on March 15 in the money laundering case and was sent to judicial custody on March 26.\n\nThe agencies have alleged that Kavitha is one of the key persons involved in arranging and providing kickbacks of approximately \u20b9100 crore to the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) to get favourable provisions added to the now scrapped policy.\n\nThe CBI had earlier on April 6 interrogated Kavitha in Tihar jail after obtaining permission from the court.\n\nHowever, according to CBI, she did not give satisfactory replies to their questions and gave evasive answers despite being confronted with the evidence.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Directorate",

Accordingly, the application under consideration is dismissed,'' the judge said.\n\nKavitha is in judicial custody in both the cases lodged by the ED and the CBI.\n\nThe ED arrested Kavitha (46) from her Banjara Hills residence in Hyderabad on March 15, and she was in judicial custody in the case.\n\nThe CBI arrested the Bharatiya Rashtra Samithi (BRS) leader from judicial custody.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kavitha_(actress)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kavitha (actress)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excise", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Excise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Money laundering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Directorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Enforcement Directorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Public interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_conspiracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal conspiracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaveri", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kaveri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prima_facie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prima facie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharat_Rashtra_Samithi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bharat Rashtra Samithi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aam_Aadmi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aam Aadmi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detention_(imprisonment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detention (imprisonment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banjara_Hills", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Banjara Hills"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Banjara Hills"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/03_03_2020_19_08_19_05616.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541920", "eventUri": "eng-9541920", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-15", "textStart": 3347, "textEnd": 3355}], "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Kavitha was produced in the Rouse Avenue Court after her judicial custody ended on Tuesday. The Enforcement Directorate officials informed the Court that they would be filing a chargesheet on Kavitha in the Delhi Liquor Policy case in a week's time.\n\nThe trial court judge, Justice Kaveri Baweja, who heard the arguments, extended the judicial custody until May 20. Advocate Nitish Rana, who is arguing on behalf of Kavitha, urged the court to provide ten books to Kavitha. The advocate also requested that the court allow Kavitha to meet her family members in court for about 15 minutes and let her eat the food brought by him. The advocate alleged that Kavitha was provided stale food after the check by 10 to 15 security staff in the jail. He urged the court to allow food after checks by the doctor and the jail official.\n\nThe judge questioned why the attorney was seeking authorisation when it had already been stated that home meals would not be supplied. The judge stated that the court will consider the request for home food after consulting with the jail's superintendent.\n\nLater, talking to the media, Kavitha said, \"People like Prajwal Revanna were let off and arrested leaders like me. This is an injustice. Everyone should take note of this.\"\n\nMeanwhile, BRS MLC K Kavitha will be filing a bail petition in the Delhi High Court on Wednesday, challenging the trial court's decision.

through \"hawala\" channels to be spent on the AAP's campaign in Goa ahead of the Assembly elections there in 2022.\n\nThe CBI and ED have made multiple arrests in this case in the last two years including Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, AAP's RS MP leader Sanjay Singh, communications head Vijay Nair, and Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) leader K Kavitha.\n\nMr. Kejriwal and Ms. Kavitha are

Even in her bail application, she argued that the case had political overtones and brought disrepute to her father and the BRS party before the Parliament elections.\n\nShe also cited hypertension and medication for the bail apart from her son's examinations and his need for the mother to be by his side.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharat_Rashtra_Samithi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharat Rashtra Samithi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Directorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Enforcement Directorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaveri", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kaveri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._Kavitha", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "K.

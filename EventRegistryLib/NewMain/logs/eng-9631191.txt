He was only 21 and he said: 'Not today.' He picked up the grenade and swiftly threw it back,\" Trudeau said.\n\nBut he said that William Cameron, a 100-year-old Canadian veteran, died just before he was to return to France.\n\nHis daughter described \"just how much he had been looking forward to being here,\" Trudeau said.\n\n\"His bags have been packed for weeks. And he was so proud to be coming back to Normandy,\" he added.\n\nAnother US veteran, 102-year-old Robert Persichitti, died last week while sailing down to Normandy for the commemorations.\n\nbur-ah/sjw/ach", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@reformer.com", "name": "Agence

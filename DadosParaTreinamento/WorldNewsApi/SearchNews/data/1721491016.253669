The tattoo is a simple line drawing of a naked man and women cuddling. The woman is holding the man to her chest. The photo was shared by Los Angeles-based tattooist Kane Navasard, who tagged the artist and let fans know how they can get one just like Shawn's. 'A fun piece for @shawnmendes. Original artwork by the talented @comoeloro. For tattoo appointments, visit WWW.KANENAVASARD.COM.' Fans of the Se\u00f1orita singer \u2013 who stepped out for smoothies recently with his chiropractor \u2013 immediately wanted to know who the inspiration for the tattoo was, with some volunteering to reenact it with him. 'Who's that lucky lady tho,' one eager fan asked, while another wrote, 'but what does it represent? What's the backstory?' One fan had an idea of who the lady in the tattoo is: 'probably someone special cause I don\u2019t think shawn would just randomly get those tattoos cause it looks cute yk what i mean!' Meanwhile someone else pointed out that the tat is art by a Puerto Rican artist Shawn recently started following. The fan noted Mendes has a new album coming out and that's usually when he adds new ink to his body. 'I hope this isn\u2019t Shawn and a specific girl cause that beats getting someone\u2019s name tattooed on yourself for stupidest tattoo,' wrote another fan. Mendes has gotten more than a dozen tattoos since he debuted the thin red line down the back of his neck on social media in April 2021. Mendes had Good Boy tattooed below his elbow, believed to be a tribute to his dog Tarzan and Fe on his bicep, which is the Portuguese word for 'faith (as well as the symbol for iron), in May 2021. He also has 'little sunflower' tattooed on his torso, believed to be in honor of his ex-girlfriend Camila Cabello and Aaliyah Maria, his sister's name, on his collarbone. The Canadian musician's first tattoo is also his most complicated and meaningful. He had it done in August 2016. He explained that the tree-filled guitar on the inside of his arm represents the skyline of his native Toronto through the neck of the instrument, during an interview on Today. The body of the instrument is a sound wave of his parents and sister saying 'I love you' interwoven with trees and their reflection in water. He also has an elephant, a sparrow, the number 8 \u2013 which he admitted to W he got with his then-girlfriend Hailey Baldwin Bieber \u2013 a meditating figure, and the letter A. Finally, after a fan Photoshopped a butterfly with one wing filled with flowers on a photo of Shawn, he took it to a tattooist and had it put on his arm.", "summary": "Shawn Mendes added to his tattoo collection recently and its raising some eyebrows among his fans.

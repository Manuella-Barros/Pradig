Joyce will also take part in a public outreach initiative with the organization.\n\n\"I sincerely apologize to the fans, the Oakland A's, MLB and most importantly the LGBTQ community for my comments and actions,\" Joyce's statement said. \"A fan yelled vulgar and obscene words about me and my family and I let my frustrations and emotions get the better of me.\n\n\"I am beyond sorry for the inappropriate language that I used and understand and agree that those words should NEVER come out of someone's mouth no matter the situation. Anyone who knows me will tell you that it is not reflective of me as a person, how I treat others, how I live my life and that those hurtful words are not my views. I fully support and hope to help the LGBTQ community with their efforts in being treated fairly. I intend to let my actions speak louder than anything more that can be said about this truly regrettable moment.\"\n\nThe exchange occurred in the eighth inning after Angels first baseman C.J. Cron made a diving stop of Joyce's hard-hit grounder.\n\nAs Joyce returned to the dugout, he uttered several profanities at the fan, called him a gay slur and challenged him to fight, according to Associated Press photographer Mark J.

We pride ourselves on being inclusive and expect our entire organization to live up to higher standards. We appreciate that Matt is contrite about his conduct and know he will learn from this incident.\"\n\nJoyce, 33, is in his first season with Oakland, his 10th in the majors overall and played with the Angels for one season in 2015.\n\nAfter the game, Joyce also acknowledged he shouldn't have reacted.\n\n\"It's just one of those things that fans kind of get into the game.

The exchange and alleged slur were overheard by Associated Press photographer Mark J. Terrill, who according to their report did not hear how it began or what was said by the fan involved.\n\n[Now's the time to sign up for Fantasy Football! Join for free]\n\nJoyce acknowledged the exchange following the game and never denied using a gay slur. Instead he expressed regret in letting his frustration get the best of him.\n\nHere's more from the Associated Press report, including Joyce's postgame comments:\n\nAs Joyce returned to the dugout, he uttered several profanities at the fan, called him a gay slur and challenged him to fight, according to Associated Press photographer Mark J. Terrill, who overheard the exchange. Terrill said he did not hear the first part of the exchange.\n\n\"It's just one of those things that fans kind of get into the game.

For me it just wasn't the right time to say some stuff like that. I fired back and obviously as soon as you fire back you regret saying anything, because it's just not worth it.\"\n\nThe A's and Major League Baseball have yet to comment on the incident. Punishment could be handed out in short order if either confirms Joyce used a gay slur or he comes forward himself and admits as much.\n\nEarlier this season the Blue Jays suspended Kevin Pillar two games for directing a gay slur toward Braves pitcher Jason Motte.

Joyce said he is \"beyond sorry,\" and the Athletics also made a statement insisting his language was unacceptable and wouldn't be tolerated.\n\nThe A's are donating more than $54,000 of Joyce's lost salary to PFLAG.\n\n\"In regard to last night's incident, I sincerely apologize to the fans, the Oakland A's, MLB and most importantly the LGBTQ community for my comments and actions,\" Joyce's statement said. \"A fan yelled vulgar and obscene words about me and my family and I let my frustrations and emotions get the better of me.\n\n\"I am beyond sorry for the inappropriate language that I used and understand and agree that those words should NEVER come out of someone's mouth no matter the situation. Anyone who knows me will tell you that it is not reflective of me as a person, how I treat others, how I live my life and that those hurtful words are not my views. I fully support and hope to help the LGBTQ community with their efforts in being treated fairly. I intend to let my actions speak louder than anything more that can be said about this truly regrettable moment.\"\n\nThe exchange occurred in the eighth inning of Los Angeles' 8-6 win after Angels first baseman C.J. Cron made a diving stop of Joyce's hard-hit grounder.\n\nAs Joyce returned to the dugout, he uttered several profanities at the fan, called him a gay slur and challenged him to fight, according to Associated Press photographer Mark J. Terrill, who overheard the exchange. Terrill said he didn't hear the first part of the exchange.\n\n\"The Oakland Athletics are very disappointed by the comments Matt Joyce made to a fan during the eighth inning of last night's game,\" the A's statement said. \"This language is unacceptable and will not be tolerated by our team. We pride ourselves on being inclusive and expect our entire organization to live up to higher standards. We appreciate that Matt is contrite about his conduct and know he will learn from this incident.\"\n\nAround baseball, any discriminatory behavior is being taken extremely seriously - and MLB has been firm about its stance.\n\nThe Boston Red Sox in May permanently banned a male fan they said used a racial slur, a separate confrontation from insults directed at Baltimore Orioles outfielder Adam Jones one night before. In June, the New York Mets fired their recognizable \"Mr. Met\" mascot - with the oversized costumed head with baseball seams - for flipping off a fan.\n\nJoyce, 33, is in his first season with Oakland, his 10th in the majors overall and played with the Angels for one season in 2015.\n\nJoyce was batting .227 with 14 home runs, 43 RBIs and 74 strikeouts in 98 games for the last-place A's.\n\nAfter the game, Joyce also acknowledged he shouldn't have reacted.\n\n\"It's just one of those things that fans kind of get into the game. Obviously, we're pretty frustrated on our side and I had just hit a ball hard and had Cron make a good play,\" Joyce said. \"I was walking back to the dugout and just had a fan yell some vulgar and obscene words.\n\n\"For me it just wasn't the right time to say some stuff like that. I fired back and obviously as soon as you fire back you regret saying anything, because it's just not worth it.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

The NHL and NBA have also disciplined players in recent years for use of homophobic slurs, and a whole goddamn arena of soccer fans chanted a homophobic slur in unison (albeit in Spanish) at an MLS game in Atlanta in March. It's a reminder that, for all the celebrating that happens when a current or former athlete publicly comes out, the world of American professional sports is still not a particularly friendly place for homosexual athletes.", "eventUri": "eng-3339294", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-05", "title": "Oakland's Matt Joyce Allegedly Uses Homophobic Slur In Exchange With Fan", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-05", "id": "15569857", "extractedDates": null, "storyUri": "eng-3339294", "time": "15:47:00", "details": {}, "concepts": [{"score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta"}, "id": "182635", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Atlanta"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "label": {"eng": "Association football"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302552"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303571"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303573"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}, "type": "org", "id": "304131"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay", "label": {"eng": "Gay"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "304544"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}, "type": "org", "id": "304754"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305018"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305788"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays", "label": {"eng": "Toronto Blue Jays"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305796"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophobia", "label": {"eng": "Homophobia"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "306872"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_sports", "label": {"eng": "Professional sports"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "308072"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity", "label": {"eng": "Profanity"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "309393"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}, "type": "org", "id": "310551"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Athletics", "label": {"eng": "Oakland Athletics"}, "type": "org", "id": "312735"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "315689"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}, "type": "org", "id": "315690"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pejorative", "label": {"eng": "Pejorative"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "316596"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obscenity", "label": {"eng": "Obscenity"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "321180"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faggot_(slang)", "label": {"eng": "Faggot (slang)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "321209"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dugout_(baseball)", "label": {"eng": "Dugout (baseball)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "331803"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Motte", "label": {"eng": "Jason Motte"}, "type": "person", "id": "386942"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays_minor_league_players#Kevin_Pillar", "label": {"eng": "Kevin Pillar"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "396584"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Joyce_(baseball)", "label": {"eng": "Matt Joyce (baseball)"}, "type": "person", "id": "522852"}], "url": "http://deadspin.com/oaklands-matt-joyce-allegedly-uses-homophobic-slur-in-e-1797562083", "timeCrawl": "15:47:00", "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--fx_ZHvfH--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/dlkykedi1vn5mjtbpwui.jpg", "location": null, "dateTime": "2017-08-05T15:47:00Z", "originalArticle": null, "sim": 0.8039215803146362}

Joyce told the Associated Press that the fan had used vulgarities at him. \"I fired back and obviously as soon as you fire back, you regret saying anything, because it's just not worth it,\" Joyce said.\n\nJoyce responded to a text from The Chronicle this morning by saying he will speak to reporters at Angel Stadium later today.\n\nThe A's have punished minor-leaguers severely for using homophobic slurs, suspending pitcher Ian Krol for the end of the 2011 season for a social-media post that included a slur and releasing a minor-leaguer this spring for a similar infraction. At the major-league level, however, the commissioner's office handles all disciplinary action.\n\nToronto's Kevin Pillar was suspended for two games earlier this season for using an anti-gar slur against an opposing pitcher and former Toronto infielder Yunel Escobar, now with the Angels, was suspended for three games for a homophobic slur etched into his eye black; Joyce is likely to draw a similar penalty of two or three games unless Major League Baseball uncovers any additional issues.\n\nJoyce played for the Angels in 2015 and performed so poorly that he was sent to the minors; he is often the target of verbal abuse at Angel Stadium. Outfielders are particularly prone to profane heckling; A's left fielder Khris Davis has discussed the racist comments he hears on a regular basis while play in the outfield.", "eventUri": "eng-3339294", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-05", "title": "MLB reviewing anti-gay slur used by A's outfielder", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-05", "id": "15591193", "extractedDates": null, "storyUri": "eng-3339294", "time": "19:05:00", "details": {}, "concepts": [{"score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anaheim, California"}, "id": "226711", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Anaheim, California"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaheim,_California", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oakland, California"}, "id": "228719", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Oakland, California"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland,_California", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "id": "241442", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303564"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303571"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303573"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay", "label": {"eng": "Gay"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "304544"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}, "type": "org", "id": "304754"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophobia", "label": {"eng": "Homophobia"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "306872"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Athletics", "label": {"eng": "Oakland Athletics"}, "type": "org", "id": "312735"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faggot_(slang)", "label": {"eng": "Faggot (slang)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "321209"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "334404"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "334720"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadoff_hitter", "label": {"eng": "Leadoff hitter"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "360827"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Stadium_of_Anaheim", "label": {"eng": "Angel Stadium"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "385282"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commissioner_of_Baseball", "label": {"eng": "Commissioner of Baseball"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "386682"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays_minor_league_players#Kevin_Pillar", "label": {"eng": "Kevin Pillar"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "396584"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yunel_Escobar", "label": {"eng": "Yunel Escobar"}, "type": "person", "id": "427336"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Silver_Slugger_Award_winners_at_outfield", "label": {"eng": "List of Silver Slugger Award winners at outfield"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "516969"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Joyce_(baseball)", "label": {"eng": "Matt Joyce (baseball)"}, "type": "person", "id": "522852"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Krol", "label": {"eng": "Ian Krol"}, "type": "person", "id": "553399"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_black", "label": {"eng": "Eye black"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "714766"}], "url": "http://www.sfgate.com/athletics/article/MLB-reviewing-anti-gay-slur-used-by-A-s-11736580.php", "timeCrawl": "19:05:00", "image": "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/64/02/70/13643306/5/rawImage.jpg", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Anaheim, California"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "dateTime": "2017-08-05T19:05:00Z", "originalArticle": null, "sim": 0.5333333611488342}

We pride ourselves on being inclusive and expect our entire organization to live up to higher standards. We appreciate that Matt is contrite about his conduct and know he will learn from this incident.\"\n\nAround baseball, any discriminatory behavior is being taken extremely seriously - and MLB has been firm about its stance.\n\nThe Boston Red Sox in May permanently banned a male fan they said used a racial slur, a separate confrontation from insults directed at Baltimore Orioles outfielder Adam Jones one night before. In June, the New York Mets fired their recognizable \"Mr. Met\" mascot - with the oversized costumed head with baseball seams - for flipping off a fan.\n\nJoyce, 33, is in his first season with Oakland, his 10th in the majors overall and played with the Angels for one season in 2015.\n\nJoyce was batting .227 with 14 home runs, 43 RBIs and 74 strikeouts in 98 games for the last-place A's.\n\nAfter the game, Joyce also acknowledged he shouldn't have reacted.\n\n\"It's just one of those things that fans kind of get into the game. Obviously, we're pretty frustrated on our side and I had just hit a ball hard and had Cron make a good play,\" Joyce said. \"I was walking back to the dugout and just had a fan yell some vulgar and obscene words.\n\n\"For me it just wasn't the right time to say some stuff like that.

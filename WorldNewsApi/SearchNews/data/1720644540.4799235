After delighting Swifties across the world over with the show, which has been on the road since March 2023, the Blank Space icon is finally set to take to the stage in Scotland, a place she's admitted previously to the Record that holds a \"special place\" in her heart. Taylor, who previously dated Scots DJ Calvin Harris, opened up on her heritage during her 2015 gig at the Glasgow Hydro where she revealed she had links to William the Lion. Speaking to the Daily Record last year, she spoke of her connections to Scotland through both of her parents, dad Scott, 71, and mum Andrea, 65. Taylor said: \u201cScotland is a really special place for me \u2013 last time I was there the crowd were amazing and I felt like we really connected. \"My dad is super proud of our Scottish heritage he told me that pretty much most of our family can be traced back to Scotland so of course it\u2019s obviously very cool for me to get to perform there as part of the tour.\u201d Taylor is currently loved up with Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce and the A-list pair were pictured together a few months back enjoying down time together at Coachella as the pop superstar took a much needed break from touring. The couple also escaped for a sunshine break out of the spotlight in the Bahamas ahead of Taylor\u2019s European leg of her tour. But it's unknown whether Scots fans can expect the sports star at the Edinburgh gigs... though it seems next time she\u2019s planning to get away from the stress of gig life, she might even consider a trip to Scotland. She added: \u201cI would love to have a vacation in a castle for a couple of nights. It might even be the perfect way to end my tour next year.\u201d Taylor's Scottish roots came to light when she was performing for her Scots fans in 2015 and revealed she'd had an email from her dad, who is also her manager, before she'd got on the stage, and he'd told her of her heritage. The Swift family line had been connected to William the Lion, King of Scotland, by ancestry website famousskin.com, which claimed the Scottish monarch is her 26th great-grandfather. But despite her close connections to all things tartan, she's not giving anything away about donning a kilt when she arrives in the country for her run of shows, as she said: \"I have always loved a kilt \u2013 as for wearing one when I am in Scotland you will just have to wait and see.\u201d The Never Grow Up singer is playing 15 shows across the UK in Scotland, England and Wales in June and August. She will perform in Edinburgh Murrayfield at the start of the UK-leg on June, 7, 8 and 9. Get the latest celebrity gossip and telly news sent straight to your inbox.

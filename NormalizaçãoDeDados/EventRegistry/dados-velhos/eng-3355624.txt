A federal judge on Friday ordered Baylor University to turn over information -including interview recordings and documents - it provided to a law firm it hired amid a sexual assault scandal that rocked the nation's largest Baptist school.\n\nBaylor had sought to block the release of information it provided to the Philadelphia-based law firm Pepper Hamilton, which was hired to investigate how the university handled sexual assault cases. Baylor claimed the information it provided the law firm was protected under attorney-client privilege.\n\nBut U.S. District Judge Robert Pitman in Austin ordered the materials released to attorneys representing a group of 10 women suing Baylor. He did so because the university had waived its protections under attorney-client privilege when it released a detailed summary of the law firm's investigation and when it quoted text messages and conversations by university personnel about sexual assault reports in court filings.\n\n\"'Would it be fair to allow Baylor to protect remaining undisclosed details regarding the Pepper Hamilton investigation when it intentionally, publicly, and selectively released certain details of the investigation, including attorney-client communications? The Court concludes, with respect to materials covered by the attorney-client privilege, that it would not,\" Pitman said.\n\nBaylor faces federal lawsuits from more than a dozen women who contend school officials ignored or suppressed assault claims and fostered a rape culture within the football program. The lawsuits allege officials mishandled or ignored sex assault allegations for years. The school is also facing several federal civil rights investigations and a state criminal investigation.\n\nJim Dunnam, one of the attorneys for the women, identified as \"Jane Doe,\" called the judge's ruling \"a very big step\" in allowing his clients to show that this was not isolated to only the football program.\n\n\"Our position all along has been it's been an institutional culture at the top of the university to suppress this type of reporting of claims to basically deny that it occurs on campus,\" Dunnam said.\n\nPitman did deny a request by the women's attorneys to force Baylor to release any notes, emails and other documents that were prepared by the law firm as part of its investigation and considered work-product that could reveal legal strategy. The university will be required to produce a detailed log of certain work product and to identify witnesses who were interviewed.\n\n\"Baylor recognizes this is a complex order, and the university appreciates the court's ruling that attorney work product privileges continue to apply in this case,\" the university said in a statement. \"Baylor continues to express concerns regarding the protection of students' personal records, specifically the desire of many students - who are unrelated to this case - that their identities remain anonymous and their information confidential.\"\n\nBaylor has said in court filings that the law firm had reviewed some 26.5 terabytes of information from 52 laptops and 62 mobile devices.\n\nIt is unclear if all of this information will be turned over to the women's attorneys or when they will be given access to it.\n\nDue to previous protective orders issued by Pitman regarding the protection of sensitive information, it's unclear if any of this information will ultimately be made public, said Chad Dunn, another of the attorneys for the women. The trial in their case has been set for October 2018.\n\nIn its report last year, the law firm concluded the football program acted as if it was \"above the rules\" as coaches and staff had improper contact with complainants, and interfered or impeded school and potentially criminal investigations.\n\nAfter Pepper Hamilton's report, Baylor fired football coach Art Briles in May 2016 and demoted then-university President Ken Starr, who later resigned.\n\nBriles has insisted he didn't cover up sexual violence by his players or try to obstruct any investigations.\n\n___\n\nFollow Juan A.

He said the judge's ruling compels Baylor to turn over the \"information and the data\" that the school gave Philadelphia law firm Pepper Hamilton, which was hired in 2015 to examine the school's response to sexual violence. \"Now we can hopefully determine specifics about who did what and the specific failures.\"\n\nThe university is facing four other Title IX lawsuits, and disclosure of materials used in the Pepper Hamilton investigation is at issue in some of them.\n\nIn his 21-page order, U.S. District Court Judge Robert Pitman wrote that communications between Baylor and Pepper Hamilton were subject to attorney-client privilege. Such a determination would typically make them off-limits for release. However, Pitman also wrote that Baylor waived that privilege when it publicly released select details of the investigation, which it did in May 2016 when it issued a summary known as its \"Findings of Fact,\" and in February 2017 in a regents' response to a defamation lawsuit that included specific text messages and details of interviews.\n\n\"Would it be fair to allow Baylor to protect remaining undisclosed details regarding the Pepper Hamilton investigation when it intentionally, publicly, and selectively released certain details of the investigation, including attorney-client communications?\" Pitman wrote. \"The Court concludes, with respect to materials covered by the attorney-client privilege, that it would not.\"\n\nThe judge, however, made some specific exemptions. Because the school's Findings of Fact, which broadly outlined the failures of the university and football program, did not include names or specific data sources, he wrote that the school, \"need not reveal which documents and interviews formed the bases for those documents.\" He also wrote that recordings of interviews conducted by Pepper Hamilton and interview notes \"need not be produced.\"\n\nOn Friday, Baylor issued a statement in response to the ruling: \"Baylor recognizes this is a complex order, and the university appreciates the court's ruling that attorney work product privileges continue to apply in this case. All of the work product and related materials prepared by Pepper Hamilton is currently protected from discovery, with the provision of the university being required to produce a detailed log of certain work product and to identify witnesses who were interviewed.\" The statement also noted that, \"Baylor continues to express concerns regarding the protection of students' personal records, specifically the desire of many students - who are unrelated to this case - that their identities remain anonymous and their information confidential.\"\n\nOutside the courtroom, there has been a great deal of pressure on Baylor from alumni, donors, fans and others to release more details of the school's investigation, including from people who are critical of what they have described as an over emphasis on alleged sexual and physical assaults involving football players. Of the 10 women in the lawsuit at issue Friday, one claims she was assaulted by a football player.\n\n\"We've said all along this is not just some football rogue issue,\" Dunnam said. \"This is an issue that permeated the entire university and a problem that was in the entire Baylor culture at the top. Baylor has tried to misdirect attention to say this was only a football program that was solved by the firing of a coach.\"\n\nIn addition to firing Briles in May 2016, Baylor demoted president Ken Starr and suspended athletic director Ian McCaw, both of whom would leave the university soon after. It also removed two other athletic department employees, including former football director of operations Colin Shillinglaw. In response to a defamation lawsuit that Shillinglaw filed, but later withdrew earlier this year, three Baylor regents cited several examples of materials given to Pepper Hamilton and defended their decisions.\n\n\"Contrary to some people's belief, Briles was not a 'scapegoat' for the university's larger problems - he was part of the larger problem. So was Shillinglaw. Coach Briles admitted that he was operating an internal disciplinary system outside Baylor's policies that left their team unaccountable under university procedures,\" according to the filing in the defamation case. \"Baylor had no choice but to change leadership - including parting ways with its prized football coach. There is no question that the regents, after a long self-imposed silence, had to respond with truthful statements to correct the record in an attempt to end the widespread misinformation.\"", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2016-05-", "textEnd": 1448, "textStart": 1440, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "2017-02-", "textEnd": 1527, "textStart": 1514}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355624", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T19:11:00Z", "sim": 0.8588235378265381, "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "title": "ESPN.com", "id": "4"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "19:11:00", "url": "http://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/20314943", "storyUri": "eng-3355624", "id": "8685814", "image": "http://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2016%2F0129%2Fr49150_933x525_16%2D9.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "19:11:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

The Court concludes, with respect to materials covered by the attorney-client privilege, that it would not,\" Pitman said.\n\nBaylor faces federal lawsuits from more than a dozen women who contend school officials ignored or suppressed assault claims and fostered a rape culture within the football program. The lawsuits allege officials mishandled or ignored sex assault allegations for years. The school is also facing several federal civil rights investigations and a state criminal investigation.\n\nJim Dunnam, one of the attorneys for the women, identified as \"Jane Doe,\" called the judge's ruling \"a very big step\" in allowing his clients to show that this was not isolated to only the football program.\n\n\"Our position all along has been it's been an institutional culture at the top of the university to suppress this type of reporting of claims to basically deny that it occurs on campus,\" Dunnam said.\n\nPitman did deny a request by the women's attorneys to force Baylor to release any notes, emails and other documents that were prepared by the law firm as part of its investigation and considered work-product that could reveal legal strategy. The university will be required to produce a detailed log of certain work product and to identify witnesses who were interviewed.\n\n\"Baylor recognizes this is a complex order, and the university appreciates the court's ruling that attorney work product privileges continue to apply in this case,\" the university said in a statement. \"Baylor continues to express concerns regarding the protection of students' personal records, specifically the desire of many students - who are unrelated to this case - that their identities remain anonymous and their information confidential.\"\n\nBaylor has said in court filings that the law firm had reviewed some 26.5 terabytes of information from 52 laptops and 62 mobile devices.\n\nIt is unclear if all of this information will be turned over to the women's attorneys or when they will be given access to it.\n\nDue to previous protective orders issued by Pitman regarding the protection of sensitive information, it's unclear if any of this information will ultimately be made public, said Chad Dunn, another of the attorneys for the women. The trial in their case has been set for October 2018.\n\nIn its report last year, the law firm concluded the football program acted as if it was \"above the rules\" as coaches and staff had improper contact with complainants, and interfered or impeded school and potentially criminal investigations.\n\nAfter Pepper Hamilton's report, Baylor fired football coach Art Briles in May 2016 and demoted then-university President Ken Starr, who later resigned.\n\nBriles has insisted he didn't cover up sexual violence by his players or try to obstruct any investigations.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-10-", "textEnd": 3520, "textStart": 3508}, {"amb": false, "date": "2016-05-", "textEnd": 3847, "textStart": 3839}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355624", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T22:06:00Z", "sim": 0.8588235378265381, "source": {"uri": "sfgate.com", "title": "San Francisco Gate", "id": "530"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "22:06:00", "url": "http://www.sfgate.com/news/texas/article/Baylor-ordered-to-turn-over-documents-in-sex-11751498.php", "storyUri": "eng-3355624", "id": "8709692", "image": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "22:06:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

Jim Dunnam, who is representing multiple anonymous women who say there were raped while at Baylor. The university had claimed that the documents were privileged, since the firm Pepper Hamilton that was conducting the investigation was doing legal work for the private Baptist school. But the judge ruled that Baylor waived that privilege when it released certain details from the investigation.\n\nIt's not immediately clear whether the documents will ever be fully public. District Judge Robert Pitman said information produced as a result of his order \"shall be subject to protective orders already entered in this case when applicable.\" Certain logs produced, he wrote, will be considered \"classified.\"\n\nBut this means that they could come up in a trial if the two sides in the lawsuit chose not to settle. Baylor has vigorously fought to keep the documents privileged in past court filings.\n\nIn a statement, Baylor officials called it \"a complex order\" and noted that some significant information is still protected from release. Baylor must turn over things like phone records, interview lists and other documents that it provided Pepper Hamilton for its investigation. But some correspondence between the firm and the university can still be held back. Those are communications known as \"work product,\" which include investigators' notes and presentations prepared for Baylor that might include some analysis about legal liabilities.\n\nBaylor must provide a log of those documents that would allow the plaintiffs to argue that some are exempt from privilege.\n\n\"Baylor continues to express concerns regarding the protection of students' personal records, specifically the desire of many students -- who are unrelated to this case -- that their identities remain anonymous and their information confidential,\" the school said in its statement.\n\nBaylor hired Pepper Hamilton in 2015 after the trial of former football player Sam Ukwuachu, who was accused of raping another student. After Pepper Hamilton's investigation was complete, Baylor released a 13-page document listing the findings, plus a list of recommendations for how to improve its processes. That release, the judge ruled, waived Baylor's attorney-client privilege.\n\nBaylor must turn over documents that it provided Pepper Hamilton for its investigation. But some correspondence between the firm and the university can still be held back. Those are mostly communications in which some kind of analysis or advice was provided.\n\nUpon the release of the Pepper Hamilton findings of fact, Baylor fired its head football coach, Art Briles, and reassigned its president, Ken Starr, who later left the school entirely. Regents later reported that 19 football players had been involved in sexual violence since 2011. A legal filing in a separate lawsuit alleges that the number is even higher.\n\nThe school remains under investigation by the Big 12 Conference, the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights and the Texas Rangers. The school has hired a new football coach, athletic director and president since the scandal broke.

Henderson attended Saturday's funeral for a man the public knows as a former big league player, who was the 1979 American League MVP, and a former big league manager, who won the National League Manager of the Year Award in 1995.\n\nFor Henderson, like so many others, Baylor was an inspiration. The man, better known in the NFL as \"Hollywood,\" explained as part of an open microphone session during Baylor's funeral at the Greater Mount Zion Baptist Church.\n\nHenderson is 4 years younger than Baylor, and grew up across town from Baylor, who was born and raised in Austin's Clarksville District, the oldest surviving freedomtown, the communities in which emancipated slaves settled. But Baylor was no stranger.\n\n\"He had a mystique about him,\" Henderson said. \"He was one of the people I looked up to growing up. I was [in junior college in Oklahoma] when he got to the big leagues in 1972. I felt if he could be from Austin and make it I could, too. I chose football. ... Think about it. Two boys from Austin with a World Series ring and a Super Bowl ring.\"\n\nHow far did Baylor come from the kid who grew up in a section of Austin where the streets weren't even paved until after he made it to the big leagues for good with the Orioles in 1972?\n\nHe was laid to rest Saturday in the Texas State Cemetery, next to Chris Kyle, the highly decorated sniper who lost his life trying to calm a veteran suffering from PTSD. Kyle and Baylor worked together on the Wounded Warrior Project, which led to a strong friendship. Off to the side was the grave of James Street, a former University of Texas quarterback and father of big league pitcher Huston Street, and nearby was the grave of legendary Texas football coach Darrell Royal, who in 1967 offered Baylor a scholarship to become the first African-American player in University of Texas history.\n\nThe Rev. Steve Manning, the pastor for Sweet Home Missionary Baptist Church in Austin, Baylor's childhood church for which he oversaw a major renovation in recent years, said, \"We are here to celebrate an MVP, an MVP on the field, an MVP in life, and an MVP of his church.\"\n\nThe ceremony underscored the universal appeal of Baylor, whose his former teammates Bobby Grich and Frank Robinson were among a list of speakers that included a long-time sportswriter who had known Baylor on a personal basis for more than 40 years, his son Don Jr., niece, Marquette, and nearly a dozen people from the audience, including his fifth-grade teacher.\n\nAnd Baylor's memory was honored by the presence of a fellow Texan and former teammate with the Angels, Hall of Fame pitcher Nolan Ryan and his wife, Ruth.\n\n\"I don't think of him as my uncle,\" Marquette said. \"I think of him as my hero, who I thought was so special I shared him with my friends. I shared him with the world.\"\n\nThe church auditorium was filled with friends and family, not only from Austin, but throughout baseball, including Pirates manager Clint Hurdle, who missed games in Toronto on Friday and Saturday to be in the audience.\n\n\"Where else could I be?\" Hurdle asked. \"The man believed in me when I don't know that many did. He gave me a chance to be a big league coach [with the Rockies], and when I became a big league manager, he honored me by becoming my hitting coach [with the Rockies]. He helped me along the way, like he did so many people.\"\n\nDon Jr. said he was proud people didn't wait until Baylor died, but that \"they let him know how they felt about him ... He taught so many people lessons in life and as his only child, I was his No. 1 pupil. I was never his equal [as an athlete], but he supported me in whatever I did. I know in his heart he wanted me to have the opportunities he never had.\"\n\nNot that Don Sr. ever said that. One of the things that made Baylor so special is that for all the challenges he faced in being one of the three African-American kids to integrate O. Henry Middle School in 1962, and later becoming the first black athlete at Stephen F. Austin High School, he never spoke of hardships. He never complained about what he went through growing up.\n\nHe saw all that as challenges that made him strong, and opened the way for him to help others deal with the challenges they faced in life.\n\nBaylor passed on that chance to play football at Texas to instead sign with the Baltimore Orioles, who selected him in the second round of the 1967 Draft, a round after Grich, who became his roommate in the Minor Leagues and big leagues in an odd-couple mixture of the kid from the Clarksville district of Austin and a Southern California surfer.\n\n\"He never pushed me into it, but I knew in his heart he wanted me to have an opportunity [to have an occupation] where I never had to use my hands,\" said Don Jr., who did his undergraduate work at Georgetown and graduate work at the University of Wisconsin. \"I studied under professionals with global respect. I had professors who wrote a number of books. But my dad was the best teacher I ever had.\n\n\"He taught me to be a leader. That the most important thing about being a leader is leading by example. He taught me the value of hard work, the value of discipline.\"", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3355624", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T00:20:00Z", "sim": 0.5137255191802979, "source": {"uri": "m.rockies.mlb.com", "title": "Colorado Rockies", "id": "6150"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "00:20:00", "url": "http://m.mlb.com/news/article/248038644/don-baylor-inspired-many-in-baseball-and-nfl/", "storyUri": "eng-3355624", "id": "8857473", "image": "http://m.mlb.com/assets/images/1/4/0/248040140/cuts/1280x720/cut.jpg", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "00:20:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

Over 390 bodies have been discovered at Nasser and Al Shifa hospitals, including of women and children, with many reportedly showing signs of torture and summary executions, and potential instances of people buried alive,\" the experts said.\n\nThey noted that women, girls and children overall are among those most exposed to danger in this conflict, and that as of 29 April 2024, of 34,488 Palestinians killed in Gaza, 14,500 have been children and 9,500 women. Another 77,643 have reportedly been injured, of which 75% are estimated to be female. Over 8,000 others are reported missing or under the rubble - and the experts noted that at least half of them can be assumed to be women and children. They also noted that an estimated 63 women, including 37 mothers are being killed daily and 17,000 Palestinian children are believed to have been orphaned since the war on Gaza began.\n\n1.7 million people are internally displaced, and 1.1. million are projected to face catastrophic levels of food insecurity. According to UN reports, a number of women and girls have also been forcefully disappeared by the Israeli military since the beginning of Israel's onslaught. The experts noted that Israeli forces had also destroyed Gaza's largest fertility clinic, reported to have been storing 3,000 embryos.\n\n\"The treatment of pregnant and lactating women continues to be appalling, with the direct bombardment of hospitals and deliberate denial of access to health care facilities by Israeli snipers, combined with the lack of beds and medical resources placing an estimated 50,000 pregnant Palestinian women and 20,000 new-born babies at unimaginable risk. Over 183 women per day are giving birth without pain relief, while hundreds of babies have died because of a lack of electricity to power incubators,\" they said. \"The dreadful conditions have resulted in increases in miscarriages by up to 300 percent. 95 per cent of pregnant and breastfeeding women face severe food poverty\".\n\nThe experts said women in labour deliver their babies in horrific circumstances. According to UNFPA, around 155,000 pregnant women and new mothers are struggling to survive and access basic health care. In addition, an estimated 690,000 women and girls in Gaza who require menstrual hygiene supplies are unable to manage their menstrual cycle in privacy and with dignity with some reports of contraceptive pills being taken to avoid the unhygienic menstrual conditions.\n\nThey said unprecedented mass destruction of housing and precarious tent living conditions have disproportionately impacted women and girls, including on their personal security and privacy.\n\n\"Nothing illustrates systematic violence being inflicted on women and their children better than the story of an infant who was saved from her mother's womb after she was killed in an Israeli attack in the Gaza Strip, and died days later in an incubator on 26 April,\" the experts said.\n\nThey were dismayed at continued reports of sexual assault and violence against women and girls, including against those detained by Israeli occupation forces. The experts said the Government of Israel has continuously failed to conduct an independent, impartial and effective investigation into the reported crimes.\n\n\"We are appalled that women are being targeted by Israel with such vicious, indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks, seemingly sparing no means to destroy their lives and deny them their fundamental human rights,\" they said.\n\n\"Israel must cease all hostilities and States must end the export of all weapons immediately. These States can no longer ignore the fact that the weapons are being used to kill and maim innocent women and children. There can be no more excuses,\" the experts said. \"Women and children are entitled to special protection under international humanitarian law and human rights law\".\n\n*The experts: Reem Alsalem, Special Rapporteur on violence against women and girls, its causes and consequences; Francesca Albanese, Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian Territory occupied since 1967; Balakrishnan Rajagopal, Special Rapporteur on the right to adequate housing; Michael Fakhri, Special Rapporteur on the right to food; Pedro Arrojo Agudo, Special Rapporteur on the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation; Paula Gaviria Betancur, Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons; Ben Saul, Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism\n\nThe experts are part of what is known as the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council.

Over 390 bodies have been discovered at Nasser and Al Shifa hospitals, including of women and children, with many reportedly showing signs of torture and summary executions, and potential instances of people buried alive,\" the experts said.\n\n\"The treatment of pregnant and lactating women continues to be appalling, with the direct bombardment of hospitals and deliberate denial of access to health care facilities by Israeli snipers, combined with the lack of beds and medical resources placing an estimated 50,000 pregnant Palestinian women and 20,000 new-born babies at unimaginable risk,\" said the UN experts.\n\n\"We are appalled that women are being targeted by Israel with such vicious, indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks, seemingly sparing no means to destroy their lives and deny them their fundamental human rights,\" they said.\n\nThey said unprecedented mass destruction of housing and precarious tent living conditions have disproportionately impacted women and girls, including their personal security and privacy.\n\n\"Nothing illustrates systematic violence being inflicted on women and their children better than the story of an infant who was saved from her mother's womb after she was killed in an Israeli attack in the Gaza Strip, and died days later in an incubator on 26 April,\" the experts said.\n\n\"Over 183 women per day are giving birth without pain relief, while hundreds of babies have died because of a lack of electricity to power incubators,\" they said. \"The dreadful conditions have resulted in increases in miscarriages by up to 300 percent. 95 percent of pregnant and breastfeeding women face severe food poverty.\"\n\nThe UN experts expressed dismay at continued reports of sexual assault and violence against women and girls, including against those detained by Israeli occupation forces. The experts said the Government of Israel has continuously failed to conduct an independent, impartial and effective investigation into the reported crimes.\n\n\"Women and children are entitled to special protection under international humanitarian law and human rights law,\" they said.\n\nThe experts seven are Reem Alsalem, Special Rapporteur on violence against women and girls, its causes and

They also pointed to severely limited access to justice due to fear of reprisals and the lack of economic opportunities.\n\nThe experts expressed grave concern that criminal gangs continue to use sexual violence against women and girls as a primary tactic to instil fear, extort money, gain control of power, and punish local communities.\n\n\"Internally displaced women and girls, who live in inadequate and precarious displacement sites, are particularly vulnerable to sexual violence,\" they said. The experts also warned that risks and prevalence of trafficking of women and girls for purposes of sexual exploitation and sexual slavery had increased.\n\nCalling on criminal gangs to put an immediate end to all forms of gender-based violence, the experts expressed alarm towards the authorities' serious and continued failure to protect and fulfil the rights of women and girls in this crisis. \"No one should be forced to choose between their safety and their ability to provide for themselves and their families, attend school, access healthcare and basic services, including sexual and reproductive care,\" they said. They sounded alarm that survivors of violence continue to be unable to receive the assistance and protection they need.\n\nThe experts were also concerned at reports that the Government undermined and under-resourced State institutions that provide social services and protect human rights, failed to address corruption in the justice sector and beyond, and was actively complicit in gang activities.\n\n\"Haiti must return to democratic and constitutional governance based on the principles of respect for human rights, transparency and accountability,\" the experts urged. \"The transitional government must exert good-faith efforts to execute its mandate and create conditions for free, fair and inclusive elections.\"\n\nThey emphasised that women's voices and perspectives must be front and centre in the political transition process, to ensure accountability and non-recurrence of widespread violations of women and girls' rights.\n\n\"We call on authorities to take all measures to ensure the full and equal participation of women in the peacebuilding process, in accordance with Security Council Resolution 1325,\" the experts said.\n\n*The experts: Dorothy Estrada Tanck (Chair), Claudia Flores, Ivana Krsti\u0107, Haina Lu, and Laura Nyirinkindi, Working group on discrimination against women and girls;

Over 390 bodies have been discovered at Nasser and Al Shifa hospitals, including of women and children, with many reportedly showing signs of torture and summary executions, and potential instances of people buried alive,\" the experts said.\n\nThey noted that women, girls and children overall are among those most exposed to danger in this conflict, and that as of 29 April 2024, of 34,488 Palestinians killed in Gaza, 14,500 have been children and 9,500 women. Another 77,643 have reportedly been injured, of which 75% are estimated to be female. Over 8,000 others are reported missing or under the rubble - and the experts noted that at least half of them can be assumed to be women and children. They also noted that an estimated 63 women, including 37 mothers are being killed daily and 17,000 Palestinian children are believed to have been orphaned since the war on Gaza began.\n\n1.7 million people are internally displaced, and 1.1. million are projected to face catastrophic levels of food insecurity. According to UN reports, a number of women and girls have also been forcefully disappeared by the Israeli military since the beginning of Israel's onslaught. The experts noted that Israeli forces had also destroyed Gaza's largest fertility clinic, reported to have been storing 3,000 embryos.\n\n\"The treatment of pregnant and lactating women continues to be appalling, with the direct bombardment of hospitals and deliberate denial of access to health care facilities by Israeli snipers, combined with the lack of beds and medical resources placing an estimated 50,000 pregnant Palestinian women and 20,000 new-born babies at unimaginable risk. Over 183 women per day are giving birth without pain relief, while hundreds of babies have died because of a lack of electricity to power incubators,\" they said. \"The dreadful conditions have resulted in increases in miscarriages by up to 300 percent. 95 per cent of pregnant and breastfeeding women face severe food poverty\".\n\nThe experts said women in labour deliver their babies in horrific circumstances. According to UNFPA, around 155,000 pregnant women and new mothers are struggling to survive and access basic health care. In addition, an estimated 690,000 women and girls in Gaza who require menstrual hygiene supplies are unable to manage their menstrual cycle in privacy and with dignity with some reports of contraceptive pills being taken to avoid the unhygienic menstrual conditions.\n\nThey said unprecedented mass destruction of housing and precarious tent living conditions have disproportionately impacted women and girls, including on their personal security and privacy.\n\n\"Nothing illustrates systematic violence being inflicted on women and their children better than the story of an infant who was saved from her mother's womb after she was killed in an Israeli attack in the Gaza Strip, and died days later in an incubator on 26 April,\" the experts said.\n\nThey were dismayed at continued reports of sexual assault and violence against women and girls, including against those detained by Israeli occupation forces. The experts said the Government of Israel has continuously failed to conduct an independent, impartial and effective investigation into the reported crimes.\n\n\"We are appalled that women are being targeted by Israel with such vicious, indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks, seemingly sparing no means to destroy their lives and deny them their fundamental human rights,\" they said.\n\n\"Israel must cease all hostilities and States must end the export of all weapons immediately. These States can no longer ignore the fact that the weapons are being used to kill and maim innocent women and children. There can be no more excuses,\" the experts said. \"Women and children are entitled to special protection under international humanitarian law and human rights law\".", "source": {"uri": "scoop.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Scoop"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamal_Abdel_Nasser", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gamal Abdel Nasser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_grave", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mass grave"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summary_execution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summary execution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Torture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miscarriage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Embryo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniper", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sniper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Food security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fertility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breastfeeding", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Breastfeeding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_occupation_of_the_West_Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israeli occupation of the West Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Israel", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Population_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations Population Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_human_rights_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International human rights law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Menstrual cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_humanitarian_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International humanitarian law"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Smoking", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Smoking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 65}], "image": "http://img.scoop.co.nz/stories/images/1908/scoop_image.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543165", "eventUri": "eng-9543165", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-26", "textStart": 3182, "textEnd": 3190}], "sentiment": -0.6, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

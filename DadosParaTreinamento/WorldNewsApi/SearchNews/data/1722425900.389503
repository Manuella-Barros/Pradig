Celebrini, 18, was a star center at Boston University, the fourth freshman to win the Hobey Baker Award as college hockey\u2019s top player. And he did so as the nation\u2019s youngest player. He scored 34 goals and had 64 points in 38 games.

The Sharks entered the NHL at the start of the 1991-92 season. Friday night was the first time they had the No. 1 pick in the draft. They\u2019ve had the No. 2 overall pick three times. In 1991, they selected Pat Falloon. In 1996, they selected Andrei Zyuzin. In 1997, they took Patrick Marleau. An NHL Central Scouting report described Celebrini as being a \"a strong skater with fluid stride, elusive speed and quickness. ... The go-to for one-timers on the power play. Plays a heads-up complete game.\" CONN SMYTHE TROPHY WINNER CONNOR MCDAVID'S FIANC\u00c9E REFLECTS ON STANLEY CUP LOSS: 'HEARTBROKEN' Celebrini is a central part of the Sharks\u2019 future. The team selected center William Smith last year. \"Having the first overall pick, it\u2019s a big moment for the organization, to have someone hopefully that can be a big part of our core and play here for a long, long time,\" Sharks general manager Mike Grier said earlier this week. \"It\u2019s definitely doing a good job of laying (the foundation). I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s finishing the foundation,\" he added. \"It\u2019s definitely an important time, an important draft, but we still got some work to do to kind of round things out and keep building up the prospect pool.\" The draft took place at the Sphere in Las Vegas for the first time. The Chicago Blackhawks chose defenseman Artyom Levshunov with the No. 2 pick. The Anaheim Ducks surprised the NHL world when they took Beckett Sennecke, a right winger, at No. 3.

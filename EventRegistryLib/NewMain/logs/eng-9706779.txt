I mean it,\" Howard told the Daily Mail.\n\n\"I know Klopp has only been retired a few weeks and I know he wants a break. But if we sat around his villa in Spain, I think I could lure him over here. 100 percent.\n\n\"The money is certainly there. So my pitch would be simple: he has a young group of players who can play progressive, front-foot soccer - exactly like his Liverpool teams. And in two years' time he can go to the biggest World Cup in history.\"\n\nKlopp has fuelled speculation he would be willing to take the role after sending a message to his supporters in the USA on social media.\n\n\"It's the perfect day to think about my trips with Liverpool to the States... we've had a great time & the US fans are electric! Happy 4th of July,\" Klopp wrote alongside a selection of pictures from Liverpool's pre-season tours to the USA.\n\nUnited States supporters were quick to respond, with one posting on X: \"HE'S COMING!\"\n\nAnother added: \"If this isn't a wink I don't know what it is. Klopp wants to come!!!!!\"\n\nFormer USA international Alexi Lalas echoed Howard, claiming football chiefs would be 'derelict in their duty not to have a conversation with Klopp'.\n\n\"He might say that he doesn't want to do it, but you leave no stone unturned in terms of going out and trying to identify and lure in the best in the world,\" Lalas told the New York Post.\n\n\"I know people scoff at the idea of someone with his pedigree and background would ever consider doing this. But until you have the conversation, you don't know.\"", "source": {"uri": "sportbible.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.sportbible.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_Club_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA Club World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Howard", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Howard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Merseyside"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregg_Berhalter", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gregg Berhalter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Football pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexi_Lalas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexi Lalas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://images.ladbible.com/resize?type=webp&quality=70&width=1200&fit=contain&gravity=auto&url=https://images.ladbiblegroup.com/v3/assets/blta90d05ad41a54a71/bltdd71927c4c4b5bcd/6686c96bb8ecc70a9bd7f3f0/liverpool-jurgen-klopp-anfield.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9706779", "eventUri": "eng-9706779", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 2129, "textEnd": 2140}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 217, "relevance": 1}

Jurgen Klopp has gone back on his word in the past. More than once, in fact. No wonder DailyMail.com columnist Tim Howard is confident he would do it again.\n\nAfter the USMNT crashed out of Copa America, the legendary goalkeeper has vowed to fly to Spain himself to make the pitch for Klopp to take over. A pipe dream? That's what the cynics will say. Recent history paints a different picture.\n\nBack in April 2015, Klopp announced that, after seven years in charge of Borussia Dortmund, he was leaving the club. The German initially denied that his tank was empty. He ruled out taking a sabbatical. By June, however, his tune had changed.\n\n'It makes sense to take time to take stock of the countless memories before me and my fellow coaching team embrace a new challenge, fresh and highly motivated,' Klopp said following his final game in charge. For 'the time being' he would unwind and recharge.\n\nFour months later, Klopp was sitting in the Anfield dugout. He wouldn't allow himself another chance to rest for nearly nine years. Until this summer, when Klopp left Liverpool a greater, grayer manager. His energy levels depleted.\n\nJurgen Klopp is enjoying a break in Spain after leaving Liverpool at the end of last season\n\nThe German wanted a sabbatical after leaving Borussia Dortmund but changed his mind\n\nDailyMail.com columnist Tim Howard\n\nKlopp, who recently turned 47, has a $4.3million villa in Majorca. He had dreamed of having a place there all his life; his plan is to create 'an ecological family paradise'.\n\nHe enjoys the weather, the people, the padel. He and his wife Ulla are honorary members of their local country club alongside the likes of Novak Djokovic. Where better to retire after one of the finest managerial careers of recent times?\n\n'It's out of the question that I'll stop working altogether,' the German said recently. 'But I don't see myself continuing at the same pace as before at the moment.'\n\nSo the door is ajar and Howard fancies his powers of persuasion. The stakes could hardly be higher: two years out from the 2026 World Cup, a pivotal moment for the game on these shores, US Soccer is in turmoil.\n\nDefeat by Uruguay saw the team exit a home Copa America at the first hurdle. Supporters are calling for head coach Gregg Berhalter to be fired; US Soccer is at a crossroads.\n\nGregg Berhalter is facing calls to go after the USMNT crashed out of Copa America on Monday\n\nKlopp, now 57, has bought a $4.3million villa in Majorca where he has been winding down\n\n'They have to go for the jackpot,' Howard said. 'You need someone with high expectations, a clear vision and a clear path. Someone who is demanding of themselves as well as their team. Someone like Jurgen Klopp.'\n\nThe upside for the US is obvious. The more pressing question is whether Klopp would want the job. 'If we sat around his villa in Spain, I think I could lure him over here. 100 percent,' Howard insisted.\n\nYou can understand his confidence. There are several reasons why Klopp and the USA would appear to be a perfect fit. Both on and off the field.\n\nFirst, the finances. At Liverpool, Klopp was one of the world's best-paid managers, raking in an estimated $22million a year by the end of his Anfield tenure. That's before the $28million he is said to make through commercial deals.\n\nIt's a package that will price him out of most jobs. Including, it would seem, the Germany national team. 'The DFB can't pay Jurgen Klopp at all,' German football chief Ralph-Uwe Schaffert said recently.\n\nBut Howard is certain that won't be an issue over here. Money rarely is in US sports. Only last year, Inter Miami, Adidas, Apple and MLS pulled strings to bring Lionel Messi to America.\n\nKlopp recently took to Instagram to reveal he has been playing padel while on vacation\n\nUS Soccer has just built a new $200m training center. In 2022, Berhalter made $2,291,136 - including $900,000 in bonuses after leading the US to the knockout stages of the Qatar World Cup.\n\nPocket change compared to Klopp, perhaps. But not bad for international football. Gareth Southgate is thought to be the highest earner at Euro 2024, with the England manager said to make around $5m a year.\n\nKlopp won't make the sort of money he earned at Liverpool. But he wouldn't have to work as hard either. International management involves far, far fewer days on the training pitch. It does not put coaches through the week-to-week grind of life in the Premier League. It wouldn't require Klopp to work at that 'same pace as before'.\n\nLife in the United States would, however, introduce Klopp to a commercial market with an insatiable appetite - and virtually unlimited budget - for personalities.\n\nThere are few foreign coaches who are as comfortable and charismatic in front of the cameras as Klopp. The cackle. The Colgate smile. The charm. The sense of humor and the sense that Klopp remains in touch with the common man.\n\nThere were no few tantrums but, time and again at Liverpool, the German won hearts and minds with his openness, his insight, his considered input into difficult conversations. Even his interviews with young Scousers.\n\nKlopp has proven himself to be both charming and charismatic in front of the cameras\n\nThe German developed a close relationship with both players and fans while at Liverpool\n\nBerhalter has carried himself with dignity and his achievements on the field should not be ignored. But he possesses none of the star power of a coach like Klopp.\n\nKlopp has even embraced social media in recent weeks, starting an Instagram account and peeling back the curtain on his new life - playing padel and catching up old friends including Boris Becker.\n\nAt this crucial juncture for US Soccer, its hard to think of a manager better suited to shouldering the expectation and attention that would come with leading the team into a home World Cup. A tournament that will break all records. Klopp would be welcomed like a coming savior. He could make himself a God. The rewards would be immense. The risk to his legacy? Negligible, really.\n\nFortunately Klopp knows what he is doing, too. Few teams over the last decade had such consistent success as his Liverpool team. Even fewer played with such fearlessness and dizzying intensity.\n\nKlopp wouldn't have long - or many opportunities - to apply those principles to a new team. He wouldn't have his trusted right-hand man, Pep Lijnders, either - the Dutchman recently became a head coach at RB Salzburg.\n\nFortunately, this is a young, 'golden generation' of US players who would be easier to mold into Klopp's system than their predecessors. Many of this group are technically gifted and already playing in Europe's top leagues.\n\nThe German manager has previously heaped praise on United States star Christian Pulisic\n\nKlopp's wife Ulla has reportedly been overseeing the renovation of the couple's villa\n\nAt their best under the German, Liverpool had full-backs blessed with creativity, tireless midfielders and a front three who combined at devastating speed.\n\nHe heaped praise on Christian Pulisic not long ago, having worked with the then-teenager at Dortmund. In Flo Balogun, meanwhile, the US have a raw No 9 of immense talent.\n\nMidfielders don't come much more diligent and willing than Tyler Adams, who anchors a well-balanced trio alongside Weston McKennie and Gio Reyna.\n\nAt full back, meanwhile, Antonee Robinson was linked with Liverpool during Klopp's reign. Both he and Sergino Dest offer pace and attacking thrust.\n\nOn the evidence of this summer, the US still face an uphill task to go deep into the World Cup. They went out of Copa America with barely a whimper.\n\nA coach like Klopp would ensure nothing was left to chance. For many Liverpool fans, the joy of his reign came not only from the cups they won but the thrill of the journey.\n\nThe USMNT's trip to Qatar sparked a scandal involving Berhalter and Reyna. Klopp engenders fierce buy-in from players and fans. He could not guarantee success in two years' time. He wouldn't get blame if the USMNT failed. All that is for certain: it would be one hell of a ride.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Proud to serve. So if I was in charge of US Soccer right now, I'd be on my way to the airport. Why? Because I believe I could make a very compelling argument to Jurgen Klopp to take over the US Men's National Team. After the disappointment of Copa America, after the United States lost to Uruguay and exited at the group stages, I will personally fly to Spain. I mean it. I know Klopp has only been retired a few weeks and I know he wants a break. But if we sat around his villa in Spain, I think I could lure him over here. 100 percent. The money is certainly there. So my pitch would be simple: he has a young group of players who can play progressive, front-foot soccer - exactly like his Liverpool teams. And in two years' time he can go to the biggest World Cup in history.\"\n\nWOW.\n\nLiverpool Football Club is a professional football club based in Liverpool, England. The club competes in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. Founded in 1892, the club joined the Football League the following year and has played its home games at Anfield since its formation.\n\nDomestically, the club has won 19 league titles, eight FA Cups, a record nine League Cups and 16 FA Community Shields. In international competitions, the club has won six European Cups, three UEFA Cups, four UEFA Super Cups -- all English records -- and one FIFA Club World Cup.\n\nThe club established itself as a major force in domestic and European football in the 1970s and 1980s, when Bill Shankly, Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan and Kenny Dalglish, led the club to a combined 11 League titles and four European Cups. Liverpool won two further European Cups in 2005 and 2019 under the management of Rafael Ben\u00edtez and J\u00fcrgen Klopp, respectively; the latter led Liverpool to a 19th league title in 2020, the club's first during the Premier League era.\n\nAnfield was built in 1884 on land adjacent to Stanley Park. Situated 2 miles (3 km) from Liverpool city centre, it was originally used by Everton before the club moved to Goodison Park after a dispute over rent with Anfield owner John Houlding. Left with an empty ground, Houlding founded Liverpool in 1892 and the club has played at Anfield ever since. The capacity of the stadium at the time was 20,000, although only 100 spectators attended Liverpool's first match at Anfield.", "source": {"uri": "theinfostride.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Happy 4th of July,\" Klopp said in an Instagram post.\n\nKlopp, who was picked by ex-USMNT player and media personality Alexi Lalas in an exclusive interview with The Post's Ryan Glasspiegel to replace coach Gregg Berhalter, was the FIFA Coach of the Year in 2019 and 2020.\n\n\"Someone like J\u00fcrgen Klopp is out there,\" Lalas told The Post. \"I know people scoff at the idea of someone with his pedigree and background would ever consider doing this. But until you have the conversation, you don't know.\"\n\nWell, if his Instagram post is any indication, it looks as though he would be more than willing to discuss the job with the USSF.\n\nBerhalter's job is on the chopping block after horrific results at the Copa America tournament, losing to Panama and Uruguay on home soil.\n\nThe USSF released a statement earlier this week that they will be conducting a \"comprehensive review of our performance.\"\n\nBerhalter's group lost to Panama in the group stage while constantly battling with the referees against Uruguay in another 1-0 defeat Monday.\n\nLalas added that if U.S. soccer does indeed move on from Berhalter, the federation that controls the search for a new coach would be \"derelict in their duty not to have a conversation with Klopp.\"\n\n\"He might say that he doesn't want to do it, but you leave no stone un-turned in terms of going out and trying to identify and lure in the best in the world,\" Lalas said to the Post.\n\nIt's important to mention that a coach of his stature would be tough to get financially, the USSF would need to open their wallets for this one.\n\nKlopp was making \u20ac15 million per year (roughly $16.2 million) while coaching at Liverpool, while coach Berhalter makes roughly $1.6 million, according to Yahoo! Sports.\n\nThe salary difference is vast, but if the USSF can actually pony up the dough for an elite coach who could develop some of its younger players, it would be a game-changer for American soccer.\n\nKlopp is a legend at Anfield stadium in Liverpool, as he guided the club to six major trophies under his reign.\n\nBerhalter has not been fired as the coach of the U.S. Men's National Team, although calls for his job have been ringing with the unacceptable result in the Copa America.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregg_Berhalter", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gregg Berhalter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexi_Lalas", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexi Lalas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Soccer_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Soccer Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Panama"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Panama"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/newspress-collage-dl3quybpi-1720117179990.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1720102891&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9706779", "eventUri": "eng-9706779", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 475, "textEnd": 486}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

We've Got Bad News", "body": "The differences in the definitions of \"possible\" and \"feasible\" are subtle yet substantial.\n\nWhereas \"possible\" is defined as whether or not something is *able* to be done, \"feasible\" is defined as whether or not something is *capable* of being done.\n\nFor example: is it possible to survive trying to climb up the Empire State Building? Well, sure. But is it feasible? I think you know the answer.\n\nSo, yes, is it possible that the United States Men's National Team could hire a world-elite manager like Jurgen Klopp or Pep Guardiola? Sure! Especially when money is involved, anything is possible. But whether or not it's feasible is another question entirely, and its answer is likely not one that American soccer fans will want to hear.\n\nFirst, let's start with the recently retired Klopp, who departed from Liverpool earlier this year after spending nine years with the storied English club. Klopp's reason for leaving, above all else, was that he was \"running out of energy.\"\n\nThis admission is both positive and negative when it comes to his potential prospects as a USMNT manager. On one hand, his retirement just started, so it's highly unlikely that he will get back into management until 2025, at the earliest.\n\nOn the other, however, is the fact being a national team manager is far less demanding than being a club manager. And if Klopp were to decide to go down the international management route, his native and beloved Germany would certainly take priority over the United States, no?\n\nGranted, Klopp's affection for American culture has never been a secret, given his relationship with Fenway Sports Group, his constant wearing of Yankees or Red Sox hats, vacations to New York City, his love of the Rocky movies, and so on.\n\nThe final factor that breaks in USMNT fans' favor as far as Klopp is concerned is that, despite his status as one of the game's all-time great managers, his options are surprisingly limited due to his own loyalties.\n\nHe's already said he'd never manage in England again (other than Liverpool) and it's difficult to see him going to a world power like Real Madrid, PSG, or Barcelona. His Dortmund ties in Germany also mean he'd never manage Bayern Munich, and he's not the type to sell out and manage in the Middle East. He'd also likely never manage the England national team given that Liverpudlians largely see themselves in opposition to what the national team stands for.\n\nAs for Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola, his prospects are simultaneously more straightforward yet more complex, as Pep is both more attainable, and less predictable than Klopp.\n\nWith Pep, as he's proven with Barca, Bayern, and City, he needs to be in an elite set-up where he's given carte blanche to build the program as he pleases. While the USMNT is not currently structured this way, a legendary figure like Guardiola might be able to bend them to his will. If the US Soccer Federation were to offer him that, plus a ton of money, Guardiola would likely mull it over.\n\nWhat makes Pep harder to pin down than Klopp, however, is that his principles make it unclear what his future holds beyond Man City. If Pep leaves the club in the summer of 2025, which recent rumors have suggested, there is truly no telling where he could pop up next. Returning to Barca? Taking a crack at Italy with a club Juventus or Inter Milan? Cashing a check in Saudi Arabia or MLS? The Spanish national team? All of these options are -- you guessed it! -- feasible when pondering Pep's future.\n\nEven when stripping away all hypothetical reasoning, there are technical and tangible elements preventing US Soccer from hiring someone like Pep or Klopp, most notably the newly-installed equity regulations within the federation, i.e., whatever obscene amount of money it would take to coax one of them to take the job, US Soccer would have to pay the women's team manager the same.\n\nAnd that, ultimately, is the biggest hurdle in the US Federation making a truly bold hire that would change the arc of the sport in the country, particularly ahead of a historic World Cup: money. Following the 2022 World Cup, the USF had the chance to replace Berhalter, as the expiry of his contract plus numerous swirling controversies gave both parties an opportunity for a clean break.\n\nInstead, the USF chose the safe route, the risk-averse route, the vanilla route, and got exactly what they deserved on Monday night when Berhalter was holding up his two pointer fingers to indicate that the score of the Panama-Bolivia game was 1-1 only to watch his team concede seconds later, personifying and embodying the federation's ambitions: mediocrity, in terms of profile, results, and ultimately, cost.", "source": {"uri": "brobible.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BroBible"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eric_italiano@brobible.com", "name": "Eric Italiano", "type":

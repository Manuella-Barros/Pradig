The sharp yen spikes on July 11 and 12 led to interventions estimated at 5.71 trillion yen.

A day-by-day breakdown will be available in quarterly data due in about three months' time.\n\nThe finance ministry's latest foray differed from other recent rounds of intervention - including the record 9.79 trillion yen intervention spanning the end of April and start of May - because officials bought yen as the dollar was already tumbling following a surprisingly weak U.S. consumer inflation print.\n\nEven so, analysts pointed to factors other than Tokyo's dollar selling for keeping the yen surging over the course of this month.\n\nThe dollar took another leg lower after Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said he wanted a weaker currency. That was quickly followed by a host of high-profile Japanese politicians, including the prime minister, urging near-term Bank of Japan interest rate hikes to curb yen weakness.\n\nThe BOJ's decision to raise interest rates earlier Wednesday and subsequent hawkish news conference by Governor Kazuo Ueda send the dollar spiralling down to the cusp of 150 yen.

That was quickly followed by a host of high-profile Japanese politicians, including the prime minister, urging near-term Bank of Japan interest rate hikes to curb yen weakness.\n\nALSO READ: US Fed keeps interest rates unchanged at 5.25-5.5%, hints at September cut\n\nThe BOJ's decision to raise interest rates earlier Wednesday and subsequent hawkish news conference by Governor Kazuo Ueda send the dollar spiraling down to the cusp of 150 yen.

But if Trump and the others hadn't come out and said what they did, we'd probably have gone back to around 160,\" said Shoki Omori, chief Japan desk strategist at Mizuho Securities.\n\nDespite rising expectations for further BOJ policy normalization, Omori says he expects the yen to weaken again over the course of August.\n\n\"A mere 25 basis point rate hike does not necessarily diminish the attractiveness of carry trades,\" he said, referring to a practice where market players borrow yen at Japan's near-zero interest rates and invest it in higher yielding assets overseas, including the United States.\n\nALSO READ: Japan's chief cabinet secretary calls for broad-based wage hikes\n\nJapanese authorities have made a practice of refraining from confirming intervention, while consistently warning that they stand ready to act at any time to counter one-sided, speculative currency moves.\n\nTokyo still has plenty of firepower to act again, with foreign reserves standing at a whopping $1.23 trillion as of the end of June, and a weak yen remains unpopular with the public and could figure prominently in ruling party leadership elections in September.\n\nHowever, further intervention would take place under new leadership, with Masato Kanda's stint as Japan's top currency diplomat ending on Tuesday.

The amount was largely in line with earlier estimates based on the Bank of Japan's accounts and money broker forecasts.\n\nThe July intervention followed similar actions in April and May, underscoring the government's commitment to keeping speculators on the back foot. The latest action appears to have helped reverse the tide on the yen's weakness, helped in part by heightened speculation that the gaping rate differential between Japan and the US will begin to narrow.\n\nThe yen was little changed against the dollar following the data release, after it had gained 1.7 per cent over the course of the day.\n\nDuring the reporting period, the yen experienced two notable gains. The first move came on the evening of July 12 after the release of weaker-than-expected US inflation data, when the currency appreciated sharply against the dollar from 161.58 to 157.44.\n\nThe second action likely followed on the next business day, when the yen gained by as much as 0.9 per cent. Since then, the Japanese currency has made significant gains.\n\n\"It was a good timing for the government to intervene in the market - just when the yen was about to appreciate,\" said Tohru Sasaki, chief strategist at Fukuoka Financial Group.\n\nMeanwhile, given how much Japan has used already to step into markets this year, \"it would be quite difficult for authorities to spend the same amount again if the yen returns to its previous low,\" said Sasaki. Interventions since April have so far has cost the country around 15 trillion yen (S$133.6 billion) this year.\n\nEarlier estimates comparing the BOJ's current accounts data's final version with money broker forecasts suggested that Japan had likely spent around 3 trillion yen and 2 trillion yen on these operations, respectively. Those projections can vary from the actual amount that's eventually confirmed by finance ministry data.\n\nWednesday's intervention data came hours after the BOJ's decision to hike rates again and unveil slightly faster than expected bond purchase cuts. The central bank raised its policy rate to around 0.25 per cent from a range of 0 to 0.1 per cent, and also unveiled plans to halve its bond purchases by the first quarter of 2026. After governor Kazuo Ueda's press conference, where he didn't rule out additional rate increases, the yen strengthened further.\n\nAtsushi Mimura, who succeeded Masato Kanda as the country's top currency chief on Wednesday, told Bloomberg on Monday that intervention remains a method to counter speculation. He also said the demerits of the recent weak yen are becoming more noticeable on balance, given the impact of higher import costs on households and small businesses.\n\nFollowing the suspected interventions in July, Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki and Kanda declined to comment on whether they had stepped into the market, maintaining their strategy of keeping investors guessing. Mimura appeared to suggest he may continue with that stance.\n\nFurther details of this month's market actions, including daily amounts and the specific markets the government entered, will be released in November.

A day-by-day breakdown will be available in quarterly data due in about three months' time.\n\nThe finance ministry's latest foray differed from other recent rounds of intervention - including the record 9.79 trillion yen intervention spanning the end of April and start of May - because officials bought yen as the dollar was already tumbling following a surprisingly weak U.S. consumer inflation print.\n\nEven so, analysts pointed to factors other than Tokyo's dollar selling for keeping the yen surging over the course of this month.\n\nThe dollar took another leg lower after Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said he wanted a weaker currency. That was quickly followed by a host of high-profile Japanese politicians, including the prime minister, urging near-term Bank of Japan interest rate hikes to curb yen weakness.\n\nThe BOJ's decision to raise interest rates earlier Wednesday and subsequent hawkish news conference by Governor Kazuo Ueda send the dollar spiralling down to the cusp of 150 yen. It was at 150.37 yen as of 1039 GMT.\n\n\"I'm not saying intervention didn't have an impact. It did. But if Trump and the others hadn't come out and said what they did, we'd probably have gone back to around 160,\" said Shoki Omori, chief Japan desk strategist at Mizuho Securities.\n\nDespite rising expectations for further BOJ policy normalization, Omori says he expects the yen to weaken again over the course of August.\n\n\"A mere 25 basis point rate hike does not necessarily diminish the attractiveness of carry trades,\" he said, referring to a practice where market players borrow yen at Japan's near-zero interest rates and invest it in higher yielding assets overseas, including the United States.\n\nJapanese authorities have made a practice of refraining from confirming intervention, while consistently warning that they stand ready to act at any time to counter one-sided, speculative currency moves.\n\nTokyo still has plenty of firepower to act again, with foreign reserves standing at a whopping $1.23 trillion as of the end of June, and a weak yen remains unpopular with the public and could figure prominently in ruling party leadership elections in September.\n\nHowever, further intervention would take place under new leadership, with Masato Kanda's stint as Japan's top currency diplomat ending on Tuesday. Financial regulation expert Atsushi Mimura took over as vice finance minister for international affairs, saying in an interview that intervention remains on the table.

No daily breakdowns were released.\n\nUntil now, Japanese officials have been reticent, seemingly to keep market traders on edge and reluctant to sell the yen aggressively.\n\nThe amount was smaller than the 9.79 trillion yen spent between April and May, a monthly record, but was broadly in line with over 5 trillion yen estimated by market sources.\n\nAuthorities were suspected of yen-buying when the dollar tumbled over 4 yen from 161 yen in New York on July 11. It then dropped by over 1 yen in a short period into the lower 157 yen zone the following day.\n\nWhile analysts say the effects of market interventions should be short-lived, the yen has strengthened from the 161 zone following what was then suspected to be yen-buying by Japanese authorities.\n\nComments by U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump criticizing a strong dollar, along with market expectations of an interest rate hike by the Bank of Japan ahead of its policy meeting on Wednesday, also boosted yen-buying.\n\nJapan has stressed that foreign exchange rates should be determined by market forces but move stably based on economic fundamentals.

And as trend-followers who rode the currency's slide to a 38-year low start to flip their bets, investors of all stripes are rushing to get out of the way.\n\nThe yen is up 8% on the dollar in three weeks and the speed of the rally has caught market participants off guard.\n\nFunds and trend-following commodity trading advisers (CTAs), who took short positions in calmer times, face losses or at least a new risk calculus, as the yen has sharply retraced a slide that took it from 140 a dollar in January to 161 in July.\n\nAt about 150 to the dollar on Thursday, about half the year's paper-gain for yen shorts is gone and the volatility leaves the position less and less comfortable by the day.\n\nWith policy meetings in the U.S. and Japan done, and confirming opposite trajectories for interest rates, analysts and dealers say leveraged players' next move will drive the currency market, and that probably means more gains for the yen.\n\n\"It's really the price action that drives dollar/yen,\" said James Malcolm, macro strategist at UBS.\n\nAnd with trend-followers all picking up the same signals from the market shift, an already big move can get even bigger - and fast.\n\n\"Sub-152, a lot of these triggers begin to come in for CTAs, not just reducing the dollar longs,\" he said. \"But actually starting to turn short dollars in dollar-yen.\"\n\nBeing short the yen, whose short-term yields had been anchored at zero since the start of the century, was the world's juiciest currency trade for years - all the more so while the yen steadily declined and forex volatility was low.\n\nNow the factors underpinning the assumption that the yen would stay both cheap and stable are suddenly shifting. A rising stock market is encouraging more Japanese to bring money back home, and the trade deficit has narrowed.\n\nJapanese investors have withdrawn a net 2.2 trillion yen ($15 billion) from foreign equities so far this year, a larger sum than the net 621.2 billion yen investment flows to foreign bonds, according to official data.\n\nAt the same time, within four months the Bank of Japan has hiked rates twice and dismantled a policy of capping yields that had acted as a safety-net for short yen positions by ensuring that its interest rates stayed at rock-bottom.\n\n\"We remain convinced that the past two years of yen weakness does not represent a structural shift; the sell-off is cyclical in nature and fully reversible,\" said Macquarie strategist Gareth Berry, who forecasts dollar/yen at 125 by the end of 2025.\n\nREGIME CHANGE\n\nSpeculators have cut their bearish bets against the yen by the most in a month since March 2020. At $8.61 billion, the net short position is 40% below April's near-seven year high, according to data from the U.S. markets regulator.\n\n\"Dollar/yen technicals have flipped. With a decidedly more hawkish BOJ, markets are now focused on how much they can hike, not if they will,\" said Rong Ren Goh, a portfolio manager in the fixed income team at Eastspring Investments.\n\nGoh expects more yen gains, as the market is still short the currency.\n\nTo be sure, there are fundamental reasons for the yen to remain weak. Japan's policy rate is some 500 basis points (bps) below the U.S. Fed Funds rate and markets project that even in a year's time the gap will be larger than 300 bps.\n\nBut investors who remember the last time yen-carry trades unwound in 1998 dread the kind of pain caused by the yen's rally from 147 to the dollar to 101 within weeks, and are getting out of the way.\n\nTareck Horchani, head of prime brokerage dealing at Maybank Securities in Singapore, expects hedge funds will avoid 'naked' short yen trades, and bet instead via options on even higher volatility.\n\nBart Wakabayashi, Tokyo branch manager at State Street, says non-leveraged investors have poured in to yen in recent weeks, with the flow among the most extreme in the past five years, as money managers square underweight yen positions back to neutral.\n\n\"What's on everybody's mind is this positioning fallout and how long is it going to last,\" said Wakabayashi.\n\n\"We smashed our way through the 200-day moving average ... so this process has probably now created a different technical regime\".\n\nCharts had moved such that the dollar could now face resistance around 150.5 yen and the pair might be in a 145-150 range, he said.\n\n($1=150.2000 yen)\n\n(Reporting by Tom Westbrook; Additional reporting by Vidya Ranganathan and Patturaja Murugaboopathy; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Toyota reported Thursday that its April-June profit rose 1.7 percent, boosted by a favorable exchange rate, as vehicle sales grew around the world despite a certification scandal that halted production in Japan for several months.\n\nFiscal first-quarter profit at Japan's top automaker rose to 1.33 trillion yen ($8.9 billion), a record profit for that period, from 1.31 trillion yen the same period a year ago.\n\nQuarterly sales edged up 12 percent to 11.8 trillion yen ($79 billion).\n\nA weak yen, which boosts the value of overseas profits for Japanese exporters, also helped. The US dollar has been trading at above 160 yen in recent weeks, although it slid below 150 yen after the Bank of Japan raised a key interest rate.\n\nThe currency fluctuations added 370 billion yen ($2.5 billion) in operating profit for the period, according to Toyota Motor Corp.\n\nCost reduction efforts added 55 billion yen ($367 million) in operating profit.\n\nProduction in Japan was halted on some auto models after the government found irregularities in documentation for certification approval.\n\nToyota has apologized for the misconduct and said efforts were underway to resume production.\n\nDemand for Toyota's popular hybrid models remained especially strong. Hybrid models deliver fuel efficiency by switching back and forth between an electric motor and gas engine.\n\nBut Toyota sold fewer vehicles around the world during the latest quarter at 2.25 million vehicles, down from 2.3 million vehicles last year.\n\nToyota expects to sell 9.5 million vehicles around the world for the full fiscal year. When including group companies like Daihatsu Motor Co., which makes small models, and truck maker Hino Motors, annual global sales are expected to hit nearly 11 million vehicles, according to Toyota.\n\nToyota stuck to its profit forecast for the full fiscal year through March 2025 at 3.57 trillion yen ($24 billion), down nearly 28% from the previous fiscal year.\n\nLast week, Japanese rival Nissan Motor Co. reported a 73 percent decline in quarterly profit, although sales edged up 3 percent. Honda Motor Co. reports earnings next week.

That would return it to levels last seen in early 2022, when the Federal Reserve had only just begun to hike interest rates.\n\nWhile some strategists see the near-term risk of the yen giving up a large chunk of the gains made in recent weeks, the Bank of Japan's rate hike Wednesday and the Fed's signaling on rate cuts have washed away the sense of doom that hung over the currency for months.\n\n\"It can get to 140 if we see a confluence of factors: The start to the Fed's easing cycle, bouts of risk aversion and a BOJ maintaining an unwavering tightening stance,\" said Paresh Upadhyaya, director of fixed income and currency strategy at Amundi, US. \"While that may seem to be a daunting hurdle, it really is not.\"\n\nThe yen advanced 0.6% to 149.01 versus the dollar at 10:57 a.m. in Tokyo on Thursday, having surged about 1.8% on Wednesday to extend its monthly gain to more than 7%.\n\nThe contrast is stark to the first half of this year, when the currency dropped 12% in the worst performance among Group-of-10 peers, forcing Japan into the market to prop up the yen in April and May. It spent \u00a59.8 trillion ($65.4 billion) at that time, and another \u00a55.5 trillion last month with buying that finally helped turn the tide.\n\n\"Tighter monetary policy in Japan will strengthen the feedback loop of the rebalancing towards local assets,\" said Alex Loo, a macro strategist for TD Securities, which expects dollar-yen to reach 140 int he first quarter of next year.\n\nSaxo Markets head of currency strategy Charu Chanana said there's room for the yen to strengthen towards sub-145 levels this year, especially if volatility increases and carry trades unwind.\n\n\"The Fed is expected to cut interest rates and we see the BOJ raising rates to 0.75% next year,\" said Shusuke Yamada, head of Japan currency and rates strategy at BofA's securities unit in Tokyo. He sees the yen trading in the 140s zone.\n\nSebastian Boyd, MLIV Strategist: \"The yen remains cheaper than it would be if the only thing weighing on it were rate expectations in the US and Japan. The yen has more upside from current levels, and the model suggests it should be trading a whole lot stronger than it is.\"\n\nMacquarie's Gareth Berry reckons the yen will strengthen a lot more as popular carry trades that often involve selling the yen crumble.\n\n\"Over time, the Fed's forthcoming easing cycle should undermine the whole point of being short the yen as an FX carry play,\" the Singapore-based currency and rates strategist wrote in a note.\n\nThe yen has strengthened against every major currency in the past month -- a stunning change from when it wallowed near a 38-year low against the greenback on July 3. Hedge funds drove a chunk of the rally after they beat a hasty retreat from selling the yen to fund purchases in higher-yielding peers like the Mexican peso.\n\nWhile there are strong expectations that Japan's yawning interest-rate differential is now set to narrow further, investors will still need to navigate a bevy of risks, including the US election and the policy path for the BOJ and the Fed.\n\nAt around 0.25%, Japan's borrowing costs are still far below those in the US, where central bankers left the federal funds rate in a range of 5.25% to 5.5%. Swaps traders, though, are pricing in at least two US rate reductions this year, with the first likely coming in September.\n\nSome investors had said in the lead-up to the BOJ meeting that even if it did hike, there would still be a case for the yen to retain favor in carry trades.\n\nIt could weaken back toward the 155 level once market volatility subsides, according to abrdn.\n\n\"Sustained yen appreciation is unlikely without a US recession or more dovish Fed than what's priced,\" said David Zhou, investment director of multi-asset investment solutions at abrdn. \"Odds favors yen strength to peter out.\"\n\nFukuoka Financial Group Inc.'s Tohru Sasaki also remains unconvinced that the yen's strength will stick. While the currency may advance in the short-term, it could weaken towards the 160 level again when focus returns to rate differentials and economic fundamentals.\n\n\"If real interest rates remain substantially negative and do not turn positive, I think it will be difficult for the yen to appreciate even in the medium to long term,\" said the chief strategist.\n\nYet for many, the BOJ's policy decision Wednesday, following on from its first rate hike in March, has changed the picture for the yen.\n\n\"The BOJ noted it 'will accordingly continue to raise the policy interest rate' if its economic outlook materializes,\" wrote Carol Kong, currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, who sees the yen trading at 145 by the fourth quarter of next year. \"This is a hawkish change from the March statement.\"\n\n--With assistance from Matthew Burgess and Winnie Hsu.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

The U.S. dollar has been trading at above 160 yen in recent weeks, although it slid below 150 yen after the Bank of Japan raised a key interest rate.\n\nThe currency fluctuations added 370 billion yen ($2.5 billion) in operating profit for the period, according to Toyota Motor Corp.\n\nCost reduction efforts added 55 billion yen ($367 million) in operating profit.\n\nProduction in Japan was halted on some auto models after the government found irregularities in documentation for certification approval.\n\nToyota has apologized for the misconduct and said efforts were underway to resume production.\n\nDemand for Toyota's popular hybrid models remained especially strong. Hybrid models deliver fuel efficiency by switching back and forth between an electric motor and gas engine.\n\nBut Toyota sold fewer vehicles around the world during the latest quarter at 2.25 million vehicles, down from 2.3 million vehicles last year.\n\nToyota expects to sell 9.5 million vehicles around the world for the full fiscal year. When including group companies like Daihatsu Motor Co., which makes small models, and truck maker Hino Motors, annual global sales are expected to hit nearly 11 million vehicles, according to Toyota.\n\nToyota stuck to its profit forecast for the full fiscal year through March 2025 at 3.57 trillion yen ($24 billion), down nearly 28% from the previous fiscal year.\n\nLast week, Japanese rival Nissan Motor Co. reported a 73% decline in quarterly profit, although sales edged up 3%.

Their paper gains for the year have been slashed as the yen moved from 161 to around 150 against the dollar.

The Bank of Japan's (BoJ) policy shifts, including two rate hikes in four months and ending yield caps, have driven these market dynamics. Meetings in the US and Japan have highlighted their divergent interest rate paths, which may push the yen higher. According to UBS, price action is a major driver for dollar/yen, and with trend followers actively responding, we could see even more dramatic market movements if it slips below 152.\n\nSpeculators have cut bearish bets against the yen by the most since March 2020, now 40% below April's near-seven-year high.

The amount was largely in line with earlier estimates based on the Bank of Japan's accounts and money broker forecasts.\n\nThe July intervention followed similar actions in April and May, underscoring the government's commitment to keeping speculators on the back foot. The latest action appears to have helped reverse the tide on the yen's weakness, helped in part by heightened speculation that the gaping rate differential between Japan and the US will begin to narrow.\n\nThe yen was little changed against the dollar following the data release, after it had gained 1.7% over the course of the day.\n\nDuring the reporting period, the yen experienced two notable gains. The first move came on the evening of July 12 after the release of weaker-than-expected US inflation data, when the currency appreciated sharply against the dollar from 161.58 to 157.44. The second action likely followed on the next business day, when the yen gained by as much as 0.9%. Since then, the Japanese currency has made significant gains.\n\n\"It was a good timing for the government to intervene in the market -- just when the yen was about to appreciate,\" said Tohru Sasaki, chief strategist at Fukuoka Financial Group Inc.\n\nMeanwhile, given how much Japan has used already to step into markets this year, \"it would be quite difficult for authorities to spend the same amount again if the yen returns to its previous low,\" said Sasaki. Interventions since April have so far has cost the country around \u00a515 trillion this year.\n\nEarlier estimates comparing the BOJ's current accounts data's final version with money broker forecasts suggested that Japan had likely spent around \u00a53 trillion and \u00a52 trillion on these operations, respectively. Those projections can vary from the actual amount that's eventually confirmed by finance ministry data.\n\nWednesday's intervention data came hours after the BOJ's decision to hike rates again and unveil slightly faster than expected bond purchase cuts. The central bank raised its policy rate to around 0.25% from a range of 0 to 0.1%, and also unveiled plans to halve its bond purchases by the first quarter of 2026. After Governor Kazuo Ueda's press conference, where he didn't rule out additional rate increases, the yen strengthened further.\n\nAtsushi Mimura, who succeeded Masato Kanda as the country's top currency chief Wednesday, told Bloomberg on Monday that intervention remains a method to counter speculation. He also said the demerits of the recent weak yen are becoming more noticeable on balance, given the impact of higher import costs on households and small businesses.\n\nFollowing the suspected interventions in July, Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki and Kanda declined to comment on whether they had stepped into the market, maintaining their strategy of keeping investors guessing.

Operating profit in the first quarter increased compared to the previous year due to foreign exchange gains and improvement efforts though lower production volumes.\" said Yasushi Matsui, CFO, Vice President and member of the Board of Directors of DENSO CORPORATION. \"In this fiscal year, we forecast 7,330.0 billion yen (US$45.5 billion) in revenue and 692.0 billion yen (US$4.3 billion) in operating profit. In the first quarter, due to the idling of Japanese customers and lower vehicle production volumes in Asia, both sales revenue and operating profit decreased compared to the announced forecast at the beginning of the year. And from the second quarter onward, the impact of suspended operations by customers in Japan is expected to be reduced, but poor vehicle sales, especially in Asia, are expected to continue. On the other hand, the yen is also expected to continue to depreciate. As we navigate these uncertainties, we commit to execute our plan from the second quarter onward announced at the beginning of the year. Based on the above, our forecast of revenue and operating profit reflects only the downside of the first quarter and revise full-year financial forecast downward.\"\n\nIn Japan, revenue increased to 984.6illion yen (US$6.1 billion), up 0.4% from the previous year, and operating profit was 45.1 billion yen (US$280.0 million), up 81.6% from the previous year.\n\nIn North America, revenue increased to 500.1 billion yen (US$3.1 billion), up 17.7% from the previous year, and operating profit was 23.3 billion yen (US$144.6 million) up 270.2% from the previous year.\n\nIn Europe, revenue increased to 199.8 billion yen (US$1.2 billion), up 0.7% from the previous year, and operating profit was 5.0 billion yen (US$31.0 million), down 33.0% from the previous year.\n\nIn Asia, revenue increased to 461.4 billion yen (US$2.9 billion), down 0.6% from the previous year and operating profit was 35.8 billion yen (US$222.0 million), down 11.7% from the previous year.\n\nIn other areas, revenue increased to 29.0 billion yen (US$0.2 billion), up 1.8% from the previous year, and operating profit was 5.9 billion yen (US$36.9 million), up 19.5% from the previous year.\n\nForecast for Fiscal Year Ending March 31, 2025\n\nFull-Year Forecast\n\nChanges from\n\nPrevious Forecast\n\nChanges from\n\nPrevious FY\n\nRevenue\n\n7,330.0 billion yen\n\n[US$45.5 billion]\n\n+20.0 billion yen\n\n(\u25b30.3 percent)\n\n+185.3 billion yen\n\n(+2.6 percent)\n\nOperating Profit\n\n692.0 billion yen\n\n[US$4.3 billion]\n\n+22.0 billion yen\n\n(\u25b33.1 percent)\n\n+311.4 billion yen\n\n(+81.8 percent)\n\nProfit Before Profit\n\nTaxes\n\n745.0 billion yen\n\n[US$4.6 billion]\n\n+27.0 billion yen\n\n(\u25b33.5 percent)\n\n+308.8 billion yen\n\n(+70.8 percent)\n\nProfit Attributable to\n\nOwners of the Parent\n\nCompany\n\n525.0 billion yen\n\n[US$3.3 billion]\n\n+1.0 billion yen\n\n(\u25b30.2 percent)\n\n+212.2 billion yen\n\n(+67.8 percent)\n\nROE\n\n9.3 %\n\n+0.1 %\n\n+3.0 %\n\n(Notes)\n\nThe above forecasts are created based on information obtained by the date of this announcement and the actual results may differ due to various causes in the future.

Governor Kazuo Ueda, furthermore, did not rule out another hike this year and stressed the bank's readiness to keep raising borrowing costs to levels deemed neutral to the economy.\n\nThe dollar dropped 1.7% against the Japanese currency to 150.2 yen after the BOJ's move and is now over 10 yen lower than its early July level of 161.9.\n\nThat July level was the Japanese currency's weakest since 1986. The yen came under heavy pressure as benign market conditions and a wide gap between borrowing costs in Japan and those elsewhere meant it was a popular choice as a funding currency for carry trades.\n\nThese see investors borrow in a currency where interest rates are low - the yen has been popular - and then swap them for another currency in which they can invest in higher yielding assets.\n\nThey had been very popular with investors earlier in the year as global rate cuts that had been expected early in 2024 got pushed back, and currency prices were stable - sudden swings in price can wipe out gains from yield differentials.\n\nBut with the BOJ raising rates at a time when cuts by central banks around the world finally gather pace, investors are changing tack.\n\n\"It's the rate of change (of interest rate differentials) that matters. And so if the BOJ are stepping up the pace of rate hikes relative to market pricing, and if the Fed is also becoming in play here, then the pressure on the carry trade increases,\" said James Malcolm, head of FX strategy at UBS.\n\nThe Federal Reserve held interest rates steady on Wednesday but opened the door to reducing borrowing costs as soon as its next meeting in September as inflation continues coming into line with the U.S. central bank's 2% target.\n\n\"Hedge funds are likely reassessing their strategies in light of these developments,\" said Tareck Horchani, head of prime brokerage dealing at Maybank Securities in Singapore.\n\n\"This shift could diminish the attractiveness of short yen positions, as the narrowing rate differential between the BOJ and other central banks, particularly the Fed which is expected to cut in September and December, makes the yen less appealing for carry trades.\"\n\nPACE AND VOLATILITY\n\nWhile it is difficult to gauge the exact amount of global positions in yen-funded carry trades, and hence the impact their unwinding could have on the currency, a lot of speculative positions are based on pure currency swaps between the yen and higher yielding currencies.\n\nThere are hundreds of billions of dollars worth of yen-funded short-term investments too.\n\nYen-funded carry trades in U.S. Treasuries, for example, yield nearly 6% - a mighty incentive for market participants that has so far been hard for Japan to counter. The BOJ's 15 basis points rate rise will only marginally erode the 'carry' on such trades.\n\nBut what could upend the trades and force liquidation is volatility.\n\n\"The carry trade works when volatility is low, but if that volatility goes up, people will unwind positions,\" said Yusuke Miyairi FX strategist at Nomura.\n\nThat is rising, and dollar/yen overnight implied volatility jumped to 27% on Wednesday, its highest level this year.\n\nIt is not just Wednesday's BOJ move that has jolted the yen, as the MOF's intervention earlier in July stopped the currency's slide. Remarks from Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump criticising Japan for the yen's weakness, and the changing Fed expectations were in the mix.\n\nThose factors have already seen carry trades get unwound, with knock on effects on currencies from Mexico to Switzerland.\n\nCFTC data shows speculators' bearish bets against the yen are 40% below April's near-seven year high, though at a still elevated $8.61 billion.\n\nAnd there is still scope for the yen's moves to get more dramatic.\n\n\"You can't discount the notion that we might have a single day move of five or seven or even like the historic extremes of 10 (yen) in a single day,\" said UBS' Malcolm.\n\n\"In 1998, we had two consecutive days of 10 (yen) moves in dollar/yen. That's what carry trade unwinds look like. That's what we've seen in the past and that's what the setup still looks like today.\"\n\n(Reporting by Alun John London and Tom Westbrook in Singapore; Additional reporting by Vidya Ranganathan in

This is the first rate hike since the March meeting, when the BOJ lifted its negative interest rate policy.\n\nFollowing this additional rate hike decision, the USD/JPY exchange rate saw accelerated dollar selling and yen buying after Governor Ueda's press conference. A Fibonacci analysis was conducted to forecast the future movements of the USD/JPY exchange rate, yielding the following results:\n\n* Low 140.252 yen - High 161.950 yen: 61.8% retracement at 148.541 yen\n\n* Low 127.220 yen - High 161.950 yen: 38.2% retracement at 148.683 yen\n\nThe prices calculated from the above two Fibonacci analyses are very close, indicating that the support zone located around 148.541 yen to 148.683 yen is extremely thin.

Revenues climbed 12.2 percent to 11.8 trillion yen.\n\nThe world's largest automaker by sales also kept unchanged its full-year forecasts, predicting net profit of 3.57 trillion yen, marking a drop of 27.8 percent, on sales of 46 trillion yen, which would be a gain of 2.0 percent.\n\n\"Our operating income was 1.3 trillion yen despite a decrease in production and sales volume in Japan, due to the effects of foreign exchange rates and cost reduction efforts,\" Toyota said in a statement.\n\n\"Despite the inability to maintain stable production in Japan due to factors such as certification issues and recalls, we achieved an increase in profit, thanks to the support of all our stakeholders, including suppliers and dealers,\" it said.\n\nIn June, the government instructed five firms -- Toyota, Honda, Mazda, Suzuki and Yamaha -- to stop delivering certain vehicle models within Japan because of certification issues.\n\nThis week Toyota was also slapped with a correction order by the transport ministry over a failure to comply fully with national vehicle inspection standards.\n\nThat followed inspections in June by officials at its headquarters in the central Aichi region to probe breaches declared by the company related to domestic shipment certifications.\n\nToyota last year reported record bumper results, with net profit doubling to 4.94 trillion yen and revenues soaring by a fifth to 45.1 trillion yen, helped by strong sales of hybrid vehicles.\n\nThe company pioneered hybrid cars -- combining internal combustion engines and batteries -- with its popular Prius model.\n\nBut it has been criticised along with other Japanese automakers for being slow to embrace purely battery-powered vehicles, allowing firms like Tesla and China's BYD to steal a march and gain market share.\n\nHowever, there are signs consumers are going cold on pure EVs because of high prices and worries about reliability, range and a lack of charging points.\n\nToyota aims to sell 1.5 million pure EVs annually by 2026 and 3.5 million by 2030. Last year it sold 10.3 million vehicles.\n\nThe firm is also hoping to mass-produce solid-state batteries, a potential game-changing technological breakthrough that could mean faster charging times and greater range.\n\nIts rivals Honda and Nissan announced in March that they are exploring a \"strategic partnership\" in EVs in a bid to catch up with competitors.\n\nThe scope for possible cooperation includes EV software and joint procurement of parts, the companies said.\n\nThe two firms were due to hold a news conference later Thursday, with reports saying they will announce a basic agreement to form the alliance.\n\nMedia reports reported that Mitsubishi was also in talks to join the tie-up.\n\nnf-stu/dan", "source": {"uri": "ccenterdispatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Governor Kazuo Ueda, furthermore, did not rule out another hike this year and stressed the bank's readiness to keep raising borrowing costs to levels deemed neutral to the economy.\n\nThe dollar dropped 1.7% against the Japanese currency to 150.2 yen after the BOJ's move and is now over 10 yen lower than its early July level of 161.9.\n\nThat July level was the Japanese currency's weakest since 1986. The yen came under heavy pressure as benign market conditions and a wide gap between borrowing costs in Japan and those elsewhere meant it was a popular choice as a funding currency for carry trades.\n\nThese see investors borrow in a currency where interest rates are low - the yen has been popular - and then swap them for another currency in which they can invest in higher yielding assets.\n\nThey had been very popular with investors earlier in the year as global rate cuts that had been expected early in 2024 got pushed back, and currency prices were stable - sudden swings in price can wipe out gains from yield differentials.\n\nBut with the BOJ raising rates at a time when cuts by central banks around the world finally gather pace, investors are changing tack.\n\n\"It's the rate of change (of interest rate differentials) that matters. And so if the BOJ are stepping up the pace of rate hikes relative to market pricing, and if the Fed is also becoming in play here, then the pressure on the carry trade increases,\" said James Malcolm, head of FX strategy at UBS.\n\nThe Federal Reserve holds its policy meeting later Wednesday. They are not expected to change interest rates, but could give support to current market pricing for a cut in September.\n\n\"Hedge funds are likely reassessing their strategies in light of these developments,\" said Tareck Horchani, head of prime brokerage dealing at Maybank Securities in Singapore.\n\n\"This shift could diminish the attractiveness of short yen positions, as the narrowing rate differential between the BOJ and other central banks, particularly the Fed which is expected to cut in September and December, makes the yen less appealing for carry trades.\"\n\nPACE AND VOLATILITY\n\nWhile it is difficult to gauge the exact amount of global positions in yen-funded carry trades, and hence the impact their unwinding could have on the currency, a lot of speculative positions are based on pure currency swaps between the yen and higher yielding currencies.\n\nThere are hundreds of billions of dollars worth of yen-funded short-term investments too.\n\nYen-funded carry trades in U.S. Treasuries, for example, yield nearly 6% - a mighty incentive for market participants that has so far been hard for Japan to counter. The BOJ's 15 basis points rate rise will only marginally erode the 'carry' on such trades.\n\nBut what could upend the trades and force liquidation is volatility.\n\n\"The carry trade works when volatility is low, but if that volatility goes up, people will unwind positions,\" said Yusuke Miyairi FX strategist at Nomura.\n\nThat is rising, and dollar/yen overnight implied volatility jumped to 27% on Wednesday, its highest level this year.\n\nIt is not just Wednesday's BOJ move that has jolted the yen, as the MOF's intervention earlier in July stopped the currency's slide. Remarks from Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump criticising Japan for the yen's weakness, and the changing Fed expectations were in the mix.\n\nThose factors have already seen carry trades get unwound, with knock on effects on currencies from Mexico to Switzerland.\n\nCFTC data shows speculators' bearish bets against the yen are 40% below April's near-seven year high, though at a still elevated $8.61 billion.\n\nAnd there is still scope for the yen's moves to get more dramatic.\n\n\"You can't discount the notion that we might have a single day move of five or seven or even like the historic extremes of 10 (yen) in a single day,\" said UBS' Malcolm.\n\n\"In 1998, we had two consecutive days of 10 (yen) moves in dollar/yen. That's what carry trade unwinds look like. That's what we've seen in the past and that's what the setup still looks like today.\"\n\nReporting by Alun John London and Tom Westbrook in Singapore, additional reporting by Vidya Ranganathan in Singapore and Harry Robertson in London; Editing by Toby Chopra\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles., opens new tab\n\nTom Westbrook\n\nThomson Reuters\n\nTom reports from Singapore on financial markets in Asia, filing daily market reports and deeper pieces on stock, bond and foreign exchange trade.

Japan's two-year bonds dropped, as did futures for the 10-year maturity, pointing to higher yields. Stocks opened lower.\n\nThe yen extended its advance slightly to 152.62 to the dollar at 9 a.m. in Tokyo, supported by comments from Japan's new currency chief, who said recent yen weakness had done more harm than good for the Japanese economy. Despite its July advance the yen is still down about 8% this year, the worst performance among Group-of-10 currencies.\n\nThe BOJ has flagged that it will likely announce a substantial cut in its bond purchases Wednesday, with market focus on the exact size and speed of the reductions, and the possibility of a rate hike.\n\nOvernight-indexed swaps, which have been volatile in recent days, priced in a 77% chance of a 15 basis points increase, down from 49% on last Wednesday. Public broadcaster NHK reported that board members will discuss raising interest rates to around 0.25% from the current range of 0 to 0.1%, citing unidentified people.\n\nIf the BOJ disappoints expectations for policy tightening, and the Fed later Wednesday does anything to damp the view that it will cut borrowing costs in September, the yen is vulnerable to a sharp drop.\n\nThat in turn could trigger Japanese authorities to intervene in the market to stem losses, as they are suspected to have done on four occasions already this year.\n\nAction will be taken \"if it's really needed, after comprehensively considering it from multiple angles,\" Atsushi Mimura, vice finance minister for international affairs, told Bloomberg in an interview. He referred to a Group-of-20 agreement that excessive volatility and disorderly currency movements can have a negative impact on economic and financial stability.\n\nThe currency's turnaround this month from a 38-year low of 161.95 against the dollar was helped along by Japan apparently stepping into the market. The gains accelerated amid an unwinding of global carry trades, and a huge pullback in bets against the yen by hedge funds.

Investors also offloaded derivative contracts worth about 1.01 trillion yen, marking the most significant weekly net selling since October 2023. As a result, Japan's Topix index experienced a sharp 5.64% drop, its steepest weekly decline since March 2020, and the Nikkei share average plummeted 5.98%. Adding to the turmoil, the yen surged to around 148.48 per dollar on Thursday - its strongest level since mid-March. This strengthening yen, coupled with a global tech stock sell-off, dampened investor confidence and raised fears about the profit outlook for Japanese exporters.\n\nWhile foreign investors diverted their attention from Japanese stocks, they found solace in long-term Japanese bonds, buying 1.2 billion yen worth after a substantial sell-off the previous week. On the flip side, short-term debt instruments faced heavy selling of 2.64 trillion yen. Japanese investors, meanwhile, sold 700.5 billion yen in long-term foreign bonds for the third week running but turned bullish on short-term instruments and overseas equities, buying 14.5 billion yen and 230.4 billion yen worth, respectively.\n\nThe bigger picture: Exporters under pressure.\n\nThe yen's appreciation and the tech stock sell-off combined to fuel fears over the profit outlook for Japanese exporters. A stronger yen makes Japanese goods more expensive abroad, potentially hurting export volumes.

Revenues climbed 12.2 percent to 11.8 trillion yen.\n\nThe world's largest automaker by sales also kept unchanged its full-year forecasts, predicting net profit of 3.57 trillion yen, marking a drop of 27.8 percent, on sales of 46 trillion yen, which would be a gain of 2.0 percent.\n\n\"Our operating income was 1.3 trillion yen despite a decrease in production and sales volume in Japan, due to the effects of foreign exchange rates and cost reduction efforts,\" Toyota said in a statement.\n\n\"Despite the inability to maintain stable production in Japan due to factors such as certification issues and recalls, we achieved an increase in profit, thanks to the support of all our stakeholders, including suppliers and dealers,\" it said.\n\nIn June, the government instructed five firms -- Toyota, Honda, Mazda, Suzuki and Yamaha -- to stop delivering certain vehicle models within Japan because of certification issues.\n\nThis week Toyota was also slapped with a correction order by the transport ministry over a failure to comply fully with national vehicle inspection standards.\n\nThat followed inspections in June by officials at its headquarters in the central Aichi region to probe breaches declared by the company related to domestic shipment certifications.\n\nToyota last year reported record bumper results, with net profit doubling to 4.94 trillion yen and revenues soaring by a fifth to 45.1 trillion yen, helped by strong sales of hybrid vehicles.\n\nThe company pioneered hybrid cars -- combining internal combustion engines and batteries -- with its popular Prius model.\n\nBut it has been criticised along with other Japanese automakers for being slow to embrace purely battery-powered vehicles, allowing firms like Tesla and China's BYD to steal a march and gain market share.\n\nHowever, there are signs consumers are going cold on pure EVs because of high prices and worries about reliability, range and a lack of charging points.\n\nToyota aims to sell 1.5 million pure EVs annually by 2026 and 3.5 million by 2030. Last year it sold 10.3 million vehicles.\n\nThe firm is also hoping to mass-produce solid-state batteries, a potential game-changing technological breakthrough that could mean faster charging times and greater range.\n\nIts rivals Honda and Nissan announced in March that they are exploring a \"strategic partnership\" in EVs in a bid to catch up with competitors.\n\nThe scope for possible cooperation includes EV software and joint procurement of parts, the companies said.\n\nThe two firms were due to hold a news conference later Thursday, with reports saying they will announce a basic agreement to form the alliance.\n\nMedia reports reported that Mitsubishi was also in talks to join the tie-up.\n\nnf-stu/dan\n\nMore from this section\n\nRestrictive Policies Contribute to

The amount was largely in line with earlier estimates based on the Bank of Japan's accounts and money broker forecasts.\n\nThe July intervention followed similar actions in April and May, underscoring the government's commitment to keeping speculators on the back foot. The latest action appears to have helped reverse the tide on the yen's weakness, helped in part by heightened speculation that the gaping rate differential between Japan and the US will begin to narrow.\n\nThe yen was little changed against the dollar following the data release, after it had gained 1.7% over the course of the day.\n\nDuring the reporting period, the yen experienced two notable gains. The first move came on the evening of July 12 after the release of weaker-than-expected US inflation data, when the currency appreciated sharply against the dollar from 161.58 to 157.44. The second action likely followed on the next business day, when the yen gained by as much as 0.9%.\n\nEarlier estimates comparing the BOJ's current accounts data's final version with money broker forecasts suggested that Japan had likely spent around \u00a53 trillion and \u00a52 trillion on these operations, respectively. Those projections can vary from the actual amount that's eventually confirmed by finance ministry data.\n\nWednesday's intervention data came hours after the BOJ's decision to hike rates again and unveil slightly faster than expected bond purchase cuts. The central bank raised its policy rate to around 0.25% from a range of 0 to 0.1%, and also unveiled plans to halve its bond purchases by the first quarter of 2026. After Governor Kazuo Ueda's press conference, where he didn't rule out additional rate increases, the yen strengthened further.\n\nAtsushi Mimura, who succeeded Masato Kanda as the country's top currency chief Wednesday, told Bloomberg on Monday that intervention remains a method to counter speculation. He also said the demerits of the recent weak yen are becoming more noticeable on balance, given the impact of higher import costs on households and small businesses.\n\nFollowing the suspected interventions in July, Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki and Kanda declined to comment on whether they had stepped into the market, maintaining their strategy of keeping investors guessing. Mimura appeared to suggest he may continue with that stance.\n\nFurther details of this month's market actions, including daily amounts and the specific markets the government entered, will be released in November. Separately, foreign reserves data due next week will provide clues on whether the government sold treasuries or used deposits to fund the yen-buying operation.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Governor Kazuo Ueda, furthermore, did not rule out another hike this year and stressed the bank's readiness to keep raising borrowing costs to levels deemed neutral to the economy.\n\nThe dollar dropped 1.7% against the Japanese currency to 150.2 yen after the BOJ's move and is now over 10 yen lower than its early July level of 161.9.\n\nThat July level was the Japanese currency's weakest since 1986. The yen came under heavy pressure as benign market conditions and a wide gap between borrowing costs in Japan and those elsewhere meant it was a popular choice as a funding currency for carry trades.\n\nThese see investors borrow in a currency where interest rates are low - the yen has been popular - and then swap them for another currency in which they can invest in higher yielding assets.\n\nThey had been very popular with investors earlier in the year as global rate cuts that had been expected early in 2024 got pushed back, and currency prices were stable - sudden swings in price can wipe out gains from yield differentials.\n\nBut with the BOJ raising rates at a time when cuts by central banks around the world finally gather pace, investors are changing tack.\n\n\"It's the rate of change (of interest rate differentials) that matters. And so if the BOJ are stepping up the pace of rate hikes relative to market pricing, and if the Fed is also becoming in play here, then the pressure on the carry trade increases,\" said James Malcolm, head of FX strategy at UBS.\n\nThe Federal Reserve held interest rates steady on Wednesday but opened the door to reducing borrowing costs as soon as its next meeting in September as inflation continues coming into line with the U.S. central bank's 2% target.\n\n\"Hedge funds are likely reassessing their strategies in light of these developments,\" said Tareck Horchani, head of prime brokerage dealing at Maybank Securities in Singapore.\n\n\"This shift could diminish the attractiveness of short yen positions, as the narrowing rate differential between the BOJ and other central banks, particularly the Fed which is expected to cut in September and December, makes the yen less appealing for carry trades.\"\n\nPACE AND VOLATILITY\n\nWhile it is difficult to gauge the exact amount of global positions in yen-funded carry trades, and hence the impact their unwinding could have on the currency, a lot of speculative positions are based on pure currency swaps between the yen and higher yielding currencies.\n\nThere are hundreds of billions of dollars worth of yen-funded short-term investments too.\n\nYen-funded carry trades in U.S. Treasuries, for example, yield nearly 6% - a mighty incentive for market participants that has so far been hard for Japan to counter. The BOJ's 15 basis points rate rise will only marginally erode the 'carry' on such trades.\n\nBut what could upend the trades and force liquidation is volatility.\n\n\"The carry trade works when volatility is low, but if that volatility goes up, people will unwind positions,\" said Yusuke Miyairi FX strategist at Nomura.\n\nThat is rising, and dollar/yen overnight implied volatility jumped to 27% on Wednesday, its highest level this year.\n\nIt is not just Wednesday's BOJ move that has jolted the yen, as the MOF's intervention earlier in July stopped the currency's slide. Remarks from Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump criticising Japan for the yen's weakness, and the changing Fed expectations were in the mix.\n\nThose factors have already seen carry trades get unwound, with knock on effects on currencies from Mexico to Switzerland.\n\nCFTC data shows speculators' bearish bets against the yen are 40% below April's near-seven year high, though at a still elevated $8.61 billion.\n\nAnd there is still scope for the yen's moves to get more dramatic.\n\n\"You can't discount the notion that we might have a single day move of five or seven or even like the historic extremes of 10 (yen) in a single day,\" said UBS' Malcolm.\n\n\"In 1998, we had two consecutive days of 10 (yen) moves in dollar/yen. That's what carry trade unwinds look like. That's what we've seen in the past and that's what the setup still looks like today.\"\n\n(Reporting by Alun John London and Tom Westbrook in Singapore; Additional reporting by Vidya Ranganathan in

The fall comes as fewer passengers travelled on domestic routes in April and May compared with the year prior.\n\nThe company kept its projection for full-year profit unchanged at 170 billion yen, which is lower than the market consensus of 190 billion yen, as demand from international travellers remained robust, and a weak yen contributed to higher yields, especially on North American routes.\n\n\"A rise in oil and engine maintenance cost, as well as aggressive investment for human resource weighed on the first quarter earnings,\" chief financial officer Kimihiro Nakahori at a press conference on Tuesday (Jul 30).\n\nThe weak yen exacerbated the airline's fuel expenses as the price of oil rose versus the same period last year. A company-wide wage hike in March and a hiring spree also contributed to high costs.\n\nWhile domestic demand remains weak, ANA saw a 16 per cent rise in passengers on international routes on strong demand for travel to Japan and outbound itineraries showed signs of recovering, the company said. The airline plans to start three new European routes from Haneda to Milan, Stockholm and Istanbul this winter, underscoring the boom in demand for travel to Japan.\n\nThe planned 30 per cent increase in operations on European routes will help ANA achieve its full-year profit target, the company said in a statement.\n\nThe yen has plummeted in value against the US dollar since the beginning of the year before strengthening again over recent weeks, adding to the risks the airline faces. In April, chief executive officer Koji Shibata said 125 yen to the dollar would be an ideal rate for the airline.\n\nOn Tuesday, the yen fell as much as 0.8 per cent to 155.22 yen per dollar as traders weigh the risk of the Bank of Japan adding a rate hike to an expected reduction in bond purchases this week.\n\nOn the yen's recent fluctuations, Nakahori remained largely unperturbed Tuesday. \"We have hedged yen's moves for near-term earnings, and so it is unlikely to have much effect,\" he said.

Despite its July advance the yen is still down about 8% this year, the worst performance among Group-of-10 currencies.\n\nThe BOJ has flagged that it will likely announce a substantial cut in its bond purchases Wednesday, with market focus on the exact size and speed of the reductions, and the possibility of a rate hike.\n\nOvernight-indexed swaps priced in a 37% chance of a 15 basis points increase, down from 49% on last Wednesday.\n\nIf the BOJ disappoints expectations for policy tightening, and the Fed later Wednesday does anything to damp the view that it will cut borrowing costs in September, the yen is vulnerable to a sharp drop.\n\nThat in turn could trigger Japanese authorities to intervene in the market to stem losses, as they are suspected to have done on four occasions already this year.\n\nAction will be taken \"if it's really needed, after comprehensively considering it from multiple angles,\" Atsushi Mimura, vice finance minister for international affairs, told Bloomberg in an interview.

Revenues climbed 12.2 percent to 11.8 trillion yen.\n\nThe world's largest automaker by sales also stuck to its full-year forecasts, predicting net profit of 3.57 trillion yen, marking a drop of 27.8 percent, on sales of 46 trillion yen, which would be a gain of 2.0 percent.\n\nToyota said the rise in profit was \"despite a decrease in production and sales volume in Japan, due to the effects of foreign exchange rates and cost reduction efforts\".\n\n\"Despite the inability to maintain stable production in Japan due to factors such as certification issues and recalls, we achieved an increase in profit, thanks to the support of all our stakeholders, including suppliers and dealers,\" a statement said.\n\nIn June, the government instructed five firms -- Toyota, Honda, Mazda, Suzuki and Yamaha -- to stop delivering certain vehicle models within Japan because of certification issues.\n\nThis week Toyota was also slapped with a correction order by the transport ministry over a failure to comply fully with national vehicle inspection standards.\n\nThat followed inspections in June by officials at its headquarters in the central Aichi region to probe breaches declared by the company related to domestic shipment certifications.\n\nToyota last year reported record bumper results, with net profit doubling to 4.94 trillion yen and revenues soaring by a fifth to 45.1 trillion yen.\n\nThe results were driven by strong sales of hybrid vehicles -- which combine internal combustion engines and batteries -- an area that Toyota pioneered with the Prius.\n\n- Electric challenge -\n\nBut it has been criticised along with other Japanese automakers for being slow to embrace purely battery-powered vehicles, allowing firms like Tesla and China's BYD to steal a march and gain market share.\n\nHowever, there are signs consumers are going cold on pure EVs because of high prices and worries about reliability, range and a lack of charging points.\n\nThe firm is also hoping to mass-produce solid-state batteries, a potential game-changing technological breakthrough that could mean faster charging times and greater range.\n\nOn Thursday Toyota's rivals Honda and Nissan said that they would cooperate on research in batteries for EVs and other areas.\n\nThe news follows an announcement in March that they were exploring a \"strategic alliance\" to join forces to cope with a \"once-in-a-century\" upheaval in the car industry.\n\nJapan's number two and three automaker also confirmed in a statement that Mitsubishi was considering teaming up with them.\n\n\"The partnership was initiated when the top management of both companies recognised that the global automotive industry is undergoing dynamic structural changes due to technological innovations in intelligence and electrification, and that companies that cannot cope with these changes will be eliminated,\" Honda CEO Toshihiro Mibe told a news conference.\n\n\"The Japanese auto industry, like many others globally, is facing unprecedented challenges. These challenges include the rapid transition to electric vehicles, stringent environmental regulations, and intense competition from both established foreign carmakers and new entrants, particularly from China and the US,\" Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Tatsuo Yoshida told AFP.\n\n\"While alliances can provide significant benefits, the success of such collaborations will depend on effective integration and execution,\" he said.\n\nmac-nf-stu/dan", "source": {"uri": "wfxg.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WFXG FOX54"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The Bank of Japan announced significant new steps on its slow and not entirely steady path to monetary normalization in an effort to shore up the yen.\n\nThe Japanese central bank raised its target short-term interest rate to 0.25% from 0.1%. It will also taper purchases of government bonds under its quantitative easing program, although very gradually. The pace of new purchases will fall to \u00a53 trillion (around $20 billion) per month by early 2026 from \u00a56 trillion a month now. No one can accuse Governor Kazuo Ueda of moving with undo haste.\n\nMore unusual is why Mr. Ueda said he's taking these steps: the yen. Japan's currency has lost significant value in recent months, falling to about \u00a5162 per dollar in mid-July before a series of government interventions pulled it up to about \u00a5154. A major cause of this weakness is the yawning gap between interest rates in the U.S. and Japan.\n\nMr. Ueda on Wednesday referred to the weak yen as \"an important risk\" and cited it as \"one of the reasons for the policy decision.\" Officials and politicians are concerned that a weak yen is fueling import-price inflation that's weighing on consumer spending.\n\nFrom this perspective, Wednesday's policy change worked as the yen soared to near \u00a5150. This rise may prove more durable than some recent episodes of modest strengthening because, unlike occasional government interventions to buy yen in the exchange market, Mr. Ueda has altered the relative interest rates that influence investors' behavior.\n\nThis makes Mr. Ueda the only major-economy central banker to admit to being at all concerned about exchange rates. Washington in particular might note Tokyo's unease about a weaker yen, after a recent U.S. Treasury report added Japan to a \"monitoring list\" for possible exchange manipulation. Since Donald Trump's views of trade are trapped in the 1980s, or perhaps the 1920s, a second Trump Administration would pick up the theme.\n\nUnfortunately for Mr. Ueda, the yen isn't his only concern. One reason to move slowly in tapering Japan's quantitative easing is that other buyers will have to be found for Japanese government bonds, of which the BOJ currently holds about half the outstanding issuance. Tokyo reportedly is lining up brokers to market more of the bonds to global investors.\n\nOne unknown is whether or how such capital inflows -- coupled with a slowing or reversal of Japan's famous outbound carry trade as domestic rates rise -- will affect the yen or other financial markets such as the U.S. Another unknown is how a Japanese economy marked by zombie companies and other legacies of ultracheap money will adapt to slightly higher rates.\n\nMr. Ueda appears to hope he can manage urgent exchange-rate risks while moving slowly enough on policy normalization to avoid exacerbating these other problems.

Traders are guessing the majority of such bets have now been cleared from the market, with a new focus on how much further the BoJ's rate-raising cycle might run.\n\nThe yen was boosted by the surprise nature of the BoJ's rate increase and is now being driven by a shift in market perception about the way the BoJ is setting its monetary policy, said Bank of Singapore's chief economist Mansoor Mohi-uddin. \"You have now got uncertainty in the market about the BoJ's reaction function and about the pace of future rate hikes,\" he said.\n\nThe yen's rally, which began in mid-July and was partly propelled by a bout of government intervention, is now driven by expectations that Japan's central bank has begun a process that could produce at least two more rate increases over the next 12 months, even as the US Federal Reserve looks primed to begin cutting.\n\nJapanese stocks, as measured by the broad Topix index, fell as much as 3.6 per cent on Thursday. Many of the hardest-hit companies were carmakers and other manufacturers whose earnings are mechanically boosted by yen weakness.\n\nBut some of the fiercest selling was directed at Japan's big property stocks, which have thrived during the country's long era of ultra-loose monetary policy but now face a different environment. Shares in Mitsui Fudosan and Mitsubishi Estate fell 8 and 9 per cent, respectively.\n\nBeyond the turmoil created by the strengthening yen and rising rates, Japan's largest company, Toyota, disappointed the market when it released April-June results on Thursday without an expected upgrade to its earnings forecast. Its shares are down more than 8 per cent after the company reported.\n\n\"A lot of people were not expecting that Bank of Japan hike on Wednesday and all the crowded trades suddenly looked exposed,\" said one broker at a Japanese investment bank, adding that the disappointing Toyota results and the yen's sharp rise had been taken as a trigger for selling a wide range of stocks.\n\nShares in Isetan Mitsukoshi, Japan's biggest department store chain and a huge beneficiary of foreign tourists exploiting the weak yen, fell by more than 10 per cent. Shares in the bread maker Yamazaki Baking, which had been a darling of investors looking for exposure to rising food prices, dropped more than 18 per cent.\n\n\"There was just nowhere for investors to hide today,\" said the broker.\n\nAkira Otani, senior Japan economic research adviser at Goldman Sachs, said the central questions for investors attempting to judge future BoJ moves would be whether wage growth accelerated over the summer and whether this would be firmly passed on to services prices.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japanese yen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Toyota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Short (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Japan", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panasonic", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Panasonic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hedge fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOPIX", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TOPIX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_prices", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Food prices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamazaki_Baking", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yamazaki Baking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsui_Fudosan", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mitsui Fudosan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsukoshi", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mitsukoshi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsubishi_Estate", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mitsubishi Estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isetan", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Isetan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Department store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_banking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Investment banking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goldman Sachs"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Investment_Banks", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Investment Banks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2F__origami%2Fservice%2Fimage%2Fv2%2Fimages%2Fraw%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%252Fproduction%252F8b9bd983-09bc-45bc-9dfc-68910f4eb214.jpg%3Fsource%3Dnext-article%26fit%3Dscale-down%26quality%3Dhighest%26width%3D700%26dpr%3D1?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778128", "eventUri": "eng-9778128", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

Luxury goods companies like Louis Vuitton parent LVMH would rather they stayed home and shopped.\n\nThe yen's sell-off - it hit a 38-year low against the dollar last month before recovering ground - has sparked an unprecedented tourist boom, drawing savvy shoppers from Asia and elsewhere.\n\nGlobal luxury brands aren't cheering, because their goods, ranging from designer sneakers to whisky, now tend to be cheaper in dollar terms in Japan than elsewhere, denting profits.\n\nSome tourists, especially Chinese, are holding off on buying designer goods at home and splurging in Japan. The yen's volatility means companies can't easily hike prices to accurately reflect the currency, leaving them stuck with lower margins in Japan - at least while the yen stays weak.\n\nZhang Lei, a 29-year-old DJ from the southern province of Hunan, was visiting Japan for the first time but said he already wanted to come again.\n\n\"It's cheaper,\" said Zhang, who carried two Louis Vuitton shopping bags and one from sportswear brand Onitsuka Tiger on a recent Saturday in Tokyo's high-end Ginza district.\n\nNearby, some 15 people queued up to enter the Louis Vuitton boutique, fanning themselves in the sweltering heat.\n\nZhang said his purchases so far included shoes and a bag. He planned to pick up a watch next, he said, pointing to his wrist as he repeated \"Rolex\".\n\nThe trend has taken French luxury giant LVMH, which also owns Dior and Fendi, by surprise.\n\n\"We really have a big shift of business from Asia into Japan,\" Chief Financial Officer Jean-Jacques Guiony told a recent earnings call. It was having a \"deflationary\" impact on LVMH's China business as customers held off on shopping at home, putting significant pressure on margins, he said.\n\nHe also mentioned the difficulty posed by currency volatility, as currencies can undo moves \"pretty quickly\". That was put in sharp relief this week as the yen surged after the Bank of Japan raised interest rates on Wednesday.\n\nDIOR, CHANEL, MOUNT FUJI\n\nLouis Vuitton's popular Alma BB handbag goes for 14,800 yuan in China, the equivalent of $2,050. In Japan it sells for 279,400 yen, or $1,875. Last month it would have been available for as low as $1,725 when the yen was at its weakest.\n\nThe yen would have to strengthen to around 136 to the dollar to put the bag's Japanese price at parity with China. The currency was at 149.30 on Thursday, not far off its strongest in 4-1/2 months.\n\nChinese tourists were also helping fuel Japanese sales of luxury spirits, drinks maker Remy Cointreau said.\n\nJapan generated strong sales growth, boosted by tourism and the weak yen, Remy Cointreau CFO Luca Marotta said on the company's first-quarter sales call, adding the sales were lower margin.\n\nSwiss luxury group Richemont, which owns the Cartier brand, saw Japan sales increase almost 60% in the first quarter, helped by Chinese, Southeast Asian and American tourists, it said.\n\n\"Shopping, shopping, shopping,\" said Fumiko Annisa, who was visiting from Indonesia, about her itinerary.\n\n\"High-end brands are cheap here,\" she said. \"We are going to buy Dior but we are going to Chanel first.\"\n\nShe also planned to visit the western city of Osaka and Gotemba near Mount Fuji, home to a sprawling outlet mall that sells brands from outdoor clothing maker Arc'teryx to Italian fashion house Zegna.\n\nJapan had a record 3.1 million foreign visitors in June, official data showed last month, putting it on track to beat an annual record of almost 32 million foreign arrivals set in 2019, before the pandemic brought global travel to a standstill.\n\nSpending by tourists is expected to reach 8 trillion yen ($54.74 billion) this year, according to the government, which sees tourism as a rare growth driver in an economy long hobbled by an ageing population.\n\nNew Yorker Yadwinder Singh said he hadn't expected to do much shopping until he saw prices in fast-fashion retailer Zara and other stores that were much cheaper than at home.", "source": {"uri": "investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He flagged the impact of rising energy and food prices on consumers and importers among the drawbacks of the feeble yen.\n\nMimura takes up his role Wednesday, following Masato Kanda's three-year stewardship of the nation's currency policy. Kanda oversaw government action to support the yen for the first time in around a quarter century, as a yawning gap between US and Japanese interest rates pushed the currency down to multi-decade lows against the dollar.\n\nHe starts his position ahead of a closely watched Bank of Japan meeting that may prompt further movements in the yen. The currency has regained some ground since Tokyo's most recent suspected intervention at the beginning of this month, with expectations for a possible interest rate hike at the meeting among the factors.\n\nAction will be taken \"if it's really needed, after comprehensively considering it from multiple angles,\" Mimura said. He referred to a Group of 20 agreement that excessive volatility and disorderly currency movements can have a negative impact on economic and financial stability. The nations reaffirmed their currency policy pledge last week when they met in Brazil.\n\nMimura also hinted he may continue his predecessor's strategy of keeping investors guessing over when Japan has stepped into markets to prop up the yen.\n\nJapan said it spent a record \u00a59.8 trillion ($63 billion) in the reporting month of May on currency intervention, about a month after two suspected moves. Since then Tokyo is believed to have stepped into the market another two times, with official disclosure of the amount spent expected later Wednesday after weeks of no comment.\n\n\"Predictability is important in some cases, while in others it makes sense to be unpredictable,\" Mimura said.\n\nMuch in the way that communication \"isn't pre-set among family, friends and colleagues,\" talking to the market is \"something you think about in that specific situation. Ultimately that's it,\" he said.\n\nThough primarily known as the top currency officer, Mimura's role is also responsible for overseeing a range of international operations within the ministry. Mimura said he hopes to strengthen communication across bureaus, including the finance bureau, which is tasked with promoting the sale of the government bonds to foreign investors.\n\nThe BOJ will announce a plan to reduce its bond purchases at Wednesday's meeting. Given that the central bank now holds more than 50% of JGBs issued, the government needs to find other buyers who could fill the gap. Last month, the ministry said foreign investors could be among the candidates.\n\nMimura also said international cooperation, development policies and economic security are three key issues for his role. While high-level gatherings including the Group of 20 have faced increasing difficulty in reaching agreements, Mimura said the meetings themselves still hold significance.\n\n\"International cooperation is not only about sharing ideas and getting along,\" said Mimura. \"It is also meaningful to get together and discuss each other's positions, including countries with different ways of thinking, and it is very important to have a channel to share views.\"\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Luxury goods companies like Louis Vuitton parent LVMH would rather they stayed home and shopped.\n\nThe yen's sell-off - it hit a 38-year low against the dollar in July before recovering ground - has sparked an unprecedented tourist boom, drawing savvy shoppers from Asia and elsewhere.\n\nGlobal luxury brands aren't cheering, because their goods, ranging from designer sneakers to whisky, now tend to be cheaper in dollar terms in Japan than elsewhere, denting profits.\n\nSome tourists, especially Chinese, are holding off on buying designer goods at home and splurging in Japan. The yen's volatility means companies can't easily hike prices to accurately reflect the currency, leaving them stuck with lower margins in Japan - at least while the yen stays weak.\n\nMr Zhang Lei, a 29-year-old DJ from the southern province of Hunan, was visiting Japan for the first time but said he already wanted to come again.\n\n\"It's cheaper,\" said Mr Zhang, who carried two Louis Vuitton shopping bags and one from sportswear brand Onitsuka Tiger on a recent Saturday in Tokyo's high-end Ginza district.\n\nNearby, some 15 people queued up to enter the Louis Vuitton boutique, fanning themselves in the sweltering heat.\n\nMr Zhang said his purchases so far included shoes and a bag. He planned to pick up a watch next, he said, pointing to his wrist as he repeated \"Rolex\".\n\nThe trend has taken French luxury giant LVMH, which also owns Dior and Fendi, by surprise.\n\n\"We really have a big shift of business from Asia into Japan,\" Chief Financial Officer Jean-Jacques Guiony told a recent earnings call. It was having a \"deflationary\" impact on LVMH's China business as customers held off on shopping at home, putting significant pressure on margins, he said.\n\nHe also mentioned the difficulty posed by currency volatility, as currencies can undo moves \"pretty quickly\". That was put in sharp relief this week as the yen surged after the Bank of Japan raised interest rates on July 31.\n\nLouis Vuitton's popular Alma BB handbag goes for 14,800 yuan (S$2,735) in China. In Japan it sells for 279,400 yen (S$2,490).\n\nThe yen would have to strengthen to around 136 to the dollar to put the bag's Japanese price at parity with China. The currency was at 149.30 on Aug 1, not far off its strongest in 4\u00bd months.", "source": {"uri": "straitstimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Straits Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxury_goods", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luxury goods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LVMH", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LVMH"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Vuitton", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Louis Vuitton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Japanese yen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sneakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whisky", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Whisky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handbag", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Handbag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Province"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boutique", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boutique"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginza", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ginza"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ginza"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hunan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hunan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dior", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dior"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fendi", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fendi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolex", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rolex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Singapore dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Japan", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renminbi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Renminbi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Ethnic_and_Regional/Asian", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Ethnic and Regional/Asian", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Ethnographic", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Ethnographic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/styles/large30x20/public/articles/2024/08/01/2024-08-01T045851Z326659425RC2S39AR7TMVRTRMADP3JAPAN-LUXURY-CURRENCY.JPG?VersionId=qjtLtD.sccGYl48k6ah6FNn8SuosGCZ1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778128", "eventUri": "eng-9778128", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 2083, "textEnd": 2090}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-01", "textStart": 2365, "textEnd": 2370}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 108, "relevance": 1}

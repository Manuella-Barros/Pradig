But it's unclear if it's working. Several drug users who have been arrested for using fentanyl out in the city streets have gone on record to say that their detainment hasn\u2019t spurred them to kick their habit or seek treatment. The San Francisco Chronicle spoke to several users who were arrested for doing drugs in public under the city\u2019s new aggressive drug enforcement policies, who say it hasn\u2019t been enough of a reckoning to inspire them to get sober. \"I\u2019m not ready. It would just be a waste of time,\" 31-year-old Kenneth McCurry told the outlet about the idea of going to rehab after being in jail for two and-a-half weeks. SAN FRANCISCO RESIDENTS FURIOUS OVER PROGRAM GIVING FREE ALCOHOL TO HOMELESS: 'THAT'S SOME BULL' McCurry was arrested in April for \"riding a scooter on the sidewalk and into United Nations Plaza. Officers said they then noticed a black plastic bag on the scooter \u2018full of suspected narcotics in plain view,\u2019 The Chronicle reported, citing court records. Upon his release, McCurry \u2013 who said he had been using illegal drugs since he was 15 \u2013 said he went right back to using the minute he got out of jail. According to the Chronicle, 33-year-old Jandre Blakely was arrested late last year for being under the influence of fentanyl. Having used it while living on the city streets for six years, he told the outlet that his arrest hasn\u2019t spurred him to get clean either, saying, \"Honestly it\u2019s really hard (to get sober or go to a treatment program), because you can\u2019t just swerve on the drop of a dime.\" \"I think what would be better is making sure people get shelter first,\" he recommended. A 34-year-old homeless user named Ashley Hauntly and five of her homeless friends were \"cited and released on misdemeanor drug charges near Mission and Eighth streets\" last month, the Chronicle stated. The outlet detailed cite and release as \"a law enforcement procedure that involves writing a ticket for minor criminal offenses and issuing a notice to appear in court.\" Hauntly told the paper that though getting the ticket made her want to stop using out in public, her lack of housing prompted her to continue smoking fentanyl on San Francisco streets. She told the paper that her and her boyfriend are most focused on \"trying to get housing,\" adding, \"For treatment, it would depend on what it is, because we can\u2019t split up.\" REP. SCHIFF REPORTEDLY ROBBED IN SAN FRANCISCO, FORCED TO ATTEND RITZY CAMPAIGN DINNER WITH NO SUIT TO WEAR These examples represent the city\u2019s ongoing struggles to get drug addicts into treatment. As the outlet noted, Mayor London Breed pushed for law enforcement to take a more \"aggressive\" approach and arrest users and dealers around the city, hoping this would both get offenders off the street and get them to seek help. Because of this plan, police have arrested 1,300 suspected drug users and more than 1,000 suspected dealers in the last year. However, a tiny fraction of these detainees have actually sought out substance abuse treatment on their own following their arrests. At the very least, the mayor\u2019s office has stated that the more aggressive enforcement plan has \"helped to curb illegal activities and improve deteriorating downtown street conditions,\" the outlet noted. Breed\u2019s spokesperson, Jeff Cretan, told the Chronicle that even if detainees don\u2019t go for treatment immediately after their arrests, it \"doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t accept or seek help through numerous other interventions afterwards.\" Breed has sought other initiatives to curb drug use in her city. She unveiled a plan last September to require anyone receiving welfare to comply with mandatory drug testing and treatment programs amid growing pressure to get ahold of the city\u2019s homeless and fentanyl crises. San Francisco voters passed a pair of law-and-order ballot measures proposed by Breed in March that enacted tougher crackdown on drug users and other crime in the city, including one proposal to increase police surveillance powers and the other to enforce her welfare drug screening plan. Breed\u2019s office did not reply to Fox News Digital\u2019s request for comment. Neither did the San Francisco Police Department.

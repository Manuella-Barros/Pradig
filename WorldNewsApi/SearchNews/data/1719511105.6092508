Tim Scott insists Donald Trump is gaining popularity! Trump\u2019s critical reception at the Libertarian Convention this weekend isn\u2019t deterring the senator from rosily insisting that while you may have heard jeers, there was a \u201cwave of red hats\u201d in the crowd. \u201cI saw a wave of red hats at the Libertarian convention,\u201d Scott told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on State of the Union Sunday. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s popularity continues to increase.\u201d Scott\u2019s sunny assessment of the reception the former president received doesn\u2019t line up with the reality that Libertarians loudly objected to nearly every line of Trump\u2019s speech that usually draws applause from the former president\u2019s supporters. \u201cCombine with us in a partnership,\u201d Trump told the convention. \u201cWe\u2019re asking that of the Libertarians. We must work together. Combine with us. You have to combine with us.\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d the crowd replied. \u201cHe\u2019s not just going to the Libertarian Convention,\u201d Scott said of Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s also doing rallies in Bronx. He\u2019s doing something, what I consider a 50-state strategy.\u201d \u201cSo I give him a lot of credit and going to places where Republicans have not gone before. If we\u2019re going to win this election cycle, we must go where we\u2019re not invited,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd to see the former president take that seriously is, in my opinion, a strong sign and one of the reasons why, Dana, we are seeing the poll numbers moving in his direction.\u201d But as The New York Times pointed out yesterday, Trump\u2019s lead in the polls is largely based on support from voters who are unreliable and disengaged, making his lead quite vulnerable. Among voters who cast a ballot in the 2020 election, Biden has come out in the lead across the last three national polls conducted by the Times and Sienna College. We are also more than five months away from the general election, so polls at this point in time don\u2019t carry a whole lot of weight. Scott is on the short list of contenders to be Trump\u2019s running mate, and he has attempted to curry favor with the former president across multiple media appearances. Earlier this month, Scott refused to say whether he would accept the results of the 2024 election. \u201cI expect President Trump to win the next election and, listen, I\u2019m not going to answer your hypothetical question,\u201d he told NBC host Kristen Welker when she pressed him on whether he would commit to accepting the election results. Scott suspended his own presidential campaign this past November after a disappointing primary performance.", "summary": "\"I saw a wave of red hats at the Libertarian convention,\" the senator claimed. \"Donald Trump's popularity continues to increase\"", "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/tim-scott-trump-gaining-popularity-libertarians-boo-1235028107/", "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1918187629.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 15:01:01", "author": "Peter Wade", "authors": ["Peter Wade"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.378}

{"id": 243310796, "title": "The New Waltham foot - mystery of severed limb five years on", "text": "One of the longest running mysteries in North East Lincolnshire continues to baffle detectives and leave residents in the dark. Over five years ago a severed human foot was spotted by dog walkers on a path off Louth Road which links to Station Road, New Waltham. It was discovered in the early hours of April 25, 2019 and shortly before children would have been using the path to go to school. There was a widespread search of the area by police, involving dogs and an underwater search team. Teams of officers spent days systematically walking through fields. READ MORE: Forensic teams examined the foot and successfully concluded it belonged to a young female, possibly in her late teens, who was 5ft 2in tall. Their main conclusion was that the foot had been deliberately severed and could have been as a result of a medical procedure. Extensive searches of medical records at Diana, Princess of Wales Hospital failed to throw light on the mystery limb. At the time, residents voiced concerns about finding other body parts, with one woman telling Grimsby Live she feared going out to her wheelie bin in case of finding further human remains which had been dumped. One of the dog walkers who found the limb and foot said: \"We were shocked but also relieved it was us that found it because the footpath is used by a lot of children going to school. \"Another hour and a child might have found it. So I am glad it happened when it did.\" Police cordoned off the path for a number of days. Specially-trained sniffer dogs were drafted in to comb the pathways and fields in new Waltham. Children took alternative routes to and from school using main roads rather than short pathways, as parents were worried the mystery amputation was one of several dumped in the area. One popular theory was that an animal had discovered the foot while digging and dragged it for some distance. Another focussed on recent house building in the village, which may have disturbed an unknown burial ground. Speculation increased over a possible remnant from a medical student's homework which involved a body part taken from a medical institution and was later discarded. Initially police said the foot had been recently dismembered. But further forensic pathology was carried out and officers are continuing to look at evidence that the foot maybe considerably older and may have originated in a churchyard. DNA analysis was undertaken to see if the unique genetic code matched that of anyone who was registered missing. The pain-staking work carried out by Humberside Police detectives spanned, not just the Lincolnshire, Humberside and Yorkshire areas, but also nationally and internationally. Chairman of New Waltham Parish Council, Councillor Dinsdale Shaw said: \"It pops up on social media now and again and gets people talking again. Someone asked me last week if they had found another foot to make the pair. It has become a bit of a joke. I'm not sure if it is anything sinister or medical waste. But it is the biggest mystery to hit New Waltham.\" With nearly 30 years of service on New Waltham Parish Council, Councillor Roger Breed said he had never heard of such a bizarre incident in his home village. \"It has never been brought to a conclusion. Everyone thinks it must have been resolved. They probably think it has died a death,\" he said. He added: \"There was so much speculation at the time that it was a medical student who had nicked it and left it behind when they moved out or a body part from the hospital that had been disposed of.\" The New Waltham councillor said: \"There were jokes about people going around with one foot and asking if it was theirs. It is strange how a story like that disappears.\" Humberside Police Detective Superintendent Alan Curtis, Senior Investigating Officer in the case, said: \u201cAn investigation was launched after a human foot was found on a footpath in New Waltham, North East Lincolnshire in April 2019. \u201cOver the past five years extensive investigations have been carried out into missing people (locally, nationally and internationally), comprehensive forensic testing and DNA analysis, yet still no match has been found that would help us provide a positive identification. \u201cEnquiries are continuing to try to identify the identity of the individual and to determine how the body part came to be on the path. I encourage anyone with any information that may assist our enquiries to please get in touch by calling our non-emergency number 101 quoting log 85 of 25 April 2019.\u201d", "summary": "The woman's foot was found on a footpath by dog walkers in April 2019", "url": "https://www.grimsbytelegraph.co.uk/news/grimsby-news/new-waltham-foot-mystery-severed-9367470", "image": "https://i2-prod.grimsbytelegraph.co.uk/news/article2799431.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_WhatsApp-Image-2019-04-26-at-093039jpeg.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 04:00:00", "author": "Peter Craig", "authors": ["Peter Craig"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.447}

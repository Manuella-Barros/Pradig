{"id": 223687634, "title": "Kate Martin Says It Was 'Weird' Facing Caitlin Clark in Fever vs. Aces WNBA Matchup", "text": "Las Vegas Aces rookie Kate Martin admitted it was \"weird\" to be on the opposite side of former Iowa teammate Caitlin Clark on Saturday night. Martin's Aces improved to 3-1 with a 99-80 win over Clark and the Indiana Fever. After the game, she said it was \"obviously different\" to see Clark on an opposing team, but it's also \"really fun\" because they're \"both living out our dream right now.\" Martin came off the bench to finish with 12 points and seven rebounds in 22 minutes. Clark, meanwhile, had the worst game of her rookie year so far. She scored eight points on 2-of-8 shooting, adding five rebounds and seven assists. Indiana led by four points after the first quarter, but the Aces turned the tables by outscoring the Fever 22-10 in the second quarter. The two-time reigning champions didn't look back from there. It was an Iowa-centric affair. Martin and Clark were teammates for four years on the Hawkeyes. Lisa Bluder, their former head coach, was in attendance at Michelob Ultra Arena in Las Vegas, as was her successor, Jan Jensen. The Aces also have Megan Gustafson, arguably the greatest player in program history before Clark arrived. The Aces and Fever have three head-to-head meetings left on the schedule, the next of which is July 2 in Vegas.", "summary": "Las Vegas Aces rookie Kate Martin admitted it was \"weird\" to be on the opposite side of former Iowa teammate Caitlin Clark on Saturday night.

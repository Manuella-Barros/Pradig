{"id": 237127088, "title": "Ban on chiropractors giving babies spinal treatment reinstated after outcry", "text": "Last week, the Chiropractic Board of Australia drew criticism from medical professionals and politicians after it again allowed chiropractors to use spinal manipulation on children under the age of two. Health Minister Mark Butler demanded an explanation from the board and raised the issue with health ministers at a meeting on Friday. On Monday, the board confirmed it would reinstate an interim policy banning the practice after a request from the health ministers&apos; meeting. The policy would be in effect until further consultation with health ministers allowed for a final decision to be developed, the board said. \"When health ministers discussed this issue last week, it seemed pretty clear to us that there was no basis for the suspension to have been lifted in the first place ... We&apos;re still looking forward to receiving an urgent explanation from the board as to why they took the action they did.\" \u2014 Health Minister Mark Butler. The board banned the practice in 2019 while it gathered evidence about its safety and effectiveness. It later commissioned health research organisation Cochrane Australia to review spinal manipulation in children under 12 and published updated guidelines in November 2023. These allowed chiropractors to treat children according to evidence and or best practice approaches. Medical bodies opposed the move to allow babies to undergo chiropractic spinal treatment, as two reviews found there was no evidence to support the practice. The board said it will consider its obligations under the national law and further decisions by health ministers in developing a \"final position\".", "summary": "After the Chiropractic Board of Australia's reversal of a ban on infants being given spinal manipulation treatment sparked criticism from politicians and health professionals, it has reinstated it.", "url": "https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/ban-on-chiropractors-giving-babies-spinal-treatment-reinstated-after-outcry/voasulyiw", "image": "https://images.sbs.com.au/dims4/default/4478cd9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5616x3159+0+293/resize/1280x720!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsbs-au-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3f%2F60%2F6bb4156d4e2bae6f74e1baa8f187%2Fbaby-held-in-hands.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-18 00:55:52", "author": "Getty / Dev Images", "authors": ["Getty / Dev Images"], "language": "en", "source_country": "au", "sentiment": -0.553}

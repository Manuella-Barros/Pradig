The bank said its Common Equity Tier 1 ratio rose to 13.1% and announced a 4-cent increase in its quarterly dividend to C$1.55 a share. National Bank National Bank beat analysts\u2019 estimates for the quarter, reporting adjusted earnings per share of C$2.54, compared with a consensus forecast of C$2.41. Profit was up in its wealth-management and capital-markets divisions, while net income slipped 3% in the company\u2019s retail-banking unit, primarily the result of higher provisions for loan losses. Overall net income rose 9% to C$906 million at the Montreal-based lender, Canada\u2019s sixth-largest bank, and it increased its quarterly dividend by 4 cents to C$1.10 a share. While the lender \u201ccould not escape the deterioration in credit that has been a theme of the second quarter, its provisions were not materially higher than expectations and were offset by strong revenue growth and solid cost controls,\u201d Jefferies Financial Group Inc. analyst John Aiken said in a note to clients.

A tense, fatalistic saga of bad luck and worse decisions, it's a throwback that feels as fresh and alive as its predecessors did decades ago. Not to be missed, it stands as one of the most welcome surprises of this moviegoing year.\n\nNever stagey despite confining the majority of its action to a single location, The Last Stop in Yuma County sets up shop at a remote pit stop on a road cutting through the hot, dusty, windswept Arizona desert. At this gas station, an unnamed man (Jim Cummings) pulls up in a little yellow Toyota Corona in need of gas. Unfortunately for him and those who'll follow in his wake, he learns from proprietor Vernon (Faizon Love) that the pumps are dry, the next filing spot is 100 miles away, and the refueling truck won't be around until later in the day.\n\nConsequently, Vernon suggests that the guy bide his time in the adjacent diner. Cummings' protagonist initially opts to just sit in his car, during which time he hears on the radio about a nearby bank robbery executed by thieves in a beat-up green Pinto. Yet after a few minutes of that -- and watching waitress Charlotte (Jocelin Donahue) get dropped off at the eating establishment by her sheriff husband Charlie (Michael Abbott Jr.) -- he heads inside and takes a seat in a booth.\n\nAlone with Charlotte, Cummings' stranger reveals that he's a knife salesman, and his nervous demeanor suggests that he's not a very good one -- not to mention that he's keeping some underlying secret close to the vest. Whatever he's hiding, however, takes a backseat to more pressing issues, the most urgent of which is the arrival of Beau (Richard Brake) and Travis (Nicholas Logan), the latter a sweaty young hothead and the former a composed, intense baddie. These are the bank robbers, and since they too can't get the gas they need to continue making their getaway, they join Cummings' everyman (who has a daughter named Sarah that he's eager to see) in the diner.\n\nIn short order, the salesman identifies their car as the one being discussed on the news. Still, Beau is a perceptive sort of villain, and before Charlotte can complete a call to Charlie, he's cocking his gun, choking her to the point of death, and cutting the phone cord to prevent any further interruptions to their morning.\n\nWith Beau and Travis' cards now out on the table for the salesman and Charlotte to see, The Last Stop in Yuma County ratchets up the complications by having additional motorists join the quartet in the diner, all of them annoyed by the refueling delay and the broken air conditioner that's turned the restaurant into a sauna. First, it's an older couple (Gene Jones and Robin Bartlett), then a gee-whiz police deputy (Connor Paolo), and finally a Native American local (Jon Proudstar) and a pair of young drifters, Miles (Ryan Masson) and Sybil (Sierra McCormick), who dream of the outlaw life -- specifically, one modeled less on Bonnie and Clyde than on Badlands. Sitting at the diner's counter, and aware that the bank robbers are in the place, Sybil remarks that Cummings' salesman \"kinda looks like that crossdresser from Psycho,\" and the comment proves amusingly apt on multiple levels, even if that's not immediately apparent.\n\nThe Last Stop in Yuma County doesn't make any more overt references to its big-screen forefathers but its blood runs film-noir black. No matter how much its characters attempt to logically manage their situation, unforeseen impediments and unfortunate developments routinely compound their troubles. Galluppi's script is a methodical ticking time bomb, winding up its various characters and waiting for them to blow. However, he wisely postpones fireworks for as long as possible, the better to maximize both the proceedings' edge-of-your-seat suspense and the jarring thrill of his payoff. Conveying much through quick cutaways to key details, close-ups of his actors' expressive faces, and compositions that lay out the geography of his setting and those who inhabit it, the director orchestrates his drama with the skill and grace of a born craftsman.\n\nHe also knows how to cast a film. Cummings remains one of indie cinema's most talented leading men, and in The Last Stop in Yuma County, he only hints at the buffoonish volatility that marked his prior turns in Thunder Road and The Wolf of Snow Hollow; instead, he embodies his salesman as a tremulous mystery who might capable of nothing or everything.\n\nA late sequence in which Galluppi's camera affixes itself to Cummings' POV as he thinks through his options is a terrific example of an actor and director working in perfect harmony. For pure showmanship, it's only exceeded by a preceding sit-down between Donahue's Charlotte, Cummings' nobody, and Brake's Beau that finds the criminal momentarily dropping his placid fa\u00e7ade to expose his terrifying true self. That quick, transformative flash is so startling that it almost resonates as a special effect, and its impact lingers for minutes afterwards, making us not just comprehend Beau's viper-like dangerousness but feel it.\n\nEnergized by a Matthew Compton score of simmering ominousness, The Last Stop in Yuma County builds to its finale with the same precision that typifies its every move. Rather than getting cute or losing his nerve, Galluppi embraces his chosen genre's bleak heart right to the bitter end, staging his concluding face-off amidst the vast plains, where the sand whips through the air, the blue sky looms large overhead, and escape is a fleeting fantasy. A fitting companion piece to everything from Robert Siodmak's 1946 The Killers to James Foley's 1990 After Dark, My Sweet, it's a faithful bit of noir nastiness that -- like Charlotte's rhubarb pie -- is to die for.", "source": {"uri": "thedailybeast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Beast"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Stop_(video_game)",

The diner's inhabitants include a mild-mannered traveling knife salesman, an elderly couple from Texas, the \"prettiest waitress in town\" (whose husband just happens to be the sheriff), and a pair of bank robbers. All of these people, except for the waitress, are stuck at this diner because the gas station is out of gas and awaiting the arrival of a fuel truck.\n\nIt's a simple set-up, variations of which have been done often, but Galluppi's direction and the actors' performances make The Last Stop in Yuma County a thrilling and enjoyable, if not entirely unique, neo-Western.\n\nGalluppi and cinematographer Mac Fisken make interesting shot choices from the opening image: an extended static shot from the gas station, looking out at the empty road, and not cutting until we see a car drive over a distant hill and come to a stop in the station. That willingness to let the camera sit and take in an image combines wonderfully with shots of natural light flowing into the diner through open blinds, stark shadows cast in the blaring Arizona sun, and some classic Western vistas.\n\nThroughout The Last Stop in Yuma County (the name of the gas station/motel/diner), Gallupi moves the camera deliberately through the indoor and outdoor areas of the stop to emphasize the spatial relationships between people and places with particular attention to various characters' sight lines. The emphasis on what characters can and cannot see allows for some fantastically orchestrated suspense sequences, any of which might develop from an innocuous observation to a multi-fatality incident.\n\nAt the center of that tension are the bank robbers, Travis (Nicholas Logan) and Beau (Richard Brake), men who may or may not be brothers but, beyond their criminality, could not be more different.\n\nTravis is big, loud, and a bit dumb, while Beau is wiry, soft-spoken, and keenly observant. Brake is (as usual) brilliant. There's no doubt that he's the brains of the operation from the moment the two appear on screen, but what's more is that there's no doubt about his willingness to dispatch anyone who stands between him and his money and freedom. Brake is a master of quiet menace and brings that ability to bear as Beau when, several times throughout the film, he calmly explains to the other diners what is going to happen while pointing a gun directly at someone's head.\n\nOver the course of The Last Stop in Yuma County, some other characters, including a deputy and the proprietor of the gas station and motel, come through the diner, bringing with them possiblities of the inevitable violent outburst. But instead of the requisite close calls feeling as though they're just another genre checkbox, the film establishes early on that we do not know how this story will play out. Several characters are smarter, dumber, and braver than we might expect, leading to a climax that offers multiple twists and turns within the course of minutes, and manages to be equally hilarious and tense.\n\nIn its final moments, The Last Stop in Yuma County moves outside the titular last stop, introduces some unnecessary characters, and generally goes beyond the small scale, fantastically suspenseful set-up that's made it such a success up to that point. The ending isn't bad, just not up to the quality of what's come before. But if this movie is any indication of what's in store from Galluppi, I can't wait to see what he does next.", "source": {"uri": "screenanarchy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ScreenAnarchy"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Diner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filling_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Filling station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Stop_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Last Stop (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Motel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuma_County,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Yuma County, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Yuma County, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jocelin_Donahue", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jocelin Donahue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Cummings", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jim Cummings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_McCormick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sierra McCormick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Brake", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Richard Brake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thriller film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_(genre)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western (genre)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinematographer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cinematographer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_County,_Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Logan County, Oklahoma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Logan County, Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genre", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crime"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://screenanarchy.com/assets/2024/05/sa_LSYC-poster_430.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552520", "eventUri": "eng-9552520", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Best put in a reservation at this remote diner from hell.\n\nThe Big Picture The Last Stop in Yuma County is a dark thriller set in a remote gas station and diner. The film carves out its own place in the genre, ratcheting up the tension until the explosive conclusion. Jim Cummings emerges as the center of the film, balancing dark comedy and chilling dread effectively.\n\nA sign reading \"you'll die for our rhubarb pie\" is normally a cheeky promise of some good eats. When seen at the remote Arizona gas station and diner in writer-director Francis Galluppi's serviceable if a little scattered feature debut The Last Stop in Yuma County, it's a warning that death is on the menu. Many people will roll through, but a good number of them won't be leaving. Playing like an extended riff on everything from the diner scene in Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction to any number of films by the Coen brothers, it's a confined little thriller that carves out a distinct place in the genre in how it isn't afraid to get dark. There is much about it that remains imperfect, especially in terms of some of the broad character beats that it begins with, but it proves to be proper fun once it gets going.\n\nThe Last Stop in Yuma County (2024) RCrimeThriller\n\nThe Last Stop in Yuma County is a western drama film that explores the struggles of a small town in Arizona during the 1970s. The story revolves around the intersecting lives of the town's inhabitants, including outlaws, lawmen, and settlers, as they navigate the harsh realities of the American frontier.\n\nRelease Date May 10, 2024 Director Francis Galluppi Cast Jim Cummings , Jocelin Donahue , Richard Brake , Nicholas Logan , Faizon Love Runtime 90 Minutes Main Genre Crime Writers Francis Galluppi Studio(s) Random Lane Productions , Local Boogeyman Productions , Carte Blanche\n\nIt also is a film that you should not watch the trailer for if you want to preserve the dark delights that get uncovered. Seeing it won't entirely rob you of the joys that the chaotic experience increasingly careens its way into, but some of the late escalations land far better when you don't know they're coming. Even a general plot description should remain light on anything but the basic details. This is not only because the film itself thrives in the twists it takes that, while they all feel grimly inevitable in retrospect, are still mighty tense in the moment, but because of how the story itself matters very little. It's all about getting a bunch of people in a room, some overtly nefarious while others will take a while to get there, and letting the chips fall in the deadly dance that is bearing down on all of them.\n\nWhat Is 'The Last Stop in Yuma County' About?\n\nThis all begins with a man who is known only as The Knife Salesman. Played by Jim Cummings of everything from the spectacular Thunder Road to the fantastic series finale of Barry, he already seems stressed even before he learns the gas station he has just pulled into has run dry. Now stuck here until a fuel truck arrives, he originally considers staying in his car where he hears a report of a bank robbery on the radio. He then wanders into the diner that has just opened where he strikes up a polite conversation with Charlotte (Jocelin Donahue), who seemingly runs the establishment on her own, while Verno (Faizon Love) works at the adjacent gas station. They aren't alone for long as two men pull up with a beat-up car that is out of gas. Beau (played by the perfectly menacing Richard Brake) and Travis, the more jittery of the bunch played by Nicholas Logan, are, of course, the bank robbers who are now trying to flee. The Knife Salesman soon puts together who they are and Beau recognizes this, pushing us over the edge into a hostage situation. Charlotte will have to keep up appearances, serving the customers that come through, as we ride the edge until everything explodes.\n\nWhile it all does ultimately explode, the film doesn't skimp on the small moments where the sparks begin to grow closer and closer to the powder keg. Even when it breaks the tension just a bit by pulling away from some side characters and their less sharply realized shenanigans, the core diner scenes are all operating at just the right frequency to cut through all the noise. Galluppi never feels like he is phoning it in or leaning too heavily on homage to anything, instead drawing us in deeper into the unique rhythms of the predicament he's created. Everyone just feels perpetually sweaty and tense, ensuring even the most simple of conversations are crackling with energy. It finds just the right balance between dark comedy and a chilling sense of dread at what is coming that may just consume everyone in the diner.\n\nFor those who are familiar with Cummings, you'll also know that this is where he thrives. Thunder Road is still the best example of this, followed closely by The Beta Test, while The Last Stop in Yuma County is closer to the experience of something like The Wolf of Snow Hollow. Each of these roles sees him playing an otherwise straight-laced man on the exterior who has an internal maniac that is just waiting to burst out. He's the guy you'd almost overlook before you see a strange look in his eyes. While everyone else in the film is solid in their roles, with Donahue finding small moments of resilience for her character just as Brake looms large over everything, it ends up being Cumming who emerges as the center of it all. This ensures that, even when it could stumble a bit in getting there and lose focus on its best parts, there is still plenty of fun to be had even after everything kicks off and it seems like the dust may have settled. It makes for the best part of the whole experience.\n\n'The Last Stop in Yuma Country' Ends With a Brutal and Bloody Bang Close\n\nWithout tipping anything off about what the conclusion looks like, it doesn't stop even when gunshots may be ringing in your ears. Following a great needle drop that marks the beginning of the end and where the characters go past the point of no return, everything suddenly opens into interesting new directions. Suddenly, the character who was almost most passive steps into the spotlight in a more unsettling yet totally fitting shift. It both slows down and speeds up with the initial danger having seemingly passed just as a new plot comes into focus.\n\nThe tragedy of what was essentially a bleak tragicomedy is brought to the forefront as there are still more bodies to stack up. After a film where we thought we had just about everything and everyone figured out, Galluppi reminds us that we very much don't. Not only is he not interested in leaving us with any sort of catharsis, but he just keeps twisting the screws tighter until there is nowhere left to go. When you hear that one final car horn ring out and everything continues to fall apart, it's a beautiful thing. Even as it all goes to pieces, it manages to reassemble them in a way that strikes a darkly wonderful tune before riding into the sunset.\n\nThe Last Stop in Yuma County (2024) REVIEW\n\nThe Last Stop in Yuma County is a solid Western thriller that boasts another great performance by Jim Cummings and a commitment to ratcheting up the tension.\n\n710\n\nProsFrancis Galluppi's feature debut finds a unique rhythm as the predicament he's created keeps drawing us in deeper.While not the movie where he goes a bit wild, Jim Cummings again strikes the perfect balance between dark comedy and chilling dread.The ending carries on beyond when the dust settles, reassembling the pieces into something that strikes a darkly wonderful tune. ConsThere is much that can feel more scattered, losing the focus on the strong central component of the standoff in the diner.\n\nThe Last Stop in Yuma County comes to theaters in the U.S. and is available to stream on VOD on May 10.

It's dark and funny, a version of a type of movie you've seen before -- keep adding people in a bad situation till something goes wrong -- but different enough to stand out.\n\nOh, and it was actually filmed in California. Which is probably good news for the citizens of Yuma County, all things considered.\n\nWhat is 'The Last Stop in Yuma County' about?\n\nSet in 1973 (if the Arizona license plates are any indication), the film begins with a man only identified as a knife salesman, played by Jim Cummings, pulling into a dusty desert gas station. Bad news: the pumps are empty, Vernon (Faizon Love), the station's owner, informs him. The next station is 100 miles down the road. A refueling truck is on the way, and he is welcome to wait in the diner, where there is at least air conditioning.\n\nExcept not today. Charlotte (Jocelin Donahue), the waitress who has been dropped off by her husband Charlie (Michael Abbott Jr.), informs the knife salesman that he's welcome to coffee and the supposedly famous rhubarb pie. He's just trying to get to Carlsbad to see his daughter, who lives with his ex-wife and her new stepfather.\n\nWhile he was in the car, the knife salesman heard reports on the radio of a bank robbery in Buckeye; the two robbers were seen driving away in a green Ford Pinto. Guess who pulls up at the station, wanting gas? Beau (Richard Brake, genuinely menacing) and his dim-bulb brother Travis (Nicholas Logan) are the bank robbers.\n\n'The Fall Guy' review:Preposterous, outrageous and charming\n\nThey're also compelled to wait, and none too happy about it. The knife salesman is on to them and they find out. The plan is for everyone to just wait till the gas truck comes, though Beau seems like he might have more nefarious plans.\n\nOne thing leads to another and several more people arrive, all of them wanting gas. (These include the great Gene Jones, last seen in \"Killers of the Flower Moon,\" here playing a cranky old man who, like everyone else, just wants to get on the road.)\n\nA green sheriff's deputy arrives (Connor Paolo) and isn't sharp enough to realize anything is amiss, though he does ask the sheriff when he sees him later if Charlotte is OK, because she didn't quite seem herself.\n\nNo kidding.\n\n(Charlie's secretary is played by horror-movie queen Barbara Crampton.)\n\nThere are some clumsy, half-hearted escape attempts. Beau threatens Charlotte, telling her to ask every new patron if they have gas or are waiting on the truck. Eventually Pete (Jon Proudstar, who played Willie Jack's dad Leon in \"Reservation Dogs\") shows up for breakfast. And finally, things are set in motion.\n\nGalluppi is unsparing with his characters\n\nThere is a fair amount of humor up to this point, all of it with a dark tinge because the audience knows what's really going on, even if all the characters don't. Jones' old man speaks for everyone when another character spells out a cockamamie plan to get everyone out alive. It sounds like a beautiful plan, he says, but I think it's really unlikely.\n\nIndeed, Galluppi is unsparing with violence and with his characters. The action is fast and, well, furious, and over more quickly than you'd think. It's also as messy and random as real life, not the balletic choreography you see in some movie shootouts. Which makes it more meaningful, and a lot more effective.\n\nTom Petty sang that \"The Waiting\" is the hardest part. He wasn't talking about movies (as far as I know), but in this case the waiting is actually the best part. Watching the tension ratchet, knowing that something's got to give at some point and wondering how that will commence, is the most effective part of the film.\n\nThe characters' motivations wander a little bit, and while the performances are all good, there are probably a couple too many thrown in to keep things as lean and mean as Galluppi obviously intends them to be. But \"The Last Stop in Yuma County\" is a promising debut, and a welcome chance to watch some actors you've seen in other things get a chance to branch out a little. It's dark fun, assuming you find watching escalating tension a good time. And why wouldn't you?", "source": {"uri": "azcentral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AZ Central"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bill_goodykoontz@azcentral.com", "name": "Bill Goodykoontz", "type":

Plastered on a sign attached to the outside wall of a diner in the middle of nowhere, writer/director Francis Galluppi and director of photography Mac Fisken keep that image in the background of a scene as if it's a foreboding warning, except its not pie that's going to get people killed. However, chasing after a slice of a different kind of pie has a high chance of proving to be dangerous in The Last Stop in Yuma County, a single-location potboiler set during an unspecified time period that resembles the 1970s, centered on an array of colorful characters stranded inside the aforementioned diner with a busted air conditioner, awaiting the arrival of a truck driver to refuel the adjacent gas station, which also happens to be the only one for a long stretch.\n\nWhile none of these characters are particularly deep, the story gets the most out of the tried-and-true messaging about greed, as a pair of bank robbers on the run happen to be also stuck in this diner. They are Travis (Nicholas Logan as the more bumbling comic relief half of the duo, sporting an amusing shirt that says \"Bigfoot for president\") and Beau (a quietly terrifying Richard Brake who only raises his voice when necessary), taking control of the diner by intimidation and force. A mad dash by waitress Charlotte (Jocelin Donahue) to phone her sheriff husband Charlie (Michael Abbott Jr.) for help is squashed, gas station owner Vernon (Faizon Love) has no idea what's happening, and the diner itself is filled up with patrons (such as an elderly couple played by Gene Jones and Robin Bartlett) having coffee and meals awaiting the chance to refuel their vehicles.\n\nIn the corner of the diner is a quiet, mild-mannered, nameless traveling knife salesman played by the supremely talented, seemingly underappreciated Jim Cummings (seek out all of his directorial efforts, which he also stars in, if you haven't and especially if you like what you see here.) Business also doesn't seem to be hot, although his reason for passing through this diner is simply because it's en route to visit his daughter. He mostly sticks to filling in the blanks on a newspaper crossword puzzle, often remaining silent, as if he is patiently waiting for the right moment to make a move.\n\nThis traveling salesman is certainly the protagonist, although The Last Stop in Yuma County greatly balances time between all characters, including ones not at the diner; there are scenes at the police station offering insight into the marriage between sheriff and waitress. The point is that when violence escalates, it is downright shocking how gutsy Francis Galluppi disposes of key characters. Much of the film is also shot utilizing tracking shots to demonstrate a sense of geography regarding the characters' locations. Even simple details, such as tension rising during sweltering heat, are smart, creative decisions that add to the atmosphere here.\n\nFrom there, The Last Stop in Yuma County transitions into an attempted escape with the money, and while I won't spoil who that involves, it should be mentioned that it's thrilling regarding how Francis Galluppi never loses that claustrophobic suspense. Characters still converge on a path of violence in a crowd-pleasing fashion. Again, one would be hard-pressed to find depth here, but that's fine, considering how flat-out awesome this movie is. There is twisted glee in the take-no-prisoners manner in which the film unfolds, or watching desperate souls dig their graves, killing each other over this money.\n\nFlickering Myth Rating - Film:

Not just a place to see peeling upholstery and rodent traps, and indulge in the occasional sugary slice, but a genuine icon of Americana from Edward Hopper to \"Frasier.\" A diner is the great, anxiety-drenched stage where most of first-time feature director Francis Galluppi's \"The Last Stop in Yuma County\" takes place, and, though this thriller is packed with memorable characters, the diner itself might be its greatest.\n\n\"The Petrified Forest\" meets Tarantino and the Coen brothers, \"The Last Stop in Yuma County\" revels in its Americana like few films in recent memory. There's an olive green Ford Pinto, Roy Orbison's \"Crying\" played from a jukebox, a sheriff with '70s sideburns, and, of course, a couple of bank robbers on the run. There's the oafish Travis (Nicholas Logan), who inquires about the location of the facilities with a repeated \"Where's the shitter?\" and wipes his armpits in front of the most adorable diner waitress (Jocelin Donahue) this side of \"Twin Peaks.\" His partner in crime is Beau (Richard Brake, whose Joe Chill killed Bruce Wayne's parents in \"Batman Begins,\" and who also played the Night King on the earlier seasons of \"Game of Thrones\"), who has a lizard-like, unblinking stare. Pure psychopath.\n\nThey quickly take over the diner in question, holding hostage the only people present -- Donahue's waitress, named Charlotte, and a traveling knife salesman played by Jim Cummings, unnamed. Well, the only people there at that moment. Travis and Beau needed a place to hide out while waiting for the gas truck to arrive at the fill 'er up station next door, so they can fill up and head out onto the 100-mile stretch of road that leads straight into the desert. The gas truck doesn't arrive, though. The opening credits show why. And with a long wait for it to arrive, other people start pouring into the diner as well, also hoping to get some gas and unaware of the hostage situation playing out right in front of them.\n\nEventually, the diner's relatively packed. Sierra McCormick as Sybil, a redhead spitfire who turns up her nose at the eatery's rhubarb pie, and Faizon Love as Vernon, the proprietor of the gas station, are particular highlights. And Galluppi directs the hell out of every moment. There are overhead shots, low-angle shots, at one point the camera is even attached to the fender of the Pinto. More impressive still is when he doesn't go for the virtuosity and lets a wide-shot simmer as a slow burn for an entire two minutes as the camera slowly tracks in on The Knife Salesman and Charlotte as he tells her he thinks Travis and Beau are bank robbers and they need to formulate a plan to survive.\n\nThis is one promising debut, but the reality is that it's a far greater feat of directing than screenwriting, for which Galluppi has the sole credit as well. He's great at telegraphing small details about his characters through close-up reaction shots -- and his actors are more than up to the challenge of conveying a ton, without significant explanatory dialogue. Donahue, a scream queen who came to horror fans' attention for Ti West's \"The House of the Devil,\" is particularly adept at conveying so much of what she needs to through a flick of her eyes and a shift in her posture. But everyone's dialogue feels a little too on-the-nose at times. Does Sybill really need to flat-out say that The Knife Salesman looks like the \"cross-dresser from 'Psycho'?\" Cummings' Anthony Perkins vibes here are already very palpable to anyone with even a rudimentary knowledge of film. And the scenario itself is ultimately about moving them around like pieces on a chess board -- about putting them into just the right positions for the most explosive effect. Because you know something major is going to go down.\n\nAnd it does. Less because it's what's most organic an outcome for these characters, but because it's the greatest spectacle this scenario allows. That's a tad unfair to several characters, who feel like they're in want of a better story. There's even a specific moment where you can identify \"Oh, this has gone from a Tarantino riff to a Coen brothers riff,\" down to the hastily snatched bag full of money. Not to mention the Chekhov's Gas Tanker introduced in the opening moments.\n\nGalluppi is clearly adept with actors, and he knows how to make the most of a simple setup -- the way he slows down and speeds up the experience of time is particularly skillful -- but \"The Last Stop in Yuma County\" has many of the hallmarks of a first film. It's a showcase for its director's skillset and chosen obsessions but with many notions feeling more like a tease than the full elaboration you might expect from a more experienced filmmaker. He's directed music videos and his similarly dusty short-film thriller \"High Desert Hell\" won acclaim in 2019, but he's got a way to go as a filmmaker.\n\nThe ambition is there, though, and Galluppi's ability to maximize the potential of a single location and an ensemble within it should lend itself well to the Untitled \"Evil Dead\" film he's attached to as his next project. After all, a roadside diner is usually just a place to stop for a bit when passing through. Maybe \"The Last Stop in Yuma County\" is just a pitstop on the way to an even more exciting cinematic destination to come.", "source": {"uri": "indiewire.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Before anyone can continue on their respective journeys, however, the movie itself has some time-traveling to do, all within the space of its opening 20 minutes or so. The font on its title card looks like something out of the 1950s; a crucial reference to a Ford Pinto pulls the story into the 1970s; and finally, the movie pulls to a stop in the '90s -- not as its setting (per the Pinto and a Badlands reference, that seems to be sometime in the latter half of the '70s) but as the point in time where showily composed crime pictures set partially in diners had their most recent, post-Tarantino peak. In quantity, that is, if not necessarily quality.\n\nMaybe writer-director Francis Galluppi has other filmmakers in mind, though. A husband and wife who turn up at the diner, also waiting for gasoline to arrive, are played by Gene Jones and Robin Bartlett; audiences may recognize them as the guy at the counter in a famous scene from No Country For Old Men and the woman who plays Lillian Gorfein in Inside Llewyn Davis. Depending on your character-actor recall, this is either a subtle nod or a buzzing neon sign pointing to the influence of the Coen brothers.\n\nFor much of the movie, it's only the characters' lack of Tarantino-knockoff swagger that recalls the Coens. Galluppi uses an unnamed knife salesman (Jim Cummings) to lay out the situation with perfect, immediate clarity. His fuel gauge near empty. The man pulls into a gas station, advertised as the last one for many miles, where the attendant (Faizon Love) informs him that the station itself is out of gas at the moment. He can wait at the diner if he wants; the gas truck is running late and should be there any minute. Nervously hoping to make a date with his daughter, the salesman waits, and strikes up conversation with Charlotte (Jocelin Donahue), the waitress, who also lacks transportation. Her husband -- the sheriff -- dropped her off that morning.\n\nGalluppi's premise has ingenious simplicity. As soon as the knife salesman learns about the gas delay, it becomes clear that just about anyone else who pulls into the near-empty parking lot of the filling station/diner/motel will be in a similar situation: waiting, impatient, and also hot, because the air conditioning in the diner is busted. It's similarly inevitable that after the salesman hears something on the radio about a local bank robbery early on, the perpetrators will also show up in need of gas. Sure enough, quietly ruthless Beau (Richard Brake) and dimmer, more impulsive Travis (Nicholas Logan) pull up in their dented Pinto, and bicker over what to do if they get recognized.\n\nPeriodically, more unwilling customers enter. It's easy to picture how, if this were a bigger studio picture like Bad Times At The El Royale, these people could all be played by familiar movie-star faces. Some of the faces in The Last Stop In Yuma County are familiar, but not in that way. Richard Brake, for example, played Joe Chill, killer of Bruce Wayne's parents, in Batman Begins. He often plays guys who are referred to only by their last name; he's in the Strangers remake next week. This is the type of role that will likely lead to a substantial uptick in recognition among those who see it. Galluppi probably made this movie on a budget, but bigger stars might well have ruined its tension with showboating, however unintentionally.\n\nAs is, the biggest star in the movie is the specter of Quentin Tarantino. This may not be fair to Galluppi, who avoids most pitfalls of the garden-variety QT imitator from 1997 or thereabouts, and has made a skillful, entertaining thriller. On the other hand, if, when a dopey character talks about his grand bank-robbery plan, you feel certain that someone will call him out as appropriating the plot of a movie he saw, it's probably fine to cite a tremendously influential filmmaker. It's actually the self-inflicted Coen comparisons that come back to haunt The Last Stop In Yuma County -- because Galluppi does eventually find some more Coens-y notes of blackly comic haplessness in this unpredictable yarn. He's splendidly ruthless in this area, yet the corkscrew turns of fate don't have much heft of either the comic or the dramatic variety. There's a sense that the movie thinks just by lingering on certain shots, they'll take on a greater weight, connecting to some significant observation about the world. When this doesn't happen, though, it feels almost fitting. Sometimes a long wait at a diner doesn't pay off.", "source": {"uri": "avclub.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The A.V.

And no, he can't tell you anything about it. He can, however, prove his bona fides as a horror and suspense fan in our Zoom interview by pointing to the \"Evil Dead\" poster in his office and the \"three Necronomicons on my desk.\"\n\nGalluppi landed the coveted gig after Sam Raimi saw Galluppi's feature film debut, \"The Last Stop in Yuma County,\" the acclaimed thriller that arrives in theaters and on digital this week. Shot in 20 days on a budget of \"about a million\" dollars, the film is set almost entirely at road stop diner in an unspecified past era where traveling salesmen and rotary phones are still prevalent. As patrons await the arrival of a gas truck, the establishment soon becomes populated with an ensemble of independent film legends, including Jim Cummings as a knife salesman, Jocelin Donahue as a waitress and Richard Brake and Nicholas Logan as bank robbers trying (and failing) to keep a low profile. The film is nasty in the best way -- a lean, darkly funny and unpredictable ride that feels both like a throwback to the crime movies of the 1970s but also urgently timely.\n\nIn short, it's easy to see what Raimi and Ghost House Pictures saw in the film's DNA that makes Galluppi the perfect fit for their universe. Any further evidence can also be found in his two short films, \"High Desert Hell\" and \"The Gemini Project,\" that preceded it. And it's no coincidence that \"Evil Dead\" is a major source of inspiration for the filmmaker, who began his career in music before pivoting to movies. \"It's one of the movies that legitimately made me want to make movies,\" Galluppi enthuses. \"If I'd never seen 'Evil Dead' I don't think I would have grabbed my friends and went out to the desert and made my first short.\"\n\nBelow are some highlights of our conversation with Galluppi about the making of the twisty thriller, working with his dream cast and what's next.\n\nHe'd be open to a play version of \"Last Stop in Yuma County.\"\n\nIt's intended as a compliment to say the film feels like a play at times, thanks to the mostly singular location, strong characters and real-time setting. And Galluppi takes it as such, noting he's a fan of movies such as \"Rope,\" \"Dial M for Murder\" and even the underrated \"Phone Booth.\" It's also how he made his short films -- \"High Desert Hell\" is set in a remote California desert while \"The Gemini Project\" was shot because \"my buddy had a cabin up in Oregon.\"\n\nThe location might look familiar.\n\n\"Last Stop\" really took off when Galluppi was scouting locations and came across an existing diner set at the Four Aces Movie Ranch in Palmdale, just north of Los Angeles. Traveling in his music career, he recalled often ending up at such places in the middle of nowhere. \"It was always this eerie feeling of walking in and feeling like the fish out of water,\" he notes. \"I'm very neurotic but I'd walk in and feel like I was out of the loop on a secret everyone else knew. I think that really sparked the seed to start writing this story.\"\n\nWhat he didn't know at the time was that the diner has also served as a location for countless music videos, commercials and shows. \"Now that I know, I see it all the time,\" he admits. It's in the new season of 'Dave,' it's in 'House of 1,000 Corpses,' it's in 'Identity.'\" In fact, during the edit, Galluppi's was sitting with his composer Matthew Compton when the latter mentioned that the diner looked familiar. \"He said, 'I think I've eaten there before,'\" Galluppi recalls. \"And I was like, 'No, dude, you did the score for 'Palm Springs,' which shot at this diner!'\"\n\nThere will be blood.\n\nWithout giving too much away, there are bound to be causalities when you put a group of desperate people in a hot desert diner with money on the line. It also meant his cast was almost always on set, even if they were just sitting at a booth in the background of a shot. Despite that, Galluppi says, \"Everybody was in really good spirits. Honestly, it felt like summer camp every single day.\"\n\nThat goodwill extended to scenes where actors had to be still or lie in a pool of blood -- due to the low budget, there was no money for fake bodies. While it might not sound too bad to lie down on the job, Galluppi insists, \"It's not as great as it sounds. The blood is so stick and someone has to lie there for two days. I felt so bad.\"\n\nNobody auditioned for the movie.\n\nPerhaps the high spirits were due to the cast and crew being all \"movie nerds and cinephiles\" who spent the long days geeking out on each other's work. \"Nobody was there for a paycheck,\" he says.Though he worked with casting director David Guglielmo to assemble the ensemble, Galluppi says he never made any actors audition -- he knew who he wanted based on their past work. That includes genre legend Barbra Crampton as a sheriff's secretary and Sierra McCormick, who impressed him with her one-take scene in \"The Vast of Night.\" He even wrote Donahue's role with her in mind, despite not knowing her personally.\n\nGalluppi was a fan of filmmaker and actor Cummings from his movies \"Thunder Road\" and \"The Beta Test,\" and heard him on a podcast talk about how he was rarely asked to just act in a film. So Galluppi sent him a letter -- and Cumming called and invited him over for coffee. \"I went over the next day and we just talked about 'South Park,' for three hours,\" Galluppi recalls. \"And he ended up being my North Star -- there were so many times in on set where my face was buried in my hands and he'd tell me, 'It's all going to be okay, it's going to be great.' And coming from someone who has such experience making scrappy movies with his friends -- it meant the world.\"\n\nHis producer literally bet the house on the movie.\n\nGalluppi stresses time and again what a \"truly independent\" movie the production was. In fact, he had spent years trying to make the film. \"There have been 20 different version over the years, and it's been this rollercoaster of emotions trying to get it made,\" he admits, adding that he's had two children in the time it took to get the film made.\n\nAt one point, his executive producer James Claeys had offered to sell his house to finance the film so they could make it the way they wanted. \"At the time, I said, 'That's crazy. Don't do that,'\" Galluppi recalls. For awhile, the script was with a production company, but Galluppi realized they had a different vision from him -- including wanting \"name\" actors. \"So as soon as the option expired, I pulled it,\" he notes.\n\nAt this point he had begun to put his dream cast in place, so he went back to Claeys. \"I said, 'Look man, I don't know if you're serious or not. But if you are, this is what it means: We can do this thing how we want to do it, nobody's going to be telling us how to make this movie.' And he did it, he sold his house. And we were up and running a month later.\"\n\nHis kids haven't seen his movies, but they've heard about them.\n\nSpeaking of his children, they're far too young to have seen \"Last Stop\" but he notes that he has spent so much time talking about the movie, they have picked up a few things. \"My daughter very much knows the words 'last stop' and 'Yuma County,'\" he says with a laugh. \"And now because all I've been talking about is 'Evil Dead,' she calls everything by that name. She made something on her Lite-Brite and I asked what it was. She goes, 'It's evil dead.' It made no sense.\"", "source": {"uri": "variety.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Variety"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasquale_Galluppi", "type": "person",

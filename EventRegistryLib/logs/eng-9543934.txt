Missouri state auditor wants to know", "body": "Former St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kimberly M. Gardner is dodging subpoenas, not returning phone calls and physically avoiding state officials who want to question her.\n\nSo in some ways, it's like she never left office.\n\nAnd due to futile attempts over several months to reach Gardner -- a search that has been unable to even confidently determine where she is living -- a top state official held a press conference Monday in St. Louis.\n\nStopping just short of handing out milk cartons bearing Gardner's photo, Missouri Auditor Scott Fitzpatrick asked:\n\n\"Have you seen Kim Gardner? Do you know where she is?\"\n\nFitzpatrick said the time now has come for Gardner to address what \"appears to be inappropriate expenditures and mismanagement\" that auditors have uncovered.\n\nWentzville superintendent's departure came after threats and police patrols Washington University faculty placed on leave, students 'houseless' after Gaza protest Busch Stadium needs renovations. Should St. Louis taxpayers kick in? Cardinals games dropped by Comcast after Bally Sports deal falls through Pro-Palestinian protests block traffic outside Washington University Teen charged with breaking into more than 35 cars in St. Louis County BenFred: Sunday was a gut-test game for the Cardinals.

'It's my university's turn.'\n\nHe said his office wants to wrap up this audit that began in 2021, laid mostly dormant for more than a year, and then was rebooted when he took office in January 2023.\n\nShould Gardner persist in being a no-show for questioning, Fitzpatrick said, the audit will be wrapped up and released before the end of 2024 -- whether or not Gardner decides to participate.\n\nFitzpatrick said the quest to locate Gardner has involved dozens of phone calls to Gardner; contacting attorneys who did represent her, or who are now doing so; reaching out to former colleagues and co-workers; and checking known addresses and places of employment.\n\nTo be sure, Gardner sightings are regular rumors that run around the courthouse with a Carmen Sandiego-like quality. Some have her at one of several hospitals in the area -- not so far-fetched given she attended nursing school while she was circuit attorney.\n\nOthers have her living somewhere in South Carolina, possibly near Clemson University, where her husband coaches track.\n\nFitzpatrick did not dismiss the possibility that Gardner might be \"willing to leave the state and never return as an effective way to avoid answering questions.\"\n\nBut in an appeal to Gardner's conscience, Fitzpatrick said, \"It's not too late to do the right thing.\"\n\nThen again, this would not be the first time that Gardner has gummed up governmental works. (Please note, one St. Louis circuit judge called her office \"a rudderless ship of chaos.\")\n\nIn early 2023, Fitzpatrick's auditors tried to obtain records from Gardner, who would not allow auditors to enter her office.\n\nIt also was reported at the time that auditors were forced into engage in a constant back-and-forth with Gardner's lawyers, who either refused to turn over records or, when they did turn them over, had heavily redacted pertinent information.\n\nSo in March 2023, Fitzpatrick subpoenaed documents that included bank and credit card statements. Gardner's office did not respond and Fitzpatrick planned to go to court to enforce the subpoenas.\n\nBut on the same day Fitzpatrick planned to add the additional heat, May 16, Gardner abruptly resigned.\n\nThat past action might be complicate Fitzpatrick's hope that Gardner will feel obligated to come forward to assist in any way with the completion of the audit -- given that her abrupt resignation managed to make a bad situation worse.\n\nThe Post-Dispatch reported then that Gardner's move \"throws into further chaos a city courts system that's already bending under the weight of a staffing exodus, organizational dysfunction, a leadership vacuum and a backlog of several thousand cases.\"\n\nFitzpatrick gave credit to now-Circuit Attorney Gabe Gore, Gardner's successor, for allowing auditors to come on site and have access to the necessary records.\n\nUltimately, Fitzpatrick urged anyone with knowledge of Gardner's whereabouts to call his office's \"whistleblower\" line at 800-347-8597.\n\n0 Comments Tags Kim Gardner Circuit Attorney St. Louis Local-politics Local-politicians Gabe Gore Scott Fitzpatrick Joe Holleman Joe's Political Fix Crime And Courts Katie Kull",

At the time of her resignation, Gardner was the subject of an ouster effort by Republican Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey. GOP lawmakers were considering a bill allowing Republican Gov.

The Starliner capsule safely docked with the International Space Station on Thursday, meeting a key test in proving the vessel\u2019s flight-worthiness and sharpening Boeing\u2019s competition with Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX. The rendezvous was achieved despite an earlier loss of several guidance-control jet thrusters, some of them due to a helium propulsion leak, which Nana and Boeing said should not compromise the mission. Boeing\u2019s CST-100 Starliner, with veteran astronauts Barry \u201cButch\u201d Wilmore and Sunita \u201cSuni\u201d Williams aboard, arrived at the orbiting platform after a flight of nearly 27 hours following its launch from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. On arrival, Wilmore, 58, and Williams, 61, spent about two hours conducting a series of standard procedures, such as checking for airlock leaks and pressurizing the passage between the capsule and the ISS, before opening the entry hatches. A live Nasa video feed showed the smiling new arrivals, wearing their blue flight suits, weightlessly floating headfirst through the padded passageway, one after the other, into the station.", "summary": "<p>Watch live as two <a href=\"/topic/nasa\">Nasa</a> astronauts give a tour of the <a href=\"/topic/boeing\">Boeing</a> Starliner on Saturday 8 June.</p>", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/space/nasa-boeing-starliner-iss-tour-livefeed-b2559115.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/06/08/13/Thumbnail%20starliner%20jw.png?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 13:10:20", "author": "Oliver Browning", "authors": ["Oliver Browning"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.261}

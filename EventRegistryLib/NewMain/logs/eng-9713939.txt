Relief Agency Protests Israeli Attacks - The New York Times (http://nytimes.com)\n\nBackground Information:\n\nUNRWA is the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East. The United Nations General Assembly established UNRWA in 1949 with a mandate to provide humanitarian assistance and protection to registered Palestine refugees in the Agency's area of operations pending a just and lasting solution to their plight.\n\nUNRWA operates in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, The Gaza Strip, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria.\n\nTens of thousands of Palestine refugees who lost their homes and livelihoods due to the 1948 conflict continue to be displaced and in need of support, nearly 75 years on.\n\nUNRWA helps Palestine Refugees achieve their full potential in human development through quality services it provides in education, health care, relief and social services, protection, camp infrastructure and improvement, microfinance, and emergency assistance. UNRWA is funded almost entirely by voluntary contributions.", "source": {"uri": "reliefweb.int", "dataType": "news", "title": "ReliefWeb"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNRWA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UNRWA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Lazzarini", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philippe Lazzarini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_(region)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestine (region)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_refugees", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian refugees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations General Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_East", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Near East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Jerusalem", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "East Jerusalem"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Syria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Syria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://reliefweb.int/modules/custom/reliefweb_meta/images/icons/OPT_PSE.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713939", "eventUri": "eng-9713939", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

This confirms its importance and role, which is not limited to the Gaza Strip, but extends to include caring for the affairs of Palestinian refugees inside and outside the occupied Palestinian territories, whether in Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon or Syria.\"\n\nHe pointed out that UNRWA has a humanitarian mandate, a long history, and an actual contribution on the ground. It is an integral part of the responsibility that lies on the international community for millions of Palestinians.\n\nEgypt is \"constant eager to work closely with UNRWA to perform its noble mission,\"\n\nHe pointed out that the campaign to undermine the UNRWA's credibility is not new, but aims to break the sanctity of the work of international organizations that support the Palestinian people. He highlighted that UNRWA is the only entity that has distribution centers in Gaza.\n\n\"The Gaza Strip can no longer tolerate further destruction. The Israeli military machine has destroyed all facilities and infrastructure, in addition to the systematic targeting of UNRWA institutions and buildings, which is a blatant violation of international law and its continuation cannot be accepted.\"\n\nAbdel Aty called on the international community to intensify pressure for an immediate ceasefire, stressing that Egypt provides support to the wounded in the Gaza Strip, as Egyptian hospitals host large numbers of the wounded and their families.\n\nHe explained that the Palestinian child no longer enjoys his most basic rights, and there are still half a million Palestinian children suffering from psychological trauma due to the cessation of education after the destruction of the schools run by UNRWA.\n\nThe minister said \"education is a basic right, and UNRWA plays an essential role in providing educational services. It does not It only works to provide humanitarian aid, but also provides educational and health services.\"\n\nFor his part, UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini said that he discussed with Abdel Aty close cooperation with Egypt during these difficult times and the attacks on UNRWA, in which about two hundred employees lost their lives since the beginning of the war.\n\n\"Since the beginning of the war, UNRWA's headquarters have been the target of military and security operations, and above all that is the campaign that aimed to dismantle UNRWA. We also saw the brutal campaign and some of the measures that were taken against the agency.\"\n\n\"Member states have requested that we respond to this campaign and not We accept this matter, because it will not be limited to UNRWA only, but will extend to the United Nations, and will not be limited to Gaza, but it can happen with crises in other places,\" Lazzarini added.\n\nHe pointed out that this week witnessed the displacement of 250,000 people from Khan Yunis based on Israeli instructions. This is not the first time that residents have been forced to flee, which means that there is no safe place in Gaza.\n\nHe explained that he discussed with Abdel Ati the situation of children in Gaza, noting that half of Gaza's population is under 18 years of age, and there are 600,000 girls and boys living among the rubble. There is a danger that an entire generation will be deprived of education.", "source": {"uri": "egypttoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EgyptToday"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNRWA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UNRWA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_refugees", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian refugees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Lazzarini", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philippe Lazzarini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_System", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_humanitarian_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International humanitarian law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diplomat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Syria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Syria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khan_Yunis", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Multinational_Forces", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Multinational Forces", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.egypttoday.com/siteimages/larg/202107010259315931.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713939", "eventUri": "eng-9713939", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5294117647058822, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

Another month. Another school hit,\" said Philippe Lazzarini, head of UNRWA, the largest aid agency in Gaza, in a post on X, formerly Twitter, after a school in Nuseirat, central Gaza, was \"hit by the Israeli Forces\" on Saturday. It was home to nearly 2,000 people forcibly displaced by the hostilities, the UNRWA Commissioner-General said, adding that dozens of casualties had been reported.\n\nThe development comes as ceasefire and hostage-release talks were reportedly due to resume in coming days.

Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East's (UNRWA) latest situation report on Israel's military operations in Gaza and the West Bank, and was reported the same day that Israel attacked the agency's Gaza City headquarters.\n\nUNRWA said a total of 453 attacks have been waged by Israel on its facilities \"and the people inside them\" since October, while at least 524 people have been killed in attacks on schools run by the agency.\n\n\"U.N. structures, schools, and shelters are not a target,\" said UNRWA in a social media post.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) claimed its latest attack on UNRWA's headquarters was aimed at defeating Hamas and Islamic Jihad members who were using the building for military operations.\n\nEarlier this year, Israeli officials claimed without evidence that a dozen of UNRWA's 13,000 staff members in Gaza had contributed to a Hamas-led attack on southern Israel last October 7. The allegation pushed countries including the United States, Germany, and Canada to suspend financial support for the donor-funded agency, which is the biggest employer in Gaza as well as a provider of education and public services to Palestinians there.\n\nThe suspension of funding to UNRWA, which has been lifted all donor countries except the U.S., U.K., and New Zealand, has been named as one cause exacerbating the starvation of Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nPhilippe Lazzarini, head of the agency, said Wednesday that four schools, including at least two run by the U.N., have been attacked by Israel in the last four days.\n\n\"Since the war began, two-thirds of UNRWA schools in Gaza have been hit, some were bombed out, many severely damaged,\" said Lazzarini. \"Schools have gone from safe places of education and hope for children to overcrowded shelters and often ending up a place of death and misery... The blatant disregard of international humanitarian law cannot become the new normal.\"\n\nOn Monday, several people were injured in an Israeli strike on a UNRWA-run school in Nuseirat.

Additionally, Indonesia questioned the inaction of the United Nations (UN) and Israel's allies in addressing the situation.\n\n\"Are such atrocities still not enough for the UN Security Council and countries supporting Israel to take firm actions against Israel?\" the ministry wrote.\n\nThe al-Jaouni School operated by UNRWA became the latest educational facility targeted by Israel since the October 2023 offensive began. UNRWA reported that the school served as a shelter for nearly 2,000 internally displaced persons.\n\nThe agency further stated that since the offensive's start, over half, or approximately 190 of its facilities have been struck, resulting in 520 reported deaths and nearly 1,600 injuries, with many victims being women and children.\n\nThe Israeli military confirmed an airstrike on the school, claiming it was used as a Hamas command center, according to a statement last Saturday cited from the Times of Israel. UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini refuted this claim, stating it's a recurring justification used by Israel.\n\n\"These are claims that I take very seriously.

Another month. Another school hit,\" said Philippe Lazzarini, head of UNRWA, the largest aid agency in Gaza, in a post on X, formerly Twitter, after a school in Nuseirat, central Gaza, was \"hit by the Israeli Forces\" on Saturday. It was home to nearly 2,000 people forcibly displaced by the hostilities, the UNRWA Commissioner-General said, adding that dozens of casualties had been reported.\n\nThe development comes as ceasefire and hostage-release talks were reportedly due to resume in coming days. Repeated previous efforts to make headway have foundered, despite sustained international pressure from Member States with influence on both sides.\n\nSuccess in negotiations this week will depend on satisfying Hamas's call for a permanent end to the fighting and intense Israeli airstrikes which have flattened vast areas of the enclave, and the Israeli Government's stated war aim of destroying Hamas's military capability after the group attacked multiple targets in southern Israel on 7 October, killing around 1,250 people and capturing more than 250 hostages.\n\nTo date, tens of thousands of Palestinians have been killed, according to the Gazan health authorities and latest data from UNRWA indicates that at least 520 people sheltering in the UN agency's shelters have been killed and at least 1,602 injured since the start of the war.\n\nIn a regular situation update, the UN aid coordination office, OCHA, reported that up to 1.9 million people in Gaza have been uprooted by the war, including some displaced \"nine or 10 times\". Previous estimates were 1.7 million but this was before the Israeli operation in Rafah in early May, which led to additional displacements from Rafah and other parts across the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe renewed push for an end to the war comes amid daily exchanges of fire between Lebanese militants, Israel, and key Hamas ally, Hezbollah, across the UN-monitored Blue Line separating them.\n\nOn Sunday, the Lebanon-based group claimed responsibility for a reported drone strike on Mount Hermon in the Israeli-occupied Syrian Golan Heights. Hezbollah has said that it will halt operations only when the war in Gaza ends.\n\n\"The gradual expansion in the scope and scale of the confrontations well beyond the Blue Line significantly raises the risk of miscalculation and further deterioration of an already alarming situation,\" the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) told UN News, ahead of the latest escalation.\n\nCiting latest OCHA data, the UN force said that nearly 97,000 people have been displaced from southern Lebanon because of the ongoing hostilities as of 25 June; more than 1,800 casualties have been reported including 435 deaths of whom 97 were civilians. \"A political and diplomatic solution is the only viable long-term solution,\" it insisted.\n\nResponding to the school strike and Israeli military claims that it had been used by Palestinian armed groups, UNRWA's chief Mr. Lazzarini said that he took the allegations \"very seriously.\n\n\"It is exactly why I have repeatedly called for independent investigations to ascertain the facts and identify those responsible for attacks on UN premises or their misuse\", he said - a reference to an ongoing UN office investigation into Israeli assertions that 12 UNRWA staff were involved in the 7 October Hamas-led attacks.\n\nEight UNRWA staff remain under investigation by the UN's internal oversight body, OIOS; to date, it has suspended three other cases citing insufficient evidence from the Israeli authorities and closed one case because Israel had not provided any supporting evidence, it has been reported.\n\n\"Nine months on this brutal war, I call once again for a ceasefire under which people in Gaza and Israel would finally get respite and protection and all hostages would be immediately released,\" Mr. Lazzarini said.\n\n\"The longer this war goes on, the deeper the rift will become, & the more suffering people will endure.\"", "source": {"uri": "eurasiareview.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eurasia Review"}, "authors": [],

the only agency that has a mandate from the United Nations to provide relief and support to Palestinian refugees.\n\nAbdel Ati said \"suspending the financial contributions allocated to UNRWA is unacceptable, and means participating in the use of famine as a weapon of collective punishment against the Palestinians.\"\n\nAbswl Ati called on international community and international donor parties that are still suspending their contributions to reconsider the situation.\n\nHe affirmed that the agency is one of the most important United Nations agencies, because it works in the humanitarian field, especially in light of the blatant violations of international law and international humanitarian law witnessed by the occupied Palestinian territories, and this confirms the importance of UNRWA and its role in taking care of refugee affairs inside and outside the Palestinian territories.\n\nAbdel Ati stressed that UNRWA's work will not end until the Palestinian refugees obtain their rights, whether through return or compensation, in accordance with UN General Assembly Resolution No. 194.\n\nHe added \"The Republic of Egypt has a major and pivotal role in alleviating the suffering of our people in the Gaza Strip, as it provided more than 70% of the aid that entered the Gaza Strip, despite all the economic challenges it faces, in addition to providing treatment for the wounded in Egyptian hospitals.\"\n\nIn turn, Lazzarini said that about 200 employees were killed as a result of military operations in the Strip, more than 50% of our institutions were destroyed,

Since the war began, two thirds of UNRWA schools in Gaza have been hit, some were bombed out, many severely damaged,\" said Philippe Lazzarini, in a post on X.\n\nIn a statement posted on Tuesday, the Israeli military said it had been targeting \"terrorist infrastructure and terrorist operatives\" in Gaza City.\n\nOn Tuesday, at least 25 people were killed after an Israeli strike near a school building sheltering displaced Gazans in eastern Khan Younis, southern Gaza, according to the enclave's health authorities.\n\nOn Saturday, another strike left at least 16 dead at an UNRWA school in Nuseirat, central Gaza, followed a day later by a hit on a school in Gaza City that was reportedly sheltering hundreds of people.\n\nFurther Israeli strikes on Monday were reported on or near an UNRWA school in Nuseirat, UNRWA Director of Communications Juliette Touma told UN News, a media website.\n\n\"This is becoming commonplace; only in the past four days we've seen four schools come under attack,\" she said. Every time a school is hit \"dozens of people pay the price.\"\n\nThe UN agency - the largest humanitarian operator in Gaza - closed all of its schools when war erupted on 7 October.\n\n\"We've turned the vast majority of them into shelters and at some point we had one million people staying in our schools,\" Ms. Touma explained, adding that of the casualties from the latest school strikes, \"many\" were women and children.\n\nSince the war began, more than half of UNRWA's facilities - the vast majority of them schools - have been hit.\n\n\"Some were completely bombed out and are out of commission\", Ms. Touma continued, adding that since the war began, at least 600,000 children have seen their schools close.\n\n\"In the case of UNRWA most of them were used as shelters, but what this means is that if this war continues, we are on the verge of losing a whole generation of children,\" she continued.\n\n\"The longer children stay out of school, the more difficult it is for them to catch up on education losses; the higher the risk that they fall prey to exploitation, including child labour, child marriage, but also recruitment into armed groups, and recruitment into the fighting. So it is for the sake of those children that we must have a ceasefire\".\n\nIn response to allegations that the schools were being used by Hamas fighters or affiliates, the UNRWA official insisted that no UN facility should be used for military purposes, before reiterating repeated calls by the Commissioner-General for \"independent inquiries and investigations into all these very serious claims\".\n\n\"Civilian infrastructure, including schools, including shelters, including other facilities like health, clinics, or hospitals, must be protected at all times, including in times of conflict,\" Ms. Touma insisted.\n\nIn a related development, the UN sexual reproduction agency, UNFPA, warned that the humanitarian situation in Gaza continues to worsen, with \"severe suffering\" now the norm.\n\nCiting Gazan health authorities, UNFPA said that nearly 38,000 Palestinians have now been killed and more than 87,000 injured, with food, shelter, health and livelihood resources all \"critically low\".\n\nAcross the enclave some 1.9 million people remain forcibly uprooted by the conflict - often repeatedly - and evacuation orders issued by the Israeli military.\n\nGazans live in \"tents, overcrowded shelters, or on the streets without basic necessities\", the UN agency said, pointing to widespread feelings of hopelessness by people \"with little prospect of returning home or ending the conflict\".\n\n\"Severe obstacles\" in ensuring that humanitarian aid can reach those who need it continue to hamper the relief operation, the UNFPA situation update noted, listing \"crossing point closures and bureaucratic hurdles impeding life-saving assistance\".\n\nProblems associated with the breakdown in law and order in Gaza has also increased theft and violence, endangering humanitarian workers and their operations, according to the UN agency.\n\nIn addition, doctors continue to report rising numbers of preterm and low-birth-weight babies, \"indicators of severe malnutrition exacerbated by stress and fear among pregnant women\" UNFPA said, while also highlighting the high risk of gender-based violence (GBV) faced by women and adolescent girls, \"particularly those displaced, widowed, or unaccompanied\".\n\nDespite the challenges, UNFPA has distributed essential sexual reproductive health and GBV services in Gaza and the West Bank.\n\nThe UN agency and partners have also established two maternal health units for emergency births, provided menstrual hygiene products to thousands of women and girls and supported mobile medical points and deployed sexual and reproductive health teams to shelters.", "source": {"uri": "urdupoint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UrduPoint"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Many of the refugees for whom it provides primary education and health care are Palestinian-Jordanian dual citizens.\n\nInternational powers, Mr Safadi said, are obligated to guarantee not only humanitarian aid to the Palestinians but also health and education, especially in Gaza, where the situation \"remains disastrous\".\n\nIn a postwar scenario, no one is capable of restoring the education system in Gaza, except UNRWA, which used to provide schooling for 500,000 Palestinian pupils before the war, he said.\n\n\"UNRWA is an irreplaceable humanitarian agency,\" Mr Safadi said after the meeting.\n\nSince the war in Gaza began in October, about 200 of UNRWA's Palestinian staff in Gaza have been killed and many of its facilities have come under Israeli bombing. Israel has also imposed restrictions on aid deliveries, a significant proportion of which is ordinarily distributed by the relief agency.\n\nIn March, the US, which is UNRWA's main donor, along with 15 other countries, suspended funding following the accusations concerning agency staff. The bulk of the funding has since resumed, after most of the allegations have failed to be proven.\n\nThe agency is still affected by the episode, however, and has been in a \"very bad\" financial situation this year, Mr Lazzarini said. With current funding expected to last only until the end of next month, the organisation is living \"hand to mouth\", he added.\n\nWashington was instrumental in setting up UNRWA in 1949, a year after the creation of Israel.", "source": {"uri": "thenationalnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"}, "authors": [{"uri": "khaled_yacoub_oweis@thenationalnews.com", "name": "Khaled Yacoub Oweis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Lazzarini", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philippe Lazzarini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNRWA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UNRWA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_System", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Nations System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amman", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amman"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Amman"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Gaza_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2014 Gaza War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt\u2013Israel_peace_treaty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Egypt\u2013Israel peace treaty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_refugees", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian refugees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayman_Safadi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ayman Safadi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Levant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_world", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arab world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandate_for_Syria_and_the_Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_occupation_of_the_West_Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israeli occupation of the West Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Declaration_of_Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israeli Declaration of Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://thenational-the-national-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/QSTLEG3BW47WLXG7SXM4XUMOTM.jpg?smart=true&auth=04fd6202109007033556f691711754c76a20b0f32f14e92d118e2094b853e1e5&width=1200&height=630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713939", "eventUri": "eng-9713939", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 890, "textEnd": 899}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

On Sunday, Israeli forces struck a Gaza City school, killing four, including one Palestinian government official. And on Monday, Israel struck near a UNRWA school in Nuseirat, seemingly a separate school in the neighborhood, sending multiple people to the hospital.\n\nThe Israeli military claimed that they were striking \"terrorist infrastructure\" in attacks on Gaza City. A horrifying video published by Al Jazeera from the Tuesday strike on the Khan Yunis school, meanwhile, shows Palestinians playing soccer in the tightly packed school yard at the time Israel struck the facility, with the scene rapidly erupting into terror. The video shows bodies scattered around the yard, and witnesses said that there were body parts strewn everywhere after the bombing.\n\nThe New York Times identified a bomb used at the site as a U.S.-made GBU-39, a \"small diameter\" bomb that Israel has used extensively in its genocidal assault.\n\nIn all, Israeli attacks on schools have killed at least 50 Palestinians in the past four days alone.\n\nIsrael's streak of school strikes comes after its military struck yet another UN-run school last Thursday in Nuseirat, killing 40 people. That strike, CNN reported, used two of the U.S.-made GBU-39s.\n\n\"Since the war began, two thirds of UNRWA schools in Gaza have been hit, some were bombed out, many severely damaged,\" UNRWA Commissioner Philippe Lazzarini said. \"Nine months in, under our watch, the relentless, endless killings, destruction and despair continue.\"\n\nChildren in Gaza haven't been able to attend school since Israel began its current genocidal campaign in October, with 600,000 children being deprived of the education they need for healthy development. Most of the schools in Gaza, including UN-run facilities, have been turned into shelters for Palestinians who have been forcibly displaced by the genocide or Israel's decades of ethnic cleansing.\n\n\"Gaza is no place for children. The blatant disregard of international humanitarian law cannot become the new normal,\" Lazzarini continued.\n\nThe UN noted that Israel's strikes on schools have become \"commonplace\" amid Israel's assault. Indeed, this is at least the second time in a month that Israel has attacked schools multiple days in a row. In June, Israeli forces bragged about striking a UN school near Gaza City, killing at least three Palestinians and injuring 15, the day after bombing a UN school in Nuseirat, killing at least 40, including 14 children.\n\nIsrael's targeting of Gaza's education system, as well as the genocide at large, is endangering the futures of an entire generation of Palestinians, the UN warned.\n\n\"If this war continues, we are on the verge of losing a whole generation of children,\" said UNRWA communications director Juliette Touma. \"The longer children stay out of school, the more difficult it is for them to catch up on education losses; the higher the risk that they fall prey to exploitation, including child labour, child marriage, but also recruitment into armed groups, and recruitment into the fighting.

Since the war began, two thirds of UNRWA schools in Gaza have been hit, some were bombed out, many severely damaged,\" said Philippe Lazzarini, in a post on X.\n\nIn a statement posted on Tuesday, the Israeli military said it had been targeting \"terrorist infrastructure and terrorist operatives\" in Gaza City.\n\nOn Tuesday, at least 25 people were killed after an Israeli strike near a school building sheltering displaced Gazans in eastern Khan Younis, southern Gaza, according to the enclave's health authorities.\n\nOn Saturday, another strike left at least 16 dead at an UNRWA school in Nuseirat, central Gaza, followed a day later by a hit on a school in Gaza City that was reportedly sheltering hundreds of people.\n\nFurther Israeli strikes on Monday were reported on or near an UNRWA school in Nuseirat, UNRWA Director of Communications Juliette Touma told UN News, a media website.\n\n\"This is becoming commonplace; only in the past four days we've seen four schools come under attack,\" she said. Every time a school is hit \"dozens of people pay the price.\"\n\nThe UN agency - the largest humanitarian operator in Gaza - closed all of its schools when war erupted on 7 October.\n\n\"We've turned the vast majority of them into shelters and at some point we had one million people staying in our schools,\" Ms. Touma explained, adding that of the casualties from the latest school strikes, \"many\" were women and children.\n\nSince the war began, more than half of UNRWA's facilities - the vast majority of them schools - have been hit.\n\n\"Some were completely bombed out and are out of commission\", Ms. Touma continued, adding that since the war began, at least 600,000 children have seen their schools close.\n\n\"In the case of UNRWA most of them were used as shelters, but what this means is that if this war continues, we are on the verge of losing a whole generation of children,\" she continued.\n\n\"The longer children stay out of school, the more difficult it is for them to catch up on education losses; the higher the risk that they fall prey to exploitation, including child labour, child marriage, but also recruitment into armed groups, and recruitment into the fighting. So it is for the sake of those children that we must have a ceasefire\".\n\nIn response to allegations that the schools were being used by Hamas fighters or affiliates, the UNRWA official insisted that no UN facility should be used for military purposes, before reiterating repeated calls by the Commissioner-General for \"independent inquiries and investigations into all these very serious claims\".\n\n\"Civilian infrastructure, including schools, including shelters, including other facilities like health, clinics, or hospitals, must be protected at all times, including in times of conflict,\" Ms. Touma insisted.\n\nIn a related development, the UN sexual reproduction agency, UNFPA, warned that the humanitarian situation in Gaza continues to worsen, with \"severe suffering\" now the norm.\n\nCiting Gazan health authorities, UNFPA said that nearly 38,000 Palestinians have now been killed and more than 87,000 injured, with food, shelter, health and livelihood resources all \"critically low\".\n\nAcross the enclave some 1.9 million people remain forcibly uprooted by the conflict - often repeatedly - and evacuation orders issued by the Israeli military.\n\nGazans live in \"tents, overcrowded shelters, or on the streets without basic necessities\", the UN agency said, pointing to widespread feelings of hopelessness by people \"with little prospect of returning home or ending the conflict\".\n\n\"Severe obstacles\" in ensuring that humanitarian aid can reach those who need it continue to hamper the relief operation, the UNFPA situation update noted, listing \"crossing point closures and bureaucratic hurdles impeding life-saving assistance\".\n\nProblems associated with the breakdown in law and order in Gaza has also increased theft and violence, endangering humanitarian workers and their operations, according to the UN agency.\n\nIn addition, doctors continue to report rising numbers of preterm and low-birth-weight babies, \"indicators of severe malnutrition exacerbated by stress and fear among pregnant women\" UNFPA said, while also highlighting the high risk of gender-based violence (GBV) faced by women and adolescent girls, \"particularly those displaced, widowed, or unaccompanied\".\n\nDespite the challenges, UNFPA has distributed essential sexual reproductive health and GBV services in Gaza and the West Bank.\n\nThe UN agency and partners have also established two maternal health units for emergency births, provided menstrual hygiene products to thousands of women and girls and supported mobile medical points and deployed sexual and reproductive health teams to shelters.", "source": {"uri": "app.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Associated Press Of Pakistan"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It doesn't exist anywhere in the world -- just for Palestinians. It is their own agency,\" said Gur-Aryeh, referring to the humanitarian relief organization that draws its funding from the contributions of UN member states.\n\nIt has been operating in the West Bank, East Jerusalem, Gaza, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria for nearly 75 years.\n\n\"Most UNRWA employees are teachers. But what they teach is the destruction of Israel and the western world in general, hatred and violence.\"\n\n\"Now, we already know that UNRWA employees are active members of Hamas. There were letters that were found with the Hamas logo at the top that were sent to UNRWA headquarters, requesting that this person be made the principal of this school tomorrow. And it happened. He became principal of the school because of his ties to Hamas.\"\n\nGur-Aryeh has wide knowledge of international law and diplomacy. She joined the Israel Foreign Ministry in 1999 and served as spokesperson in New Delhi, vice consul general in Istanbul, deputy ambassador to Belgium and Luxembourg, and counselor for political affairs in Rome.\n\nShe is also a qualified advocate and mediator with a Bachelor's Degree in Law from Cambridge University in the United Kingdom, and a Master's Degree in Conflict Research, Management and Resolution from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.\n\n\"This is my area of expertise: According to the Geneva Convention, when a protected place is used for terrorism, it loses its protection,\" she said.\n\n\"This is something that many journalists forget. The moment there are weapons there, it loses its protection. It becomes a legitimate military objective,\" she added.\n\n\"So we know very well that UNRWA, for many years now, basically has become like an operative of Hamas. Basically, they are under the control of Hamas.\"\n\nConnections to terror\n\nAccording to an Israeli intelligence report obtained by DAILY TRIBUNE, a handful of ranking UNRWA employees and social workers have strong links to the Hamas terrorists.\n\nUNRWA school principal Hafez Mousa Mousa was said to have played a key role in the 7 October massacre of Israeli civilians as he reportedly notified other Hamas operatives to meet him at the border.\n\nAnother ranking UNRWA employee, school counselor Mousa Subhi Musa Al Qidra is said to be an assistant in the Khan Yunis Brigade Command that carried out the abductions in Israel.\n\nUNRWA mathematics teacher Rani Mohammad was also in the intelligence report for being an operative in communications and combat support of the Nusirat battalion and was said to be a prime mover in the kidnapping of Israeli civilians.\n\nUNRWA social worker Faisal Ali was identified as one of the leaders in the kidnappings in the southern Israeli area of Beeri and was the chief coordinator in the transfer of weapons and trucks.\n\nOn its official website, the aid and relief agency strongly denied that its employees had a hand in the deadly terror attack.\n\nThe names of the 12 individuals against whom allegations were made were all shared multiple times with Israel and other UN member states. Prior to January 2024, \"UNRWA did not receive any indication from the relevant authorities of any involvement of its staff in armed or militant groups,\" the agency, which has 30,000 staff across the

Since the war began, two thirds of\n\nUNRWA schools in Gaza have been hit, some were bombed out, many severely damaged,\" said Philippe Lazzarini, in a post on X.\n\nIn a statement posted on Tuesday, the Israeli military said it had been targeting \"terrorist infrastructure and terrorist operatives\" in Gaza City.\n\nOn Tuesday, at least 25 people were killed after an Israeli strike near a school building sheltering displaced Gazans in eastern Khan Younis, southern Gaza, according to the enclave's health authorities.\n\nOn Saturday, another strike left at least 16 dead at an UNRWA school in Nuseirat, central Gaza, followed a day later by a hit on a school in Gaza City that was reportedly sheltering hundreds of people.\n\nFurther Israeli strikes on Monday were reported on or near an UNRWA school in Nuseirat, UNRWA Director of Communications Juliette Touma told UN News.\n\n\"This is becoming commonplace; only in the past four days we've seen four schools come under attack,\" she said. Every time a school is hit \"dozens of people pay the price.\"\n\nThe UN agency - the largest humanitarian operator in Gaza - closed all of its schools when war erupted on 7 October in response to Hamas-led attacks on multiple targets in southern Israel that left some 1,250 dead and more than 250 taken hostage.\n\n\"We've turned the vast majority of them into shelters and at some point we had one million people staying in our schools,\" Ms. Touma explained, adding that of the casualties from the latest school strikes, \"many\" were women and children.\n\nSince the war began, more than half of UNRWA's facilities - the vast majority of them schools - have been hit.\n\n\"Some were completely bombed out and are out of commission\", Ms. Touma continued, adding that since the war began, at least 600,000 children have seen their schools close.\n\n\"In the case of UNRWA most of them were used as shelters, but what this means is that if this war continues, we are on the verge of losing a whole generation of children,\" she continued.\n\n\"The longer children stay out of school, the more difficult it is for them to catch up on education losses; the higher the risk that they fall prey to exploitation, including child labour, child marriage, but also recruitment into armed groups, and recruitment into the fighting. So it is for the sake of those children that we must have a ceasefire\".\n\nIn response to allegations that the schools were being used by Hamas fighters or affiliates, the UNRWA official insisted that no UN facility should be used for military purposes, before reiterating repeated calls by the Commissioner-General for \"independent inquiries and investigations into all these very serious claims\".\n\n\"Civilian infrastructure, including schools, including shelters, including other facilities like health, clinics, or hospitals, must be protected at all times, including in times of conflict,\" Ms. Touma insisted.\n\nIn a related development, the UN sexual reproduction agency, UNFPA, warned that the humanitarian situation in Gaza continues to worsen, with \"severe suffering\" now the norm.\n\nCiting Gazan health authorities, UNFPA said that nearly 38,000 Palestinians have now been killed and more than 87,000 injured, with food, shelter, health and livelihood resources all \"critically low\".\n\nAcross the enclave some 1.9 million people remain forcibly uprooted by the conflict - often repeatedly - and evacuation orders issued by the Israeli military.\n\nGazans live in \"tents, overcrowded shelters, or on the streets without basic necessities\", the UN agency said, pointing to widespread feelings of hopelessness by people \"with little prospect of returning home or ending the conflict\".\n\n\"Severe obstacles\" in ensuring that humanitarian aid can reach those who need it continue to hamper the relief operation, the UNFPA situation update noted, listing \"crossing point closures and bureaucratic hurdles impeding life-saving assistance\".\n\nProblems associated with the breakdown in law and order in Gaza has also increased theft and violence, endangering humanitarian workers and their operations, according to the UN agency.\n\nIn addition, doctors continue to report rising numbers of preterm and low-birth-weight babies, \"indicators of severe malnutrition exacerbated by stress and fear among pregnant women\" UNFPA said, while also highlighting the high risk of gender-based violence (GBV) faced by women and adolescent girls, \"particularly those displaced, widowed, or unaccompanied\".\n\nDespite the challenges, UNFPA has distributed essential sexual reproductive health and GBV services in Gaza and the West Bank.\n\nThe UN agency and partners have also established two maternal health units for emergency births, provided menstrual hygiene products to thousands of women and girls and supported mobile medical points and deployed sexual and reproductive health teams to shelters.", "source": {"uri": "news.un.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "UN News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

higher the risk that they fall prey to exploitation, including child labour, child marriage, but also recruitment into armed groups, and recruitment into the fighting.\"\n\nMs. Touma explained that UNRWA closed all of its schools when war erupted with the 7 October Hamas-led terror attacks, and turned them into shelters.\n\nIn a statement, the Israeli military claimed that it had been targeting \"terrorist infrastructure and terrorist operatives.\"\n\nA welcome medical development now with the announcement on Wednesday from the UN health agency that it has prequalified the first self-test for hepatitis C.\n\nThe kit, which is made by OraSure Technologies, has been specifically designed for use by people with no previous medical experience.\n\nIt comprises a single kit containing all the components needed to take the test, which the World Health Organization expects will boost much-needed access in low and middle-income countries to testing and diagnosis of hepatitis C - a virus that claims 3,500 lives every day.\n\nGlobally, 50 million people live with hepatitis C but less than four in 10 have been diagnosed, and just two in 10 have received treatment, said the UN health agency's Dr Meg Doherty, Director of the WHO's department of Global HIV, Hepatitis and Sexually Transmitted Infections.\n\nFinally, did you know that the energy required for data mining for bitcoins reached 121 terawatts last year - that's more than the amount consumed by most small countries.\n\nThis is just one of the concerning findings of a new report into the digital economy by UN trade agency UNCTAD, which insists that the thriving sector's negative environmental impact must be taken more seriously - and slowed by investment in renewables and global regulation.\n\nUNCTAD Secretary-General Rebeca Grynspan noted that energy consumption has increased significantly with the rise of technologies such as artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency.\n\nShe said that Bitcoin mining's energy consumption has 34-fold between 2015 and 2020, reaching around 121 terawatt hours, which is more than what Belgium or Finland consume per year.\n\nToday, some 5.4 billion people use the Internet, and the global digital economy is booming, with obvious upsides for many, but Ms. Grynspan highlighted that there are plenty of downsides too, particularly for developing countries whose natural riches are exploited.", "source": {"uri": "news.un.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "UN News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNRWA", "type": "wiki",

It was a moment of respite in the Gaza Strip -- but it did not last. Before the ball reached the ground, a large boom shook the yard, sending players and spectators fleeing in frenzied panic.\n\nThe Gazan authorities say that at least 27 people were killed on Tuesday in that explosion, which was caused by an Israeli airstrike near the entrance to a school turned shelter on the outskirts of Khan Younis, in southern Gaza.\n\nIyad Qadeh, who was sitting outside his home near the school property, said the day had been calm, without drones buzzing overhead. Then a warplane appeared and fired a missile toward a group of young men sitting at an internet cafe, he said.\n\n\"After that, it was screams and body parts everywhere,\" Mr. Qadeh said.\n\nPhilippe Lazzarini, head of the U.N. agency that helps Palestinians, UNRWA, said on Wednesday that it was the fourth strike in four days to hit or damage a school building in Gaza. Two-thirds of U.N. school buildings in the enclave have been hit since the start of the war, with more than 500 people killed, UNRWA said.\n\nThe Israeli military said the strike on Tuesday had been targeting a Hamas member who took part in the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel that set off the war. It did not release details on the identity of the Hamas member or whether the target had been killed. The military said it was \"looking into reports that civilians were harmed.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khan_Yunis", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Lazzarini", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philippe Lazzarini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNRWA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UNRWA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclave_and_exclave", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Enclave and exclave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 45}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/07/10/multimedia/10mideast-crisis-leadall-vqtm/10mideast-crisis-leadall-vqtm-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713939", "eventUri": "eng-9713939", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1457, "textEnd": 1463}], "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

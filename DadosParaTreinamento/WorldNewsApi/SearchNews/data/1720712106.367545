{"id": 231928598, "title": "'We won\u2019t be intimidated': Activists balk after right-wingers publish AR canvasser list", "text": "Supporters of a proposed Arkansas constitutional amendment that would allow a limited right to abortion denounced a conservative advocacy group\u2019s publication of a list of paid canvassers, calling the move an intimidation tactic. The right-wing Family Council posted Thursday on its website a list of 79 people that the Arkansans for Limited Government ballot question committee is paying to collect signatures from across the state. The committee needs 90,704 signatures from registered voters by July 5 for the proposed amendment to appear on the November ballot. The Family Council obtained the list of paid canvassers and their home cities via an Arkansas Freedom of Information Act request, according to the post. Ballot question committees do not have to submit lists of unpaid or volunteer canvassers to the state. AFLG released a statement Friday in response to the post. \u201cThe canvassers working tirelessly to collect petitions in support of the Arkansas Abortion Amendment are proud of the work they are doing to promote reproductive liberty in the state and to engage in direct democracy \u2014 they aren\u2019t hiding,\u201d the group stated. \u201cBut when the Family Council releases lists of their names and whereabouts to their network of anti-choice protestors who vehemently, and sometimes violently, disagree with our work, it puts our team at great risk for harassment, stalking, and other dangers. The Family Council\u2019s tactics are ugly, transparently menacing, and unworthy of Arkansas. We won\u2019t be intimidated.\u201d Other states\u2019 ballot successes provide model for Arkansas abortion initiative The Family Council\u2019s post is the second instance of alleged intimidation of abortion amendment supporters in less than two weeks. On May 30, canvasser Veronica McClane filmed an interaction between herself and Little Rock police, in which Officer Christopher Tollette told her that both Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and the Arkansas Martin Luther King Jr. Commission did not want her and others canvassing at the intersection of 9th and State streets. Tollette told McClane that canvassers could be arrested for obstructing traffic. The canvassers told reporters they were not blocking traffic but instead sought the attention of drivers from a public sidewalk. The Martin Luther King Jr. Commission, located at the 9th and Broadway intersection, attracted a slow-moving line of cars with a free food giveaway on May 30. Mark Edwards, the Little Rock Police Department\u2019s spokesman, told reporters that Sanders had nothing to do with the officers\u2019 presence and that Tollette misspoke when he mentioned her. Edwards also said the police arrived because a Martin Luther King Jr. Commission member claimed to have overheard a canvasser trying to coerce someone into signing the petition. The proposed amendment The Arkansas Abortion Amendment would not allow government entities to \u201cprohibit, penalize, delay or restrict abortion services within 18 weeks of fertilization.\u201d The proposal would also permit abortion services in cases of rape, incest, a fatal fetal anomaly or to \u201cprotect the pregnant female\u2019s life or physical health,\u201d and it would nullify any of the state\u2019s existing \u201cprovisions of the Constitution, statutes and common law\u201d that conflict with it. The Family Council claims this measure would allow \u201cthousands of elective abortions in Arkansas every year\u201d and \u201cpermit abortion through all nine months of pregnancy in many cases\u201d because of its health provisions despite the 18-week limit. The proposed amendment would alter Amendment 68 to the state Constitution, which currently states that Arkansas policy \u201cis to protect the life of every unborn child from conception until birth, to the extent permitted by the Federal Constitution,\u201d by adding \u201cand the Constitution of the State of Arkansas\u201d at the end. Arkansas Legislature saw wide range of maternal and reproductive health legislation in 2023 Amendment 68 states, \u201cNo public funds will be used to pay for any abortion, except to save the mother\u2019s life.\u201d The proposed amendment would not alter this statement, contrary to the Family Council\u2019s claim in Thursday\u2019s post. Abortion has been illegal in Arkansas, with a narrow exception to save the pregnant person\u2019s life, since June 2022 when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that made abortion a federally recognized right. Democratic state lawmakers introduced bills during the 2023 legislative session that would have created exceptions to the abortion ban for fatal fetal anomalies, child victims of incest and threats to the health of the pregnant person. Republican lawmakers voted down all three proposals in committee. The anti-abortion Arkansas Right to Life has been leading a \u201cDecline to Sign\u201d campaign encouraging voters not to sign petitions for the amendment. McClane said last week that opponents of the proposed amendment have attended AFLG\u2019s signing events in protest, which she said amounts to harassment.

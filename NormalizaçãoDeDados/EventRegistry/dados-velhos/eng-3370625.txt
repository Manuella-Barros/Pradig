(AP) Blake Bortles' career in Jacksonville could be nearing an end.\n\nCoach Doug Marrone opened up the team's quarterback job after Bortles' latest inconsistent performance Thursday night, giving Chad Henne a chance to start.\n\n\"I'm looking for someone who is going to lead this offense,\" Marrone said. \"I'm not happy with the performance. I'm not going to sit here and BS anyone. Everyone saw it out there. Whatever you want to call it, I'm still trying to evaluate who the best person is at that position.\"\n\nBortles completed 8 of 13 passes for 65 yards in a 12-8 preseason loss to Tampa Bay and headed to the sideline after four possessions that ended with punts. He missed Allen Robinson on two plays, including a woefully underthrown ball down the seam.\n\n\"Just didn't make a whole lot of plays,\" Bortles said. \"Missed a couple of throws down the field, and we were very stagnant as an offense.\"\n\nHenne got some work with the first-team offense, fueling speculation that Bortles had lost his grasp on the job. Even though the move had been planned beforehand, it gave the appearance that Marrone and football czar Tom Coughlin had wavered in their commitment to Bortles. Marrone confirmed it after the game.\n\n\"We're going to figure this thing out,\" Marrone said. \"It's just simple. I'm not going to try to make this thing complicated. I'm looking for the best person to lead our offense.\"\n\nMarrone and Coughlin had publicly supported Bortles all year, even picking up the fifth-year option in his rookie contract. But Marrone pulled the third overall pick in the 2014 NFL draft last week following two interceptions. Marrone said Bortles' \"arm looked tired.\" Bortles denied having any issues.\n\nBortles doesn't have a touchdown or a turnover in two preseason games.\n\n\"It's hard to not hear people booing,\" Bortles said. \"But if they're cheering or booing, it's kind of irrelevant, at least for me it is. I think you've got to treat adversity and prosperity the same way. They're not booing for no reason. They're booing because you didn't do your job.\"\n\nHenne's first pass should have resulted in a touchdown, but Keelan Cole dropped it at the goal line.

(AP) -- Jameis Winston continued his solid preseason, completing 21 of 29 passes for 196 yards and helping the Tampa Bay Buccaneers beat woeful Jacksonville 12-8 on Thursday night.\n\nWinston had two passes dropped, including what would have been a 43-yard touchdown strike to Mike Evans in the first quarter.\n\nThe Buccaneers (1-1) scored on their first three possessions, getting a short touchdown run from Doug Martin and two field goals from Nick Folk. Tampa Bay dominated Jacksonville in two quarters that featured mostly starters, outgaining the Jags 240-59 and looking like the much better team.\n\nFolk, who won the kicking job last week after the Bucs waived former second-round draft pick Roberto Aguayo, had an extra point blocked by Calais Campbell. He also missed a 47-yarder wide right in the fourth quarter.\n\nEvans finished with five catches for 57 yards, but missed a chance for a huge gain when he let Winston's perfectly thrown deep ball slip through his fingers. It was about the only thing that went right for the Jaguars (1-1).\n\nJacksonville's night went so awry that coach Doug Marrone now seemingly has open competitions at quarterback and place-kicker.\n\nBackup quarterback Chad Henne got some work with the first-team offense, fueling speculation that Blake Bortles has lost his grasp on the starting job.\n\nHenne entered late in the second quarter after Bortles played four series that ended in punts. Even though the move had been planned beforehand, it surely created the appearance that Marrone and football czar Tom Coughlin are wavering in their commitment to Bortles.\n\nMarrone and Coughlin have publicly supported Bortles all year, even picking up the fifth-year option in his rookie contract. But Marrone pulled the third overall pick in the 2014 NFL draft last week following two interceptions. Marrone said Bortles' \"arm looked tired.\" Bortles denied having any issues.\n\nBortles completed 8 of 13 passes for 65 yards against the Bucs. He doesn't have a touchdown or a turnover in two preseason games.\n\nHenne's first pass should have resulted in a touchdown, but Keelan Cole dropped it at the goal line. Henne finished 6-of-10 passing for 44 yards.\n\nJason Myers missed from 40 yards out, leaving him 1 for 4 on the season. He also missed an extra point in the fourth. The Jaguars don't have another kicker in camp, but that likely will change Friday.\n\nROOKIE WATCH\n\nDede Westbrook, a fourth-round draft pick from Oklahoma, finished with five catches for 101 yards. He was one of the few bright spots for Jacksonville. Westbrook and third-string quarterback Brandon Allen got the Jags to the 2-yard line in the final 2 minutes, but Allen misfired on a fourth-and-1 play.\n\nSITTING OUT\n\nThe Buccaneers played without two starters: cornerback Brent Grimes (leg laceration) and linebacker Devante Bond (sprained knee). The Jaguars were without rookie running back Leonard Fournette (foot), receiver Marqise Lee (ankle) and their top three cornerbacks. Jalen Ramsey, A.J. Bouye and Aaron Colvin did not dress.\n\nAWFUL START\n\nJacksonville, which wants to be a power run team, ran seven times for minus a yard in the opening half. The Jags managed four first downs and got booed by the home crowd when Bortles badly underthrew a wide-open Allen Robinson in the seam.\n\nINJURIES\n\nTampa Bay: Starting right tackle Demar Dotson left the game with a groin injury and did not return. Cornerback Josh Robinson injured a hamstring.\n\nJacksonville: Running back T.J. Yeldon injured his left hamstring and did not return. Cornerback Charles Gaines injured his right eye.\n\n___\n\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 The Associated Press.

(AP) -- Jameis Winston continued his solid preseason, completing 21 of 29 passes for 196 yards and helping the Tampa Bay Buccaneers beat woeful Jacksonville 12-8 on Thursday night.\n\nWinston had two passes dropped, including what would have been a 43-yard touchdown strike to Mike Evans in the first quarter.\n\nThe Buccaneers (1-1) scored on their first three possessions, getting a short touchdown run from Doug Martin and two field goals from Nick Folk. Tampa Bay dominated Jacksonville in two quarters that featured mostly starters, outgaining the Jags 240-59 and looking like the much better team.\n\nFolk, who won the kicking job last week after the Bucs waived former second-round draft pick Roberto Aguayo, had an extra point blocked by Calais Campbell. He also missed a 47-yarder wide right in the fourth quarter.\n\nSponsored Content: Sign up for a free webinar as DoD, Air Force and VA offer insights on cybersecurity strategies.\n\nEvans finished with five catches for 57 yards, but missed a chance for a huge gain when he let Winston's perfectly thrown deep ball slip through his fingers. It was about the only thing that went right for the Jaguars (1-1).\n\nJacksonville's night went so awry that coach Doug Marrone now seemingly has open competitions at quarterback and place-kicker.\n\nBackup quarterback Chad Henne got some work with the first-team offense, fueling speculation that Blake Bortles has lost his grasp on the starting job.\n\nHenne entered late in the second quarter after Bortles played four series that ended in punts. Even though the move had been planned beforehand, it surely created the appearance that Marrone and football czar Tom Coughlin are wavering in their commitment to Bortles.\n\nMarrone and Coughlin have publicly supported Bortles all year, even picking up the fifth-year option in his rookie contract. But Marrone pulled the third overall pick in the 2014 NFL draft last week following two interceptions. Marrone said Bortles' \"arm looked tired.\" Bortles denied having any issues.\n\nBortles completed 8 of 13 passes for 65 yards against the Bucs. He doesn't have a touchdown or a turnover in two preseason games.\n\nGSA gives per diem travel rates another bump for 2018\n\nHenne's first pass should have resulted in a touchdown, but Keelan Cole dropped it at the goal line. Henne finished 6-of-10 passing for 44 yards.\n\nJason Myers missed from 40 yards out, leaving him 1 for 4 on the season. He also missed an extra point in the fourth. The Jaguars don't have another kicker in camp, but that likely will change Friday.\n\nROOKIE WATCH\n\nDede Westbrook, a fourth-round draft pick from Oklahoma, finished with five catches for 101 yards. He was one of the few bright spots for Jacksonville. Westbrook and third-string quarterback Brandon Allen got the Jags to the 2-yard line in the final 2 minutes, but Allen misfired on a fourth-and-1 play.\n\nSITTING OUT\n\nThe Buccaneers played without two starters: cornerback Brent Grimes (leg laceration) and linebacker Devante Bond (sprained knee). The Jaguars were without rookie running back Leonard Fournette (foot), receiver Marqise Lee (ankle) and their top three cornerbacks. Jalen Ramsey, A.J. Bouye and Aaron Colvin did not dress.\n\nAWFUL START\n\nJacksonville, which wants to be a power run team, ran seven times for minus a yard in the opening half. The Jags managed four first downs and got booed by the home crowd when Bortles badly underthrew a wide-open Allen Robinson in the seam.\n\nINJURIES\n\nTampa Bay: Starting right tackle Demar Dotson left the game with a groin injury and did not return. Cornerback Josh Robinson injured a hamstring.\n\nJacksonville: Running back T.J. Yeldon injured his left hamstring and did not return. Cornerback Charles Gaines injured his right eye.\n\n___\n\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri":

(AP) -- Blake Bortles may have started his last game in Jacksonville.\n\nCoach Doug Marrone opened up the team's quarterback competition Thursday night after another inconsistent performance from Bortles, the third overall pick in the 2014 NFL draft.\n\nBortles completed 8 of 13 passes for 65 yards in a 12-8 exhibition loss to Tampa Bay. All four of his drives ended with punts. The first-team offense now has three points in Bortles' six preseason possessions.\n\nHe misfired to Allen Robinson twice Thursday, including a woefully underthrown pass down the seam that drew boos from the home crowd and caused some head-shaking on the sideline.\n\n\"It's hard to not hear people booing,\" Bortles said. \"But if they're cheering or booing, it's kind of irrelevant, at least for me it is. I think you've got to treat adversity and prosperity the same way. They're not booing for no reason. They're booing because you didn't do your job.\"\n\nBortles hasn't gotten it done in three-plus seasons.\n\nThe former Central Florida standout has 11 wins and 11 interceptions returned for touchdowns in 45 career starts.\n\nHis mechanics have mostly been a mess. His decision-making has been dreadful at times. And his confidence sure seemed crushed after an awkward few weeks of training camp.\n\nBortles had a five-interception performance during the team's first practice in full pads last month and has been up and down since. He seemingly got benched last week after throwing two picks early in practice.\n\nMarrone said Bortles' \"arm looked tired.\" Bortles denied having any issues. That was the first indication that Bortles' job security was in jeopardy.\n\nThe Jaguars probably should have seen this coming. After all, Marrone and offensive coordinator Nathaniel Hackett watched Bortles up close the last two years and knew all his flaws.\n\nBut instead of drafting a quarterback or bringing in a veteran to compete with Bortles, Jacksonville publicly supported him. Coughlin and general manager Dave Caldwell even picked up the fifth-year option in Bortles' rookie contract, which would pay him $19 million in 2018. The deal is guaranteed for injury only, meaning the team can part ways with Bortles and not owe him anything beyond this season.\n\nStill, putting Bortles on the field could be considered a financial risk.\n\nMarrone surely doesn't have money on his mind.\n\n\"I'm looking for someone who is going to lead this offense,\" Marrone said. \"I'm not happy with the performance. I'm not going to sit here and BS anyone. Everyone saw it out there. Whatever you want to call it, I'm still trying to evaluate who the best person is at that position.\"\n\nIt could be Chad Henne.\n\nThe 10th-year pro and former second-round pick by Miami completed 6 of 10 passes for 44 yards against the Bucs. Henne's first pass should have been a touchdown, but rookie Keelan Cole dropped it at the goal line.\n\nHenne started 22 games for Jacksonville between 2012 and 2014, but has backed up Bortles since. He has completed 59 percent of his passes for 12,931 yards, with 58 touchdowns and 63 interceptions.\n\n\"I always took it as I'm always competing and never really said I'm the backup even though that's the way it was,\" Henne said. \"I still study hard and try to prove in practice what I can do. All I can do is to try to get myself better prepared each week.\"\n\nHenne isn't a long-term solution. So Jacksonville surely will start over at the all-important position in 2018 by selecting a quarterback in what appears to be a strong draft class or signing one in what appears to be a solid free-agent fold.\n\n\"We're going to figure this thing out,\" Marrone said. \"It's just simple. I'm not going to try to make this thing complicated. I'm looking for the best person to lead our offense.\"\n\n___\n\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 The Associated Press.

(AP) Blake Bortles may have started his last game in Jacksonville.\n\nCoach Doug Marrone opened up the team's quarterback competition Thursday night after another inconsistent performance from Bortles, the third overall pick in the 2014 NFL draft.\n\nBortles completed 8 of 13 passes for 65 yards in a 12-8 exhibition loss to Tampa Bay. All four of his drives ended with punts. The first-team offense now has three points in Bortles' six preseason possessions.\n\nHe misfired to Allen Robinson twice Thursday, including a woefully underthrown pass down the seam that drew boos from the home crowd and caused some head-shaking on the sideline.\n\n\"It's hard to not hear people booing,\" Bortles said. \"But if they're cheering or booing, it's kind of irrelevant, at least for me it is. I think you've got to treat adversity and prosperity the same way. They're not booing for no reason. They're booing because you didn't do your job.\"\n\nBortles hasn't gotten it done in three-plus seasons.\n\nThe former Central Florida standout has 11 wins and 11 interceptions returned for touchdowns in 45 career starts.\n\nHis mechanics have mostly been a mess. His decision-making has been dreadful at times. And his confidence sure seemed crushed after an awkward few weeks of training camp.\n\nBortles had a five-interception performance during the team's first practice in full pads last month and has been up and down since. He seemingly got benched last week after throwing two picks early in practice.\n\nMarrone said Bortles' \"arm looked tired.\" Bortles denied having any issues. That was the first indication that Bortles' job security was in jeopardy.\n\nThe Jaguars probably should have seen this coming. After all, Marrone and offensive coordinator Nathaniel Hackett watched Bortles up close the last two years and knew all his flaws.\n\nBut instead of drafting a quarterback or bringing in a veteran to compete with Bortles, Jacksonville publicly supported him. Coughlin and general manager Dave Caldwell even picked up the fifth-year option in Bortles' rookie contract, which would pay him $19 million in 2018. The deal is guaranteed for injury only, meaning the team can part ways with Bortles and not owe him anything beyond this season.\n\nStill, putting Bortles on the field could be considered a financial risk.\n\nMarrone surely doesn't have money on his mind.\n\n\"I'm looking for someone who is going to lead this offense,\" Marrone said. \"I'm not happy with the performance. I'm not going to sit here and BS anyone. Everyone saw it out there. Whatever you want to call it, I'm still trying to evaluate who the best person is at that position.\"\n\nIt could be Chad Henne.\n\nThe 10th-year pro and former second-round pick by Miami completed 6 of 10 passes for 44 yards against the Bucs. Henne's first pass should have been a touchdown, but rookie Keelan Cole dropped it at the goal line.\n\nHenne started 22 games for Jacksonville between 2012 and 2014, but has backed up Bortles since. He has completed 59 percent of his passes for 12,931 yards, with 58 touchdowns and 63 interceptions.\n\n\"I always took it as I'm always competing and never really said I'm the backup even though that's the way it was,\" Henne said. \"I still study hard and try to prove in practice what I can do. All I can do is to try to get myself better prepared each week.\"\n\nHenne isn't a long-term solution. So Jacksonville surely will start over at the all-important position in 2018 by selecting a quarterback in what appears to be a strong draft class or signing one in what appears to be a solid free-agent fold.\n\n\"We're going to figure this thing out,\" Marrone said. \"It's just simple. I'm not going to try to make this thing complicated. I'm looking for the best person to lead our offense.\"\n\n--\n\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP-NFL", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100, "id": 25, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 100, "id": 28, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "wgt": 100, "id": 30, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100, "id": 32, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "wgt": 100, "id": 829, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job_Search", "wgt": 100, "id": 948, "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job Search"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville"}, "type": "loc", "id": "181844"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "type": "loc", "id": "182034"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tampa"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa,_Florida", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tampa"}, "type": "loc", "id": "182437"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302611", "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304976", "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305439", "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305661", "label": {"eng": "National Football League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305872", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306949", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punt_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "325513", "label": {"eng": "Punt (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "329510", "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thursday_Night_Football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "330672", "label": {"eng": "Thursday Night Football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake_Bortles", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "342528", "label": {"eng": "Blake Bortles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Robinson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "362447", "label": {"eng": "Allen Robinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Henne", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "390554", "label": {"eng": "Chad Henne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Marrone", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "472582", "label": {"eng": "Doug Marrone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathaniel_Hackett", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "863484", "label": {"eng": "Nathaniel Hackett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_NFL_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1272372", "label": {"eng": "2014 NFL draft"}}]}

(AP) - Jameis Winston continued his solid preseason, completing 21 of 29 passes for 196 yards and helping the Tampa Bay Buccaneers beat woeful Jacksonville 12-8 on Thursday night.\n\nWinston had two passes dropped, including what would have been a 43-yard touchdown strike to Mike Evans in the first quarter.\n\nThe Buccaneers (1-1) scored on their first three possessions, getting a short touchdown run from Doug Martin and two field goals from Nick Folk. Tampa Bay dominated Jacksonville in two quarters that featured mostly starters, outgaining the Jags 240-59 and looking like the much better team.\n\nFolk, who won the kicking job last week after the Bucs waived former second-round draft pick Roberto Aguayo, had an extra point blocked by Calais Campbell. He also missed a 47-yarder wide right in the fourth quarter.\n\nEvans finished with five catches for 57 yards, but missed a chance for a huge gain when he let Winston's perfectly thrown deep ball slip through his fingers. It was about the only thing that went right for the Jaguars (1-1).\n\nJacksonville's night went so awry that coach Doug Marrone now seemingly has open competitions at quarterback and place-kicker.\n\nBackup quarterback Chad Henne got some work with the first-team offense, fueling speculation that Blake Bortles has lost his grasp on the starting job.\n\nHenne entered late in the second quarter after Bortles played four series that ended in punts. Even though the move had been planned beforehand, it surely created the appearance that Marrone and football czar Tom Coughlin are wavering in their commitment to Bortles.\n\nMarrone and Coughlin have publicly supported Bortles all year, even picking up the fifth-year option in his rookie contract. But Marrone pulled the third overall pick in the 2014 NFL draft last week following two interceptions. Marrone said Bortles' \"arm looked tired.\" Bortles denied having any issues.\n\nBortles completed 8 of 13 passes for 65 yards against the Bucs. He doesn't have a touchdown or a turnover in two preseason games.\n\nHenne's first pass should have resulted in a touchdown, but Keelan Cole dropped it at the goal line. Henne finished 6-of-10 passing for 44 yards.\n\nJason Myers missed from 40 yards out, leaving him 1 for 4 on the season. He also missed an extra point in the fourth. The Jaguars don't have another kicker in camp, but that likely will change Friday.\n\nROOKIE WATCH\n\nDede Westbrook, a fourth-round draft pick from Oklahoma, finished with five catches for 101 yards. He was one of the few bright spots for Jacksonville. Westbrook and third-string quarterback Brandon Allen got the Jags to the 2-yard line in the final 2 minutes, but Allen misfired on a fourth-and-1 play.\n\nSITTING OUT\n\nThe Buccaneers played without two starters: cornerback Brent Grimes (leg laceration) and linebacker Devante Bond (sprained knee). The Jaguars were without rookie running back Leonard Fournette (foot), receiver Marqise Lee (ankle) and their top three cornerbacks. Jalen Ramsey, A.J. Bouye and Aaron Colvin did not dress.\n\nAWFUL START\n\nJacksonville, which wants to be a power run team, ran seven times for minus a yard in the opening half. The Jags managed four first downs and got booed by the home crowd when Bortles badly underthrew a wide-open Allen Robinson in the seam.\n\nINJURIES\n\nTampa Bay: Starting right tackle Demar Dotson left the game with a groin injury and did not return. Cornerback Josh Robinson injured a hamstring.\n\nJacksonville: Running back T.J. Yeldon injured his left hamstring and did not return. Cornerback Charles Gaines injured his right eye.\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(AP) -- Blake Bortles' career in Jacksonville could be nearing an end.\n\nCoach Doug Marrone opened up the team's quarterback job after Bortles' latest inconsistent performance Thursday night, giving Chad Henne a chance to start.\n\n\"I'm looking for someone who is going to lead this offense,\" Marrone said. \"I'm not happy with the performance. I'm not going to sit here and BS anyone. Everyone saw it out there. Whatever you want to call it, I'm still trying to evaluate who the best person is at that position.\"\n\nBortles completed 8 of 13 passes for 65 yards in a 12-8 preseason loss to Tampa Bay and headed to the sideline after four possessions that ended with punts. He missed Allen Robinson on two plays, including a woefully underthrown ball down the seam.\n\n\"Just didn't make a whole lot of plays,\" Bortles said. \"Missed a couple of throws down the field, and we were very stagnant as an offense.\"\n\nHenne got some work with the first-team offense, fueling speculation that Bortles had lost his grasp on the job. Even though the move had been planned beforehand, it gave the appearance that Marrone and football czar Tom Coughlin had wavered in their commitment to Bortles. Marrone confirmed it after the game.\n\n\"We're going to figure this thing out,\" Marrone said. \"It's just simple. I'm not going to try to make this thing complicated. I'm looking for the best person to lead our offense.\"\n\nMarrone and Coughlin had publicly supported Bortles all year, even picking up the fifth-year option in his rookie contract. But Marrone pulled the third overall pick in the 2014 NFL draft last week following two interceptions. Marrone said Bortles' \"arm looked tired.\" Bortles denied having any issues.\n\nBortles doesn't have a touchdown or a turnover in two preseason games.\n\n\"It's hard to not hear people booing,\" Bortles said. \"But if they're cheering or booing, it's kind of irrelevant, at least for me it is. I think you've got to treat adversity and prosperity the same way. They're not booing for no reason. They're booing because you didn't do your job.\"\n\nHenne's first pass should have resulted in a touchdown, but Keelan Cole dropped it at the goal line. Henne finished 6-of-10 passing for 44 yards.\n\nThe Jaguars also could have a kicking competition.\n\nJason Myers missed a field goal and an extra point. He has missed three of four field-goal attempts in two exhibitions. The Jaguars don't have another kicker in camp, but that could change Friday.\n\n\"I think that's something that we'll talk about,\" Marrone said.\n\nWINSTON SHINES\n\nJameis Winston continued his solid preseason, completing 21 of 29 passes for 196 yards for Tampa Bay.\n\nWinston had two passes dropped, including what would have been a 43-yard touchdown strike to Mike Evans in the first quarter.\n\nThe Buccaneers scored on their first three possessions, getting a short touchdown run from Doug Martin and two field goals from Nick Folk. Tampa Bay dominated Jacksonville in two quarters that featured mostly starters, outgaining the Jags 240-59 and looking like the much better team.\n\n\"We've got to finish,\" Winston said. \"We've got to have touchdowns in the red zone.\"\n\nCoach Dirk Koetter praised Winston's performance aside from an ill-advised throw that ended up being a sack.\n\n\"Other than that one play, he was extremely sharp,\" Koetter said. \"But we have extremely high standards for him as he does for himself. He took us right down the field, had a lot of run checks, converted on third downs. He did the things that quarterbacks like him are supposed to do, except for one play. ... Elite quarterbacks don't make that play.\"\n\nFOLK'S NIGHT\n\nBucs kicker Nick Folk, who won the job last week after the team waived former second-round draft pick Roberto Aguayo, had an extra point blocked by Calais Campbell. He also missed a 47-yarder wide right in the fourth quarter.\n\nSITTING OUT\n\nThe Buccaneers played without two starters: cornerback Brent Grimes (leg laceration) and linebacker Devante Bond (sprained knee). The Jaguars were without rookie running back Leonard Fournette (foot), receiver Marqise Lee (ankle) and their top three cornerbacks. Jalen Ramsey, A.J. Bouye and Aaron Colvin did not dress.\n\nINJURIES\n\nTampa Bay: Starting right tackle Demar Dotson left the game with a groin injury and did not return. Cornerback Josh Robinson injured a hamstring.\n\nJacksonville: Running back T.J. Yeldon injured his left hamstring and did not return. Cornerback Charles Gaines injured his right eye.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100, "id": 32, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American"},

All four of his drives ended with punts.

I'm looking for the best person to lead our offense.\"\n\n___\n\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100, "id": 25, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 100, "id": 28, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "wgt": 100, "id": 30, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100, "id": 32, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "wgt": 100, "id": 829, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job_Search", "wgt": 100, "id": 948, "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job Search"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville"}, "type": "loc", "id": "181844"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "type": "loc", "id": "182034"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tampa"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa,_Florida", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tampa"}, "type": "loc", "id": "182437"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302611", "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304976", "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305439", "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305661", "label": {"eng": "National Football League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305872", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "306949", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punt_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "325513", "label": {"eng": "Punt (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "329510", "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thursday_Night_Football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "330672", "label": {"eng": "Thursday Night Football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake_Bortles", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "342528", "label": {"eng": "Blake Bortles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WFED", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "356249", "label": {"eng": "WFED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Robinson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "362447", "label": {"eng": "Allen Robinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Henne", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "390554", "label": {"eng": "Chad Henne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Marrone", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "472582", "label": {"eng": "Doug Marrone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathaniel_Hackett", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "863484", "label": {"eng": "Nathaniel Hackett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_NFL_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "1272372", "label": {"eng": "2014 NFL draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sponsored_Content_(South_Park)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1283290", "label": {"eng": "Sponsored Content (South Park)"}}]}

(AP) -- Blake Bortles may have started his last game in Jacksonville.\n\nCoach Doug Marrone opened up the team's quarterback competition Thursday night after another inconsistent performance from Bortles, the third overall pick in the 2014 NFL draft.\n\nBortles completed 8 of 13 passes for 65 yards in a 12-8 exhibition loss to Tampa Bay. All four of his drives ended with punts. The first-team offense now has three points in Bortles' six preseason possessions.\n\nHe misfired to Allen Robinson twice Thursday, including a woefully underthrown pass down the seam that drew boos from the home crowd and caused some head-shaking on the sideline.\n\n\"It's hard to not hear people booing,\" Bortles said. \"But if they're cheering or booing, it's kind of irrelevant, at least for me it is. I think you've got to treat adversity and prosperity the same way. They're not booing for no reason. They're booing because you didn't do your job.\"\n\nBortles hasn't gotten it done in three-plus seasons.\n\nThe former Central Florida standout has 11 wins and 11 interceptions returned for touchdowns in 45 career starts.\n\nHis mechanics have mostly been a mess. His decision-making has been dreadful at times. And his confidence sure seemed crushed after an awkward few weeks of training camp.\n\nBortles had a five-interception performance during the team's first practice in full pads last month and has been up and down since. He seemingly got benched last week after throwing two picks early in practice.\n\nMarrone said Bortles' \"arm looked tired.\" Bortles denied having any issues. That was the first indication that Bortles' job security was in jeopardy.\n\nThe Jaguars probably should have seen this coming. After all, Marrone and offensive coordinator Nathaniel Hackett watched Bortles up close the last two years and knew all his flaws.\n\nBut instead of drafting a quarterback or bringing in a veteran to compete with Bortles, Jacksonville publicly supported him. Coughlin and general manager Dave Caldwell even picked up the fifth-year option in Bortles' rookie contract, which would pay him $19 million in 2018. The deal is guaranteed for injury only, meaning the team can part ways with Bortles and not owe him anything beyond this season.\n\nStill, putting Bortles on the field could be considered a financial risk.\n\nMarrone surely doesn't have money on his mind.\n\n\"I'm looking for someone who is going to lead this offense,\" Marrone said. \"I'm not happy with the performance. I'm not going to sit here and BS anyone. Everyone saw it out there. Whatever you want to call it, I'm still trying to evaluate who the best person is at that position.\"\n\nIt could be Chad Henne.\n\nThe 10th-year pro and former second-round pick by Miami completed 6 of 10 passes for 44 yards against the Bucs. Henne's first pass should have been a touchdown, but rookie Keelan Cole dropped it at the goal line.\n\nHenne started 22 games for Jacksonville between 2012 and 2014, but has backed up Bortles since. He has completed 59 percent of his passes for 12,931 yards, with 58 touchdowns and 63 interceptions.\n\n\"I always took it as I'm always competing and never really said I'm the backup even though that's the way it was,\" Henne said. \"I still study hard and try to prove in practice what I can do. All I can do is to try to get myself better prepared each week.\"\n\nHenne isn't a long-term solution. So Jacksonville surely will start over at the all-important position in 2018 by selecting a quarterback in what appears to be a strong draft class or signing one in what appears to be a solid free-agent fold.\n\n\"We're going to figure this thing out,\" Marrone said. \"It's just simple.

(AP) -- Jameis Winston continued his solid preseason, completing 21 of 29 passes for 196 yards and helping the Tampa Bay Buccaneers beat woeful Jacksonville 12-8 on Thursday night.\n\nWinston had two passes dropped, including what would have been a 43-yard touchdown strike to Mike Evans in the first quarter.\n\nThe Buccaneers (1-1) scored on their first three possessions, getting a short touchdown run from Doug Martin and two field goals from Nick Folk. Tampa Bay dominated Jacksonville in two quarters that featured mostly starters, outgaining the Jags 240-59 and looking like the much better team.\n\nFolk, who won the kicking job last week after the Bucs waived former second-round draft pick Roberto Aguayo, had an extra point blocked by Calais Campbell. He also missed a 47-yarder wide right in the fourth quarter.\n\nEvans finished with five catches for 57 yards, but missed a chance for a huge gain when he let Winston's perfectly thrown deep ball slip through his fingers. It was about the only thing that went right for the Jaguars (1-1).\n\nJacksonville's night went so awry that coach Doug Marrone now seemingly has open competitions at quarterback and place-kicker.\n\nBackup quarterback Chad Henne got some work with the first-team offense, fueling speculation that Blake Bortles has lost his grasp on the starting job.\n\nHenne entered late in the second quarter after Bortles played four series that ended in punts. Even though the move had been planned beforehand, it surely created the appearance that Marrone and football czar Tom Coughlin are wavering in their commitment to Bortles.\n\nMarrone and Coughlin have publicly supported Bortles all year, even picking up the fifth-year option in his rookie contract. But Marrone pulled the third overall pick in the 2014 NFL draft last week following two interceptions. Marrone said Bortles' \"arm looked tired.\" Bortles denied having any issues.\n\nBortles completed 8 of 13 passes for 65 yards against the Bucs. He doesn't have a touchdown or a turnover in two preseason games.\n\nHenne's first pass should have resulted in a touchdown, but Keelan Cole dropped it at the goal line. Henne finished 6-of-10 passing for 44 yards.\n\nJason Myers missed from 40 yards out, leaving him 1 for 4 on the season. He also missed an extra point in the fourth. The Jaguars don't have another kicker in camp, but that likely will change Friday.\n\nROOKIE WATCH\n\nDede Westbrook, a fourth-round draft pick from Oklahoma, finished with five catches for 101 yards. He was one of the few bright spots for Jacksonville. Westbrook and third-string quarterback Brandon Allen got the Jags to the 2-yard line in the final 2 minutes, but Allen misfired on a fourth-and-1 play.\n\nSITTING OUT\n\nThe Buccaneers played without two starters: cornerback Brent Grimes (leg laceration) and linebacker Devante Bond (sprained knee). The Jaguars were without rookie running back Leonard Fournette (foot), receiver Marqise Lee (ankle) and their top three cornerbacks. Jalen Ramsey, A.J. Bouye and Aaron Colvin did not dress.\n\nAWFUL START\n\nJacksonville, which wants to be a power run team, ran seven times for minus a yard in the opening half. The Jags managed four first downs and got booed by the home crowd when Bortles badly underthrew a wide-open Allen Robinson in the seam.\n\nINJURIES\n\nTampa Bay: Starting right tackle Demar Dotson left the game with a groin injury and did not return. Cornerback Josh Robinson injured a hamstring.\n\nJacksonville: Running back T.J. Yeldon injured his left hamstring and did not return. Cornerback Charles Gaines injured his right eye.\n\n___\n\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

(AP) -- Blake Bortles may have started his last game in Jacksonville.\n\nCoach Doug Marrone opened up the team's quarterback competition Thursday night after another inconsistent performance from Bortles, the third overall pick in the 2014 NFL draft.\n\nBortles completed 8 of 13 passes for 65 yards in a 12-8 exhibition loss to Tampa Bay. All four of his drives ended with punts. The first-team offense now has three points in Bortles' six preseason possessions.\n\nHe misfired to Allen Robinson twice Thursday, including a woefully underthrown pass down the seam that drew boos from the home crowd and caused some head-shaking on the sideline.\n\n\"It's hard to not hear people booing,\" Bortles said. \"But if they're cheering or booing, it's kind of irrelevant, at least for me it is. I think you've got to treat adversity and prosperity the same way. They're not booing for no reason. They're booing because you didn't do your job.\"\n\nBortles hasn't gotten it done in three-plus seasons.\n\nThe former Central Florida standout has 11 wins and 11 interceptions returned for touchdowns in 45 career starts.\n\nHis mechanics have mostly been a mess. His decision-making has been dreadful at times. And his confidence sure seemed crushed after an awkward few weeks of training camp.\n\nBortles had a five-interception performance during the team's first practice in full pads last month and has been up and down since. He seemingly got benched last week after throwing two picks early in practice.\n\nMarrone said Bortles' \"arm looked tired.\" Bortles denied having any issues. That was the first indication that Bortles' job security was in jeopardy.\n\nThe Jaguars probably should have seen this coming. After all, Marrone and offensive coordinator Nathaniel Hackett watched Bortles up close the last two years and knew all his flaws.\n\nBut instead of drafting a quarterback or bringing in a veteran to compete with Bortles, Jacksonville publicly supported him. Coughlin and general manager Dave Caldwell even picked up the fifth-year option in Bortles' rookie contract, which would pay him $19 million in 2018. The deal is guaranteed for injury only, meaning the team can part ways with Bortles and not owe him anything beyond this season.\n\nStill, putting Bortles on the field could be considered a financial risk.\n\nMarrone surely doesn't have money on his mind.\n\n\"I'm looking for someone who is going to lead this offense,\" Marrone said. \"I'm not happy with the performance. I'm not going to sit here and BS anyone. Everyone saw it out there. Whatever you want to call it, I'm still trying to evaluate who the best person is at that position.\"\n\nIt could be Chad Henne.\n\nThe 10th-year pro and former second-round pick by Miami completed 6 of 10 passes for 44 yards against the Bucs. Henne's first pass should have been a touchdown, but rookie Keelan Cole dropped it at the goal line.\n\nHenne started 22 games for Jacksonville between 2012 and 2014, but has backed up Bortles since. He has completed 59 percent of his passes for 12,931 yards, with 58 touchdowns and 63 interceptions.\n\n\"I always took it as I'm always competing and never really said I'm the backup even though that's the way it was,\" Henne said. \"I still study hard and try to prove in practice what I can do. All I can do is to try to get myself better prepared each week.\"\n\nHenne isn't a long-term solution. So Jacksonville surely will start over at the all-important position in 2018 by selecting a quarterback in what appears to be a strong draft class or signing one in what appears to be a solid free-agent fold.\n\n\"We're going to figure this thing out,\" Marrone said. \"It's just simple. I'm not going to try to make this thing complicated. I'm looking for the best person to lead our offense.\"\n\n___\n\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

They're booing because you didn't do your job.\"\n\nBortles hasn't gotten it done in three-plus seasons.\n\nThe former Central Florida standout has 11 wins and 11 interceptions returned for touchdowns in 45 career starts.\n\nHis mechanics have mostly been a mess. His decision-making has been dreadful at times. And his confidence sure seemed crushed after an awkward few weeks of training camp.\n\nBortles had a five-interception performance during the team's first practice in full pads last month and has been up and down since. He seemingly got benched last week after throwing two picks early in practice.\n\nMarrone said Bortles' \"arm looked tired.\" Bortles denied having any issues. That was the first indication that Bortles' job security was in jeopardy.\n\nThe Jaguars probably should have seen this coming. After all, Marrone and offensive coordinator Nathaniel Hackett watched Bortles up close the last two years and knew all his flaws.\n\nBut instead of drafting a quarterback or bringing in a veteran to compete with Bortles, Jacksonville publicly supported him. Coughlin and general manager Dave Caldwell even picked up the fifth-year option in Bortles' rookie contract, which would pay him $19 million in 2018. The deal is guaranteed for injury only, meaning the team can part ways with Bortles and not owe him anything beyond this season.\n\nStill, putting Bortles on the field could be considered a financial risk.\n\nMarrone surely doesn't have money on his mind.\n\n\"I'm looking for someone who is going to lead this offense,\" Marrone said. \"I'm not happy with the performance. I'm not going to sit here and BS anyone. Everyone saw it out there. Whatever you want to call it, I'm still trying to evaluate who the best person is at that position.\"\n\nIt could be Chad Henne.\n\nThe 10th-year pro and former second-round pick by Miami completed 6 of 10 passes for 44 yards against the Bucs. Henne's first pass should have been a touchdown, but rookie Keelan Cole dropped it at the goal line.\n\nHenne started 22 games for Jacksonville between 2012 and 2014, but has backed up Bortles since. He has completed 59 percent of his passes for 12,931 yards, with 58 touchdowns and 63 interceptions.\n\n\"I always took it as I'm always competing and never really said I'm the backup even though that's the way it was,\" Henne said. \"I still study hard and try to prove in practice what I can do. All I can do is to try to get myself better prepared each week.\"\n\nHenne isn't a long-term solution. So Jacksonville surely will start over at the all-important position in 2018 by selecting a quarterback in what appears to be a strong draft class or signing one in what appears to be a solid free-agent fold.\n\n\"We're going to figure this thing out,\" Marrone said. \"It's just simple. I'm not going to try to make this thing complicated. I'm looking for the best person to lead our offense.\"\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(AP) -- Blake Bortles may have started his last game in Jacksonville.\n\nCoach Doug Marrone opened up the team's quarterback competition Thursday night after another inconsistent performance from Bortles, the third overall pick in the 2014 NFL draft.\n\nBortles completed 8 of 13 passes for 65 yards in a 12-8 exhibition loss to Tampa Bay. All four of his drives ended with punts. The first-team offense now has three points in Bortles' six preseason possessions.\n\nHe misfired to Allen Robinson twice Thursday, including a woefully underthrown pass down the seam that drew boos from the home crowd and caused some head-shaking on the sideline.\n\n\"It's hard to not hear people booing,\" Bortles said. \"But if they're cheering or booing, it's kind of irrelevant, at least for me it is. I think you've got to treat adversity and prosperity the same way. They're not booing for no reason. They're booing because you didn't do your job.\"\n\nBortles hasn't gotten it done in three-plus seasons.\n\nThe former Central Florida standout has 11 wins and 11 interceptions returned for touchdowns in 45 career starts.\n\nHis mechanics have mostly been a mess. His decision-making has been dreadful at times. And his confidence sure seemed crushed after an awkward few weeks of training camp.\n\nBortles had a five-interception performance during the team's first practice in full pads last month and has been up and down since. He seemingly got benched last week after throwing two picks early in practice.\n\nMarrone said Bortles' \"arm looked tired.\" Bortles denied having any issues. That was the first indication that Bortles' job security was in jeopardy.\n\nThe Jaguars probably should have seen this coming. After all, Marrone and offensive coordinator Nathaniel Hackett watched Bortles up close the last two years and knew all his flaws.\n\nBut instead of drafting a quarterback or bringing in a veteran to compete with Bortles, Jacksonville publicly supported him. Coughlin and general manager Dave Caldwell even picked up the fifth-year option in Bortles' rookie contract, which would pay him $19 million in 2018. The deal is guaranteed for injury only, meaning the team can part ways with Bortles and not owe him anything beyond this season.\n\nStill, putting Bortles on the field could be considered a financial risk.\n\nMarrone surely doesn't have money on his mind.\n\n\"I'm looking for someone who is going to lead this offense,\" Marrone said. \"I'm not happy with the performance. I'm not going to sit here and BS anyone. Everyone saw it out there. Whatever you want to call it, I'm still trying to evaluate who the best person is at that position.\"\n\nIt could be Chad Henne.\n\nThe 10th-year pro and former second-round pick by Miami completed 6 of 10 passes for 44 yards against the Bucs. Henne's first pass should have been a touchdown, but rookie Keelan Cole dropped it at the goal line.\n\nHenne started 22 games for Jacksonville between 2012 and 2014, but has backed up Bortles since. He has completed 59 percent of his passes for 12,931 yards, with 58 touchdowns and 63 interceptions.\n\n\"I always took it as I'm always competing and never really said I'm the backup even though that's the way it was,\" Henne said. \"I still study hard and try to prove in practice what I can do. All I can do is to try to get myself better prepared each week.\"\n\nHenne isn't a long-term solution. So Jacksonville surely will start over at the all-important position in 2018 by selecting a quarterback in what appears to be a strong draft class or signing one in what appears to be a solid free-agent fold.\n\n\"We're going to figure this thing out,\" Marrone said. \"It's just simple. I'm not going to try to make this thing complicated. I'm looking for the best person to lead our offense.\"\n\n___\n\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100, "id": 25, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 100, "id": 28, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "wgt": 100, "id": 30, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100, "id": 32, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "wgt": 100, "id": 829, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job_Search", "wgt": 100, "id": 948, "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job Search"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville"}, "type": "loc", "id": "181844"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "type": "loc", "id": "182034"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tampa"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa,_Florida", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tampa"}, "type": "loc", "id": "182437"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302611", "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304976", "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305439", "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305661", "label": {"eng": "National Football League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305872", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306949", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punt_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "325513", "label": {"eng": "Punt (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "329510", "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thursday_Night_Football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "330672", "label": {"eng": "Thursday Night Football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake_Bortles", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "342528", "label": {"eng": "Blake Bortles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Robinson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "362447", "label": {"eng": "Allen Robinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Henne", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "390554", "label": {"eng": "Chad Henne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Marrone", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "472582", "label": {"eng": "Doug Marrone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathaniel_Hackett", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "863484", "label": {"eng": "Nathaniel Hackett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_NFL_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1272372", "label": {"eng": "2014 NFL draft"}}]}

(AP) -- Jameis Winston continued his solid preseason, completing 21 of 29 passes for 196 yards and helping the Tampa Bay Buccaneers beat woeful Jacksonville 12-8 on Thursday night.\n\nWinston had two passes dropped, including what would have been a 43-yard touchdown strike to Mike Evans in the first quarter.\n\nThe Buccaneers (1-1) scored on their first three possessions, getting a short touchdown run from Doug Martin and two field goals from Nick Folk. Tampa Bay dominated Jacksonville in two quarters that featured mostly starters, outgaining the Jags 240-59 and looking like the much better team.\n\nFolk, who won the kicking job last week after the Bucs waived former second-round draft pick Roberto Aguayo, had an extra point blocked by Calais Campbell. He also missed a 47-yarder wide right in the fourth quarter.\n\nEvans finished with five catches for 57 yards, but missed a chance for a huge gain when he let Winston's perfectly thrown deep ball slip through his fingers. It was about the only thing that went right for the Jaguars (1-1).\n\nJacksonville's night went so awry that coach Doug Marrone now seemingly has open competitions at quarterback and place-kicker.\n\nBackup quarterback Chad Henne got some work with the first-team offense, fueling speculation that Blake Bortles has lost his grasp on the starting job.\n\nHenne entered late in the second quarter after Bortles played four series that ended in punts. Even though the move had been planned beforehand, it surely created the appearance that Marrone and football czar Tom Coughlin are wavering in their commitment to Bortles.\n\nMarrone and Coughlin have publicly supported Bortles all year, even picking up the fifth-year option in his rookie contract. But Marrone pulled the third overall pick in the 2014 NFL draft last week following two interceptions. Marrone said Bortles' \"arm looked tired.\" Bortles denied having any issues.\n\nBortles completed 8 of 13 passes for 65 yards against the Bucs. He doesn't have a touchdown or a turnover in two preseason games.\n\nHenne's first pass should have resulted in a touchdown, but Keelan Cole dropped it at the goal line. Henne finished 6-of-10 passing for 44 yards.\n\nJason Myers missed from 40 yards out, leaving him 1 for 4 on the season. He also missed an extra point in the fourth. The Jaguars don't have another kicker in camp, but that likely will change Friday.\n\nROOKIE WATCH\n\nDede Westbrook, a fourth-round draft pick from Oklahoma, finished with five catches for 101 yards. He was one of the few bright spots for Jacksonville. Westbrook and third-string quarterback Brandon Allen got the Jags to the 2-yard line in the final 2 minutes, but Allen misfired on a fourth-and-1 play.\n\nSITTING OUT\n\nThe Buccaneers played without two starters: cornerback Brent Grimes (leg laceration) and linebacker Devante Bond (sprained knee). The Jaguars were without rookie running back Leonard Fournette (foot), receiver Marqise Lee (ankle) and their top three cornerbacks. Jalen Ramsey, A.J. Bouye and Aaron Colvin did not dress.\n\nAWFUL START\n\nJacksonville, which wants to be a power run team, ran seven times for minus a yard in the opening half. The Jags managed four first downs and got booed by the home crowd when Bortles badly underthrew a wide-open Allen Robinson in the seam.\n\nINJURIES\n\nTampa Bay: Starting right tackle Demar Dotson left the game with a groin injury and did not return. Cornerback Josh Robinson injured a hamstring.\n\nJacksonville: Running back T.J. Yeldon injured his left hamstring and did not return. Cornerback Charles Gaines injured his right eye.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100, "id": 32, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American"},

(AP) Jameis Winston continued his solid preseason, completing 21 of 29 passes for 196 yards and helping the Tampa Bay Buccaneers beat woeful Jacksonville 12-8 on Thursday night.\n\nWinston had two passes dropped, including what would have been a 43-yard touchdown strike to Mike Evans in the first quarter.\n\nThe Buccaneers (1-1) scored on their first three possessions, getting a short touchdown run from Doug Martin and two field goals from Nick Folk. Tampa Bay dominated Jacksonville in two quarters that featured mostly starters, outgaining the Jags 240-59 and looking like the much better team.\n\nFolk, who won the kicking job last week after the Bucs waived former second-round draft pick Roberto Aguayo, had an extra point blocked by Calais Campbell. He also missed a 47-yarder wide right in the fourth quarter.\n\nEvans finished with five catches for 57 yards, but missed a chance for a huge gain when he let Winston's perfectly thrown deep ball slip through his fingers. It was about the only thing that went right for the Jaguars (1-1).\n\nJacksonville's night went so awry that coach Doug Marrone now seemingly has open competitions at quarterback and place-kicker.\n\nBackup quarterback Chad Henne got some work with the first-team offense, fueling speculation that Blake Bortles has lost his grasp on the starting job.\n\nHenne entered late in the second quarter after Bortles played four series that ended in punts. Even though the move had been planned beforehand, it surely created the appearance that Marrone and football czar Tom Coughlin are wavering in their commitment to Bortles.\n\nMarrone and Coughlin have publicly supported Bortles all year, even picking up the fifth-year option in his rookie contract. But Marrone pulled the third overall pick in the 2014 NFL draft last week following two interceptions. Marrone said Bortles' \"arm looked tired.\" Bortles denied having any issues.\n\nBortles completed 8 of 13 passes for 65 yards against the Bucs. He doesn't have a touchdown or a turnover in two preseason games.\n\nHenne's first pass should have resulted in a touchdown, but Keelan Cole dropped it at the goal line. Henne finished 6-of-10 passing for 44 yards.\n\nJason Myers missed from 40 yards out, leaving him 1 for 4 on the season. He also missed an extra point in the fourth. The Jaguars don't have another kicker in camp, but that likely will change Friday.\n\nROOKIE WATCH\n\nDede Westbrook, a fourth-round draft pick from Oklahoma, finished with five catches for 101 yards. He was one of the few bright spots for Jacksonville. Westbrook and third-string quarterback Brandon Allen got the Jags to the 2-yard line in the final 2 minutes, but Allen misfired on a fourth-and-1 play.\n\nSITTING OUT\n\nThe Buccaneers played without two starters: cornerback Brent Grimes (leg laceration) and linebacker Devante Bond (sprained knee). The Jaguars were without rookie running back Leonard Fournette (foot), receiver Marqise Lee (ankle) and their top three cornerbacks. Jalen Ramsey, A.J. Bouye and Aaron Colvin did not dress.\n\nAWFUL START\n\nJacksonville, which wants to be a power run team, ran seven times for minus a yard in the opening half. The Jags managed four first downs and got booed by the home crowd when Bortles badly underthrew a wide-open Allen Robinson in the seam.\n\nINJURIES\n\nTampa Bay: Starting right tackle Demar Dotson left the game with a groin injury and did not return. Cornerback Josh Robinson injured a hamstring.\n\nJacksonville: Running back T.J. Yeldon injured his left hamstring and did not return. Cornerback Charles Gaines injured his right eye.\n\n--\n\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP-NFL", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri":

I told them what I'm looking for is, I'm looking for someone that's going to lead this offense, so I'm not happy with the performance today,\" Marrone said, via ESPN.com.\n\nThe Jaguars coach insinuated that he's going to have an open quarterback competition between Bortles and Chad Henne to determine who'll be the team's starter at Houston for a game that's just over three weeks away.\n\n\"I'm not gonna sit here and B.S. anyone, I mean, everyone saw it out there,\" Marrone said. \"Whatever you want to call it, I'm still trying to evaluate who the best person is at that position. I told that to both quarterbacks.\"\n\nAlthough Bortles didn't put up horrible numbers against Tampa Bay (8 of 13 for 65 yards), the truth is, it might have been the most painful 8 of 13 game in NFL history. Bortles had trouble hitting receivers when they were wide open, and the only passes he managed to complete came mostly due to the fact that he was making short, safe throws.\n\nThings actually got so bad for Bortles that the fans in Jacksonville started booing him after he overthrew Allen Robinson on a play early in the second quarter.\n\nsp11: Bortles. Yikes. ESPN Monday Night Football: Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Jacksonville Jagu... https://t.co/rwmL62PUCLpic.twitter.com/mKZClHletT -- FanSportsClips (@FanSportsClips)\n\nAugust 18, 2017\n\nEventually, Marrone decided to pull Bortles from the game and put Henne in with the first team, but that didn't do much to spark the Jags.\n\n\"I need someone to lead this offense,\" Marrone said.\n\nMarrone did make one thing clear about the quarterback situation: It doesn't sound like he wants to bring in a free agent quarterback at this point in the preseason.\n\n\"I don't work with the 'outside the roster stuff,'\" Marrone said when asked if the starter might not be on the roster yet. \"So for me, I can't answer that question. I work with what we have.\"\n\nThat comment ostensibly rules out Colin Kaepernick as the possible starter in Jacksonville, which is too bad for the fan below.\n\nAs for Bortles, he clearly wasn't happy with how he played. The fourth year starter didn't stick around for a postgame interview, which is something you usually don't see with a starting quarterback.\n\nBortles has been one of the most inconsistent quarterbacks since 2014 when the Jaguars made him the No. 3 overall pick in the NFL Draft. Although the Jaguars recently picked up Bortles' fifth-year option, which gives them his rights through the 2018 season, that doesn't necessarily mean he'll be on the team that long.\n\nThe option is only guaranteed for injury, which means if Bortles doesn't get injured in 2017, the Jaguars can cut him at the end of the season and not owe him any money for 2018.\n\nIf Henne were to be the Jags' Week 1 starter, that means the former Michigan quarterback would be making his first NFL start since 2014.\n\nNo matter who starts, the Jaguars are exactly where you don't want to be at this point in the preseason: They're three weeks away from their regular season opener and they have no idea who their starting quarterback is going to be.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100, "id": 25, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 100, "id": 31, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100, "id": 32, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "wgt": 100, "id": 51, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice_Hockey", "wgt": 100, "id": 435, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice Hockey"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "wgt": 100, "id": 829, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville"}, "type": "loc", "id": "181844"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tampa"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa,_Florida", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tampa"}, "type": "loc", "id": "182437"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305661", "label": {"eng": "National Football League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305872", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306949", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League_Draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "309406", "label": {"eng": "National Football League Draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "310476", "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_lineup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "316239", "label": {"eng": "Starting lineup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monday_Night_Football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "323763", "label": {"eng": "Monday Night Football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "327676", "label": {"eng": "ESPN.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "329510", "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake_Bortles", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "342528", "label": {"eng": "Blake Bortles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Robinson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "362447", "label": {"eng": "Allen Robinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Henne", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "390554", "label": {"eng": "Chad Henne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Kaepernick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "395519", "label": {"eng": "Colin Kaepernick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Marrone", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "472582", "label": {"eng": "Doug Marrone"}}]}

Tampa Bay dominated Jacksonville in two quarters that featured mostly starters, outgaining the Jags 240-59 and looking like the much better team.\n\nFolk, who won the kicking job last week after the Bucs waived former second-round draft pick Roberto Aguayo, had an extra point blocked by Calais Campbell. He also missed a 47-yarder wide right in the fourth quarter.\n\nEvans finished with five catches for 57 yards, but missed a chance for a huge gain when he let Winston's perfectly thrown deep ball slip through his fingers. It was about the only thing that went right for the Jaguars (1-1).\n\nJacksonville's night went so awry that coach Doug Marrone now seemingly has open competitions at quarterback and place-kicker.\n\nBackup quarterback Chad Henne got some work with the first-team offense, fueling speculation that Blake Bortles has lost his grasp on the starting job.\n\nHenne entered late in the second quarter after Bortles played four series that ended in punts. Even though the move had been planned beforehand, it surely created the appearance that Marrone and football czar Tom Coughlin are wavering in their commitment to Bortles.\n\nMarrone and Coughlin have publicly supported Bortles all year, even picking up the fifth-year option in his rookie contract. But Marrone pulled the third overall pick in the 2014 NFL draft last week following two interceptions. Marrone said Bortles' \"arm looked tired.\" Bortles denied having any issues.\n\nBortles completed 8 of 13 passes for 65 yards against the Bucs. He doesn't have a touchdown or a turnover in two preseason games.\n\nHenne's first pass should have resulted in a touchdown, but Keelan Cole dropped it at the goal line. Henne finished 6-of-10 passing for 44 yards.\n\nJason Myers missed from 40 yards out, leaving him 1 for 4 on the season. He also missed an extra point in the fourth. The Jaguars don't have another kicker in camp, but that likely will change Friday.\n\nROOKIE WATCH\n\nDede Westbrook, a fourth-round draft pick from Oklahoma, finished with five catches for 101 yards. He was one of the few bright spots for Jacksonville. Westbrook and third-string quarterback Brandon Allen got the Jags to the 2-yard line in the final 2 minutes, but Allen misfired on a fourth-and-1 play.\n\nSITTING OUT\n\nThe Buccaneers played without two starters: cornerback Brent Grimes (leg laceration) and linebacker Devante Bond (sprained knee). The Jaguars were without rookie running back Leonard Fournette (foot), receiver Marqise Lee (ankle) and their top three cornerbacks. Jalen Ramsey, A.J. Bouye and Aaron Colvin did not dress.\n\nAWFUL START\n\nJacksonville, which wants to be a power run team, ran seven times for minus a yard in the opening half. The Jags managed four first downs and got booed by the home crowd when Bortles badly underthrew a wide-open Allen Robinson in the seam.\n\nINJURIES\n\nTampa Bay: Starting right tackle Demar Dotson left the game with a groin injury and did not return. Cornerback Josh Robinson injured a hamstring.\n\nJacksonville: Running back T.J. Yeldon injured his left hamstring and did not return. Cornerback Charles Gaines injured his right eye.\n\n___\n\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri":

After a particularly rough performance, even by Bortles's standards, head coach Doug Marrone announced after the game that the quarterback job was \"up for grabs.\"\n\nBortles finished the Jaguars' 12-8 loss to Tampa Bay Thursday night 8-of-13 for 65 yards, while Chad Henne finished 6-of-10 for 44 yards. The stat lines may look uninspired, but it's the tape that should strike fear into Jaguars fans' hearts.\n\nAllen Robinson had Bucs corner Javien Elliott beat so badly on this throw you could have fit an entire Hard Knocks camera crew between them. Working from flawless pass protection, Bortles underthrew Robinson by 5 full yards, though Robinson was so open that the corner still barely got his hand on the ball. This is ugly by college standards, and probably some Florida high school standards, too. Sadly, throws like this from Bortles come with an alarming consistency.\n\nThe writing to replace Bortles has been on the wall all training camp (if not the last two years), but it has been impossible to ignore this week. Bortles badly overthrew Robinson at training camp on Tuesday, and the receiver had some colorful advice for his quarterback after barreling into someone on the sideline trying to make the catch.\n\nThe next day, Jaguars cornerback Jalen Ramsey, one of the two best players on the team, liked this on Instagram:\n\n.\n\nBackup quarterback Chad Henne was the man who replaced Bortles on Thursday. Marrone had previously emphasized that Henne was the backup quarterback, but he had a change of heart during the game and sent Henne out with the starting offense at the end of the first half, a clear message to Bortles. After the game, Marrone verbalized that message, saying of the Jaguars starting quarterback job, \"It's right up there for grabs, and either person can take it.\" (If only Bortles could throw footballs up for grabs that his receivers could take.) Even the eternally optimistic Jon Gruden suggested during Thursday's broadcast that Bortles should sit for at least the beginning of the year and fix his mechanics. Fourth-year quarterbacks shouldn't need to relearn how to throw a football, but such is the plight of the Jacksonville Jaguars.\n\nAnd yet if you squint really hard and use your imagination, there is hope. One of the few bright spots for Jacksonville on the night was Brandon Allen, the Jaguars' 2016 sixth-round pick out of Arkansas, who finished 10-of-15 for 144 yards and a touchdown and added 27 yards on three rushes. Allen showed some impressive poise when the righty rolled to his left and found Marquez Williams at the pylon for the Jaguars offense's only points of the night. Marrone said that Allen is in consideration for the job, and with the paltry level of competition, he just might earn it.\n\nNo matter who wins the Jaguars' quarterback battle, just opening up the competition signals the beginning of the end of the Bortles experiment in Jacksonville. Nothing in Bortles' 2016 indicated he could lead an NFL team, but Jacksonville executive vice president of football operations and organizational Godfather Tom Coughlin didn't sign or draft any notable signal-callers in the offseason (passing on now-division-rival Deshaun Watson). Now the team boasts what should be a decent defense and some talented skill players with a black hole at quarterback. The Jags appear to be back to square one under center (or more accurately, have finally admitted they've been there for a while now).", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 100, "id": 31, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100, "id": 32, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "wgt": 100, "id": 447, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "wgt": 100, "id": 463, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "wgt": 100, "id": 829, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job_Search", "wgt": 100, "id": 948, "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job Search"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "type": "loc", "id": "181655"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville"}, "type": "loc", "id": "181844"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tampa"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa,_Florida", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tampa"}, "type": "loc", "id": "182437"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302552", "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302611", "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "303287", "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304975", "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305436", "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "305661", "label": {"eng": "National Football League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305872", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "306949", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Knocks_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "310123", "label": {"eng": "Hard Knocks (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "329510", "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thursday_Night_Football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "330672", "label": {"eng": "Thursday Night Football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake_Bortles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "342528", "label": {"eng": "Blake Bortles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Gruden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "343233", "label": {"eng": "Jon Gruden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Robinson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "362447", "label": {"eng": "Allen Robinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Coughlin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "379853", "label": {"eng": "Tom Coughlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Henne", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "390554", "label": {"eng": "Chad Henne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Marrone", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "472582", "label": {"eng": "Doug Marrone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Ramsey", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1274687", "label": {"eng": "Jalen Ramsey"}}]}

He also was sacked once. He has completed 11 of 18 passes for 81 yards with no touchdowns and no interceptions in two preseason games.\n\nHenne threw two passes in his one drive in the first half, both of which were dropped in the end zone by Keelan Cole and Allen Robinson. Jacksonville trailed 12-0 at halftime.\n\nDespite saying the starters would play just the first half, Jaguars coach Doug Marrone sent the first-team offense back on the field with Henne to start the third quarter.\n\nMarrone told ESPN at halftime that he did this because he was upset with the entire offense's performance, emphasizing he thought it was all 11 players and not just Bortles.\n\nAside from the second part of last Sunday's practice, Henne has worked exclusively with the second-team offense. Henne took those first-team reps last Sunday because coach Doug Marrone said he wanted to rest Bortles, saying Bortles' arm \"looked tired.\" Marrone also said the move was not made in response to the two interceptions Bortles threw in the first part of the practice. Two days later, Bortles said his arm was fine.\n\nBortles has had an up-and-down training camp, with the lowlight being a five-interception practice on the first day the team was in full pads, in what is a make-or-break season. Bortles, who has committed the most turnovers (63) and thrown the second-most interceptions (51) in the NFL over the past three seasons, has won just 11 games as a starter and has thrown 11 pick sixes.\n\nThe Jaguars did not bring in any quarterbacks in the offseason to compete with Bortles and instead planned on building the offense around the run game, which is why the team drafted Leonard Fournette fourth overall.\n\nThe team picked up Bortles' fifth-year option for 2018, but that's guaranteed for injury only. If the Jaguars decide Bortles is no longer their quarterback of the future they can cut him after this season without owing him any money as long as he isn't injured.\n\nHenne has played just one snap since Week 3 of the 2014 season and has thrown 58 touchdowns and 63 interceptions in 53 starts with Miami and Jacksonville.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100, "id": 25, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 100, "id": 28, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "wgt": 100, "id": 30, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100, "id": 32, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice_Hockey", "wgt": 100, "id": 435, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice Hockey"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville"}, "type": "loc", "id": "181844"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tampa"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa,_Florida", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tampa"}, "type": "loc", "id": "182437"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302611", "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304976", "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305661", "label": {"eng": "National Football League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "305867", "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305872", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EverBank_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306943", "label": {"eng": "EverBank Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "306949", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League_Draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "309406", "label": {"eng": "National Football League Draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "310129", "label": {"eng": "End zone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "310743", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League_preseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "314202", "label": {"eng": "National Football League preseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punt_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "325513", "label": {"eng": "Punt (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "329510", "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thursday_Night_Football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "330672", "label": {"eng": "Thursday Night Football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake_Bortles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "342528", "label": {"eng": "Blake Bortles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Robinson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "362447", "label": {"eng": "Allen Robinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Henne", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "390554", "label": {"eng": "Chad Henne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Marrone", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "472582", "label": {"eng": "Doug Marrone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Fournette", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "1269793", "label": {"eng": "Leonard Fournette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Jacksonville_Jaguars_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "1309453", "label": {"eng": "2014 Jacksonville Jaguars season"}}]}

After Bortles received fewer reps with the team in practice, head coach Doug Marrone chalked it up to fatigue in his throwing arm. During drills against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Jags wide receiver Allen Robinson couldn't help but voice his exasperation with Bortles, per Pewter Report (Warning: video contains NSFW language):\n\nThe fact the Jaguars could reasonably consider starting Henne ahead of Bortles is a damning indictment of the latter's progress -- or lack thereof.\n\nBortles is set to make a little over $19 million in 2018, but none of that is guaranteed. Should he continue to struggle or get replaced by Henne, he could potentially be out of a job at the end of the season -- four years after the Jaguars selected him with the third overall pick.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100, "id": 25, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 100, "id": 28, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100, "id": 32, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100, "id": 282, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "wgt": 100, "id": 381, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice_Hockey", "wgt": 100, "id": 435, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice Hockey"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "wgt": 100, "id": 463, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville"}, "type": "loc", "id": "181844"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302611", "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304976", "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "305867", "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305872", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "306949", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "310130", "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Network", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "311040", "label": {"eng": "NFL Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League_preseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "314202", "label": {"eng": "National Football League preseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "327676", "label": {"eng": "ESPN.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "329510", "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake_Bortles", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "342528", "label": {"eng": "Blake Bortles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_pass", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "345076", "label": {"eng": "Forward pass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Robinson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "362447", "label": {"eng": "Allen Robinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Henne", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "390554", "label": {"eng": "Chad Henne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Marrone", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "472582", "label": {"eng": "Doug Marrone"}}]}

If Thursday night's 12-8 Bucs preseason win over the Jaguars is any indication, it's also going to be filled with footballs thrown by quarterback Jameis Winston.\n\nThe Bucs are putting more and more of their offense on Winston's right shoulder, and that shoulder seems plenty strong enough to carry this team.\n\nBut Winston's head may not be.\n\nOne play from Thursday's game serves as a reminder that Winston still hasn't learned when to attack and when not to.\n\nFacing third and goal from the Jaguars' 7-yard line, Winston was being pulled to the ground by tackle Sheldon Day when a bad habit took hold of him.\n\nFrom the seat of his pants, he threw a pass up for grabs in the end zone, and it was intercepted by safety Barry Church.\n\nFortunately for the Bucs, referee Clete Blakeman ruled that Winston's \"progress was stopped,\" resulting in a sack.\n\nThe play was not reviewable. The Bucs would prefer to never see it again, too.\n\n\"Elite quarterbacks don't make that play,\" coach Dirk Koetter said.\n\nRemember the scene from the first episode of Hard Knocks when Winston asked Koetter \"how much is too much?\" That play, right there, is too much.\n\nIt may seem like we are picking the same nit, because other than that one ugly play, Winston and the Bucs had one pretty dominant half.\n\nWinston completed 21 of 28 passes for 196 yards and led the Bucs to three scores on their first three possessions. He spread the ball to eight receivers. He made good use of new receiver DeSean Jackson and rookie tight end O.J. Howard.\n\nThe lone touchdown came on a 2-yard run by Doug Martin to cap the opening drive of the game.\n\nHowever, twice the Bucs were forced to settle for Nick Folk field goals of 35 and 29 yards. (His extra point after Martin's touchdown was blocked by the Jaguars' 6-foot-8 Calais Campbell, and he missed a 47-yard field goal wide right in the fourth quarter).\n\nStill, it was about as dominant of a performance for one half in Week 2 of the preseason as the Bucs could have hoped for.\n\nAt one point, the Bucs had a 187-28 advantage in total yards and nine first downs to one for the Jaguars. They finished the first half with 16 first downs to four.\n\nThe game was also a much better performance for the starting defense. It bottled up the Jaguars' running game, had three tackles for a loss in the first half and kept the Jaguars off the scoreboard in the first half.\n\nBeleaguered Jaguars quarterback Blake Bortles was 8-of-13 for 65 yards and was harassed all night by the Bucs' pass rush.\n\n\"We've been able to get pressure on (Bortles) all week in those (joint) practices,\" Koetter said. \"They used some quick counts on us early to try and hold the pressure off, but I thought we did a good job of getting in his face.\"\n\nIn two preseason games, Winston is 30-of-41 (73 percent) for 295 yards with no interceptions and no touchdowns.\n\nThe playmakers he has at his disposal are ridiculous. Though Mike Evans had a perfectly thrown 43-yard pass go through his hands in the end zone, he had five receptions for 57 yards. Adam Humphries caught five passes for 42. In all, Winston spread the ball to eight different pass catchers in the first half.\n\n\"We were able to run it and throw it,\" Koetter said. \"So that's always the toughest thing to defend.\"\n\nThe return of center Ali Marpet, who missed the first preseason game last week with an ankle injury, made a difference. Martin found some holes and rushed five times for 30 yards and the score.\n\n\"Coach wanted us to start fast as a team and as an offensive unit,\" Martin said. \"We really wanted to come out here and start with a good drive. We've been practicing against (the Jaguars) the past few days, so we wanted to get out there and impose our will on them.\"\n\nAfter two preseason games, it's safe to say the Bucs could have the best offense in their history. Without much of a stretch, you can say they already have their best quarterback.\n\nWinston's gunslinger mentality has resulted in 42 turnovers in his first two NFL seasons. If he learns that he can't make every play, he will make enough plays to take the Bucs exactly where they want to go.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100, "id": 49, "label": "dmoz/Games"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "wgt": 100, "id": 51, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "wgt": 100, "id": 52, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "wgt": 100, "id": 134, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games", "wgt": 100, "id": 138, "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "wgt": 100, "id": 284, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "wgt": 100, "id": 641, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tampa"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa,_Florida", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tampa"}, "type": "loc", "id": "182437"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302611", "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302622", "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304976", "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305872", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_(American_and_Canadian_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309405", "label": {"eng": "Safety (American and Canadian football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeSean_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "310122", "label": {"eng": "DeSean Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Knocks_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "310123", "label": {"eng": "Hard Knocks (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "310129", "label": {"eng": "End zone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "310743", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "311349", "label": {"eng": "Conversion (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tight_end", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "312020", "label": {"eng": "Tight end"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "313674", "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League_preseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "314202", "label": {"eng": "National Football League preseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "324223", "label": {"eng": "Rush (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_(American_and_Canadian_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "326127", "label": {"eng": "Down (American and Canadian football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "329510", "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake_Bortles", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "342528", "label": {"eng": "Blake Bortles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jameis_Winston", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "342532", "label": {"eng": "Jameis Winston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirk_Koetter", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "361667", "label": {"eng": "Dirk Koetter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calais_Campbell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "391963", "label": {"eng": "Calais Campbell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Church", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "509035", "label": {"eng": "Barry Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Folk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "556096", "label": {"eng": "Nick Folk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clete_Blakeman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "1143461", "label": {"eng": "Clete Blakeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1268994", "label": {"eng": "Field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Marpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1326280", "label": {"eng": "Ali Marpet"}}]}

(AP) -- Jameis Winston continued his solid preseason, completing 21 of 29 passes for 196 yards and helping the Tampa Bay Buccaneers beat woeful Jacksonville 12-8 on Thursday night.\n\nWinston had two passes dropped, including what would have been a 43-yard touchdown strike to Mike Evans in the first quarter.\n\nMore Tampa Bay Buccaneers news Buccaneers dominate first half in preseason victory over JaguarsAfter a decade of missed playoffs, Bucs, Jags look to change things this seasonGetting heated: Jaguars, Bucs involved in skirmishes during shared practiceRyan Fitzpatrick makes good first impression in Bucs preseason loss to BengalsKwon Alexander hopes to transform Buccaneers into a playoff team\n\nThe Buccaneers (1-1) scored on their first three possessions, getting a short touchdown run from Doug Martin and two field goals from Nick Folk. Tampa Bay dominated Jacksonville in two quarters that featured mostly starters, outgaining the Jags 240-59 and looking like the much better team.\n\nFolk, who won the kicking job last week after the Bucs waived former second-round draft pick Roberto Aguayo, had an extra point blocked by Calais Campbell. He also missed a 47-yarder wide right in the fourth quarter.\n\nEvans finished with five catches for 57 yards, but missed a chance for a huge gain when he let Winston's perfectly thrown deep ball slip through his fingers. It was about the only thing that went right for the Jaguars (1-1).\n\nJacksonville's night went so awry that coach Doug Marrone now seemingly has open competitions at quarterback and place-kicker.\n\nBackup quarterback Chad Henne got some work with the first-team offense, fueling speculation that Blake Bortles has lost his grasp on the starting job.\n\nMore Jacksonville Jaguars news Buccaneers dominate first half in preseason victory over JaguarsAfter a decade of missed playoffs, Bucs, Jags look to change things this seasonGetting heated: Jaguars, Bucs involved in skirmishes during shared practiceJaguars QB Blake Bortles dealing with tired arm, getting reduced repsJaguars rule WR Lee, RB Fournette out for preseason game vs. Bucs\n\nHenne entered late in the second quarter after Bortles played four series that ended in punts. Even though the move had been planned beforehand, it surely created the appearance that Marrone and football czar Tom Coughlin are wavering in their commitment to Bortles.\n\nMarrone and Coughlin have publicly supported Bortles all year, even picking up the fifth-year option in his rookie contract. But Marrone pulled the third overall pick in the 2014 NFL draft last week following two interceptions. Marrone said Bortles' \"arm looked tired.\" Bortles denied having any issues.\n\nBortles completed 8 of 13 passes for 65 yards against the Bucs. He doesn't have a touchdown or a turnover in two preseason games.\n\nHenne's first pass should have resulted in a touchdown, but Keelan Cole dropped it at the goal line. Henne finished 6-of-10 passing for 44 yards.\n\nJason Myers missed from 40 yards out, leaving him 1 for 4 on the season. He also missed an extra point in the fourth. The Jaguars don't have another kicker in camp, but that likely will change Friday.\n\nROOKIE WATCH\n\nDede Westbrook, a fourth-round draft pick from Oklahoma, finished with five catches for 101 yards. He was one of the few bright spots for Jacksonville. Westbrook and third-string quarterback Brandon Allen got the Jags to the 2-yard line in the final 2 minutes, but Allen misfired on a fourth-and-1 play.\n\nSITTING OUT\n\nThe Buccaneers played without two starters: cornerback Brent Grimes (leg laceration) and linebacker Devante Bond (sprained knee). The Jaguars were without rookie running back Leonard Fournette (foot), receiver Marqise Lee (ankle) and their top three cornerbacks. Jalen Ramsey, A.J. Bouye and Aaron Colvin did not dress.\n\nAWFUL START\n\nJacksonville, which wants to be a power run team, ran seven times for minus a yard in the opening half. The Jags managed four first downs and got booed by the home crowd when Bortles badly underthrew a wide-open Allen Robinson in the seam.\n\nINJURIES\n\nTampa Bay: Starting right tackle Demar Dotson left the game with a groin injury and did not return. Cornerback Josh Robinson injured a hamstring.\n\nJacksonville: Running back T.J. Yeldon injured his left hamstring and did not return. Cornerback Charles Gaines injured his right eye.\n\n107\n\nView Gallery Gallery: Tampa Bay Buccaneers cheerleader photo gallery\n\nReinhold Matay-USA TODAY Sports | Reinhold Matay", "date":

Everyone saw it out there. Whatever you want to call it, I'm still trying to evaluate who the best person is at that position.\"\n\nJacksonville Jaguars quarterback Blake Bortles (5) throws a pass for a first down against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers during the first half of an NFL preseason football game, Thursday, Aug. 17, 2017, in Jacksonville, Fla. (AP Photo/John Raoux)\n\nBortles completed 8 of 13 passes for 65 yards in a 12-8 preseason loss to Tampa Bay and headed to the sideline after four possessions that ended with punts. He missed Allen Robinson on two plays, including a woefully underthrown ball down the seam.\n\n\"Just didn't make a whole lot of plays,\" Bortles said. \"Missed a couple of throws down the field, and we were very stagnant as an offense.\"\n\nHenne got some work with the first-team offense, fueling speculation that Bortles had lost his grasp on the job. Even though the move had been planned beforehand, it gave the appearance that Marrone and football czar Tom Coughlin had wavered in their commitment to Bortles. Marrone confirmed it after the game.\n\n\"We're going to figure this thing out,\" Marrone said. \"It's just simple. I'm not going to try to make this thing complicated. I'm looking for the best person to lead our offense.\"\n\nMarrone and Coughlin had publicly supported Bortles all year, even picking up the fifth-year option in his rookie contract. But Marrone pulled the third overall pick in the 2014 NFL draft last week following two interceptions. Marrone said Bortles' \"arm looked tired.\" Bortles denied having any issues.\n\nBortles doesn't have a touchdown or a turnover in two preseason games.\n\n\"It's hard to not hear people booing,\" Bortles said. \"But if they're cheering or booing, it's kind of irrelevant, at least for me it is. I think you've got to treat adversity and prosperity the same way. They're not booing for no reason. They're booing because you didn't do your job.\"\n\nHenne's first pass should have resulted in a touchdown, but Keelan Cole dropped it at the goal line. Henne finished 6-of-10 passing for 44 yards.\n\nThe Jaguars also could have a kicking competition.\n\nJason Myers missed a field goal and an extra point. He has missed three of four field-goal attempts in two exhibitions. The Jaguars don't have another kicker in camp, but that could change Friday.\n\n\"I think that's something that we'll talk about,\" Marrone said.\n\nWINSTON SHINES\n\nJameis Winston continued his solid preseason, completing 21 of 29 passes for 196 yards for Tampa Bay.\n\nWinston had two passes dropped, including what would have been a 43-yard touchdown strike to Mike Evans in the first quarter.\n\nThe Buccaneers scored on their first three possessions, getting a short touchdown run from Doug Martin and two field goals from Nick Folk. Tampa Bay dominated Jacksonville in two quarters that featured mostly starters, outgaining the Jags 240-59 and looking like the much better team.\n\n\"We've got to finish,\" Winston said. \"We've got to have touchdowns in the red zone.\"\n\nCoach Dirk Koetter praised Winston's performance aside from an ill-advised throw that ended up being a sack.\n\n\"Other than that one play, he was extremely sharp,\" Koetter said. \"But we have extremely high standards for him as he does for himself. He took us right down the field, had a lot of run checks, converted on third downs. He did the things that quarterbacks like him are supposed to do, except for one play. ... Elite quarterbacks don't make that play.\"\n\n___\n\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Jameis Winston (3) throws a pass as he is pressured by Jacksonville Jaguars defensive lineman Malik Jackson (97) during the first half of an NFL preseason football game, Thursday, Aug. 17, 2017, in Jacksonville, Fla.

He worked with renowned quarterback coach Tom House during the offseason and talked many times about how he needed to improve his mechanics.\n\nThis scribe fell into the trap of thinking Bortles would improve, writing a column entitled, \"The Jaguars are in good hands with Blake Bortles.\"\n\nI was wrong. So, so wrong.\n\nInstead of fixing his mechanics, Bortles somehow got much, much worse. Just check out this absolutely lazy pass Bortles made on a simple out route. It was returned for six points, because the cornerback was able to read Bortles like a book.\n\nOnce again, this past offseason, Bortles dedicated himself to fixing his mechanics. From his feet to his eyes, Bortles needed help. He knew this. We all knew this. And he went to work to fix his ailing game.\n\nUnfortunately, Bortles' game is still in the pits. He's struggled during training camp, and has done the exact opposite of shine in two preseason outings.\n\nOn Thursday against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Bortles looked like a green rookie who was getting his first taste of the speed that comes from live action in the NFL. He was awful. His final line doesn't look terrible by itself -- 8-of-13 for 65 yards with no touchdowns or interceptions -- but stats are deceiving, especially when it concerns Bortles.\n\nAt one point, he had Allen Robinson streaking wide open down the right sideline. Bortles had time in the pocket. No pressure at all. He even had time to pat the ball and leisurely toss that ball. It should have been a touchdown. Instead, we saw this.\n\nRobinson got open multiple times, and Bortles kept missing him. High, low. He just couldn't dial it in. And it's because his mechanics are just atrocious. A kid with all the natural ability in the world to make it happen, Bortles is somehow getting worse right in front of our eyes.\n\nHe should be really coming into his own as a fourth-year starter. Instead, he's shrinking as the pressure around him gets more intense.\n\nThe Jaguars got whipped on both sides of the ball Thursday night. Jameis Winston and the Bucs were able to do whatever they wanted most of the first half. But given the amount of talent Jacksonville possesses on both sides of the ball, we don't expect this to be a trend.\n\nThis is a team that has the players to reach the playoffs. Assuming Leonard Fournette can stay healthy, they'll have unbelievable skill at every position on offense. There's only one problem. Bortles isn't the guy to lead this group. And quite honestly, neither is Chad Henne in the long term. But at this point, Henne needs to get a real crack leading the first-team offense the next couple of preseason games.\n\nJacksonville should seriously consider kicking the tires on another quarterback who would, at the very least, provide some legitimate competition for Bortles. That quarterback has been to the Super Bowl and is very careful with the football. He's also a dual threat who would mesh well with the powerful Fournette in a run-first offense.\n\nWe've highlighted who that guy is in the past. He'd be the perfect fit for a team that has playoff aspirations but is lacking a leader on offense. But it's highly unlikely Tom Coughlin would call him in for a visit, let alone sign him to a contract.\n\nSo, Jags fans. Looks like you're stuck with a broken first-round bust in Bortles, or that you're going to ride the Henne train throughout the 2017 season.

Winston still managed to thrive and shine. The 23-year-old gunslinger completed 21-of-29 passes for 196 yards and connected with his receivers on numerous plays. Winston and Evans proved they still have incredible chemistry and that there are good things in store for this Tampa Bay offense in 2017, especially with coach Koetter at the helm and Winston under center.\n\nJameis Winston and his Bucs are going to be good.

If Thursday night's 12-8 preseason win over the Jaguars is any indication, it's also going to be filled with footballs thrown by quarterback Jameis Winston.\n\nThe Bucs are putting more and more of their offense on Winston's right shoulder and it seems plenty strong enough to carry this football team.\n\nBut his head may not be.\n\nOne play from Thursday's game serves as a reminder that Winston still hasn't learned when to attack and when to play dead.\n\nFacing third and goal from the Jaguars' 7-yard line in the second quarter, Winston was being pulled to the ground by Jaguars defensive tackle Sheldon Day when a bad habit took hold of him.\n\nFrom the seat of his pants, he threw a pass up for grabs in the end zone that was intercepted by safety Barry Church.\n\nFortunately, referee Clete Blakeman ruled Winston's 'progress was stopped,' resulting in a sack.\n\n\"Not what we're looking for. Elite quarterbacks don't make that play,'' coach Dirk Koetter said.\n\nRemember the scene from the first episode of Hard Knocks when Winston asked coach Dirk Koetter 'how much is too much?'\n\nThat play, right there, Jameis, is too much.\n\n\"This team did so good, that's the only play we're going to sit up there, and coach is going to write it three times: You can't do it. You can't do it. You can't do it.' '' Winston said. \"Especially with a good drive like that. We've got a field goal in the bag. I'm beating myself up way more than coach is.\n\n\"Coach expressed his in words. I'm hurt. I'm disappointed in myself. But we still got the win, that's all the matters. Plus, that play didn't even count.''\n\nIt didn't count, but it mattered.\n\nWhat was Winston thinking in that moment? \"I just felt hot,'' Winston said. \"I was like, \"Man, somebody going to get it.' Nah, I can't do that.''\n\n\"It may seem like we are picking the same nit, because other than that one ugly play, Winston completed 21-of-28 passes for 196 yards and led the Bucs to three scores on the team's first three possessions Thursday. He spread the ball to eight different receivers. He made good use of new weapons, receiver DeSean Jackson and rookie tight end O.J. Howard.\n\nThe lone touchdown came on a 2-yard run by Doug Martin to cap the opening drive of the game.\n\nHowever, twice the Bucs were forced to settle for Nick Folk field goals of 35- and 29-yards (he had an extra point blocked by the Jags 6-foot-8 Calais Campbell and missed a 47-yard field goal wide right in the fourth quarter).\n\nSo if you're scoring at home, that's four trips inside the red zone for the starting offense and one touchdown in the past two weeks.\n\nStill, it was about as dominate of a performance in Week 2 of the preseason the Bucs could hope for.\n\nAt one point, the Bucs had a 187-28 advantage in total yards and nine first downs to one for the Jags. They finished the first half with 16 first downs to 4.\n\nThursday's game was also a much better showing the Bucs' starting defense. They bottled up the Jaguars running game, had three tackles for a loss in the first half and kept the Jags off the scoreboard in the first half.\n\nBeleaguered Jags quarterback Blake Bortles was 8-of-13 for 65 yards and was harassed all night by the Bucs' pass rush.\n\n\"It's complementary football,'' Winston said. \"Those guys get off the field and it's us going and having long drives. Our drives weren't short. We drove. We got a couple third downs. We converted and we kept going, we kept going. Like I tell Kwon all the time, defense wins championships. If those guys don't score, there's no way we can lose because with the guys we've got, we're going to score. So hold them to that goose egg.''\n\nIn two preseason games, Winston is 30-of-41 (73 percent) for 295 yards with no interceptions and no touchdowns.\n\nThe weapons he has at his disposal is ridiculous. Although Evans had a perfectly-thrown 43-yard pass go through his hands in the end zone, he had five receptions for 57 yards. Adam Humphries caught five for 42. In all, Winston spread the football to eight different pass catchers in the first half.\n\n\"When Jason Licht and the people upstairs do a great job of putting those guys around you, you've got to give them the ball,'' Winston said. \"Like I told you, I'm not going to discriminate. If you're open, you're open. Everybody is going to get an opportunity to make some plays. It's just when you get it, do what you do.''\n\nThe return of center Ali Marpet, who missed the first preseason game with an ankle injury, made a difference. Martin found some holes and rushed five times for 30 yards and a score.\n\n\"Coach wanted us to start fast as a team and as an offensive unit,'' Martin said. \"We really wanted to come out here and start with a good drive. We've been practicing against them the past few days so we wanted to get out there and impose our will on them.''\n\nThe kicking situation still is a mess, but Koetter seems committed to Folk. \"Well, I hope he has a real good game on Sept. 10,'' Koetter said. \"That's what I'm hoping for.''\n\nAfter two preseason games, it's safe to say the Bucs could have the best offense in their franchise history. Without much a stretch, you can say they already have their best quarterback.\n\nWinston's gunslinger mentality has resulted in 42 turnovers in his first two NFL seasons. If he learns that he can't make every play, he will make enough of them to take the Bucs' exactly where they want to go.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100, "id": 49, "label": "dmoz/Games"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "wgt": 100, "id": 51, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "wgt": 100, "id": 52, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "wgt": 100, "id": 284, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "wgt": 100, "id": 641, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Yard,_Deck,_and_Table_Games", "wgt": 100, "id": 1063, "label": "dmoz/Games/Yard, Deck, and Table Games"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tampa"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa,_Florida", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tampa"}, "type": "loc", "id": "182437"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302552", "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302611", "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302622", "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304976", "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305872", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_(American_and_Canadian_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309405", "label": {"eng": "Safety (American and Canadian football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeSean_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "310122", "label": {"eng": "DeSean Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Knocks_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "310123", "label": {"eng": "Hard Knocks (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "310129", "label": {"eng": "End zone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "310743", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "311349", "label": {"eng": "Conversion (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_(American_and_Canadian_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "311351", "label": {"eng": "Center (American and Canadian football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tight_end", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "312020", "label": {"eng": "Tight end"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(American_and_Canadian_football)#Defensive_tackle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "312085", "label": {"eng": "Defensive tackle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "313674", "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League_preseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "314202", "label": {"eng": "National Football League preseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "324223", "label": {"eng": "Rush (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_(American_and_Canadian_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "326127", "label": {"eng": "Down (American and Canadian football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._J._Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "327035", "label": {"eng": "O.

Bortles ... well, let's say he did not look like a high-level starter.\n\nThe Jacksonville Jaguars went with Bortles as their starter again this season, even though they could have drafted Patrick Mahomes or Deshaun Watson with the fourth pick. They're not the first team to see a high draft pick at quarterback through right to the bitter end. They took running back Leonard Fournette instead, presumably believing that Bortles could get better with less pressure on him.\n\nThat might still happen, but it didn't look good Thursday night. Almost anytime Bortles threw anything longer than a dump-off it rarely hit the mark. His worst pass came early in the second quarter, when Allen Robinson (who was caught on video by Pewter Report at practice this week complaining with an expletive that Bortles couldn't keep a pass to him in-bounds) got behind the cornerback and into the void between the corner and safety. Robinson was wide open and Bortles threw it horribly short for an incompletion.\n\n[Now's the time to sign up for Fantasy Football! Join for free]\n\nLater, after Bortles threw a terrible pass on an in-breaking route to Robinson, ESPN's Jon Gruden compared Bortles to a golfer who has lost his swing. It was that bad. Bortles was 8-of-13 for 65 yards when Chad Henne took over at quarterback late in the second quarter. Henne immediately threw two great passes that should have been touchdowns but were dropped by his receivers.\n\nThe Jaguars have a very talented defense. Fournette, who was held out Thursday due to a minor injury, will be the focal point of the offense and that should help. But the Jaguars need something from Bortles and there should be a lot of skepticism about his ability to deliver.\n\nThe Jaguars picked up Bortles' fifth-year option for next season, but that's guaranteed only for injury. Jacksonville could move on after this season, and then start the arduous process of finding a new quarterback to groom. They could even make a change during the season if Bortles doesn't play better. Henne isn't great but it's hard to believe a new Jaguars regime will be too patient if Bortles doesn't turn it around. It's hard to believe Bortles could lose his job before Week 1, but he might not have a long leash either.\n\nThursday was just a preseason game, but Bortles is going to have to play a lot better. If his performance against Tampa Bay continues into the regular season, he might not be long for the job.\n\n- - - - - - -\n\nFrank Schwab is the editor of Shutdown Corner on Yahoo Sports.

(AP) -- Jameis Winston continued his solid preseason, completing 21 of 29 passes for 196 yards and helping the Tampa Bay Buccaneers beat woeful Jacksonville 12-8 on Thursday night.\n\nWinston had two passes dropped, including what would have been a 43-yard touchdown strike to Mike Evans in the first quarter.\n\nThe Buccaneers (1-1) scored on their first three possessions, getting a short touchdown run from Doug Martin and two field goals from Nick Folk. Tampa Bay dominated Jacksonville in two quarters that featured mostly starters, outgaining the Jags 240-59 and looking like the much better team.\n\nFolk, who won the kicking job last week after the Bucs waived former second-round draft pick Roberto Aguayo, had an extra point blocked by Calais Campbell. He also missed a 47-yarder wide right in the fourth quarter.\n\nEvans finished with five catches for 57 yards, but missed a chance for a huge gain when he let Winston's perfectly thrown deep ball slip through his fingers. It was about the only thing that went right for the Jaguars (1-1).\n\nJacksonville's night went so awry that coach Doug Marrone now seemingly has open competitions at quarterback and place-kicker.\n\nBackup quarterback Chad Henne got some work with the first-team offense, fueling speculation that Blake Bortles has lost his grasp on the starting job.\n\nHenne entered late in the second quarter after Bortles played four series that ended in punts. Even though the move had been planned beforehand, it surely created the appearance that Marrone and football czar Tom Coughlin are wavering in their commitment to Bortles.\n\nMarrone and Coughlin have publicly supported Bortles all year, even picking up the fifth-year option in his rookie contract. But Marrone pulled the third overall pick in the 2014 NFL draft last week following two interceptions. Marrone said Bortles' \"arm looked tired.\" Bortles denied having any issues.\n\nBortles completed 8 of 13 passes for 65 yards against the Bucs. He doesn't have a touchdown or a turnover in two preseason games.\n\nHenne's first pass should have resulted in a touchdown, but Keelan Cole dropped it at the goal line. Henne finished 6-of-10 passing for 44 yards.\n\nJason Myers missed from 40 yards out, leaving him 1 for 4 on the season. He also missed an extra point in the fourth. The Jaguars don't have another kicker in camp, but that likely will change Friday.\n\nROOKIE WATCH\n\nDede Westbrook, a fourth-round draft pick from Oklahoma, finished with five catches for 101 yards. He was one of the few bright spots for Jacksonville. Westbrook and third-string quarterback Brandon Allen got the Jags to the 2-yard line in the final 2 minutes, but Allen misfired on a fourth-and-1 play.\n\nSITTING OUT\n\nThe Buccaneers played without two starters: cornerback Brent Grimes (leg laceration) and linebacker Devante Bond (sprained knee). The Jaguars were without rookie running back Leonard Fournette (foot), receiver Marqise Lee (ankle) and their top three cornerbacks. Jalen Ramsey, A.J. Bouye and Aaron Colvin did not dress.\n\nAWFUL START\n\nJacksonville, which wants to be a power run team, ran seven times for minus a yard in the opening half. The Jags managed four first downs and got booed by the home crowd when Bortles badly underthrew a wide-open Allen Robinson in the seam.\n\nINJURIES\n\nTampa Bay: Starting right tackle Demar Dotson left the game with a groin injury and did not return. Cornerback Josh Robinson injured a hamstring.\n\nJacksonville: Running back T.J. Yeldon injured his left hamstring and did not return. Cornerback Charles Gaines injured his right eye.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100, "id": 32, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American"},

I'm not going to sit here and b.s. anyone. Everyone saw it out there. Whatever you want to call it, I'm still trying to evaluate who the best person is at that position.\"\n\nBortles completed 8-of-13 passes for 65 yards against the Buccaneers Thursday. During his time on offense, the Jaguars earned just three first downs with one coming from a penalty. All of four of Bortles' drives ended in punts.\n\nBortles was eventually swapped out for Henne, who completed 6-of-10 passes for 44 yards. He had two touchdown receptions dropped by two different receivers.\n\nDOWNLOAD THE FIRST COAST FOOTBALL APP FOR MORE JAGUARS COVERAGE\n\nBortles has started 46-starting games since 2014. Henne has played just one regular season snap in two years.\n\nThose major discrepancies in recent playing time matter little to Marrone, who is seeking someone to lead his team at quarterback.\n\n\"I think [Henne] deserves that opportunity,\" Marrone said. \"I'm not going to sit here and say how much ground he's gained. It's just simple. I'm not going to try to make this thing complicated. I'm looking for the best person to lead our offense.\"\n\nThe Jaguars' faltered throughout the first three quarters until third-string quarterback Brandon Allen entered the game. Allen completed 10-of-15 passes for 144 passing yards and a touchdown. He also ran three times for 27 rushing yards.\n\nAfter the game, Marrone said he wouldn't completely take Allen out of the conversation, despite focusing his immediate attention on Henne and Bortles.\n\n\"Well, I think you've got to take that into consideration, again, is he in consideration? Yeah,\" Marrone said. \"If he's the best guy, sure, no problem. I don't have an issue with that.\"\n\nThe Jaguars will have the day off on Friday but will return to work this weekend. Over the next two weeks, Marrone will have to figure out who his top quarterback will be.\n\nHe will have two more preseason games to evaluate his internal candidates.\n\n\"Well, it's a lot better than trying to think someone is going to be something that they're not,\" Marrone said. \"It's a lot better to do it now than to wait until the season comes, in my opinion.\"\n\nWhen asked about potential outside options, Marrone declined to speak about players who are not already on his team.\n\n\"I need someone to lead this offense,\" Marrone said. \"I'm not going to sit here, again, I don't work with the outside-the-roster stuff, so for me, I can't answer that question.

Jameis Winston was sharp early on in the game, as was the offense as a whole.\n\nThe Bucs and Jaguars both gave their starters a lot of playing time. One full half, to be precise, where many teams would give their starters maybe three drives in the second preseason game.\n\nIt wasn't until the end of the fourth quarter until the Jaguars got on the scoreboard, or really got anywhere with their offense. Blake Bortles looked awful and had some baffling misfires, though at least Chad Henne looked okay for them.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bucs' backup offense struggled too. Ryan Fitzpatrick really isn't good enough, and it showed. The defense was pretty stifling throughout, though -- it almost looked like it was 1999 again.\n\nHere are some key takeaways from tonight's game.\n\nDoug Martin got all of the early workload and looked productive, despite some seemingly iffy blocking from the offensive line. Five carries for 30 yards and a touchdown as well as two catches for 11 yards -- pretty solid for one quarter of play.\n\nWhile the Bucs will need to figure something out for the first three games of the regular season, when Martin's suspended, it looks like he's going to be the starter once he's back.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Buccaneers offense got off to a really good start. They marched straight down the field and Doug Martin ran it in, though the extra point got blocked. On the very next drive the Bucs got to the goal-line again, but couldn't quite punch it in.\n\nThose drives showed consistent offensive line play, a running game, and accurate Jameis Winston. It was really promising.\n\nAnd then the end of the second quarter happened and bad Jameis started to show up. He had two ugly near-interceptions, and could not get the ball into the end zone -- in fact, Winton has yet to score a touchdown at all this preseason. Something he needs to work on, especially with big targets like Mike Evans and O.J. Howard around.\n\nAlso, Ryan Fitzpatrick is still terrible.\n\nThe Bucs have been reasonably lucky with injuries this year, but suffered one potentially catastrophic one against the Jaguars: Demar Dotson had to leave with a groin injury and was immediately ruled out, which is not a good sign.\n\nLater on, backup cornerback/special teams ace Josh Robinson suffered a hamstring injury. It's not clear how serious that is, but he did not return to play.\n\nDotson was replaced by Caleb Benenoch and later Leonard Wester, and neither player looked great. If Dotson can't return to play, the Bucs may have to juggle some positions to get a functioning offensive line.\n\nThe Jaguars got all of 48 rushing yards on 19 carries and simply could not get any kind of productive running game going, regardless of the\n\nI'd say the defense as a whole was stifling, but the only reason they didn't give up a touchdown in the first half was that the Jaguars dropped the ball. A lot. Still, they had three long touchdown drives against the Patriots last week so this is definitely a solid overall showing for the Bucs defense.\n\nOne defender who really stood out: Adarius Glanton, who got a sack in the third quarter and has several highlight tackles early on.\n\nCutting Roberto Aguayo doesn't mean the Bucs are suddenly good at kicker.

His tie is loosened, his feet are on the desk, a glass of champagne is in his hand, his eyes are fixed on the Stanley Cup that dominates the sparsely decorated room. And on the blackboard over Imlach's shoulder in that quiet moment of revelry are words Coughlin can appreciate: \"No Practice Tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Isn't that great?\" Coughlin said.\n\nFor Coughlin -- who delights in the relentlessness of preparation so much that, before the final sip of champagne had been swallowed hours after he won a Super Bowl with the New York Giants, he began musing aloud about the start of the next offseason program -- there are, once again, more practices to evaluate, more games to prepare for, his once and future team to mold.\n\nBack before anyone made the stinging suggestion he might be too old for the NFL, and certainly before he and the Giants were the only team with the physical and mental fortitude to topple Bill Belichick's Patriots -- twice -- in the Super Bowl, Coughlin toiled here, as the coach and top personnel executive, to build the Jaguars from scratch as an expansion team in the mid-1990s. He remembers the day he signed the first 10 players in team history off the street around Christmas in 1994, and it made the front page of the paper. When he came south again in January, 22 years later, it led the news again, the prodigal coach returning.\n\nExcept, well, not exactly. Coughlin's presence, even behind the scenes, has certainly re-energized and given hope to a fan base that last enjoyed a playoff appearance and winning record in 2007 and still reveres Coughlin for building the franchise from the ground up. There is comfort taken here that so much about Coughlin has remained almost exactly the same as it was when, as a Bill Parcells disciple arriving by way of Boston College, he first came to Jacksonville in 1994 and had to hire everybody in the building connected to football.\n\nOnly a handful of those employees remain today, but Coughlin's influence looms over everything here, including head coach Doug Marrone, who, in turn, calls Coughlin \"Coach.\" The emphasis on culture and mindset and physical and mental toughness is intact. Yes, the clocks in the building are set five minutes fast. No, you may not have a pingpong table in the locker room that is so plush, Coughlin shakes his head over it. As the rare executive vice president who watches warmups and position drills (even special teams), Coughlin marches the sideline in his wide-brimmed safari hat with a perpetual frown on his face, noticing everything. With Coughlin soon to be 71 and besotted with grandchildren who frequently visit his practices, his football persona has mellowed only in the most imperceptible ways. After a recent joint practice with the Patriots, Coughlin responded to a question about what he thought by starting to riff on how good it is for a young team to practice with a champion before abruptly dispensing with his up-with-people remarks to return to reality.\n\n\"I'm anxious. I've got to work on it,\" he began, before grabbing both of the reporter's arms and opening his eyes wide in dismay over one particularly mistake-prone, goal-line sequence. \"I said to the offensive line, 'You've got to be f------ kidding me. The ball's on the 1-yard line!' \"\n\nThis frustration with the lack of push from the line sounds like something Marrone -- coincidentally, a former offensive line coach -- might say. That gets to the heart of the intrigue about this iteration of Coughlin. He did not slip seamlessly back into his life in Jacksonville -- where he kept a home and much of his charitable work for the Jay Fund all along -- as a coach. He is there as the executive vice president of football operations, the top football decision maker. When former Jaguars owner Wayne Weaver interviewed Coughlin to be the Jaguars' first head coach, he off-handedly said during the interview, \"You do want personnel, don't you?\"\n\n\"Yeah, sure,\" Coughlin replied.\n\nWeaver later admitted it was a mistake to fire Coughlin after the 2002 season. This time, when current Jaguars owner Shad Khan -- desperate to turn around a franchise that is 17-63 and has the NFL's worst winning percentage over the last five seasons -- met Coughlin in Miami, the conversation went differently. He wanted Coughlin as his pigskin overlord, but not as the coach. That gig would go to Marrone.\n\nLast season, after stepping down as Giants head coach following three straight losing campaigns, Coughlin worked in the league office and -- not surprisingly -- his favorite part of that job was being in the officiating control center on Sundays, because the sense of anticipation of games reminded him of being with a team. At the same time, he was quietly assessing potential future situations, looking at teams most often, he said, not as a potential coach but as an executive, eyeing things like salary-cap space. But if Coughlin liked being in a league office, where he went out and did surveys of coaches about issues on their minds, why not just stay there rather than descending into the daily grind of running a team?\n\nHe looks at the questioner incredulously. \"Why not stay there? Because of the competitive aspect of what I've done my whole life.\"\n\nThere is something romantic, even to Coughlin, about the idea of coming full circle, to spend the twilight of his career -- a description he would probably reject -- finishing the job in Jacksonville, where he took that expansion team to two AFC Championship Games but no further. He said he hadn't followed this franchise any more closely than any other because, bluntly, there wasn't much to follow in the intervening years.\n\n\"I have a vested interest in the historical preservation and success of this team because, obviously, it's MY BABY,\" Coughlin said. \"So, I was interested at this time in my career -- this is what I told the owner. I said, 'I can help you. I can help anybody -- the coach, everybody -- because of the experience I've had, what I've done, how I came to even be in this league.' That's really what I was thinking about doing.\n\n\"I was fine with the way it came down. It wasn't, 'No, I have to be the head coach.' I don't know. I'm interested in making this job work, this franchise win. That's what I want. I want this franchise to win.\n\n\"And I want to see how I am in this capacity. Because I'm not on the sideline, I'm not the guy making the decisions on, go for it on fourth down, field goal or no field goal. It's an interesting concept for me, which, quite frankly, is very interesting to me at this point in my career.\"\n\nThis personal test for Coughlin is interesting to a lot of other people, too, because despite repeated questions, he still has not slammed the door on coaching again. Before taking the job in Jacksonville, Coughlin did not seek advice from Parcells, a Hall of Fame coach who was notably less successful in executive-only roles with the Jets and Dolphins, and the adjustments are ongoing. Recently, Coughlin was taken on a tour of EverBank Field so he could see the selection of suites from which he could choose to watch the game. This is foreign to Coughlin -- before last year, he'd been on a sideline as a coach for a team nearly every year since 1969 -- and it's going to take some getting used to. When he asked where he would watch the game when the Jaguars are on the road, he was told that many stadiums have suites for visiting teams' officials to use. But in some others, visiting executives sit in the press box among the assembled media, a revelation that surprised the veteran of many news conferences.\n\nCoughlin admits he is not sure how he'll manage being off the field for games.\n\n\"And I see something I don't like? That's going to be a good one,\" he said. \"I'll keep track of it, and that will be part of our meeting. A big part of it. I'd much rather be on the field in all aspects of that, even in the job I am in. But it's not right to be down there. It's not smart to be there.\"\n\nThat is Coughlin's way of acknowledging that he knows he cannot veer into Marrone's lane, and that he is well aware everybody is watching for it. Can a famous control freak -- who, before a season with the Giants, had every day of his assistants' year mapped out for them -- give up control of the thing he is most freakish about? Perhaps. Coughlin said he hasn't had to bite his tongue yet.\n\nBut it was lost on no one that Coughlin dominated their shared introductory press conference in January, when he interrupted as Marrone was about to answer a question about the importance of winning.\n\n\"What the hell else would you be doing this for?\" Coughlin said. \"We're trying to win today. Who's going to get the better lunch?\"\n\nOnce the season begins, Coughlin said he will probably stay late one night a week -- likely Tuesday -- as the game plan is being built and preparations for the next opponent begin. But he will not sit in on meetings, and he intends to leave the travel involved in scouting to general manager Dave Caldwell.\n\nUnspoken is a reality: The football life helps keep Coughlin so fit and energetic that someone much younger struggles to keep up as he walks down the hall. Coughlin's wife, Judy, has already noted that he is keeping a head coach's hours again, getting to the office by 5 a.m. to get in a workout, sometimes not leaving until very late at night.\n\n\"I tell her there's only one way to do this,\" Coughlin said. \"And now they report to me.\"\n\nCoughlin and Marrone have a long, sometimes sitcom-worthy relationship. Marrone, a Syracuse alum like Coughlin, was desperate to get a shot at a graduate assistant job when Coughlin was the Boston College coach. He figured out that if he called from the house phone of the hotel the team was staying at for a bowl game, the operator would put him through directly to Coughlin's room. One night, Coughlin answered, Marrone gave him his rap, and Coughlin told him to send his resume and hung up. Marrone did not get the job. Later, when Marrone was the Jets' offensive line coach and getting teased by head coach Herm Edwards about his adoration of Coughlin, he introduced himself to Coughlin, then with the Giants, at the NFL Scouting Combine. Coughlin shook his hand quickly and turned back to the conversation he was having. Finally, when Marrone became the Orange's head coach, former Syracuse great and Coughlin teammate Floyd Little brokered the introduction.\n\n\"As a coach from afar, I always felt I had a connection with him because of our school,\" Marrone said. \"But I don't know if he ever felt that way. I was like, 'I can't get to this guy. I can't connect with him. You can't make this up.' \"\n\nOnce they were introduced, Marrone would visit with Coughlin in New York to pick his brain. But Marrone did not know that Coughlin would become his boss until right before he was offered the head-coaching job in Jacksonville, where Marrone went 1-1 as the interim following Gus Bradley's firing last season. He jokes that he now walks into Coughlin's office without even knocking, and that he has no concern about whether there could come a time when Coughlin tries to usurp his authority.\n\n\"For me, personally, this has been unbelievable,\" Marrone said. \"I can tell him anything -- he's been through so much. I want to grab every bit of information, every bit of experience he's gotten, I just want to suck this dry. It's such a relief. Being a head coach is very difficult. To have someone like Coach who has been successful ... There's a lot of personalities, there's a lot of egos. All Coach cares about is one thing: winning.\n\n\"He has great respect for the position of the head coach. I'm closer to him than I am to anyone else, outside of my wife and family. The character of the person is so high. I know this is going to come out and I'm going to sound like the biggest wuss about Coach: Oh my God, they hired THIS guy to be the head coach?\"\n\nSo far, they have been in lockstep, sharing notes and impressions of everything from personnel to scheduling to the d\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdcor that got a sprucing up after they arrived. Ask each of them separately their thoughts on quarterback Blake Bortles and their responses match nearly verbatim: He has to cut down on turnovers. How they want to play? With strong lines and a ball-control offense centered around rookie Leonard Fournette.\n\nThe Jaguars' roster is widely regarded as being loaded with young talent -- the result of so many high draft picks in recent years -- but lacking in attention to detail and discipline. Marrone has run a series of long, padded practices with an emphasis on players showing consistency from the first play to the last. The coach has worked at building relationships in Jacksonville, something he admits he learned to do from his time in Buffalo. But he also believes the greatest growth comes from uncomfortable situations.\n\nWhen Calais Campbell, the veteran defensive lineman the Jags brought in this offseason to provide leadership, arrived, he heard quickly about how strict the new regime was and how many more meetings were held. And yes, how you had better be early for Coughlin.\n\n\"For the state of where the team is right now, he's perfect for us,\" said tight end Marcedes Lewis, the only player remaining on the roster from when the Jaguars last went to the playoffs. \"It's a lot of young players, learning how to play at a high level, being tough, smart, physical -- he embodies that mindset. It's your aura. Say what you mean, mean what you say. He's not out there in our faces, because he's not one of the coaches. The little he does, you know that he means business.\"\n\nOffensive lineman Branden Albert got a taste of that. Traded to Jacksonville from Miami in February, he informed the team he was going to retire, then decided he wanted to play. The Jaguars put him on the reserve/retired list, and Coughlin's tone told you everything you needed to know about his opinion of Albert.\n\n\"Reserve/retired. That's all I have to say about it,\" Coughlin said. Albert was later released.\n\nCoughlin doesn't plan to say much more to the team, either, leaving that job to Marrone. Coughlin said he would talk to the players at some point about how great it can be to win in Jacksonville. When Coughlin was the coach here, and the Jaguars were on their way to the AFC Championship Game at the end of the 1996 season -- just their second in existence -- the team flew back from Denver in the middle of the night. The pilot flew over the stadium, and 35,000 fans were there to greet the team.\n\nBut Coughlin cannot imagine being out front for the Jaguars. He will not meet with the media after games, saying derisively of executives that do it routinely, \"If you want to coach the team, coach the team.\" Marrone said whenever something goes wrong during a game, he's probably going to get a picture in his mind of how Coughlin is reacting, but Coughlin certainly doesn't plan to reveal that publicly, either. Coughlin has seen the coach-front office dynamic done the right way from the coach's perspective, and he is not about to step all over that protocol now that he is on the other side. After the first practice of training camp -- \"Eh, they did alright. Nothing great.\" -- Coughlin retreated to his office to watch tape, running off the field in a downpour beside Caldwell, leaving Marrone to talk to reporters about what he saw.\n\n\"I've made this clear with Doug and Dave: The head coach is the head coach,\" Coughlin said. \"I told Dave, we're not talking about injuries. That's the head coach's deal. He is the face of the franchise.\"\n\nReally? It seems you're the face of the franchise, Coughlin was told.", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100, "id": 32, "label":

He's got to go earn it.\"\n\nThe coach's comments come on a night when the Jaguars, playing on national television, were shut out in the first half in a home loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, during which Bortles appeared out of his element once again. The fourth-year quarterback's severe underthrow of a wide-open Allen Robinson in the second quarter earned him a chorus of boos from the Duval faithful.\n\nBortles' outing with the first-team offense was so underwhelming that Marrone sent backup quarterback Chad Henne out at the end of the first half and start of the second half with the starters. Henne's entry on Thursday appears now like a prelude of what is to come at Jags camp.\n\nThrough two preseason games, Bortles is 11/18 for 81 yards with no touchdowns and no picks, while Henne is 11/16 for 183 yards with one TD. Third-stringer Brandon Allen was the most impressive signal-caller, and Jacksonville's leading rusher, on Thursday night; he is 15/22 for 229 yards with two TDs through two exhibitions.\n\nAs has become obvious this offseason, the Jaguars have stockpiled too much talent on both sides of the ball -- young (Leonard Fournette, Jalen Ramsey) and old (Calais Campbell) -- to throw away yet another season due to subpar quarterback play.

His 6-of-10 completed passes may not stand out on paper, but he had two incompletions which were drops by Allen Robinson and Keelan Cole in the end zone.\n\nMarrone said he'd also be open to starting the Jags No. 3 quarterback, Brandon Allen, who like Henne, has been impressive in the Jags first two preseason games. He finished Thursday night 10-of-15 and had the Jags' lone touchdown pass to fullback Marquez Williams. Afterward, Allen nearly marched the offense down the field again with the help of wide receiver Dede Westbrook, but ultimately came up short by turning the ball over on downs at the Bucs 2-yard line.\n\nDue to the rules of the collective bargaining agreement, the Jags will have Friday off, but it will be interesting to find out who's taking snaps as the No. 1 quarterback when they return to the field Saturday. That said, it's no longer a guarantee that it will be Bortles, who has been given his fair share of chances.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "wgt": 100, "id": 30, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100, "id": 49, "label": "dmoz/Games"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100, "id": 485, "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Fields", "wgt": 100, "id": 624, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Fields"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job_Search", "wgt": 100, "id": 948, "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job Search"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Roleplaying", "wgt": 100, "id": 1189, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Roleplaying"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302611", "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304976", "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305872", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "306949", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "310129", "label": {"eng": "End zone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "310130", "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League_preseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "314202", "label": {"eng": "National Football League preseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "325069", "label": {"eng": "Collective agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fullback_(American_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "325507", "label": {"eng": "Fullback (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_(American_and_Canadian_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "326127", "label": {"eng": "Down (American and Canadian football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "329510", "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake_Bortles", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "342528", "label": {"eng": "Blake Bortles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Robinson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "362447", "label": {"eng": "Allen Robinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incomplete_pass", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "366952", "label": {"eng": "Incomplete pass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Henne", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "390554", "label": {"eng": "Chad Henne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Marrone", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "472582", "label": {"eng": "Doug Marrone"}}]}

(Sam Greenwood/Getty Images)\n\nBlake Bortles came into the season on shaky ground, generated negative headlines during training camp and, on Thursday, had a dismal preseason outing televised to a national audience. Afterward, Jaguars Coach Doug Marrone said the starting quarterback job was \"right up there for grabs\" between Bortles and backup Chad Henne.\n\nMeanwhile, more than a few online observers had another suggestion: How about Colin Kaepernick?\n\nAs has been widely noted, the former 49ers quarterback has been out of work since entering free agency in March, even as a succession of quarterbacks with much poorer r\u00e9sum\u00e9s have been signed. Many believe Kaepernick is essentially being shunned by NFL owners for fear of fan backlash following his national anthem protests last season, but Jacksonville may have to worry about some angry fans if it keeps putting Bortles under center.\n\nA couple of plays, in particular, brought out the boo-birds at Jacksonville's EverBank Field during a preseason game against the Buccaneers. Both of them involved throws that badly missed the Jags' top receiver, Allen Robinson, reminding everyone of video from a recent practice in which a frustrated Robinson muttered that his errant quarterback needed \"keep that s -- in bounds.\"\n\nBortles... pic.twitter.com/dbAQAtttyM\n\n-- '06 Chad Jackson (@fearthe_beard11) August 18, 2017\n\nrdreporter7: Colin #Kaepernick is better than Blake #Bortles. nice thr...

Others preferred to make the case that Kaepernick would be a far superior option.\n\nNow imagine arguing that Bortles' BACKUP QB is better than Kaepernick.\n\n-- Cian Fahey (@Cianaf) August 18, 2017\n\nThe team, above all others, that should sign and start Colin Kaepernick is the Jags.

But I'll shut up.\n\n-- Justin Tinsley (@JustinTinsley) August 18, 2017\n\nSomewhere, Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman may have been laughing, given that, earlier this month, he said, \"Blake Bortles has shown you enough to where you don't think Kaep would be a solid fit? Kaep has won games.\"\n\nKaepernick has a lifetime record of 28-30 as an NFL starter, including 1-10 last season, but he has also taken teams to two NFC championship games and a Super Bowl. The best Bortles has done in Jacksonville was a 5-11 mark in 2015, and he has an 11-34 career record after going 3-13 last season. Bortles's career marks in adjusted yards per attempt (6.1) and passer rating (79.6) are also lower than Kaepernick's (7.3, 88.9).\n\nOne Jags fan at the game didn't need to say a word to make his feelings on the matter perfectly clear.\n\nMy dude pic.twitter.com/egcTqDkREI\n\n-- Chris (@kublock) August 18, 2017\n\nHenne fared slightly better Thursday, completing six of 10 passes for 44 yards, with a few drops, and he was given a couple of series with Jacksonville's first-team offense. After the game, a 12-8 loss to Tampa Bay, Marrone said he was \"looking for someone that's going to lead this offense.\"\n\n\"I'm not happy with the performance today,\" Marrone told reporters (via ESPN). \"I'm not going to sit here and BS anyone. Everyone saw it out there. Whatever you want to call it, I'm still trying to evaluate who the best person is at that position.\"\n\nMarrone's comments gave some, such as NFL Network's Gregg Rosenthal, the impression that the coach was very likely to bench Bortles and go with Henne. Unfortunately for Jags fans, ESPN also offered a dispiriting statistic for that scenario.\n\nWorst Total QBR since 2008 (min. 1,500 attempts)\n\nMark Sanchez: 43.4\n\nChad Henne: 45.5\n\nBlake

Folk's lone field goal miss was from 47-yards and he also had an extra point attempt blocked as well. Though he did make two of his kicks, he showed that he's pretty inconsistent overall. All we can do right now is hope that he just had a bad night and that the Bucs' kicking game woes finally come to an end after all.\n\nThe Buccaneers' kicking problems continue. pic.twitter.com/hGXLmllsMv\n\n-- Sporting News (@sportingnews) August 18, 2017", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100, "id": 49, "label": "dmoz/Games"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "wgt": 100, "id": 51, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "wgt": 100, "id": 52, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "wgt": 100, "id": 114, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 100, "id": 288, "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/People/Lost_or_Missing", "wgt": 100, "id": 645, "label": "dmoz/Society/People/Lost or Missing"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "type": "loc", "id": "181655"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302611", "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305872", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "311349", "label": {"eng": "Conversion (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_back", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "324224", "label": {"eng": "Running back"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "329510", "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jameis_Winston", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "342532", "label": {"eng": "Jameis Winston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Martin_(running_back)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "379149", "label": {"eng": "Doug Martin (running back)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Folk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "556096", "label": {"eng": "Nick Folk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1268994", "label": {"eng": "Field goal"}}]}

They'll need something else. Perhaps some more time. Via NFL.com:\n\nCoughlin's influence looms over everything here, including head coach Doug Marrone, who, in turn, calls Coughlin \"Coach.\" The emphasis on culture and mindset and physical and mental toughness is intact. Yes, the clocks in the building are set five minutes fast. No, you may not have a pingpong table in the locker room that is so plush, Coughlin shakes his head over it.\n\nAh, yes, Tom Coughlin's famous fast clock. This is a tradition that Coughlin stole from Vince Lombardi (who was much more punctual btw) which the Giants still follow, though it didn't help them in last year's Wild Card game. Odell Beckham Jr. may have looked at a clock and got confused about when vacation started?\n\nThe clock thing is, in a single word, dumb, but between that and the lack of distracting ping pong tables, the Jaguars will surely shake off the stink of the previous 3, 5, 3, 4, 2, and 5-win seasons.

Henne didn't do anything on the field to distinguish himself, but it's important to note that the Jaguars left their first-team offensive line and receivers in the game when Henne entered late in the first half, and left them in with Henne fairly deep into the second half. On his first play, Henne threw a dart toward Cole, who dropped it. Although the game doesn't really count, it was a great opportunity for the Bucs' coaching staff to evaluate the entire team as a whole and determine what areas the franchise needs to work on the next few weeks before the Bucs face the Dolphins in primetime action and the regular season officially kicks off.\n\nJacksonville's best play in the first half came in the closing minutes when Keelan Cole returned a punt 31 yards that gave the Jaguars a first down at the Tampa Bay 23. Myers' point after missed wide right to keep the Buccaneers' lead at six. On fourth-and-1 from the 2, Allen threw incomplete to Rashad Greene in the end zone. During his time on offense, the Jaguars earned just three first downs with one coming from a penalty. Winston led the Bucs on an 11-play, 83-yard drive on the visitors' first possession, ending in Doug Martin's two-yard TD run.

Most importantly, Winston spread the ball around to his vast array of targets, completing important passes to Mike Evans, DeSean Jackson, Adam Hayward, O.J.

Sign one in free agency. Draft one in April.\n\nThere were options available: Brian Hoyer, Jay Cutler, Mike Glennon and Nick Foles were free agents. Even if the Jaguars were dead set on Leonard Fournette and didn't want to take a quarterback in the early rounds of the draft, they had options there, too: C.J. Beathard (third round by San Francisco) or Nathan Peterman (fifth round by Buffalo), for example.\n\nThe Jaguars should have brought in somebody to battle Bortles, Henne and Brandon Allen in organized team activities, minicamp and training camp. The Jaguars' plan to significantly increase Bortles' practice reps (he said he has thrown the ball more in this camp than the previous three combined) so he could learn to make better decisions and have a better grasp of the offense turned out to be a waste of time.\n\nHere's what Bortles said about those increased reps earlier this week:\n\n\"We're still making mistakes, and we've had thousands of reps,\" he said. \"Imagine if we only had 500, it would be probably way worse. I think the only way to eliminate those mistakes is continue to do it and continue to do it and continue to correct it in meetings until it's beaten in your head that you know how to do it.\"\n\nThat's an alarming statement. Still making mistakes after thousands of reps is bad news. If you're unable to eliminate mistakes after all that work, you're in trouble. While Bortles was talking about the entire offense, it applies to his play, too.\n\nBortles hasn't been any better or worse over the three weeks of training camp and two preseason games than he was last season -- or the season before. He's still staring down receivers. He's still making poor decisions. He's still misfiring on throws that should be practically automatic for NFL quarterbacks (crossing patterns, especially).\n\nBortles has turned the ball over more times (63) than anyone else and thrown the second-most interceptions (51) in the NFL over the past three seasons. He's 11-34 as a starter, and according to ESPN Stats & Information, that's the worst win percentage (.244) of any quarterback taken in the top three of the common draft era (since 1967) with at least 40 starts.\n\nThe other stat that we've beaten to death: He has thrown 11 pick-sixes.\n\nSo taking all that into consideration, it now looks borderline irresponsible that the Jaguars did not bring in someone in the offseason to challenge Bortles. Or at the very least give Henne a fair shot at winning the job when training camp began.\n\nAt least they're doing it now.\n\n\"It's just a matter of the production,\" Marrone said. \"It's not the production we want, OK. I'm not saying that Chad has it or not. It's right up there for grabs, and either person can take it. But it's up there, and we'll take a look at it, and at the end of the day, we'll make the best decision. Again, who is the best person?\n\n\"It's very simple. Who is the best person to put in that position to lead the offense?\"", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Time_Period", "wgt": 100, "id": 286, "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Time Period"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Camping", "wgt": 100, "id": 367, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Camping"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Domain_Names", "wgt": 100, "id": 403, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Domain Names"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "wgt": 100, "id": 463, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Math/Operations_Research", "wgt": 100, "id": 508, "label": "dmoz/Science/Math/Operations Research"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps", "wgt": 100, "id": 533, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/North_America", "wgt": 100, "id": 534, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/North America"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Special_Needs", "wgt": 100, "id": 535, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Special Needs"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "wgt": 100, "id": 537, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Chad"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republic of Chad"}, "type": "loc", "id": "215"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville"}, "type": "loc", "id": "181844"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "type": "loc", "id": "229192"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304976", "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305661", "label": {"eng": "National Football League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "305867", "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305872", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "306949", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "310476", "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League_preseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "314202", "label": {"eng": "National Football League preseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake_Bortles", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "342528", "label": {"eng": "Blake Bortles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Foles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "345700", "label": {"eng": "Nick Foles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Cutler_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "355416", "label": {"eng": "Jay Cutler (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Glennon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "368108", "label": {"eng": "Mike Glennon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Hoyer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "378919", "label": {"eng": "Brian Hoyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Henne", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "390554", "label": {"eng": "Chad Henne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Marrone", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "472582", "label": {"eng": "Doug Marrone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "945375", "label": {"eng": "Common draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Fournette", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "1269793", "label": {"eng": "Leonard Fournette"}}]}

According to Marrone, he's looking for the best person to lead the Jaguars offense. \"The QB position is right up there for grabs, and either person can take it,\" said Marrone, adding that Bortles got to earn the starting spot.\n\nBortles completed eight of 13 passes for 65 yards with no touchdown or interceptions while third-string quarterback Brandon Allen went 10-for-15 for 144 yards and a score. Chad Henne completed six of 10 passes for 44 yards for the Jaguars, who dropped to 1-1 in the preseason after a 12-6 loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nBortles failed to spark the Jaguars' offense as they went scoreless in the first half. A disappointed Marrone sent out Henne to finish the first half and start the second half before Allen took over. In two preseason outings, Bortles is 11-for-18 for 81 yards with no touchdowns and no picks while Henne completed 11 of 16 passes for 183 yards and a score. Through two preseason games, Allen was 15-for-22 for 229 yards with two touchdowns. The Jaguars have six days to evaluate their quarterback options before their third preseason outing against the Carolina Panthers.\n\n#Jameis Winston completed 21 of 29 throws for 196 yards while backup Ryan Fitzpatrick went 6-for-9 for 47 yards and an interception as the Buccaneers (1-1) notched their first preseason win.\n\nMike Evans caught five passes for 57 yards, Adam Humphries received five throws for 42 yards, while Doug Martin carried the ball five times for 30 yards and a score. Martin put the Buccaneers on the board with a two-yard run that capped an 11-play, 83-yard drive by Winston. However, Nick Folk's extra-point kick was blocked for a 6-0 lead. Folk atoned for his miss by making two field goals from 35 and 29 yards to give the Buccaneers a 12-0 lead at the half.\n\nIn the fourth, Allen sparked a five-play, 63-yard attack that he ended with a four-yard scoring throw to Marquez Williams but Jason Myers missed the extra point kick. The Jaguars forced a safety late in the fourth for the final tally. Folk made two of three field goals since he became the Buccaneers starting kicker. He assumed the position after second-year kicker Roberto Aguayo was released by the team due to his struggles in training camp and in their 23-12 preseason loss to the Cincinnati Bengals.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100, "id": 32, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "wgt": 100, "id": 51, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "wgt": 100, "id": 86, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100, "id": 161, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 100, "id": 288, "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "wgt": 100, "id": 463, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/People/Lost_or_Missing", "wgt": 100, "id": 645, "label": "dmoz/Society/People/Lost or Missing"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302611", "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304976", "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305436", "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305872", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "306949", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_(American_and_Canadian_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "309405", "label": {"eng": "Safety (American and Canadian football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "311349", "label": {"eng": "Conversion (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League_preseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "314202", "label": {"eng": "National Football League preseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "329510", "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "330906", "label": {"eng": "Carolina Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jameis_Winston", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "342532", "label": {"eng": "Jameis Winston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Fitzpatrick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "357140", "label": {"eng": "Ryan Fitzpatrick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Martin_(running_back)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "379149", "label": {"eng": "Doug Martin (running back)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Henne", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "390554", "label": {"eng": "Chad Henne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Marrone", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "472582", "label": {"eng": "Doug Marrone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Folk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "556096", "label": {"eng": "Nick Folk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1268994", "label": {"eng": "Field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Myers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "1274828", "label": {"eng": "Jason Myers"}}]}

Henne didn't do anything on the field to distinguish himself, but it's important to note that the Jaguars left their first-team offensive line and receivers in the game when Henne entered late in the first half, and left them in with Henne fairly deep into the second half. On his first play, Henne threw a dart toward Cole, who dropped it. He completed a four-yard pass to rookie fullback Marquez Williams for a touchdown on his first series. The drive stalled at the Tampa Bay 45 with a sack. Myers' point after missed wide right to keep the Buccaneers' lead at six.

I mean #blakebortles tonight?\n\n\"Man #blakebortles playing like trash.\"\n\nThe customers always write, even when they are wrong, but there is a disconcerting rumble in cyberspace, given the struggles that Bortles had last season as the starting quarterback of the Jacksonville Jaguars.\n\nBortles, the former UCF star, completed eight of 13 passes for only 65 yards in a first-half stint against the Tampa Bay Bucs Thursday night. To compare and contrast, Bucs counterpart Jameis Winston was crisp and efficient, completing 21 of 29 passes for 196 yards.\n\nExhibition games can be classified as meaningless scrums, except when they're not. Two games into the exhibition season, Winston is President of the Glee Club and Prom King. Bortles is the guy wearing \"Hello my name is\" sticker, hoping he fits in.\n\nWelcome to a tale of two cities, Tampa Bay and Jacksonville. The Charles Dickens classic has been usurped by Adam Schefter, Jon Gruden, Kurt Warner, and every other NFL talking head in our cluttered cyberspace universe.\n\nSpeaking of, Gruden compared Bortles to a golfer who has lost his swing during the ESPN telecast of the game Thursday night.\n\nAnd at the risk of a 15-yard piling on penalty, Bortles was also ripped by one of his receivers, Allen Robinson, who reportedly blasted Bortles with an expletive during practice earlier this week because Bortles couldn't throw a ball to him that was in-bounds.\n\nOn the flip side, everybody seems to be on Team Jameis in Tampa. He is in the Cool Kids corner, every step and smile documented by the ubiquitous Hard Knocks cameras.\n\nBortles' steps in Jacksonville are measured carefully, inspected for proper form and footwork, a product of his struggles in 2016.\n\nBortles made the most memorable play, keeping his feet on the ground while in the arms of Bucs star defensive tackle Gerald McCoy. He managed to flip the ball to T.J. Yeldon for the most impressive two-year gain you will ever see.\n\nWinston looked good in the most impressive incompletion you will ever see, as DeSean Jackson dropped a deep throw that would have been a score.\n\nBut Winston will be good. Very good. Bortles? Yikes?\n\nHe may never engage with the Twitter trolls who ripped him, but he had to hear the smattering of boos at times when he missed his targets.\n\nWinston and Bortles are the fancy Ferraris and Lamborghinis. Winston is humming along. Bortles needs a tune-up. What happens in September and October will set the tone for what happens in November and December, and any playoff push.\n\nFor now, it's mostly practice, practice, practice, including two days of joint practices Monday and Tuesday.\n\n\"I feel good,\" Bortles said earlier this week. \"There's definitely things to improve on, things to be better at. I feel comfortable with the system and the scheme and everything that we're doing, it's just continuing to run these reps. As an offense, I think one thing that is overlooked is it's the first year in the system, so I think that's something.\"\n\nThe \"new\" offense comes with an asterisk. Nathaniel Hackett is the offensive coordinator, but he actually started the gig last October when he replaced Greg Olson, who was fired.\n\nBortles has yet to be fired. But he won't be able to weather much more of those sourpuss reviews before first-year coach Dough Marrone is forced to make a difficult decision.\n\nSomething stinks in Jacksonville. It's up to Bortles to fix it.\n\ngdiaz@orlandosentinel.com; @georgediaz on Twitter", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100, "id": 49, "label": "dmoz/Games"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "wgt": 100, "id": 51, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web", "wgt": 100, "id": 150, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "wgt": 100, "id": 641, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100, "id": 1546, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville"}, "type": "loc", "id": "181844"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tampa"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa,_Florida", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tampa"}, "type": "loc", "id": "182437"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "302546", "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glee_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304911", "label": {"eng": "Glee (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "305439", "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305661", "label": {"eng": "National Football League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashtag", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305777", "label": {"eng": "Hashtag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "305867", "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305872", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306949", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeSean_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "310122", "label": {"eng": "DeSean Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(American_and_Canadian_football)#Defensive_tackle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "312085", "label": {"eng": "Defensive tackle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League_preseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "314202", "label": {"eng": "National Football League preseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "329510", "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thursday_Night_Football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "330672", "label": {"eng": "Thursday Night Football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Dickens", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "334178", "label": {"eng": "Charles Dickens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaine_Gabbert", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "342530", "label": {"eng": "Blaine Gabbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jameis_Winston", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "342532", "label": {"eng": "Jameis Winston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Gruden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "343233", "label": {"eng": "Jon Gruden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Schefter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "345701", "label": {"eng": "Adam Schefter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Robinson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "362447", "label": {"eng": "Allen Robinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._Yeldon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "405433", "label": {"eng": "T.

Instead, at least one had a Colin Kaepernick jersey, which says all you need to know.\n\nWhen your fans are willing to spend hundreds of dollars to buy a jersey for a quarterback who's not even on your team, that's usually a sign that they're not happy with the on-field product.\n\nOf course, just because a few fans want Kaepernick on the roster doesn't mean it's going to happen. To be clear, in this case, \"a few\" actually means a lot.\n\nAlthough Jaguars coach Doug Marrone sounded very open to the idea of benching Bortles after his team's loss to Tampa, he didn't really want to comment on the idea of bringing in a free agent quarterback.\n\n\"I don't work with the 'outside the roster stuff,'\" Marrone said when asked if the starting quarterback might not be on the roster yet. \"So for me, I can't answer that question. I work with what we have.\"\n\nBy the way, if you're scoring at home, it's not just fans who have lost all faith in Bortles.

Sign one in free agency. Draft one in April.\n\nThere were options available: Brian Hoyer, Jay Cutler, Mike Glennon and Nick Foles were free agents. Even if the Jaguars were dead set on Leonard Fournette and didn't want to take a quarterback in the early rounds of the draft, they had options there, too: C.J. Beathard (third round by San Francisco) or Nathan Peterman (fifth round by Buffalo), for example.\n\nThe Jaguars should have brought in somebody to battle Bortles, Henne and Brandon Allen in organized team activities, minicamp and training camp. The Jaguars' plan to significantly increase Bortles' practice reps (he said he has thrown the ball more in this camp than the previous three combined) so he could learn to make better decisions and have a better grasp of the offense turned out to be a waste of time.\n\nHere's what Bortles said about those increased reps earlier this week:\n\n\"We're still making mistakes, and we've had thousands of reps,\" he said. \"Imagine if we only had 500, it would be probably way worse. I think the only way to eliminate those mistakes is continue to do it and continue to do it and continue to correct it in meetings until it's beaten in your head that you know how to do it.\"\n\nThat's an alarming statement. Still making mistakes after thousands of reps is bad news. If you're unable to eliminate mistakes after all that work, you're in trouble. While Bortles was talking about the entire offense, it applies to his play, too.\n\nBortles hasn't been any better or worse over the three weeks of training camp and two preseason games than he was last season -- or the season before. He's still staring down receivers. He's still making poor decisions. He's still misfiring on throws that should be practically automatic for NFL quarterbacks (crossing patterns, especially).\n\nBortles has turned the ball over more times (63) than anyone else and thrown the second-most interceptions (51) in the NFL over the past three seasons. He's 11-34 as a starter, and according to ESPN Stats & Information, that's the worst win percentage (.244) of any quarterback taken in the top three of the common draft era (since 1967) with at least 40 starts.\n\nThe other stat that we've beaten to death: He has thrown 11 pick-sixes.\n\nSo taking all that into consideration, it now looks borderline irresponsible that the Jaguars did not bring in someone in the offseason to challenge Bortles. Or at the very least give Henne a fair shot at winning the job when training camp began.\n\nAt least they're doing it now.\n\n\"It's just a matter of the production,\" Marrone said. \"It's not the production we want, OK.

He looked the part early against the Jacksonville Jaguars Thursday night, leading a scoring drive on the opening possession for the second straight week and completing passes to nine different receivers.\n\nBut Winston failed to follow his own cardinal rule: protect the football. He got lucky in the second quarter when an interception was ruled a fumble, but that was a rookie mistake. He was being pulled down from behind by a defender, and rather than just take the sack, he tossed the ball into the air. The frustration was evident on coach Dirk Koetter's face, as it was when the offense unsuccessfully ran a tw0-minute drill. It resulted in an illegal shift, a sack given up by Leonard Wester and a holding call on J.R. Sweezy forcing a second-and-32.\n\nQB depth chart: In two quarters, Winston completed 21 of 29 passes for 196 yards, with no touchdowns and no interceptions. With Ryan Griffin nursing a sprained AC joint in his shoulder, Ryan Fitzpatrick came in next. He did a much better job of protecting the football this week. But like Winston, he had a very tidy pocket to work with.\n\nWhen it was starters vs. starters, the Bucs looked ... significantly better than their Jaguars counterparts and significantly better than how they practiced. This was a much more level playing field Monday and Tuesday. The Jaguars' pass rush was practically a non-factor Thursday. The Bucs' defense was aided by Blake Bortles' inaccuracy. Still, the Bucs left scoring opportunities on the table.\n\nOne (or two) reasons to be concerned: In what Bucs fans would call a cruel twist of fate, kicker Nick Folk missed an extra point in the first quarter. It was blocked by Calais Campbell, so it wasn't self-inflicted, but his next miss was -- a 47-yarder that sailed wide right in the fourth quarter. Roberto Aguayo was booted last week after he missed a PAT and a field goal. Even though Koetter said it was time to \"get behind Folk,\" might general manager Jason Licht's earlier comment about the Bucs kicker possibly not even being on their roster hold true? In the second quarter, Folk made field goals of 35 and 29 yards.\n\nThat guy could start: This isn't a campaign to make him a starter, but Adarius Glanton had a solid game. Glanton led the Bucs with six tackles, a sack that came on a blitz and two tackles for a loss.\n\nRookie watch: After being rendered catchless last week, tight end O.J. Howard caught two passes for 28 yards. Starting at strongside linebacker for an injured Devante Bond, Kendell Beckwith finished with four tackles and two tackles for a loss. Safety Justin Evans registered two tackles and a pass breakup. Wide receiver Chris Godwin had two catches for 30 yards. Jeremy McNichols had 11 carries for 32 yards. Linebacker Riley Bullough had five tackles. Cornerback Maurice Fleming had two tackles and a big pass breakup on third-and-1 to keep the Jaguars out of the end zone with 1:37 to go.\n\nDouggernaut: The Bucs successfully marched down the field on the opening drive largely because of running back Doug Martin, who finished the game with five rushes for 30 yards and a touchdown. He also had two catches for 11 yards. His touchdown on the opening drive was the only one of the day for the Bucs. Martin knows he's not guaranteed a job when he returns from a three-game suspension, but he certainly did his part to leaving a lasting impression.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 100, "id": 31, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100, "id": 32, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Outdoors", "wgt": 100, "id": 405, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Outdoors"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "wgt": 100, "id": 447, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "wgt": 100, "id": 463, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/People/Lost_or_Missing", "wgt": 100, "id": 645, "label": "dmoz/Society/People/Lost or Missing"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Beauty_Pageants", "wgt": 100, "id": 646, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Beauty Pageants"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302605", "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302611", "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302622", "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "304975", "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304976", "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305872", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "306949", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "309225", "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "309400", "label": {"eng": "Strong-side linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_(American_and_Canadian_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "309405", "label": {"eng": "Safety (American and Canadian football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "310129", "label": {"eng": "End zone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "310130", "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "310743", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "311349", "label": {"eng": "Conversion (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placekicker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "311350", "label": {"eng": "Placekicker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tight_end", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "312020", "label": {"eng": "Tight end"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monday_Night_Football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "323763", "label": {"eng": "Monday Night Football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_back", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "324224", "label": {"eng": "Running back"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fumble", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "324226", "label": {"eng": "Fumble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._J._Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "327035", "label": {"eng": "O.

If Bortles had hit Robinson in stride, he'd possible still be running.\n\nThe question now becomes whether Bortles, who completed eight of 13 passes for 65 yards, will be sitting. ESPN's Jon Gruden already has suggested that Chad Henne get some first-team reps so that Bortles can get his mind right, and so that the coaching staff can see what Henne can do.\n\nThere's another important reason to park Bortles' butt on the bench. With more than $18 million in injury-guaranteed salary due for 2018, the Jaguars may want to do with Bortles what Washington did with Robert Griffin III in 2015, putting him in bubble wrap and ensuring that he'll be healthy enough to pass a physical (and be cut) before his 2018 pay becomes fully guaranteed.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics", "wgt": 100, "id": 375, "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Education", "wgt": 100, "id": 376, "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Education"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "wgt": 100, "id": 463, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100, "id": 485, "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "wgt": 100, "id": 1163, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North_America", "wgt": 100, "id": 1164, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North America"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Europe", "wgt": 100, "id": 1165, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Europe"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Communication_Disorders", "wgt": 100, "id": 1315, "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Communication Disorders"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville"}, "type": "loc", "id": "181844"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "305867", "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305872", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306949", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Griffin_III", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "310096", "label": {"eng": "Robert Griffin III"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake_Bortles", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "342528", "label": {"eng": "Blake Bortles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Gruden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "343233", "label": {"eng": "Jon Gruden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Robinson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "362447", "label": {"eng": "Allen Robinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Henne", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "390554", "label": {"eng": "Chad Henne"}}]}

What do we expect from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2017?\n\nIt's safe to say we're not shy when it comes to getting you ready for the upcoming NFL season. Since March, we have strung together four different series in preparation for the fall. We have looked at all 32 teams' most improved area. That was preceded by pieces on a club's best offseason addition, some facts, figures and feats for each squad, as well as an up-and-coming player for each roster.\n\nSo call this one for the thumb. With the regular-season rapidly approaching, we'll take a look at what we could expect from each team. Every team wants to win the Super Bowl. However, 31 teams will obviously be disappointed. So we have been taking a look at all 32 clubs (in original 2017 draft order) and doing a little analysis. You can play catch up right here. So what are we really expecting from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2017?\n\nIt wasn't long ago that the Tampa Bay Buccaneers were seemingly rebuilding team via free agency and trades. Of course, we are also not that far removed from this franchise sporting a 2-14 record in 2014. Two years later and under the control of first-time NFL head coach Dirk Koetter, the Bucs orchestrated a 9-7 season thanks to eight wins in their final 12 games.\n\nThis offseason, the free-agent pickups of defensive tackle Chris Baker, wide receiver DeSean Jackson and safety J.J. Wilcox. The latter helps fortify a secondary that features cornerbacks Brent Grimes and Vernon Hargreaves. Jackson will now pair with prolific Mike Evans and give Jameis Winston a solid tandem. And Baker will pair inside with Gerald McCoy as Mike Smith's defensive unit looks to push the pocket. That makes life easier for emerging pass rusher Noah Spence, as well as play-making linebackers Lavonte David and Kwon Alexander.\n\nFinally, the Bucs also added University of Alabama tight end O.J. Howard with the 19th pick in the draft. He should help the team's ground game (minus Doug Martin for the first 3 games due to suspension). And teamed with Cameron Brate, Winston should flourish in the offense's two tight end sets.\n\nSummation:\n\nArmed with some new weapons on the offensive side of the football, there's a lot to be excited about if you're Koetter and Winston this season. Jackson and Howard are big-play additions to a Tampa Bay Buccaneers offensive unit on the verge of big things. Still, it's the defense that needs to up its game this year and not just in terms of relying on takeaways. Baker should help make this club stauncher against the run and conversely tougher to throw against.\n\nThe NFC South has produced the last two conference champions and it would be bold to think the Bucs could make it three straight from the same division. At the very least, this club has improved enough to win at least one more game from a year ago. And that could mean Tampa's first appearance in the NFL playoffs since 2007.\n\nRussell S.

When I did a similarity analysis of Derek Carr, Blake Bortles, and Teddy Bridgewater before the 2016 season, the results said that Carr was likely to be a star and Bortles far less likely to develop. (Remember, this was before inputting last season's diverging paths).\n\nLast season was a disaster. His play was worse than the disappointing final numbers, because he was dreadful during the first half of games and often padded stats late in blowouts.\n\nI was stunned when Jacksonville exercised the fifth-year option-and that they brought no competition in to push him-since the rest of the roster feels like it's ready to make a leap and Bortles is holding back the offense. In May, I wrote they were the best fit for Colin Kaepernick on the field, as a guy who could bridge and start if Bortles floundered under pressure.\n\nBortles has been, by most accounts, bad again throughout camp. He threw 5 interceptions in a practice session, which drew attention. Yes, it's practice, but when you are looking for redemption, not good. And there have been plenty of examples of teammates showing their frustration. This one from Allen Robinson this week definitely rates as the funniest (warning: NFSW language).\n\nRobert McClain on Allen Robinson. Plays him well, ball thrown too far out of bounds (unfortunately for one man too close to the sideline) pic.twitter.com/9iBQd0Iq03\n\n-- PewterReport (@PewterReport) August 15, 2017\n\nIn light of Doug Marrone's equivocation about Bortles still being the starter after Thursday's preseason debacle against Tampa Bay, the fifth-year option will likely be the hammer to go along with all his errant nails.\n\nWe saw Washington go to Kirk Cousins entering year 4, after exercising Robert Griffin's injury-only option. They put RG3 on a shelf after a preseason concussion, never to play for the organization again. Last year, Colin Kaepernick had an injury-only guarantee for the 2017 season, and the team initially went with Blaine Gabbert, and only inserted Kaepernick after he restructured the deal to eliminate those guarantees.\n\nBortles has been bad, and they don't want to be paying him $18 million in 2018 if he goes out in early October and tears his ACL. So that fifth-year option probably now means the practical end for Bortles, if Chad Henne (who I now expect to start the third preseason game) can show competently.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100, "id": 49, "label": "dmoz/Games"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "wgt": 100, "id": 51, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "wgt": 100, "id": 114, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "wgt": 100, "id": 284, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Field_Hockey", "wgt": 100, "id": 434, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Field Hockey"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 100, "id": 523, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "wgt": 100, "id": 641, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Card_Games", "wgt": 100, "id": 805, "label": "dmoz/Games/Card Games"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville"}, "type": "loc", "id": "181844"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tampa"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa,_Florida", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tampa"}, "type": "loc", "id": "182437"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "302546", "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304976", "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "306949", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Griffin_III", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "310096", "label": {"eng": "Robert Griffin III"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "312167", "label": {"eng": "Concussion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League_preseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "314202", "label": {"eng": "National Football League preseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake_Bortles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "342528", "label": {"eng": "Blake Bortles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaine_Gabbert", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "342530", "label": {"eng": "Blaine Gabbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk_Cousins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "351349", "label": {"eng": "Kirk Cousins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teddy_Bridgewater", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "357137", "label": {"eng": "Teddy Bridgewater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Robinson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "362447", "label": {"eng": "Allen Robinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Kaepernick", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "395519", "label": {"eng": "Colin Kaepernick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Carr_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "407477", "label": {"eng": "Derek Carr (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Marrone", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "472582", "label": {"eng": "Doug Marrone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_McClain", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "518047", "label": {"eng": "Robert McClain"}}]}

The annoying thing about them is that their answers make sense, and they tend to be a lot more accurate than the more optimistic fans.\n\nThis year's no different: Football Outsiders has been pretty skeptical of the Bucs' playoff chances as well as their overall quality, while other third-party analysts are pretty optimistic.\n\nSo one of the answers I asked Andrew Potter, who wrote the Bucs chapter of this year's 2017 Football Outsiders Almanac, was about that split between Football Outsiders and many other analysts -- and the answer's so long and involved that it deserves its own post, and a full quote.\n\nMost analysts are fairly optimistic about the Bucs' chances. Football Outsiders really hasn't been, at least in your models. Can you explain where this disconnect comes from?\n\nThat's the first question I asked myself too when writing the chapter! There's a lot of different factors at play in answering this, so there's no quick and easy reply. I'll try to summarize what our model said as best I can.\n\nMost analysts are affected by a degree of recency bias: they look at last year's Bucs, with great defensive numbers throughout the second half of the season, adding DeSean Jackson in place of whatever set of crutches was trotted out at wide receiver alongside Mike Evans, with healthy running backs and a first-round tight end, and think it's a sure thing that the Bucs will be better.\n\nOur model sees a team that suddenly had one good half-season of pass defense after several years of mediocrity - and it really was a half-season: the pass defense's worst seven games all came in Week 11 or earlier, whereas five of its best six came in Week 10 or later (the other was opening day, against Atlanta). We see a pass rush where the sack rate outperformed the pressure rate by a lot, when pressure rate is more consistent year-on-year than sack rate. We see that the unit also had well above-average health in 2016, and that opponents had an above-average number of turnovers. None of those factors on their own are especially massive, but all of them together suggest that the Bucs pass defense is a candidate to regress next year.\n\nOn offense, we see a line undergoing major reshuffling as a potential problem area, especially as it wasn't great last year either. The pressure numbers on offense are the inverse of the defensive equivalent: Jameis Winston took a lot of hits and pressures but relatively few sacks, and our model doesn't like that. (Subjectively, there are additional factors in play here: hits that Winston creates on himself by holding the ball instead of throwing it away, should-be-sacks that Winston escapes when other quarterbacks wouldn't, and so on.) We see, again, a lot of turnovers - turnovers being more consistent on offense than defense, and something new receivers won't necessarily fix. We see injury-prone, ineffective running backs, and an unsustainably high DVOA on screen passes to those backs. Again, it's not just one thing, like say if Ben Roethlisberger had retired in Pittsburgh, but a combination of smaller factors that all add up.\n\nFinally, the Bucs special teams are horrible. Roberto Aguayo grabs all the headlines for that, and his well-documented miscues have now led to his release, but he was far from the only problem. The kickoff team was passable, but the Bucs set a league record for lowest average kick return last year, and haven't scored either a kick or punt return touchdown since 2010. Only an above-average performance by the punting unit kept them out of the bottom three in our special teams rankings for 2016. A lot of analysts forget about special teams when making their predictions, but they are an important part of the game - enough to make a difference in the win/loss column, especially for a team with playoff ambitions.\n\nPersonally, I'm cautiously optimistic for the Buccaneers - they have a good, young core with the likes of Winston, Mike Evans, Ali Marpet, Lavonte David, and Kwon Alexander. I'm a believer in both Chris Godwin and Jeremy McNichols. I love the aggressiveness of signing Jackson to give the young quarterback another top target, the resources devoted to the team's biggest need at safety, and the addition of Chris Baker on the interior defensive line. That said, we've seen enough teams win the offseason every year and disappoint when the action starts - Jackson's former employer used to be famous for it - to be wary of the hype until we see how all of those pieces actually fit together.", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 100, "id": 31, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100, "id": 32, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "wgt": 100, "id": 447, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tampa"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa,_Florida", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tampa"}, "type": "loc", "id": "182437"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "type": "loc", "id": "222244"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302611", "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305661", "label": {"eng": "National Football League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305872", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeSean_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "310122", "label": {"eng": "DeSean Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "310130", "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "310743", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tight_end", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "312020", "label": {"eng": "Tight end"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football_positions#Special_teams", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "322846", "label": {"eng": "Special teams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_back", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "324224", "label": {"eng": "Running back"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punt_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "325513", "label": {"eng": "Punt (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_Outsiders", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "328979", "label": {"eng": "Football Outsiders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "329510", "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Roethlisberger", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "342525", "label": {"eng": "Ben Roethlisberger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jameis_Winston", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "342532", "label": {"eng": "Jameis Winston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavonte_David", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "368094", "label": {"eng": "Lavonte David"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Aguayo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "380387", "label": {"eng": "Roberto Aguayo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outsiders_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "478870", "label": {"eng": "Outsiders (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwon_Alexander", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "1292685", "label": {"eng": "Kwon Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Marpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "1326280", "label": {"eng": "Ali Marpet"}}]}

The run defense struggling was a surprise, too, The Bucs' first-team offense averaged 5.0 yards per carry and Doug Martin had 30 yards on five carries.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theaters", "wgt": 100, "id": 9, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theaters"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100, "id": 25, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 100, "id": 28, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100, "id": 32, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 100, "id": 36, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "wgt": 100, "id": 284, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 100, "id": 288, "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "wgt": 100, "id": 829, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville"}, "type": "loc", "id": "181844"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tampa"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa,_Florida", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tampa"}, "type": "loc", "id": "182437"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302611", "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304511", "label": {"eng": "Lead"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304975", "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304976", "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305661", "label": {"eng": "National Football League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305872", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306949", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "309400", "label": {"eng": "Strong-side linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "310129", "label": {"eng": "End zone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "310130", "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "310743", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "311349", "label": {"eng": "Conversion (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punt_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "325513", "label": {"eng": "Punt (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "329510", "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jameis_Winston", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "342532", "label": {"eng": "Jameis Winston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Fitzpatrick", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "357140", "label": {"eng": "Ryan Fitzpatrick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Robinson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "362447", "label": {"eng": "Allen Robinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent_Grimes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "380284", "label": {"eng": "Brent Grimes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Aguayo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "380387", "label": {"eng": "Roberto Aguayo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calais_Campbell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "391963", "label": {"eng": "Calais Campbell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1268994", "label": {"eng": "Field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Myers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1274828", "label": {"eng": "Jason Myers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashad_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1292628", "label": {"eng": "Rashad Greene"}}]}

Ryan Mallett threw for 113 yards and a touchdown , Josh Woodrum ran for two more scores and the Baltimore Ravens beat the Dolphins 31-7 on Thursday night in the second preseason game for both teams.\n\nCutler played the first two series for the Dolphins, his debut as injured starter Ryan Tannehill's replacement in Miami. He was 3 of 6 for 24 yards , some of it in a no-huddle tempo, and his highlight play was one that didn't count. Facing a third-and-16, Cutler stepped up and found DeVante Parker for what would have been a 31-yard gain -- one erased by a holding flag.\n\nCutler took a big hit on his last snap, courtesy of the Ravens' Za'Darius Smith. He got up without any problem, then switched his helmet for a baseball cap and headset.\n\nRavens starting quarterback Joe Flacco isn't expected to play until Week 1 of the regular season because of back woes, and Mallett played the entire first half.\n\nMallett completed 13 of 22 passes, getting intercepted twice -- both on passes intended for Quincy Adeboyejo. The first pick was by Xavier Howard on a ball lofted down the left sideline and overthrow, the other coming when Cordrea Tankersley ripped the ball out of Adeboyejo's hands after he had to reach back to make a catch on a quick slant.\n\nWoodrum completed eight of 10 passes for 110 yards.\n\nSenorise Perry had an 11-yard touchdown run for Miami, but he also fumbled away a kickoff return -- one of many Miami special-teams miscues. The Dolphins also had a punt blocked in the second quarter, setting up Mallett's 1-yard touchdown toss to Larry Donnell, and later had a hold on a kickoff return.\n\nGase said Miami had 10 men on the field for the blocked punt.\n\nPHILADELPHIA 20, BUFFALO 16: At Philadelphia, of all the high-profile players making debuts in a new uniform, Eagles cornerback Ronald Darby was most impressive.\n\nDarby intercepted former teammate Tyrod Taylor's pass and returned it 48 yards and also broke up two passes in his first game since Philadelphia acquired him from Buffalo last week, and the Eagles beat the Bills 20-16 on Thursday night.\n\nAlshon Jeffery, a former Pro Bowl wide receiver signed by the Eagles in the offseason, caught his first pass from Carson Wentz and finished with two receptions for 23 yards.\n\nBills cornerback E.J. Gaines also had an interception in his first game since coming from the Rams in a trade last week. Gaines picked third-string quarterback Matt McGloin, who has struggled in two preseason games.\n\nWideout Anquan Boldin, a three-time Pro Bowl pick recently signed by the Bills, caught one pass for 5 yards.\n\nThe Eagles traded wide receiver Jordan Matthews and a 2018 third-round pick for Darby. Matthews, a popular player in Philadelphia's locker room, didn't make the trip because of a chest injury.\n\nBoth teams looked sloppy in a mistake-filled game. There were 23 penalties and seven turnovers, including Mitchell White's interception in the end zone on the final play to secure the win.\n\nWentz completed 6 of 9 passes for 56 yards. Taylor was 8 of 18 for 53 yards and two interceptions.\n\nAfter T.J. Yates tossed a 9-yard touchdown pass to Brandon Reilly late in the fourth quarter to give the Bills a 16-13 lead, Philadelphia's Byron Marshall ran in from the 1 for the go-ahead score.\n\nTAMPA BAY 12, JACKSONVILLE 8: At Jacksonville, Florida, Jameis Winston continued his solid preseason, completing 21 of 29 passes for 196 yards and helping the Tampa Bay Buccaneers beat woeful Jacksonville 12-8 on Thursday night.\n\nWinston had two passes dropped, including what would have been a 43-yard touchdown strike to Mike Evans in the first quarter.\n\nThe Buccaneers (1-1) scored on their first three possessions, getting a short touchdown run from Doug Martin and two field goals from Nick Folk. Tampa Bay dominated Jacksonville in two quarters that featured mostly starters, outgaining the Jags 240-59 and looking like the much better team.\n\nFolk, who won the kicking job last week after the Bucs waived former second-round draft pick Roberto Aguayo, had an extra point blocked by Calais Campbell. He also missed a 47-yarder wide right in the fourth quarter.\n\nEvans finished with five catches for 57 yards, but missed a chance for a huge gain when he let Winston's perfectly thrown deep ball slip through his fingers. It was about the only thing that went right for the Jaguars (1-1).\n\nJacksonville's night went so awry that coach Doug Marrone now seemingly has open competitions at quarterback and place-kicker.\n\nBackup quarterback Chad Henne got some work with the first-team offense, fueling speculation that Blake Bortles has lost his grasp on the starting job.\n\nHenne entered late in the second quarter after Bortles played four series that ended in punts. Even though the move had been planned beforehand, it surely created the appearance that Marrone and football czar Tom Coughlin are wavering in their commitment to Bortles.\n\nMarrone and Coughlin have publicly supported Bortles all year, even picking up the fifth-year option in his rookie contract. But Marrone pulled the third overall pick in the 2014 NFL draft last week following two interceptions. Marrone said Bortles' \"arm looked tired.\" Bortles denied having any issues.\n\nBortles completed 8 of 13 passes for 65 yards against the Bucs. He doesn't have a touchdown or a turnover in two preseason games.\n\nHenne's first pass should have resulted in a touchdown, but Keelan Cole dropped it at the goal line. Henne finished 6-of-10 passing for 44 yards.\n\nJason Myers missed from 40 yards out, leaving him 1 for 4 on the season. He also missed an extra point in the fourth. The Jaguars don't have another kicker in camp, but that likely will change Friday.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100, "id": 32, "label":

Or maybe that place should be Jacksonville, and the time should be now.\n\nThat would mean either starting Chad Henne, which will also lead to lost hair, or scrambling to upgrade at the position in late August. And the answer to the question that just popped into your mind is an all caps \"YES.\" Yes, Colin Kaepernick would be an upgrade over Bortles, and it's not close.\n\nIt's not close because Bortles somehow still looks lost, and did again Thursday against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He was in the game for four drives, two of which ended in three-and-outs, and he averaged only five yards per pass attempt.\n\nHe's not some upstart young passer anymore with developmental potential. Bortles is still struggling with his mechanics entering his fourth season after throwing 51 interceptions over 46 career games.\n\nHis own wide receivers are reaching the end of their tolerance. So is a fanbase desperate for success, and fearing the worst, which is Bortles derailing an otherwise talented roster.\n\nOf course, the state of NFL quarterback play can leave faces buried in palms everywhere if the wrong teams are playing.

The nine-year veteran had a drive late in the first half, and that unit went back out there to start the third quarter. Jaguars coach Doug Marrone told ESPN's Lisa Salters at halftime that he wanted Henne to start the second half with the first-team offense because he was unhappy with how the unit played.\n\nMarrone said the entire offense was at fault for underperforming, not just Bortles. However, the unit seemed to have a little more life with Henne. Henne's first two throws on his first drive late were potential touchdown passes that were dropped by Keelan Cole and Allen Robinson.\n\nThat was as close to scoring a touchdown as Jacksonville's first-team offense has come in the two preseason games.\n\nQB depth chart: Bortles, entering his fourth NFL season, was a lackluster 8-for-13 for 65 yards, and the first-team offense punted on all four of his drives. It wasn't entirely his fault: The run game generated no yards on six carries and the offensive line had trouble with the Bucs' defensive front. Per ESPN Stats & Information, the Jaguars have three points in six series with Bortles on the field this preseason. Henne's numbers weren't much better (6-of-10 for 44 yards), but he saw those two potential touchdown passes dropped in his work with the first-team offense. Brandon Allen went 10-for-14 for 144 yards and a touchdown against the Bucs' third- and fourth-teamers.\n\nWhen it was starters vs. starters, the Jaguars looked ...: Awful. The Jaguars were outgained 240-59, with just 1 yard rushing, and had just four first downs on offense in the first half. The longest run of the first half was 3 yards. The offensive line couldn't create any space, and Bortles missed Robinson twice on deep passes, including one he underthrew badly. Meanwhile, Tampa Bay quarterback Jameis Winston completed 21 of 29 passes for 196 yards, and the Bucs moved up and down the field with ease. Granted, the Jaguars' top two corners were not playing (Jalen Ramsey and A.J. Bouye), but the rest of the starting defense was intact.\n\nOne reason to be concerned: It's really hard to find just one because, well, there were just so many. Let's focus on the defensive front, though, because that was supposed to be one of the defense's strengths. Defensive tackle Sheldon Day and end Dante Fowler had sacks in the first half, but for the most part Winston had plenty of time to throw, which is why he had only eight incompletions. The run defense struggling was a surprise, too, The Bucs' first-team offense averaged 5.0 yards per carry and Doug Martin had 30 yards on five carries. Nose tackle Abry Jones, DT Malik Jackson and DE Calais Campbell had trouble getting off blocks, and the Bucs' offensive line created some big holes at times.\n\nThat guy could start: Other than Henne, there weren't any reserves who made a push to crack the starting line. However, rookie receiver Dede Westbrook lit up the Bucs' reserves in the fourth quarter, catching six passes for 131 yards. He won't crack the starting lineup, but maybe he can be the team's No. 3 receiver with Marqise Lee out with an ankle injury.\n\nRookie watch: Cole has had a great camp and seems a lock to make the team as the fifth or sixth receiver, but his end zone drop certainly hurts. It wasn't a great throw -- slightly behind -- but he has caught pretty much everything in camp. He did have a 31-yard punt return to set up the offense at the Tampa Bay 23-yard line\n\nInjury report: RB T.J. Yeldon left the game in the first quarter after suffering a left-hamstring strain and did not return. He gained 2 yards on two carries before his injury. Hamstring injuries can linger for a while, so expect the Jaguars to shut him down for a while. That's significant because Leonard Fournette already is dealing with a sore foot and did not play against the Bucs. Other starters who missed the game: Ramsey, Bouye and CB Aaron Colvin (still on the physically unable to perform list).\n\nMore trouble for Myers: Kicker Jason Myers missed a 40-yard field goal attempt and a PAT on Thursday, and it wouldn't be a surprise if the team works out a couple kickers Friday or Saturday and signs one to compete with Myers next week. The third-year pro missed field goal tries of 50 and 53 yards against the Patriots in the preseason opener.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100,

Jaguars head coach Doug Marrone didn't mince words following the ugly contest and it was hard to blame him for his frustration.\n\nBelow are 10 immediate observations following the loss to the Buccaneers:\n\n1. The Jaguars quarterback situation is not ideal.\n\nJaguars presumed starting quarterback Blake Bortles has been unable to shake his struggles, despite offering some shining moments in practice. Bortles couldn't accomplish anything against a Buccaneers defense that he had played against during two joint practices earlier in the week.\n\nBortles had some really poor throws. He underthrew wide receiver Allen Robinson twice and was nearly picked off on a completion to him. Bortles has never been a consistent quarterback, relying more on brief streaks of brilliance when readily available. Those opportunities didn't come on Thursday.\n\nBackup quarterback Chad Henne was better in relief, but wasn't anything special. He completed 6-of-10 passes for 44 yards, which didn't dwarf Bortles' effort. He had two touchdown receptions dropped by Robinson and Keelan Cole on his first drive with the first team.\n\nEven with those drops in consideration, Henne didn't light the world on fire.\n\nThird-string quarterback Brandon Allen did his best with what he was given in the fourth quarter. He has clearly made a connection with rookie wide receiver Dede Westbrook. Allen completed 10-of-15 passes for 144 passing yards.\n\nMarrone is focused on Henne and Bortles, but he wouldn't rule out Allen when it comes to the impromptu starting quarterback competition.\n\nWith just two weeks left in the preseason, Marrone has a very hard decision to make. He needs to make it very soon.\n\n2. The running game without Leonard Fournette is not improved.\n\nChris Ivory and T.J. Yeldon struggled to run the football last season. They continued those woes against the Buccaneers.\n\nYeldon left the game after the first series with a hamstring strain after producing two yards on two carries. Yeldon has struggled to stay healthy throughout his brief career.\n\nIvory then gained four yards on seven carries. That's less one-yard per carry (read: awful). He also put up little effort on a blitz pickup that saw Adarius Glanton record a sack on Henne.\n\nFor two guys who are supposed to be considered \"starter level,\" it was not a strong showing.\n\nFournette is dealing with a foot injury and he can't recover soon enough.\n\n3. Westbrook has serious potential as a deep threat.\n\nFor all the negative that came out of the game, the fourth-round pick shined. It may have been against several players who will be working in Canada in a few weeks, but he absolutely flashed.\n\nWestbrook couldn't control who he played against. All he could do is put up an impressive 131 receiving yards on five catches in the fourth quarter.\n\nAll five of Westbrook's catches went for 20 yards.\n\n4. Marquez Williams catch for a touchdown catch was impressive.\n\nThe rookie fullback showed excellent hands as he snatched the ball from Allen and was able to get past the pylon while closely defended.\n\nWilliams' competition, Tommy Bohanon, has done little in practice and the preseason to fend off the rookie.\n\n5. It's time to bring in competition for kicker Jason Myers.\n\nThe third-year kicker missed his only two attempts against the Buccaneers. He missed a 40-yard field goal attempt wide left and then completely shanked an extra point attempt later on.\n\nHe also missed two field goal attempts of 50 or more yards against the New England Patriots last week.\n\nIt's time for the Jaguars to make some calls and Marrone's former kicker with the Buffalo Bills, Dan Carpenter, is available.\n\nDOWNLOAD THE FIRST COAST FOOTBALL APP FOR MORE JAGUARS COVERAGE\n\n6. This Jaguars staff is all about accountability.\n\nMarrone's press conference offered up honesty. The Jaguars head coach isn't going to settle at quarterback or anywhere else. It's a change of pace from the previous few years.\n\n7. Keelan Cole emerges as a potential punt returner.\n\nWith former draft pick Rashad Greene falling behind in the hunt for a depth spot, Cole stepped up in another area. Greene was considered the favorite to be the starting punt returner heading into camp, but Cole's emergence as a receiver may the Jaguars thinking differently.\n\nCole returned a punt for 31 yards on Thursday. That big gain will open some eyes on special teams, an area where Cole has already shown upside.\n\nWith Cole standing out on offense and special teams, he has become nearly impossible to let go at this point. There are still two weeks left, but Cole has seemingly earned his spot on the roster so far.\n\n8. The Jaguars really need to get their starting cornerbacks healthy.\n\nThe Jaguars' secondary allowed Winston to carve them up in the first half. Winston completed 21-of-29 passes for 196 passing yards. He led three scoring drives in five series.\n\nCornerbacks Brian Dixon and Tyler Patmon should be solid in depth roles, but going up against the likes of Desean Jackson and Mike Evans seems less than ideal.\n\nStarting cornerbacks A.J. Bouye (undisclosed), Jalen Ramsey (core) and Aaron Colvin (ankle) are all out with injuries. It remains to be seen when they will return.\n\n9. Sheldon Day continues to produce in the preseason.\n\nLast year's fourth-round pick is having a terrific preseason. Following a strong showing against the Patriots in Week 1, Day was the lone standout on defense in the first half.\n\nDay produced three tackles, two pressures and a sack on the night. He is in the running to be the first three-technique off the bench.\n\n10. There are still two more preseason games.\n\nBuckle up, folks, it may be a bumpy ride. The Jaguars host the Carolina Panthers next Thursday.\n\nFollow Mike Kaye on Twitter at @Mike_E_Kaye.\n\n\u00a9 2017 WTLV-TV\n\nWTLV\n\nHow does it work?

Bouye, safety Barry Church, and mammoth defensive tackle Calais Campbell. But the expected defensive improvement was nowhere to be found Thursday night as the Tampa Bay Buccaneers beat the Jacksonville Jaguars 12-8. The Bucs offensive starters dominated Jacksonville as they entered the half with a 12-0 lead, and outgained them in yardage 249-59. Jaguars head coach Doug Marrone was so frustrated he decided to play his offensive starters one more series into the third quarter, but the result was the same.\n\nBlake Bortles finished 8-13 for 65 yards, but his play was far worse as he continued to show regression from his 2015 year when he had 35 touchdowns. His throws were scattershot as he missed wide open receivers and continued to look hesitant. Meanwhile backup quarterback Chad Henne, who was already scheduled to play a couple of series with the starters, went 6-10 for 44 yards but also had two drops in the end zone as he played with far more control and authority than did Bortles. After the game Coach Marrone refused to commit to Blake Bortles as his regular season starter.\n\nFor the Buccaneers, Jameis Winston was 21-29 for 196 yards, all in the first half. His first three drives ended in scores, including a touchdown run by Doug Martin, who finished with five carries for 30 yards and a touchdown. Winston looked far more settled and in control in this game. The one exception occurred on third and goal as Winston threw the ball up for grabs and was intercepted by Church, but was overturned.\n\nMeanwhile, Tampa Bay's kicking woes continued as Nick Folk, the presumed winner of the kicking battle against recently released Roberto Aguayo, had his extra point attempt blocked and later missed a 47-yard field goal to finish 2-3 on field goal attempts. However, not to be outdone, the Jaguars kicker Jason Myers missed wide right on his only extra point attempt, leaving both teams with question marks in their kicking game.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100, "id": 49, "label": "dmoz/Games"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "wgt": 100, "id": 51, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "wgt": 100, "id": 52, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "wgt": 100, "id": 284, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/People/Lost_or_Missing", "wgt": 100, "id": 645, "label": "dmoz/Society/People/Lost or Missing"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Beauty_Pageants", "wgt": 100, "id": 646, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Beauty Pageants"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville"}, "type": "loc", "id": "181844"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tampa"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa,_Florida", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tampa"}, "type": "loc", "id": "182437"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302611", "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304511", "label": {"eng": "Lead"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304975", "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304976", "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305872", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "306949", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_(American_and_Canadian_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "309405", "label": {"eng": "Safety (American and Canadian football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "310129", "label": {"eng": "End zone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "311349", "label": {"eng": "Conversion (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(American_and_Canadian_football)#Defensive_tackle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "312085", "label": {"eng": "Defensive tackle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_lineup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "316239", "label": {"eng": "Starting lineup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "329510", "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thursday_Night_Football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "330672", "label": {"eng": "Thursday Night Football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake_Bortles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "342528", "label": {"eng": "Blake Bortles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jameis_Winston", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "342532", "label": {"eng": "Jameis Winston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Aguayo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "380387", "label": {"eng": "Roberto Aguayo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Henne", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "390554", "label": {"eng": "Chad Henne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calais_Campbell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "391963", "label": {"eng": "Calais Campbell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Marrone", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "472582", "label": {"eng": "Doug Marrone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Church", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "509035", "label": {"eng": "Barry Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Folk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "556096", "label": {"eng": "Nick Folk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1268994", "label": {"eng": "Field goal"}}]}

Both events are free and open to the public.\n\nIn addition to the Eagles and the coaching staff, Georgia Southern University President Jaimie L. Hebert, Ph.D., and Armstrong State University Interim President Jennifer L. Frum, Ph.D., will participate and will address the crowd following the practice as the 2017Georgia Southern football program is introduced to the Savannah community. Also on hand will be Georgia Southern's Southern Pride Marching Band and cheerleaders, along with the mascot \"GUS\" and live eagle mascot \"Freedom.\"\n\nGates will open at 5 p.m., with the team holding a pre-practice walk-through from 5:15-6 p.m. The actual practice begins at 6 p.m. and runs approximately 90 minutes.\n\nThe Meet the Eagles Fan Fest for Armstrong and Georgia Southern students and the Savannah community is 7:30-9 p.m. Activities for this free celebration include door prizes for fans, inflatables, face painting, an autograph session with the players and head football coach Tyson Summers, and much more.\n\nASU and Georgia Southern students with a valid student ID will receive a T-shirt and free pizza (while supplies last).\n\nFree parking is available at the Sports Center on the Armstrong campus. Refreshments from a food truck and concessions are available for purchase during the event.\n\nJACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- Jameis Winston continued his solid preseason, completing 21 of 29 passes for 196 yards and helping the Tampa Bay Buccaneers beat woeful Jacksonville 12-8 on Thursday night.\n\nWinston had two passes dropped, including what would have been a 43-yard touchdown strike to Mike Evans in the first quarter.\n\nThe Buccaneers (1-1) scored on their first three possessions, getting a short touchdown run from Doug Martin and two field goals from Nick Folk. Tampa Bay dominated Jacksonville in two quarters that featured mostly starters, outgaining the Jags 240-59 and looking like the much better team.\n\nFolk, who won the kicking job last week after the Bucs waived former second-round draft pick Roberto Aguayo, had an extra point blocked by Calais Campbell. He also missed a 47-yarder wide right in the fourth quarter.\n\nEvans finished with five catches for 57 yards, but missed a chance for a huge gain when he let Winston's perfectly thrown deep ball slip through his fingers. It was about the only thing that went right for the Jaguars (1-1).\n\nJacksonville's night went so awry that coach Doug Marrone now seemingly has open competitions at quarterback and place-kicker.\n\nBackup quarterback Chad Henne got some work with the first-team offense, fueling speculation that Blake Bortles has lost his grasp on the starting job.\n\nHenne entered late in the second quarter after Bortles played four series that ended in punts. Even though the move had been planned beforehand, it surely created the appearance that Marrone and football czar Tom Coughlin are wavering in their commitment to Bortles.\n\nMarrone and Coughlin have publicly supported Bortles all year, even picking up the fifth-year option in his rookie contract. But Marrone pulled the third overall pick in the 2014 NFL draft last week following two interceptions. Marrone said Bortles' \"arm looked tired.\" Bortles denied having any issues.\n\nBortles completed 8 of 13 passes for 65 yards against the Bucs. He doesn't have a touchdown or a turnover in two preseason games.\n\nHenne's first pass should have resulted in a touchdown, but Keelan Cole dropped it at the goal line. Henne finished 6-of-10 passing for 44 yards.\n\nJason Myers missed from 40 yards out, leaving him 1 for 4 on the season. He also missed an extra point in the fourth. The Jaguars don't have another kicker in camp, but that likely will change today.\n\nU.S. college teams in Barcelona during van attack, players OK\n\nMen's basketball teams from several U.S. universities, including Oregon State, Clemson and Arizona, were in Barcelona, Spain, when a van drove into pedestrians Thursday in a historic district popular with tourists, but school officials said the players and staff were safe.\n\nOregon State assistant coach Gregg Gottlieb posted to Facebook: \"We are all luckily ok. Our hotel/restaurant is located right on Las Ramblas. This tragedy happened right in front of us as our team just sat down for pregame meal. Thoughts and prayers for all those that are were hurt.\"\n\nSpanish police have confirmed they are investigating the bloodshed in the historic Las Ramblas district as a terror attack. The area is a popular summer tourist spot and several of the teams were staying in the area.\n\nCollege basketball teams are allowed to travel internationally during the summer once every four years. They are allowed to practice for 10 days and usually play a few exhibition games while abroad.\n\nThe trips offer teams a chance to get a jump-start on the season and also give the players a unique cultural experience.\n\nOregon State was staying in the same hotel as Clemson, which had been scheduled to play Thursday night against a Spanish All-Star team.\n\nClemson coach Brad Brownell confirmed in a text to The Associated Press that everyone was well.\n\n\"We are fine. Thankful to be safe and together,\" Brownell wrote.\n\nClemson officials said in a statement: \"We've been in contact with our men's basketball program currently in Barcelona and the entire travel party is safe and secure. Their exhibition game for tonight has been cancelled and the team will return to Clemson as previously scheduled tomorrow morning. Our thoughts are with the people of Barcelona.\"\n\nThe Beavers' game Thursday night was also canceled. It was supposed to be the first of a five-game tour.\n\nOregon State said it has not yet determined the remaining schedule for the team, which was supposed to be on the exhibition tour until Aug. 25.\n\nReplying to a Twitter inquiry from a Portland television about whether the team was OK, Oregon State head coach Wayne Tinkle responded: \"Yes we are, happened directly in front of our hotel while we were having a team meal in the restaurant, so senseless and sad! All accounted4.\"\n\nA spokesman for Arizona said the Wildcats have canceled their third and final exhibition of their tour and \"are currently working on travel plans to return home.\"\n\nTulane was also among the teams in Barcelona, staying at a hotel away from the deadly attack. The Grand Canyon University Antelopes were also playing there.\n\nTulane athletic director Troy Dannen confirmed via social media that the Green Wave players and staff were safe. The team planned to return as scheduled to the United States on Saturday.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports", "wgt": 100, "id": 14, "label": "dmoz/Sports"}, {"uri":

He stuck to mostly short and intermediate throws, finding some success with passes to wide receiver Allen Robinson, who caught five receptions for 40 receiving yards.\n\nHowever, Bortles was unable to lead the Jaguars downfield for any points in four series. The Jaguars earned just three first downs with Bortles and one was due to a pass interference on Buccaneers cornerback Vernon Hargreaves.\n\nBortles was eventually replaced by backup Chad Henne, who completed 6-of-10 passes for 44 passing yards. Two of Henne's incompletions were drops in the end zone by wide receivers Keelan Cole and Robinson on the quarterback's first drive with the starting group.\n\nThe Jaguars' first team offense received little help from its defense. The unit allowed a touchdown and two field goals in the first half. Defensive end Calais Campbell blocked an extra point attempt by Buccaneers kicker Nick Folk, who later made two field goals to extend Tampa Bay's lead to 12-0 in the first half.\n\nKicker Jason Myers didn't fare as well as Folk, as he missed a 40-yard field goal attempt wide left. Myers also missed an extra point following the Jaguars' only touchdown. Folk also missed a second-half field goal of his own.\n\nSecond-year defensive tackle Sheldon Day was the lone Jaguars standout of the first half. He produced a sack, two pressures and a run stop for no gain in the first two quarters against the Buccaneers.\n\nTampa Bay was led by quarterback Jameis Winston, who completed 21-of-29 passes for 196 passing yards. Winston and the Buccaneers' starters played the entire first half.\n\nRunning back Doug Martin produced 30 rushing yards and a touchdown on five carries. Martin's three-yard rushing score came on the Buccaneers' opening possession.\n\nThe Buccaneers defense produced two sacks on the night.\n\nJaguars second-year quarterback Brandon Allen was able to lead a fourth-quarter scoring drive. He completed a four-yard pass to rookie fullback Marquez Williams for a touchdown on his first series.\n\nAllen completed 10-of-15 passes for 144 passing yards and a touchdown on the night. His top target was rookie wide receiver Dede Westbrook, who produced six receptions for 131 receiving yards.\n\nDOWNLOAD THE FIRST COAST FOOTBALL APP FOR MORE JAGUARS COVERAGE\n\nPLAYER OF THE GAME\n\nWhile his work came mostly in the fourth quarter, Westbrook produced six receptions for 131 receiving yards against the Buccaneers.\n\nSTAT OF THE GAME\n\nThe Jaguars produced just 57 rushing yards against the Buccaneers' defense, despite the game being a low-scoring affair.\n\nPLAY OF THE GAME\n\nDuring Jacksonville's first defensive series of the second half, Buccaneers backup quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick tossed a ball downfield that was intercepted by Jaguars safety Jarrod Wilson on his own one-yard line.\n\nINJURY UPDATES\n\nThe Jaguars were without cornerbacks Jalen Ramsey (core), Aaron Colvin (ankle), Tracy Howard and A.J. Bouye, running back Leonard Fournette (foot), wide receiver Marqise Lee (ankle), offensive guard Earl Watford, tight end Mychal Rivera and defensive tackle Michael Bennett due to injury.\n\nRunning back T.J. Yeldon suffered a left hamstring strain during the team's first offensive series. Cornerback Charles Gaines was evaluated for a concussion during the fourth quarter. Gaines was cleared of a concussion but suffered a right eye injury.\n\nFollow Mike Kaye on Twitter at @Mike_E_Kaye.\n\n\u00a9 2017 WTLV-TV\n\nWTLV\n\nHow does it work?

Blake Bortles and Tyrod Taylor were not very good. Josh Woodrum was great.\n\nThe first-year quarterback from Liberty followed a 4-for-4 performance in his first preseason game with the Ravens by going 8 for 10 for 110 yards and two rushing touchdowns in Baltimore's 31-7 win over the Dolphins.\n\nWoodrum is the all-time passing leader at Liberty and the Ravens sent shockwaves through the league when they opted to sign the 6-3 quarterback instead of Colin Kaepernick.\n\nWhile the Ravens wait for the return of injured starter Joe Flacco, Woodrum has outplayed Ryan Mallett, who was 13 of 22 for 113 yards with a touchdown and two interceptions Thursday.\n\nThe Dolphins scored just one touchdown in the loss to the Ravens -- that touchdown coming on an 11-yard Senorise Perry run -- but Cutler looked comfortable in Adam Gase's offense. The Dolphins head coach was Cutler's offensive coordinator in 2015 while both were with the Bears.\n\nIn just 10 days, Cutler appeared to develop good timing with DeVante Parker but both of Cutler's drives stalled because of penalties as he went 3 of 6 for 24 yards.\n\nWhile the Ravens rolled in Miami, up I-95 along Florida's Atlantic Coast, Bortles struggled against the Buccaneers.\n\nBortles was just 4 of 31 last season on passes of 25 yards or more. His worst throw of the night in Thursday's game was a badly underthrown ball to a wide-open Allen Robinson. Bortles, the No. 3 overall pick in the 2014 NFL Draft, finished 8 of 13 for 65 yards and he may have paved the way for 10-year veteran Chad Henne to win the starting job in Jacksonville.\n\nHenne went 6 of 10 for 44 yards and was the victim of two end-zone drops in the 12-8 loss. After Bortles was 3 of 5 for only 16 yards in last week's 31-24 win over the Patriots and Henne went 5 of 6 for 139 yards and a touchdown. New Jaguars coach Doug Marrone said following the game the quarterback job is \"up for grabs\" and it's easy to see why Marrone could be leaning toward the 32-year-old Henne.\n\nAs Bortles struggled, so did Taylor. The Bills quarterback had his first pass against the Eagles deflected at the line of scrimmage and intercepted by linebacker Mychal Kendricks. That set up an Eagles field goal and Taylor finished just 8 of 18 for 53 yards and two interceptions in Buffalo's 20-16 loss.\n\nInjury roundup\n\nBills receiver Rod Streater injured his left foot after making a 12-yard catch early in the fourth quarter of Buffalo's loss to the Eagles. Streater made a leaping 28-yard catch late in the third and been one of the early preseason stars. The entire Bills team surrounded Streater as he was carted off the field.\n\nImpact rookies\n\nEagles running back Corey Clement scored the first touchdown of Thursday's game against the Bills. The former Wisconsin running back, who went undrafted in April, had eight carries for 34 yards and caught two passes for another 6 yards against the Bills.\n\nBuccaneers tight end O.J. Howard didn't play long, but had two catches for 28 yards in Tampa Bay's win over the Jaguars.\n\nBucs linebacker Kendell Beckwith, a third-round pick from LSU, had four tackles, including two for a loss, as his excellent preseason continues.\n\nThe Jaguars might have something in undrafted rookie receiver Keelan Cole, who had an electrifying 31-yard punt return against the Bucs. Cole was an All-American at Division II Kentucky Wesleyan, where he started his career as a walk-on.\n\nJaguars receiver Dede Westbrook caught six passes for an eye-popping 131 yards. The Biletnikoff winner from Oklahoma slipped to the fourth round because of off-field issues, but looks like he could be a draft steal.\n\nHighlights\n\nThe Bills traded cornerback Ronald Darby to the Eagles last week. Darby got some revenge Thursday, picking off Bills quarterback Tyrod Taylor on a pass intended for Anquan Boldin.\n\nGet traded, get an interception.\n\nWe see you, @realronalddarby! #BUFvsPHI pic.twitter.com/HOUEd1TORj\n\n-- NFL (@NFL) August 17, 2017\n\nYou don't get much more wide open in the end zone than Ravens tight end Larry Donnell was in the second quarter of Baltimore's win over the Dolphins.\n\nTouchdown, Larry Donnell!

What stood out most of all was the terrible quarterback play. It's was bad, so bad that you can be forgiven for not talking about a performance from Jay Cutler that did not feature any glaring screw ups.\n\nBlake Bortles, Jaguars: He was 8-of-13, thanks to some easy completions on dump offs. It was only by sheer luck that he didn't get intercepted, and he under threw an unmolested Allen Robinson more than once.\n\nIt was so bad for Bortles that head coach Doug Marrone opened up a quarterback competition between Bortles and Chad Henne. Chad f**king Henne. It's pretty clear that the Jags need to explore other options for their starting quarterback.\n\nTyrod Taylor, Bills: Coach Sean McDermott didn't quite take away Taylor's starting job, but he clearly wasn't pleased with his quarterback's 8-for-18, two interception performance. The fact that it was even a question is bad news for the Bills.\n\nRyan Mallett, Ravens: He was awful too, and he's Baltimore's starter while Joe Flacco is dealing with a back injury that was supposed to be healed up a long time ago. Mallett missed targets and ended his night with a pair of interceptions. John Harbaugh offered some qualified praise after the game: \"I think he's doing OK given the circumstances.\"\n\nJamies Winston, Buccaneers: He had a good night, giving fans a taste of just what this offense is capable of after a pair of scoring drives to open the game. But he also had a very Jamies-like moment with this throw.\n\nJay Cutler, Dolphins: Zero f**ks were asked, and none were given. Cutler did everything he needed to do in his preseason debut, which was mostly just prove that he wasn't overly rusty after being kinda retired. He finished 3-for-6 with 24 yards. The most encouraging sign for the Dolphins and fantasy footballers was that four of his six throws were targeted to DeVante Parker, or as Cutler dubbed him \"a faster Alshon [Jeffery].\"\n\nCarson Wentz, Eagles: Even Wentz had a rough night on Thursday. He was off the mark with this throws on Philly's first two drives, before settling into things on the third one. That one looked promising, until LeGarrette Blount fumbled to end the effort.

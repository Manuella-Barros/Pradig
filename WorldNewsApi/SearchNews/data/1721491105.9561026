During cross-examination Monday, Olienick\u2019s lawyer, Marilyn Burns, asked the third officer if she was bothered by undercover work. \u201cAt what line does the lying end? Is there ever a point where you\u2019re uncomfortable?\u201d Burns asked. \u201cYou work to complete an objective and we have specific rules that we follow,\u201d the officer replied. The defence has noted that the undercover officers did not make audio recordings to substantiate their recollections of what was said with the accused. The trial judge addressed that with the jury. Justice Dave Labrenz said officers can\u2019t secretly record those conversations without prior approval from a judge. \u201cIn this case, the undercover police officers and the police did not have the judicial authorization,\u201d Labrenz said. The officer also testified that the mood of the protest was upbeat. \u201cEverybody was in a good mood. You were happy to be there. You had a sense of patriotism,\u201d she said. \u201cThey had the Canada flag up.\u201d This report by The Canadian Press was first published June 17, 2024.", "summary": "'A lot of people had been coming up and shaking their hands and talking to them and thanking them for coming.

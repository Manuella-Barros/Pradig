Defence Minister Richard Marles emphasized the improved interoperability with U.S. defence forces. The initiative will also leverage AI for enhanced data analysis, and create 2,000 local jobs.\n\nAustralia will move its top secret intelligence data to the cloud under a A$2 billion deal with Amazon Web Services that Defence Minister Richard Marles said would boost defence force interoperability with the United States. The Director General of the Australian Signals Directorate, Rachel Noble, said the national security agency would also increase its use of artificial intelligence (AI) to analyse data under the shift, which would see top secret data centres built in Australia.\n\n\"Artificial intelligence is an important game changer for all of us in the intelligence community, and we are working to embrace the use of it in an ethical, well governed and well understood manner, where we understand very carefully when we bring AI tools into our environment how are they being used, what are they doing to the data and do we understand how carefully they need to be governed?\" Noble said in Canberra on Thursday. The move to cloud services run by Amazon Web Services , using distributed, purpose-built facilities, would give greater resilience to data used to support the defence force, Marles said at a press conference.\n\n\"If one server goes down you are still able to operate,\" he said. \"This is what will ensure we have a common computing operating environment with the United States defence forces in the future.\" Marles said in an ABC TV interview that increasingly warfare is being conducted at \"top secret level\" and such data was vital for its F-35A joint strike fighter aircraft.\n\n\"Every sensor that picks up information, that might feed it to a fifth-generation platform like a joint strike fighter, which it then uses to target or to defend itself against a threat, or defend another asset like a ship against a threat, all of that data ... is at a top secret level,\" he said.

The contract means Australia will have greater ability to share intelligence and military information and use artificial intelligence for data analysis.\n\nAustralia is a member of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance, which also comprises the US, UK, New Zealand and Canada.\n\nDefence minister Richard Marles said the deal would increase \"interoperability\" with the US and \"ensure we have a far more resilient, capable, lethal, modern and potent defence force in the future\".\n\nRachel Noble, director-general of the Australian Signals Directive, said the use of cloud-based AI would strengthen the country's intelligence work across 10 different government agencies. \"It's a game-changer in terms of how we understand the data we are holding,\" she said of the use of AI to collect, interpret and triage data of importance to national security.\n\nMike Bareja, deputy director of the ASPI think-tank's cyber, technology and security unit, said the AWS contract would play to the strategic imperative of allies in the Indo-Pacific, including Five Eyes and the smaller Aukus group, to create a platform for data sharing that goes beyond the secure sharing of classified documents.\n\nHe argued that future autonomous weapons systems, for example, would require data sharing and a unified cloud. \"Intelligence and military operations are now data operations,\" Bareja said, adding that the cloud platform and AI would enable faster decision-making by government agencies and build a stronger platform for Pillar II, the part of the Aukus pact that promotes sharing of advanced technology.\n\nAWS has fashioned a strong position in \"top secret\" cloud contracts around the world since it won a $600mn contract with US intelligence services in 2013. That deal was later expanded to include other companies including Microsoft and IBM.\n\nThe UK government followed suit in 2021 when its top three intelligence agencies signed a cloud contract with AWS, worth up to \u00a31bn at the time, to bring AI and data sharing to the heart of their operations.\n\nThe three dedicated data centres will be funded by Australia's existing pledge to boost defence spending substantially to prepare to \"resist coercion\" in the Indo-Pacific as geopolitical tension with China has grown.\n\nIt has overhauled its defence strategy and committed to a significant upgrade to its naval fleet, including the delivery of nuclear-powered submarines to the country for the first time under the Aukus agreement.\n\nThe announcement of the AWS contract coincided with an incident at the Australian parliament in which a group of protesters scaled the building's roof and unveiled banners that included the inverted red triangle symbol criticising the government's position on the war in Gaza.\n\nBareja said the protest highlighted the challenge that intelligence services faced in developing high-tech strategic capabilities but also in dealing with more basic security threats from individuals. \"It's a dichotomy that is defining the security debate,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"},

{"id": 231241514, "title": "\u2018We\u2019re in Uncharted Territory\u2019: Inside the Rise of Women\u2019s Basketball", "text": "I t\u2019s Tuesday night on the Las Vegas Strip. Crowds have been flowing into the Michelob Ultra Arena for the past two hours, a sea of red and silver and black. The merch line snakes around the entire front of the arena, folded onto itself like a theme-park queue. People nervously ask which Las Vegas Aces jerseys are still left \u2014 do you still have Wilson? Gray? Young? Inside, just before seven, nearly every seat is filled when the lights turn low. Signs wave, the stands vibrate with cheers and stomps, strobe lights flash. Tom Brady, part owner of the Aces, walks in. But every eye is on A\u2019ja Wilson when she runs out onto the court. The crowd erupts into a chant. \u201cMVP! MVP! MVP! MVP!\u201d Wilson starts to speak, but the audience isn\u2019t done. \u201cMVP! MVP! MVP!\u201d A ring as big as a ping-pong ball shines on Wilson\u2019s pinkie finger, the diamonds sparkling in the spotlight set on her. It\u2019s the WNBA\u2019s opening night. In half an hour, Wilson will lead her team, the Las Vegas Aces, against the Phoenix Mercury. She\u2019ll score 17 points in the first quarter and make it look easy, like she\u2019s just warming up. But before all of that, they\u2019ve got to celebrate last year \u2014 the Aces are getting their rings for their second championship in a row. And the room is electric. \u201cWe got a game to play, hold up, hold up!\u201d Wilson says into the microphone, smiling. \u201cI just want to say thank you all, each and every last person in this building. You helped us win a championship. We just want to say thank you and once again,\u201d she says, here pausing for dramatic effect, \u201cwe blingin\u2019.\u201d The ring ceremony is over, and the team comes out onto the court as flames shoot out from the hoops at each end. Drake\u2019s \u201cEnergy\u201d booms through the speakers. People come to Vegas for a show, and they\u2019re about to get one. This arena has hosted Katy Perry, the Latin Grammys, UFC fights. And on this Tuesday night in May, for the season opener of the WNBA, for Wilson and the reigning champions, a new record is set: the largest Aces audience the venue has ever seen \u2014 10,419 people to be exact. For the past couple of years, the WNBA has shattered nearly every record it comes up against. Ticket sales have exploded for this season \u2014 up 93 percent from last year, according to StubHub. A record 2.45 million viewers tuned in to the WNBA draft this spring on ESPN, nearly five times the previous record in 2004 and up 307 percent from 2023. Before the season tipoff, the Aces, Atlanta Dream, and Dallas Wings all announced season-ticket sellouts. The stars of the game are becoming household names, the faces of campaigns for Skims, along with Nike, Adidas, and Puma. Jerseys are selling faster than they can make them. A handful of players have their own shoes \u2014 Wilson\u2019s highly anticipated A\u2019One Nike was announced in May and will be out next year. But this moment has been a long time coming. \u201cIf you would\u2019ve told me we would eventually have sold out arenas,\u201d Wilson, who is in her sixth season, tells me the day after the game, which the Aces won 89-80, \u201cI would\u2019ve probably laughed.\u201d \u201cCompanies [are] actually putting dollars towards women\u2019s sports and not just saying \u2018We support, we support.\u2019\u2009\u201d THE W, as fans call the league, is just 27 years old \u2014 a baby in sports-league terms. The NBA has been around for 78 years, the NFL for 104. But it\u2019s by far the longest running women\u2019s professional league in the U.S. It started out with a lot of promise \u2014 more than 14,000 people showed up for the inaugural game in Inglewood, California, in 1997. But if you look back at those early years, it\u2019s still hard to imagine it turning into what it is today. After a few years, some of the early teams ended up folding, and the coverage was rough. \u201cLet\u2019s end the ongoing charade that this is a mainstream sport.\u2026 The mere concept of the WNBA is inherently flawed, like someone opening an inferior pizza place right next to the best pizza place in town, then using female chefs as a marketing hook. Who cares? It\u2019s still subpar pizza, right?\u201d wrote Bill Simmons for his ESPN \u201cSports Guy\u201d column in 2005. \u201cThe vast majority of WNBA players lack crossover sex appeal. That\u2019s just the way it is. Some are uncomfortably tall and gawky, while others lack the requisite, um, softer qualities to captivate males between 18 and 35.\u201d And it wasn\u2019t just undermining and sexist media coverage they were up against. \u201cWhen I think back to when I first started the W, we had roommates,\u201d says New York Liberty powerhouse forward Breanna Stewart. At age 29, the six-foot-four-inch Stewart is a four-time WNBA all-star. \u201cThere were the lifelong WNBA fans,\u201d she says. \u201cBut now, this growth of having [the Liberty\u2019s Brooklyn home court] Barclays being sold out almost every single game, to the viewership, the ratings, we\u2019re really going into uncharted territory. But I can\u2019t help but feel like, as a player, we\u2019ve been trying to preach this for a long, long time that we had something special here, and now people are finally catching on.\u201d When I talk to Stewart, she\u2019s just arriving in Indianapolis to face off against the Indiana Fever. The Caitlin Clark effect can\u2019t be underestimated \u2014 the brand-new Fever guard graduated from the University of Iowa this year after leading her team to the NCAA championship game. Clark\u2019s jaw-droppingly consistent long-range three-pointers were exhilarating to watch as she set the record as the NCAA\u2019s Division I all-time leading scorer \u2014 across men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball. Nearly 19 million people tuned in to follow the Hawkeyes in the final. Clark and college stars like LSU\u2019s Angel Reese and University of South Carolina\u2019s Kamilla Cardoso are entering their rookie season in the W and bringing new fans along with them. The Washington Mystics had to move arenas for their game against Reese\u2019s Chicago Sky to accommodate increased demand, and Clark\u2019s Fever jersey was briefly the top-selling jersey ever for a draft pick in any sport (plus that reported $28 million Nike deal). We\u2019ve been here before, though. There\u2019s long been enthusiasm for college stars. Six years ago, Wilson was the first draft pick after leading South Carolina to a championship \u2014 there\u2019s now a bronze statue of her on the Columbia, South Carolina, campus. Five years before that, there was the excitement around Baylor\u2019s Brittney Griner and her incredible dunks. Back in 2002, UConn point guard Sue Bird captured imaginations. This latest crop of post-grad superstars, though, is entering a growing pro league finding its way onto more TVs and into bigger arenas. Right now, there are 12 teams \u2014 144 players total. Next year, the Golden State Valkyries will be added, and the year after that, they\u2019ll bring on Toronto, the first non-American team in the league. \u201cI can\u2019t help but feel like, as a player, we\u2019ve been trying to preach this for a long, long time that we had something special here, and now people are finally catching on.\u201d A COUPLE OF DAYS after facing off against the Aces, the Mercury are back home and crowding around a TV screen playing clips from the game. Pause, rewind, pause, rewind. Griner missed the game with a broken toe \u2014 she jammed it at her team\u2019s media day, of all things. And at practice, she wheels out in a big boot propped on a leg scooter. Still, after watching tape, she hobbles on her good foot and practices free throws, hitting shot after shot; her frustration at not being able to play with the rest of the team is palpable. Last season was Griner\u2019s first one back following her 10-month detainment in Russia after being arrested when her prescription cannabis oil was found in her luggage. Her book, Coming Home, which details the harrowing experience, came out just before this practice and is already a bestseller. She writes about the brutal conditions she faced in the Russian prison and the toll it took on her body. Her six-foot-nine-inch frame being crammed into a cramped cell, the lack of adequate nutrition, the smoking habit she picked up there, which did a number on her lungs. She played last season, getting back to her old self. But she was ready to start fresh this year with a new season and an Olympics this summer. She beams talking about her son with wife Cherelle due in July, too. \u201cI\u2019m super excited about that,\u201d Griner tells me as we sit on the sidelines after practice. \u201cOh, yeah, I\u2019m going by pops. I really hope he says pop because that\u2019s what I call my dad: Pops.\u201d She looks out at the court. \u201cI was feeling great about the season. I felt like this was the year, and it still is going to be my year, but I am just going to be a little bit behind joining.\u201d Griner\u2019s experience in Russia drew attention to the reason she was there in the first place. The year she was detained, Griner earned about $220,000 playing in the WNBA. WNBA players have a hard cap on their salaries and often make hundreds times less than their NBA counterparts. (Steph Curry, for example, makes close to $50 million a year.) Playing in Russia, Griner pulled in more than a million dollars a season. Many WNBA players play internationally to make up that pay difference \u2014 which also means they\u2019re playing nearly year-round, putting additional pressure on their bodies, and using off time when they might otherwise be with their families, or training, or simply going on vacation. The players are quick to point out the benefits beyond the money, too \u2014 it\u2019s a way to up your game and see the world. If there were a longer, more lucrative season here, though, it would give players more of a choice in the matter. Griner and I talk about how the league has changed over the past decade \u2014 this is her 11th season. \u201cI love the hype,\u201d she says nodding. \u201cI love everything. I love the fact that we have all these new fans. I think the momentum is definitely growing.\u201d She adds, \u201cThe game is evolving, the game\u2019s changing, and you see it in the style of the play. The pace is getting faster. You see a shift in the players, too.\u2026 You see more of the rookies coming in and actually making an impact.\u201d Players these days are incredibly versatile \u2014 as strong defensively as they are offensively \u2014 with more long-range threes and the flash of ball handling leading to dazzling moments on the court. \u201cThe game is evolving, the game is changing, and you see it in the style of play. The pace is getting faster. You see more rookies coming in and actually making an impact.\u201d After practice, I catch up with Griner\u2019s teammate Diana Taurasi, who, in her 20th \u2014 yes, 20th \u2014 season in the league has a skeptical, been-there-done-that take on all the recent hype. The changes she wants to talk about are more granular \u2014 like how when she started, there was a single trainer for the team, one person in charge of travel, in charge of passing out gear when they got to whatever city, and in charge of food. Today, the court has as many trainers and coaches as players. We\u2019re in the Verizon 5G Performance Center, which the Mercury share with the NBA\u2019s Phoenix Suns. It\u2019s a pristine and impressive facility, just four years old. But they\u2019ve already outgrown it \u2014 a brand-new practice facility is being built up the road, which will be just the Mercury\u2019s. And this season, it was announced all W players will start to travel on chartered planes \u2014 they\u2019d been flying commercial and traveling by bus all this time. \u201cWhen people say the league\u2019s changed in all these ways, to me the biggest change has been internally, where owners are actually putting money into the infrastructure of sustaining a business, a team, an athlete. I think to me, that\u2019s been the biggest change,\u201d Taurasi says. \u201cAll the outside noise is nice for everyone else.\u201d We get to talking about Taurasi\u2019s childhood and how soccer was her first love. Basketball came later, playing with friends. But that was the Nineties, when Team USA women\u2019s soccer was dominant. \u201cMia Hamm was a superstar. That whole team kind of took women\u2019s sports into a \u2026 Oh, that was another \u2018moment,\u2019 right?\u201d she says with a satisfied I-told-you-so smile and a write-that-down head nod toward my notebook. \u201cNothing\u2019s new under the sun. We\u2019ve seen all this. The whole point is for it to continue. That has always been our biggest thing \u2014 how do we make sure we bottle this up and it stays?\u201d Well, how do you? \u201cI don\u2019t know. That\u2019s not my job. My job is to be the best basketball player I can be and show up every single year better physically, mentally, skillwise.\u2026 I\u2019m not a marketing major. I don\u2019t fucking know how all this shit works. I\u2019m here to ball out and try to kill whoever\u2019s in front of me. You know what I mean?\u201d THE THING ABOUT HAMM and that \u201996 Olympic game is that it never aired in full in the U.S. \u2014 just 20 minutes of the historic final against China was shown on NBC. When it comes to sports, visibility is everything \u2014 capturing that casual fan flipping channels, the ones watching at sports bars, the fans who want to follow every game. That\u2019s been a challenge for the WNBA. This year more than ever, though, you\u2019ll be able to turn on a TV and catch a game. Take the Liberty: This season, 31 of the team\u2019s games will be available to watch nationally, while 24 will be on Fox 5 and MY9, reaching 7.5 million households in the tristate area. \u201cI feel like the growth has been gradual, but I think recently you\u2019ve seen a big jump visibility-wise in viewership. And so maybe that feels like, \u2018OK, now it\u2019s all the way here,\u2019\u2009\u201d says the Aces\u2019 Chelsea Gray, better known as the Point Gawd. We\u2019re talking the day after the Aces-Mercury game, which Gray, who is nursing a foot injury, missed. But, she was there with her infant son on the court for the ring ceremony. \u201cIt\u2019s also these companies actually putting dollars towards women\u2019s sports and not just saying, \u2018We support, we support,\u2019 but actually putting their money behind it.\u201d \u201cMy job is to be the best basketball player I can be and show up every single year better. I\u2019m here to ball out and try to kill whoever\u2019s in front of me.\u201d And the Olympics this year is ensuring men and womens sports are scheduled fairly for better visibility. Griner, Taurasi, Stewart, Wilson, and Gray are all gold medalists and were all invited to the Olympic team training camp for the summer games in Paris. It\u2019ll be a year of transition for the team, without Sue Bird and Sylvia Fowles, but with some new players in the mix. \u201cThe Olympics has its own kind of haze and glory around it. They don\u2019t look at us as WNBA players anymore; it\u2019s more so like the three letters across your chest,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cI hope that after the Olympics it carries over and then we form that momentum even more.\u201d The momentum comes right as the players head into a new contract negotiation in the next couple of years, as well as a new media-rights deal in 2025 \u2014 meaning how much TV networks pay the league to air their games. And a new contract is a chance to negotiate for higher revenue sharing \u2014 while NBA players get a 50 percent share of the money brought in by the league, WNBA players get about 10 percent. \u201cWe are on the upward scale,\u201d says Wilson the day after the Aces\u2019 big win. \u201cI\u2019m very hard on myself and on the league, and we still have a long way to go.\u201d BEFORE THE ACES-MERCURY season opener, a restaurant just outside of the Vegas arena has the Indiana Fever versus Connecticut Sun game on one of the TVs at the end of the bar. A man sits quietly watching. \u201cWNBA! Fuck yeah!\u201d a woman wearing an Iowa shirt shouts as she walks in and pulls out a barstool. She says to the bartender, \u201cI just want to say thank you for having this on.\u201d The man sitting at the bar tells the two women he\u2019s a second-year season-ticket holder for the Aces. They tell him they\u2019re nurses and that they flew in from Phoenix just for the game. \u201cBack in the day, the Houston Comets were a big thing, and I was a huge fan when the league started in \u201996, and I idolized Cynthia Cooper,\u201d Mandy Crino, one of the nurses, tells me when I ask about her history with the W. \u201cI was always a fan, but it was never televised; you had no access to the games. So, I can say I\u2019m a fan, but I didn\u2019t watch it because the closest was going to Chicago, two and a half hours away. But we moved to Phoenix two and a half years ago and went to our first game. We have been season-ticket holders for two years now.\u201d I ask the three of them if they feel like there\u2019s a lot of excitement around the game now. \u201cWhoo, girl, are you kidding me?\u201d Steven Dickerson, the Aces season-ticket holder, says. \u201cIt\u2019s the only game in town.\u2026 The men\u2019s team is all commercial. It\u2019s all about money. They\u2019re guaranteed their money. You come and see these ladies play, man, it\u2019s like there\u2019s no tomorrow. It\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d Then the commercial is over, and everyone turns back to the screen in the corner. The other TVs have other sports \u2014 a post-game recap and hockey \u2014 but tonight, the W game is the only one anyone here is paying any attention to.", "summary": "Five WNBA superstars talk about sell-out crowds, the evolution of the game, and the road to the Olympics", "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-sports/wnba-womens-basketball-olympics-1235030924/", "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/R1389_FEA_WNBA-RSWNBA-LV6274_FINAL.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 13:00:00", "author": "Kate Storey,Steven Pearl", "authors": ["Kate Storey", "Steven Pearl"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.31}

About 31 others and some 18 vehicles were still unaccounted for.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping has ordered all-out rescue efforts, state news agency Xinhua reported.\n\n\u201cThe top priority is to fully engage in emergency rescue efforts, make every possible effort to search for the missing persons, minimise casualties to the greatest extent possible, and properly manage the aftermath, including comforting the families of those affected,\u201d Xi was quoted as saying.\n\nHe also urged emergency workers to \u201cmeticulously inspect surrounding safety hazards, and rigorously prevent secondary disasters\u201d.\n\nEmphasising that China had entered its critical flood season of late July to early August, Xi called on all relevant departments to fulfil their responsibilities in disaster monitoring and prevention.\n\nAccording to Xinhua, the finance and emergency management ministries have \u201curgently\u201d allocated 260 million yuan (US$35.8 million) to support emergency rescue and disaster relief efforts for regions including Shaanxi and neighbouring Sichuan province.\n\nThe collapsed bridge lies in Shaanxi\u2019s Shangluo city, on the southern slopes of the Qinling mountains.\n\nThe Shangluo weather office has forecast widespread thunderstorms over the next 24 hours, with heavy showers of up to 30mm (about 1.2 inches) per hour in some areas including Zhashui county, where the incident happened.\n\nLocal residents said the Jinqian River below the bridge had begun to rise on Friday afternoon. After the bridge collapsed, a man seen shouting for help was pulled up by residents with the help of a rope, state-backed website China News reported.\n\nAn eye witness told Hongxing News, a digital arm of the Chengdu Economic Daily, that he had seen a small car floating in the river. His own vehicle was stopped by locals waving flashlights, asking him to turn around as the bridge ahead had collapsed and several cars fallen into the swollen river.\n\nSeven vehicles had been recovered as of Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe incident comes as wide swathes of northern and southwestern China grapple with torrential rain and flooding, in a continued onslaught of extreme weather nationwide.\n\nAs of 2am on Saturday, more than 30 people had been reported missing and more than 40 houses damaged due to flash floods caused by heavy rains in Hanyuan county, in mountainous southwestern Sichuan, another CCTV report said.\n\nThe Shaanxi incident is China\u2019s second deadly infrastructure collapse caused by rainfall and flooding in recent months.\n\nIn early May, nearly 50 people died after a section of a mountainside highway collapsed in southern Guangdong province following days of heavy rain.", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South

China's national fire and rescue authority said it had dispatched a team involving over 850 officials as well as 90 vehicles, 20 boats and 41 drones to join the search.\n\nThe highway bridge in Shangluo, a city in the northwestern Shaanxi province, collapse at around 8.40pm local time on Friday evening, sending an estimated 25 vehicles plunging into the swollen river below.\n\nAuthorities said 11 bodies had been recovered from five of those vehicles as of Saturday morning, but as the day wore on Xinhua news agency reported that there had been no more cars recovered, and an estimated 30 people are still missing, feared dead.\n\nPictures released by state media showed a section of the bridge snapped and folded down at an almost 90-degree angle into the rushing brown water below.\n\nAccording to AFP, one witness told state media he had approached the bridge but other drivers started \"yelling at me to brake and stop the car\".\n\n\"A truck in front of me didn't stop and fell into the water,\" he said.\n\nMr Xi urged local authorities to take responsibility during a critical period for flood control in the region, ordering them to enhance monitoring and early warning systems.\n\nExtreme rains have brought flooding to large swathes of western and southwestern China in recent days, an area that is particularly prone to landslides due to its mountainous landscapes and the powerful rivers that run through the region.\n\nHubei city's Three Gorges Dam, China's largest, was put on high alert last week after dozens of rivers breached their banks and flooded townships.\n\nAt least six people have been reported dead in nearby Chongqing after flooding in a dozen districts and counties since Thursday, raising the water levels in 29 rivers.\n\nIn Sichuan province, to the south-west, another 30 people were missing and around 40 houses destroyed in flooding and storms on Saturday, Xinhua reported.\n\nSichuan's hardest-hit Hanyuan county has seen both roads and communications infrastructure damaged or destroyed, complicating rescue efforts, and teams had been working since dawn to restore connectivity and clear debris from highways.\n\nFrom record-breaking heatwaves to unprecedented rainfall, China has been facing increasing numbers of extreme weather events in recent years, testing the country's ability to cope with the impact of the climate crisis.\n\nAlmost a year's worth of rain pounded a small town in Henan earlier this week on Tuesday. It recorded 606.7mm (24 inches) of rainfall in Dafengying over a 24 hour-period, the most anywhere in China, according to national weather forecasters. That compares with the average annual rainfall of 800mm in the area.\n\nChanging rainfall patterns coincide with a dramatic decline in the country's economic expansion, which in past decades has China build a huge network of motorways, high-speed railways and airports across even the country's most remote districts.\n\nThe economic slowdown means officials and industries are cutting corners to try and continue expanding this network, leading to a proliferation of poor-quality infrastructure and poor safety supervision.", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"},

It was the second deadly episode in the country in less than three months involving the failure of a stretch of highway.\n\nState media reported early Saturday afternoon that 12 bodies and seven vehicles had been found, and that one person had been rescued. Eighteen vehicles and 31 people were still missing.\n\nA photograph released by the official Xinhua news agency on Saturday showed how a bridge in one direction of the highway had snapped. A section of it was folded downward, nearly perpendicular, into a churning, muddy river. A separate bridge that supported traffic in the other direction remained standing.\n\nThe head of the Ministry of Emergency Management, Wang Xiangxi, went to the site Saturday morning and was overseeing a rescue effort that involved 869 people, 93 vehicles, 41 drones, 20 boats and a sonar system, according to the authorities.\n\nBoth Xi Jinping, China's top leader, and Premier Li Qiang, the country's second-highest leader, ordered all-out rescue efforts.\n\nThey had issued similar instructions after the previous disaster, which occurred on May 1 also amid heavy rain. At least 48 people died after a section of expressway running along the side of a hill in southeastern China gave way, apparently because a landslide began underneath it. Mr. Xi had ordered that local governments across China pay more attention to identifying and dealing with such risks.\n\nIn the past week, heavy rain has fallen in the location of the highway collapse, in rugged terrain in the southern part of Shaanxi Province. A flood emergency was declared there this past week. Late spring through late summer is the rainy season in China.\n\nState television also reported on Saturday that a flash flood in neighboring Sichuan Province had left more than 30 people missing in a village about 500 miles southwest of the highway bridge collapse.\n\nChina has invested heavily in infrastructure like highways, bridges and rail lines in the past several decades, and much of the construction has been in mountainous terrain. By 2017, China had 81 of the world's 100 tallest bridges either already built or in progress.\n\nJust in the past two decades, China has also built twice as many miles of expressways as make up the entire interstate highway system in the United States.\n\nCloudbursts have periodically posed a problem. The heaviest hour of rainfall ever reliably recorded in China killed at least 300 people in the city of Zhengzhou in 2021, including 14 who drowned in a subway tunnel.\n\nThe May 1 highway collapse occurred when a landslide pulled the supports out from under an elevated section of expressway along the side of a hill on the outskirts of Meizhou, a city 180 miles northeast of Hong Kong.\n\nFriday's bridge collapse occurred in a village about 60 miles southeast of Xi'an, the capital of Shaanxi Province. Xi'an is famous for the 2,200-year-old terra-cotta warriors discovered at the tomb of Emperor Qin Shihuang.\n\nXi'an is also a place associated with Mr. Xi. His father was from a rural area about 25 miles north of the emperor's tomb. Mr. Xi himself left Beijing for his father's home county soon after Mao's turbulent Cultural Revolution began in 1966, later spending his teenage years in Shaanxi Province.", "source": {"uri":

The local authorities have been making contact with family members of the victims, and carried out measures to prevent secondary disasters, while monitoring geographical risks and fighting the flooding in the area.\n\nBefore the press conference, the participants observed a moment of silence for the victims.\n\nThe water flow of the river has now slowed to 130 cubic meters per second, with the water level dropping by more than three meters, compared with the level when the bridge collapse occurred, making the conditions conducive to the search and rescue work.\n\nZhao said that six rounds of heavy downpours have lashed the region since the beginning of July, increasing the risk of flooding on five major rivers, with disasters reported in seven counties and districts of the city. A total of 64,278 people have been affected. The local authorities have relocated 37,597 people due to safety concerns. \u25a0", "source": {"uri": "english.news.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "english.news.cn"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shangluo", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shangluo"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhashui_County", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Zhashui County"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Zhashui County"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhao_Jing_(swimmer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zhao Jing (swimmer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhao_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zhao (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flash flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinhua_News_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xinhua News Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaanxi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shaanxi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shaanxi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yanping_District", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yanping District"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Yanping District"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-circuit_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Closed-circuit television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled-access_highway", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Controlled-access highway"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truck", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Truck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counties_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Counties of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_(China)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "District (China)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_and_rescue", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Search and rescue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Structural_Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Structural Engineering", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Paddling", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Paddling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Card_Games/Trick_Capturing", "label": "dmoz/Games/Card Games/Trick Capturing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Bridges_and_Tunnels", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Bridges and Tunnels", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Toll_and_Automated", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Toll and Automated", "wgt": 100}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9748902", "eventUri": "eng-9748902", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-20", "textStart": 7, "textEnd": 14}], "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

ringleader of an Islamic extremist cell that carried out vehicle attacks in Barcelona and a seaside resort, as the investigation focused on links among the Moroccan members and the house where they plotted the carnage.\n\nEarly Saturday, police searched two buses in northwest Catalonia in the hunt for any remaining members of the cell. Nothing was found in the searches in Girona and Garrigas, police tweeted.\n\nAcross the Pyrenees, French police carried out extra border checks on people coming from Spain -- a routine beefing-up of patrols anytime a neighboring country flags a potential risk, a French security official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. No arrests were made.\n\nPolice also announced a series of controlled explosions Saturday in the town of Alcanar, south of Barcelona, where the attacks were planned in a rental house destroyed Wednesday by an apparently accidental blast. Authorities had initially written off the incident as a household gas accident, but took another look on Friday and returned on Saturday.\n\nPolice believe the Wednesday night blast, which killed at least one person and injured one of the people currently in custody, actually prevented a far deadlier attack using explosives, forcing the extremists to use more \"rudimentary\" vehicles instead.\n\nIn a tweet Saturday, Catalan police urged Alcanar residents not to be alarmed by the controlled explosions.\n\nPolice also said tests were underway to determine if human remains found at the house on Friday were from a second victim.\n\nIn the carnage claimed by the Islamic State group, a white van swerved onto Barcelona's historic Las Ramblas pedestrian promenade Thursday afternoon, killing 13 people and injuring more than 100 as it plowed down unsuspecting tourists and locals. A few hours later, five extremists began mowing down people along the boardwalk in the seaside resort of Cambrils.\n\nOne woman died and five others were injured before police shot and killed all five attackers. They were armed with an axe, knives and fake explosive belts.\n\nAuthorities said the two attacks were related and the work of a large terrorist cell that had been plotting for a long time from the house in Alcanar, 200 kilometers (125 miles) down the coast from Barcelona.\n\nOne of the main suspects in the attacks, Younes Abouyaaquoub, a 22-year-old Moroccan, was believed to be at large. His name figures on a police list of four main suspects sought in the attacks. All the suspects on the list hail from Ripoll, a quiet, upscale town of 10,000 about 100 kilometers north of Barcelona.\n\nOn Friday, police searched the apartment of Ripoll's imam, neighbors said. An apparent search warrant seen by The Associated Press authorized police to extract any terrorism-related \"weapons, ammunition, explosives, instruments, documents or papers\" found in the apartment.\n\nThe suspect list was issued throughout Spain and into France, according to a Spanish official and a French police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the document.\n\nThe French official said Spain had flagged a rented Kangoo utility vehicle that was believed to have been rented in Spain by a suspect in Thursday's attacks that might have crossed the border.\n\nAlso named on the list is 17-year-old Moussa Oukabir, whose brother Driss reported his documents stolen to police in Ripoll. Ripoll's mayor confirmed the documents were found in one of the vehicles used in the attacks.\n\nThe brothers were born and raised in Ripoll, where the family's first-floor apartment was searched Friday. No one was home.\n\nNeighbors said they were shocked by the news of Moussa Oukabir's alleged involvement. One teenager, who identified himself only by his first name, Pau, said they played together when they were younger and he was \"a good boy.\"\n\nIn addition to the five people killed in Cambrils, police said they arrested two people Friday, after the two arrests a day earlier. In custody are three Moroccans and one Spaniard, none with terrorism-related records.\n\n\"We are not talking about a group of one or two people, but rather a numerous group,\" regional Interior Ministry chief Joaquim Forn told Onda Cero radio.\n\nThe sheer size of the cell recalled the November 2015 attacks in Paris, in which trained Islamic State attackers struck the national stadium, a concert hall and bars and restaurants nearly simultaneously. Since then, the extremist group has steadily lost ground in its self-declared caliphate in Iraq and Syria, most recently with its defeat in Mosul.\n\n\"This shows there is no correlation between what is happening over there with Daesh and the operational capacity of the group,\" said Jean-Charles Brisard, a French security analyst, using another name for the group.\n\nSpanish authorities had not yet drawn any direct links between IS extremists and the suspects in the Spanish attacks, but the possibility that members of the Spanish group could still be at large was chilling. Those who have survived prior attacks nearly always ended their lives with new bloodshed and a hail of police bullets.\n\n\"There is the danger they will not let themselves get caught and will do something dramatic,\" said Alain Chouet, a former French intelligence official.\n\nThe attacks unnerved a country that hasn't seen an Islamic extremist attack since 2004 when al-Qaida-inspired bombers killed 191 people in coordinated assaults on Madrid's commuter trains.

ringleader of an Islamic extremist cell that carried out vehicle attacks in Barcelona and a seaside resort, as the investigation focused on links among the Moroccan members and the house where they plotted the carnage.\n\nEarly Saturday, police searched two buses in northwest Catalonia in the hunt for any remaining members of the cell. Nothing was found in the searches in Girona and Garrigas, police tweeted.\n\nAcross the Pyrenees, French police carried out extra border checks on people coming from Spain -- a routine beefing-up of patrols anytime a neighbouring country flags a potential risk, a French security official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. No arrests were made.\n\nPolice also announced a series of controlled explosions Saturday in the town of Alcanar, south of Barcelona, where the attacks were planned in a rental house destroyed Wednesday by an apparently accidental blast. Authorities had initially written off the incident as a household gas accident, but took another look on Friday and returned on Saturday.\n\nPolice believe the Wednesday night blast, which killed at least one person and injured one of the people currently in custody, actually prevented a far deadlier attack using explosives, forcing the extremists to use more \"rudimentary\" vehicles instead.\n\nIn a tweet Saturday, Catalan police urged Alcanar residents not to be alarmed by the controlled explosions.\n\nPolice also said tests were underway to determine if human remains found at the house on Friday were from a second victim.\n\nIn the carnage claimed by the Islamic State group, a white van swerved onto Barcelona's historic Las Ramblas pedestrian promenade Thursday afternoon, killing 13 people and injuring more than 100 as it plowed down unsuspecting tourists and locals. A few hours later, five extremists began mowing down people along the boardwalk in the seaside resort of Cambrils.\n\nOne woman died and five others were injured before police shot and killed all five attackers. They were armed with an axe, knives and fake explosive belts.\n\nAuthorities said the two attacks were related and the work of a large terrorist cell that had been plotting for a long time from the house in Alcanar, 200 kilometres (125 miles) down the coast from Barcelona.\n\nOne of the main suspects in the attacks, Younes Abouyaaquoub, a 22-year-old Moroccan, was believed to be at large. His name figures on a police list of four main suspects sought in the attacks. All the suspects on the list hail from Ripoll, a quiet, upscale town of 10,000 about 100 kilometres north of Barcelona.\n\nOn Friday, police searched the apartment of Ripoll's imam, neighbours said. An apparent search warrant seen by The Associated Press authorized police to extract any terrorism-related \"weapons, ammunition, explosives, instruments, documents or papers\" found in the apartment.\n\nThe suspect list was issued throughout Spain and into France, according to a Spanish official and a French police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the document.\n\nThe French official said Spain had flagged a rented Kangoo utility vehicle that was believed to have been rented in Spain by a suspect in Thursday's attacks that might have crossed the border.\n\nAlso named on the list is 17-year-old Moussa Oukabir, whose brother Driss reported his documents stolen to police in Ripoll. Ripoll's mayor confirmed the documents were found in one of the vehicles used in the attacks.\n\nThe brothers were born and raised in Ripoll, where the family's first-floor apartment was searched Friday. No one was home.\n\nNeighbours said they were shocked by the news of Moussa Oukabir's alleged involvement. One teenager, who identified himself only by his first name, Pau, said they played together when they were younger and he was \"a good boy.\"\n\nIn addition to the five people killed in Cambrils, police said they arrested two people Friday, after the two arrests a day earlier. In custody are three Moroccans and one Spaniard, none with terrorism-related records.\n\n\"We are not talking about a group of one or two people, but rather a numerous group,\" regional Interior Ministry chief Joaquim Forn told Onda Cero radio.\n\nThe sheer size of the cell recalled the November 2015 attacks in Paris, in which trained Islamic State attackers struck the national stadium, a concert hall and bars and restaurants nearly simultaneously. Since then, the extremist group has steadily lost ground in its self-declared caliphate in Iraq and Syria, most recently with its defeat in Mosul.\n\n\"This shows there is no correlation between what is happening over there with Daesh and the operational capacity of the group,\" said Jean-Charles Brisard, a French security analyst, using another name for the group.\n\nSpanish authorities had not yet drawn any direct links between IS extremists and the suspects in the Spanish attacks, but the possibility that members of the Spanish group could still be at large was chilling. Those who have survived prior attacks nearly always ended their lives with new bloodshed and a hail of police bullets.\n\n\"There is the danger they will not let themselves get caught and will do something dramatic,\" said Alain Chouet, a former French intelligence official.\n\nThe attacks unnerved a country that hasn't seen an Islamic extremist attack since 2004, when al-Qaida-inspired bombers killed 191 people in co-ordinated assaults on Madrid's commuter trains. Unlike France, Britain, Sweden and Germany, Spain has largely been spared, thanks in part to a crackdown that has netted about 200 suspected jihadis in recent years.\n\nOn Saturday, Spain decided to maintain its terrorist threat alert at level 4, declaring that no new attacks were imminent. Interior Minister Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido said the country would nevertheless reinforce security for events that draw large crowds and popular tourist sites.\n\nIslamic extremists have targeted Europe's major tourist attractions in recent years.

In a new statement Saturday, it also claimed the attack a few hours later in Cambrils, in which five extremists mowed down people along the boardwalk in the seaside resort.\n\nOne woman died and five others were injured in Cambrils before police shot and killed all five attackers. They were armed with an axe, knives and fake explosive belts. The Islamic State statement provided no information beyond what had been previously reported.\n\nAuthorities said the two attacks were related and the work of a large terrorist cell that had been plotting for a long time from the house in Alcanar, 200 kilometers (125 miles) down the coast from Barcelona.\n\nThe name of the lone suspect at large, Abouyaaquoub, figures on a police list of four main suspects sought in the attacks. All the suspects on the list hail from Ripoll, a quiet, upscale town of 10,000 about 100 kilometers north of Barcelona.\n\nOn Friday, police searched the apartment of Ripoll's imam, neighbors said. An apparent search warrant seen by The Associated Press authorized police to extract any terrorism-related \"weapons, ammunition, explosives, instruments, documents or papers\" found in the apartment.\n\nThe suspect list was issued throughout Spain and into France, according to a Spanish official and a French police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the document.\n\nThe French official said Spain had flagged a rented Kangoo utility vehicle that was believed to have been rented in Spain by a suspect in Thursday's attacks that might have crossed the border.\n\nAlso named on the list is 17-year-old Moussa Oukabir, whose brother Driss reported his documents stolen to police in Ripoll. Ripoll's mayor confirmed the documents were found in one of the vehicles used in the attacks.\n\nThe brothers were born and raised in Ripoll, where the family's first-floor apartment was searched Friday. No one was home.\n\nNeighbors said they were shocked by the news of Moussa Oukabir's alleged involvement. One teenager, who identified himself only by his first name, Pau, said they played together when they were younger and he was \"a good boy.\"\n\nIn addition to the five people killed in Cambrils, police said they arrested two people Friday, after the two arrests a day earlier. In custody are three Moroccans and one Spaniard, none with terrorism-related records.\n\n\"We are not talking about a group of one or two people, but rather a numerous group,\" regional Interior Ministry chief Joaquim Forn told Onda Cero radio.\n\nThe sheer size of the cell recalled the November 2015 attacks in Paris, in which trained Islamic State attackers struck the national stadium, a concert hall and bars and restaurants nearly simultaneously. Since then, the extremist group has steadily lost ground in its self-declared caliphate in Iraq and Syria, most recently with its defeat in Mosul.\n\n\"This shows there is no correlation between what is happening over there with Daesh and the operational capacity of the group,\" said Jean-Charles Brisard, a French security analyst, using another name for the group.\n\nSpanish authorities had not yet drawn any direct links between IS extremists and the suspects in the Spanish attacks, but the possibility that members of the Spanish group could still be at large was chilling. Those who have survived prior attacks nearly always ended their lives with new bloodshed and a hail of police bullets.\n\n\"There is the danger they will not let themselves get caught and will do something dramatic,\" said Alain Chouet, a former French intelligence official.\n\nThe attacks unnerved a country that hasn't seen an Islamic extremist attack since 2004, when al-Qaida-inspired bombers killed 191 people in coordinated assaults on Madrid's commuter trains. Unlike France, Britain, Sweden and Germany, Spain has largely been spared, thanks in part to a crackdown that has netted about 200 suspected jihadis in recent years.\n\nOn Saturday, Spain decided to maintain its terrorist threat alert at level 4, declaring that no new attacks were imminent. Interior Minister Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido said the country would nevertheless reinforce security for events that draw large crowds and popular tourist sites.\n\nIslamic extremists have targeted Europe's major tourist attractions in recent years. Rented or hijacked vehicles have formed the backbone of a strategy to attack the West and its cultural symbols. Barcelona's Las Ramblas is one of the most popular attractions in a city that swarms with foreign tourists in August.\n\nThe dead and wounded in the two attacks came from 34 countries.\n\n___\n\nAP writers Angela Charlton in Paris and Nicole Winfield in Rome contributed.", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-3374007", "id": "10078480", "url": "http://www.artesianews.com/1488749/spain-presses-manhunt-for-ringleader-in-dual-attacks.html", "sim": 0.9686274528503418, "details": {}, "uri": "711954049", "extractedDates": [{"date": "2015-11-", "textStart": 4660, "textEnd": 4673, "amb": false}], "eventUri": "eng-3374007", "image": "http://www.artesianews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/cf56ab905ada4bfbaedf30674c8f9d36-Spain_Attacks_60025.jpg", "timeCrawl": "15:48:00", "isDuplicate": false, "dateTime": "2017-08-19T15:48:00Z", "lang": "eng", "title": "Spain presses manhunt for ringleader in dual attacks", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "id": 161}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "id": 164}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "id": 203}], "time": "15:48:00", "source": {"uri": "artesianews.com", "title": "Artesia News", "id": "16398"}, "date": "2017-08-19", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19"}

Authorities in Spain and France pressed the search Saturday for the supposed ringleader of an Islamic extremist cell that carried out vehicle attacks in Barcelona and a seaside resort, as the investigation focused on links among the Moroccan members and the house where they plotted the carnage.\n\nEarly Saturday, police searched two buses in northwest Catalonia in the hunt for any remaining members of the cell. Nothing was found in the searches in Girona and Garrigas, police tweeted.\n\nAcross the Pyrenees, French police carried out extra border checks on people coming from Spain -- a routine beefing-up of patrols anytime a neighboring country flags a potential risk, a French security official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. No arrests were made.\n\nPolice also announced a series of controlled explosions Saturday in the town of Alcanar, south of Barcelona, where the attacks were planned in a rental house destroyed Wednesday by an apparently accidental blast. Authorities had initially written off the incident as a household gas accident, but took another look on Friday and returned on Saturday.\n\nPolice believe the Wednesday night blast, which killed at least one person and injured one of the people currently in custody, actually prevented a far deadlier attack using explosives, forcing the extremists to use more \"rudimentary\" vehicles instead.\n\nIn a tweet Saturday, Catalan police urged Alcanar residents not to be alarmed by the controlled explosions.\n\nPolice also said tests were underway to determine if human remains found at the house on Friday were from a second victim.\n\nIn the carnage claimed by the Islamic State group, a white van swerved onto Barcelona's historic Las Ramblas pedestrian promenade Thursday afternoon, killing 13 people and injuring more than 100 as it plowed down unsuspecting tourists and locals. A few hours later, five extremists began mowing down people along the boardwalk in the seaside resort of Cambrils.\n\nOne woman died and five others were injured before police shot and killed all five attackers. They were armed with an axe, knives and fake explosive belts.\n\nAuthorities said the two attacks were related and the work of a large terrorist cell that had been plotting for a long time from the house in Alcanar, 200 kilometers (125 miles) down the coast from Barcelona.\n\nOne of the main suspects in the attacks, Younes Abouyaaquoub, a 22-year-old Moroccan, was believed to be at large. His name figures on a police list of four main suspects sought in the attacks. All the suspects on the list hail from Ripoll, a quiet, upscale town of 10,000 about 100 kilometers north of Barcelona.\n\nOn Friday, police searched the apartment of Ripoll's imam, neighbors said.

Saturday for the supposed ringleader of an Islamic extremist cell that carried out vehicle attacks in Barcelona and a seaside resort, as the investigation focused on links among the Moroccan members and the house where they plotted the carnage.\n\nEarly Saturday, police searched two buses in northwest Catalonia in the hunt for any remaining members of the cell. Nothing was found in the searches in Girona and Garrigas, police tweeted.\n\nAcross the Pyrenees, French police carried out extra border checks on people coming from Spain a routine beefing-up of patrols anytime a neighboring country flags a potential risk, a French security official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. No arrests were made.\n\nPolice also announced a series of controlled explosions Saturday in the town of Alcanar, south of Barcelona, where the attacks were planned in a rental house destroyed Wednesday by an apparently accidental blast. Authorities had initially written off the incident as a household gas accident, but took another look on Friday and returned on Saturday.\n\nPolice believe the Wednesday night blast, which killed at least one person and injured one of the people currently in custody, actually prevented a far deadlier attack using explosives, forcing the extremists to use more \"rudimentary\" vehicles instead.\n\nIn a tweet Saturday, Catalan police urged Alcanar residents not to be alarmed by the controlled explosions.\n\nPolice also said tests were underway to determine if human remains found at the house on Friday were from a second victim.\n\nIn the carnage claimed by the Islamic State group, a white van swerved onto Barcelona's historic Las Ramblas pedestrian promenade on Thursday afternoon, killing 13 people and injuring more than 100 as it plowed down unsuspecting tourists and locals. A few hours later, five extremists began mowing down people along the boardwalk in the seaside resort of Cambrils.\n\nOne woman died and five others were injured before police shot and killed all five attackers. They were armed with an axe, knives and fake explosive belts.\n\nAuthorities said the two attacks were related and the work of a large terrorist cell that had been plotting for a long time from the house in Alcanar, 200 km down the coast from Barcelona.\n\nOne of the main suspects in the attacks, Younes Abouyaaquoub, a 22-year-old Moroccan, was believed to be at large. His name figures on a police list of four main suspects sought in the attacks. All the suspects on the list hail from Ripoll, a quiet, upscale town of 10,000 about 100 kilometers north of Barcelona.\n\nOn Friday, police searched the apartment of Ripoll's imam, neighbors said. An apparent search warrant seen by The Associated Press authorized police to extract any terrorism-related \"weapons, ammunition, explosives, instruments, documents or papers\" found in the apartment.\n\nThe suspect list was issued throughout Spain and into France, according to a Spanish official and a French police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the document.\n\nThe French official said Spain had flagged a rented Kangoo utility vehicle that was believed to have been rented in Spain by a suspect in Thursday's attacks that might have crossed the border.\n\nAlso named on the list is 17-year-old Moussa Oukabir, whose brother Driss reported his documents stolen to police in Ripoll. Ripoll's mayor confirmed the documents were found in one of the vehicles used in the attacks.\n\nThe brothers were born and raised in Ripoll, where the family's first-floor apartment was searched on Friday. No one was home.\n\nNeighbors said they were shocked by the news of Moussa Oukabir's alleged involvement. One teenager, who identified himself only by his first name, Pau, said they played together when they were younger and he was \"a good boy.\"\n\nIn addition to the five people killed in Cambrils, police said they arrested two people on Friday, after the two arrests a day earlier.

Those who have survived prior attacks nearly always ended their lives with new bloodshed and a hail of police bullets.\n\n\"There is the danger they will not let themselves get caught and will do something dramatic,\" said Alain Chouet, a former French intelligence official.\n\nThe attacks unnerved a country that hasn't seen an Islamic extremist attack since 2004, when al-Qaeda-inspired bombers killed 191 people in coordinated assaults on Madrid's commuter trains. Unlike France, Britain, Sweden and Germany, Spain has largely been spared, thanks in part to a crackdown that has netted about 200 suspected jihadis in recent years.\n\nOn Saturday, Spain decided to maintain its terrorist threat alert at level 4, declaring that no new attacks were imminent.

supposed ringleader of an Islamic extremist cell that carried out vehicle attacks in Barcelona and a seaside resort, as the investigation focused on links among the Moroccan members and the house where they plotted the carnage.\n\nEarly Saturday, police searched two buses in northwest Catalonia in the hunt for any remaining members of the cell. Nothing was found in the searches in Girona and Garrigas, police tweeted.\n\nAcross the Pyrenees, French police carried out extra border checks on people coming from Spain -- a routine beefing-up of patrols anytime a neighboring country flags a potential risk, a French security official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. No arrests were made.\n\nPolice also announced a series of controlled explosions Saturday in the town of Alcanar, south of Barcelona, where the attacks were planned in a rental house destroyed Wednesday by an apparently accidental blast. Authorities had initially written off the incident as a household gas accident, but took another look on Friday and returned on Saturday.\n\nPolice believe the Wednesday night blast, which killed at least one person and injured one of the people currently in custody, actually prevented a far deadlier attack using explosives, forcing the extremists to use more \"rudimentary\" vehicles instead.\n\nIn a tweet Saturday, Catalan police urged Alcanar residents not to be alarmed by the controlled explosions.\n\nPolice also said tests were underway to determine if human remains found at the house on Friday were from a second victim.\n\nIn the carnage claimed by the Islamic State group, a white van swerved onto Barcelona's historic Las Ramblas pedestrian promenade Thursday afternoon, killing 13 people and injuring more than 100 as it plowed down unsuspecting tourists and locals. A few hours later, five extremists began mowing down people along the boardwalk in the seaside resort of Cambrils.\n\nOne woman died and five others were injured before police shot and killed all five attackers. They were armed with an axe, knives and fake explosive belts.\n\nAuthorities said the two attacks were related and the work of a large terrorist cell that had been plotting for a long time from the house in Alcanar, 200 kilometers (125 miles) down the coast from Barcelona.\n\nOne of the main suspects in the attacks, Younes Abouyaaquoub, a 22-year-old Moroccan, was believed to be at large. His name figures on a police list of four main suspects sought in the attacks. All the suspects on the list hail from Ripoll, a quiet, upscale town of 10,000 about 100 kilometers north of Barcelona.\n\nOn Friday, police searched the apartment of Ripoll's imam, neighbors said. An apparent search warrant seen by The Associated Press authorized police to extract any terrorism-related \"weapons, ammunition, explosives, instruments, documents or papers\" found in the apartment.\n\nThe suspect list was issued throughout Spain and into France, according to a Spanish official and a French police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the document.\n\nThe French official said Spain had flagged a rented Kangoo utility vehicle that was believed to have been rented in Spain by a suspect in Thursday's attacks that might have crossed the border.\n\nAlso named on the list is 17-year-old Moussa Oukabir, whose brother Driss reported his documents stolen to police in Ripoll. Ripoll's mayor confirmed the documents were found in one of the vehicles used in the attacks.\n\nThe brothers were born and raised in Ripoll, where the family's first-floor apartment was searched Friday. No one was home.\n\nNeighbors said they were shocked by the news of Moussa Oukabir's alleged involvement. One teenager, who identified himself only by his first name, Pau, said they played together when they were younger and he was \"a good boy.\"\n\nIn addition to the five people killed in Cambrils, police said they arrested two people Friday, after the two arrests a day earlier. In custody are three Moroccans and one Spaniard, none with terrorism-related records.\n\n\"We are not talking about a group of one or two people, but rather a numerous group,\" regional Interior Ministry chief Joaquim Forn told Onda Cero radio.\n\nThe sheer size of the cell recalled the November 2015 attacks in Paris, in which trained Islamic State attackers struck the national stadium, a concert hall and bars and restaurants nearly simultaneously. Since then, the extremist group has steadily lost ground in its self-declared caliphate in Iraq and Syria, most recently with its defeat in Mosul.\n\n\"This shows there is no correlation between what is happening over there with Daesh and the operational capacity of the group,\" said Jean-Charles Brisard, a French security analyst, using another name for the group.\n\nSpanish authorities had not yet drawn any direct links between IS extremists and the suspects in the Spanish attacks, but the possibility that members of the Spanish group could still be at large was chilling. Those who have survived prior attacks nearly always ended their lives with new bloodshed and a hail of police bullets.\n\n\"There is the danger they will not let themselves get caught and will do something dramatic,\" said Alain Chouet, a former French intelligence official.\n\nThe attacks unnerved a country that hasn't seen an Islamic extremist attack since 2004, when al-Qaida-inspired bombers killed 191 people in coordinated assaults on Madrid's commuter trains. Unlike France, Britain, Sweden and Germany, Spain has largely been spared, thanks in part to a crackdown that has netted about 200 suspected jihadis in recent years.\n\nOn Saturday, Spain decided to maintain its terrorist threat alert at level 4, declaring that no new attacks were imminent. Interior Minister Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido said the country would nevertheless reinforce security for events that draw large crowds and popular tourist sites.\n\nIslamic extremists have targeted Europe's major tourist attractions in recent years. Rented or hijacked vehicles have formed the backbone of a strategy to attack the West and its cultural symbols. Barcelona's Las Ramblas is one of the most popular attractions in a city that swarms with foreign tourists in August.\n\nThe dead and wounded in the two attacks came from 34 countries.\n\n___\n\nAP writers Angela Charlton in Paris and Nicole Winfield in Rome contributed.", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-3374007", "id": "10051470", "url": "http://hosted2.ap.org/CARIE/0260ea4c3e85456b80715585ba3c7b5b/Article_2017-08-19-EU-Spain-Attacks/id-2c4f53e9696c4c7285b61d51eb22dba4", "sim": 0.9647058844566345, "details": {}, "uri": "711880923", "extractedDates": [{"date": "2015-11-", "textStart": 4315, "textEnd": 4328, "amb": false}], "eventUri": "eng-3374007", "image": "http://hosted2.ap.org/CBImages/?media=photo&contentId=e3abbd7e46cb4d67be1cccfe802536af&fmt=jpg&Role=Preview&reldt=2017-08-19T10:58:15GMT&authToken=eNoNyjEOwCAIBdATkWDRDx08jCAmbh07ePj2ze%2fk2yEQs6uJKTMXq3Ji95ThPjWpIpzqhJJnCYpYafxvjHX204tCb7A2%2bwArLBUB", "timeCrawl": "11:31:00", "isDuplicate": false, "dateTime": "2017-08-19T11:03:00Z", "lang": "eng", "title": "Spain, France press manhunt for ringleader in dual attacks", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "id": 161}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "id": 164}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "id": 203}], "time": "11:03:00", "source": {"uri": "hosted2.ap.org", "title": "Associated Press", "id": "566"}, "date": "2017-08-19", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19"}

supposed ringleader of an Islamic extremist cell that carried out vehicle attacks in Barcelona and a seaside resort, as the investigation focused on links among the Moroccan members and the house where they plotted the carnage.\n\nEarly Saturday, police searched two buses in northwest Catalonia in the hunt for any remaining members of the cell. Nothing was found in the searches in Girona and Garrigas, police tweeted.\n\nAcross the Pyrenees, French police carried out extra border checks on people coming from Spain - a routine beefing-up of patrols anytime a neighboring country flags a potential risk, a French security official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. No arrests were made.\n\nPolice also announced a series of controlled explosions Saturday in the town of Alcanar, south of Barcelona, where the attacks were planned in a rental house destroyed Wednesday by an apparently accidental blast. Authorities had initially written off the incident as a household gas accident, but took another look on Friday and returned on Saturday.\n\nPolice believe the Wednesday night blast, which killed at least one person and injured one of the people currently in custody, actually prevented a far deadlier attack using explosives, forcing the extremists to use more \"rudimentary\" vehicles instead.\n\nIn a tweet Saturday, Catalan police urged Alcanar residents not to be alarmed by the controlled explosions.\n\nPolice also said tests were underway to determine if human remains found at the house on Friday were from a second victim.\n\nIn the carnage claimed by the Islamic State group, a white van swerved onto Barcelona's historic Las Ramblas pedestrian promenade Thursday afternoon, killing 13 people and injuring more than 100 as it plowed down unsuspecting tourists and locals. A few hours later, five extremists began mowing down people along the boardwalk in the seaside resort of Cambrils.\n\nOne woman died and five others were injured before police shot and killed all five attackers. They were armed with an axe, knives and fake explosive belts.\n\nAuthorities said the two attacks were related and the work of a large terrorist cell that had been plotting for a long time from the house in Alcanar, 200 kilometers (125 miles) down the coast from Barcelona.\n\nOne of the main suspects in the attacks, Younes Abouyaaquoub, a 22-year-old Moroccan, was believed to be at large. His name figures on a police list of four main suspects sought in the attacks. All the suspects on the list hail from Ripoll, a quiet, upscale town of 10,000 about 100 kilometers north of Barcelona.\n\nOn Friday, police searched the apartment of Ripoll's imam, neighbors said. An apparent search warrant seen by The Associated Press authorized police to extract any terrorism-related \"weapons, ammunition, explosives, instruments, documents or papers\" found in the apartment.\n\nThe suspect list was issued throughout Spain and into France, according to a Spanish official and a French police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the document.\n\nThe French official said Spain had flagged a rented Kangoo utility vehicle that was believed to have been rented in Spain by a suspect in Thursday's attacks that might have crossed the border.\n\nAlso named on the list is 17-year-old Moussa Oukabir, whose brother Driss reported his documents stolen to police in Ripoll. Ripoll's mayor confirmed the documents were found in one of the vehicles used in the attacks.\n\nThe brothers were born and raised in Ripoll, where the family's first-floor apartment was searched Friday. No one was home.\n\nNeighbors said they were shocked by the news of Moussa Oukabir's alleged involvement. One teenager, who identified himself only by his first name, Pau, said they played together when they were younger and he was \"a good boy.\"\n\nIn addition to the five people killed in Cambrils, police said they arrested two people Friday, after the two arrests a day earlier. In custody are three Moroccans and one Spaniard, none with terrorism-related records.\n\n\"We are not talking about a group of one or two people, but rather a numerous group,\" regional Interior Ministry chief Joaquim Forn told Onda Cero radio.\n\nThe sheer size of the cell recalled the November 2015 attacks in Paris, in which trained Islamic State attackers struck the national stadium, a concert hall and bars and restaurants nearly simultaneously. Since then, the extremist group has steadily lost ground in its self-declared caliphate in Iraq and Syria, most recently with its defeat in Mosul.\n\n\"This shows there is no correlation between what is happening over there with Daesh and the operational capacity of the group,\" said Jean-Charles Brisard, a French security analyst, using another name for the group.\n\nSpanish authorities had not yet drawn any direct links between IS extremists and the suspects in the Spanish attacks, but the possibility that members of the Spanish group could still be at large was chilling. Those who have survived prior attacks nearly always ended their lives with new bloodshed and a hail of police bullets.\n\n\"There is the danger they will not let themselves get caught and will do something dramatic,\" said Alain Chouet, a former French intelligence official.\n\nThe attacks unnerved a country that hasn't seen an Islamic extremist attack since 2004, when al-Qaida-inspired bombers killed 191 people in coordinated assaults on Madrid's commuter trains. Unlike France, Britain, Sweden and Germany, Spain has largely been spared, thanks in part to a crackdown that has netted about 200 suspected jihadis in recent years.\n\nOn Saturday, Spain decided to maintain its terrorist threat alert at level 4, declaring that no new attacks were imminent. Interior Minister Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido said the country would nevertheless reinforce security for events that draw large crowds and popular tourist sites.\n\nIslamic extremists have targeted Europe's major tourist attractions in recent years. Rented or hijacked vehicles have formed the backbone of a strategy to attack the West and its cultural symbols. Barcelona's Las Ramblas is one of the most popular attractions in a city that swarms with foreign tourists in August.\n\nThe dead and wounded in the two attacks came from 34 countries.\n\n___\n\nAP writers Angela Charlton in Paris and Nicole Winfield in Rome contributed.\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

ringleader of an Islamic extremist cell that carried out vehicle attacks in Barcelona and a seaside resort, as the investigation focused on links among the Moroccan members and the house where they plotted the carnage.\n\nEarly Saturday, police searched two buses in northwest Catalonia in the hunt for any remaining members of the cell. Nothing was found in the searches in Girona and Garrigas, police tweeted.\n\nAcross the Pyrenees, French police carried out extra border checks on people coming from Spain -- a routine beefing-up of patrols anytime a neighbouring country flags a potential risk, a French security official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. No arrests were made.\n\nPolice also announced a series of controlled explosions Saturday in the town of Alcanar, south of Barcelona, where the attacks were planned in a rental house destroyed Wednesday by an apparently accidental blast. Authorities had initially written off the incident as a household gas accident, but took another look on Friday and returned on Saturday.\n\nPolice believe the Wednesday night blast, which killed at least one person and injured one of the people currently in custody, actually prevented a far deadlier attack using explosives, forcing the extremists to use more \"rudimentary\" vehicles instead.\n\nIn a tweet Saturday, Catalan police urged Alcanar residents not to be alarmed by the controlled explosions.\n\nPolice also said tests were underway to determine if human remains found at the house on Friday were from a second victim.\n\nIn the carnage claimed by the Islamic State group, a white van swerved onto Barcelona's historic Las Ramblas pedestrian promenade Thursday afternoon, killing 13 people and injuring more than 100 as it plowed down unsuspecting tourists and locals. A few hours later, five extremists began mowing down people along the boardwalk in the seaside resort of Cambrils.\n\nOne woman died and five others were injured before police shot and killed all five attackers. They were armed with an axe, knives and fake explosive belts.\n\nAuthorities said the two attacks were related and the work of a large terrorist cell that had been plotting for a long time from the house in Alcanar, 200 kilometres (125 miles) down the coast from Barcelona.\n\nOne of the main suspects in the attacks, Younes Abouyaaquoub, a 22-year-old Moroccan, was believed to be at large. His name figures on a police list of four main suspects sought in the attacks. All the suspects on the list hail from Ripoll, a quiet, upscale town of 10,000 about 100 kilometres north of Barcelona.\n\nOn Friday, police searched the apartment of Ripoll's imam, neighbours said. An apparent search warrant seen by The Associated Press authorized police to extract any terrorism-related \"weapons, ammunition, explosives, instruments, documents or papers\" found in the apartment.\n\nThe suspect list was issued throughout Spain and into France, according to a Spanish official and a French police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the document.\n\nThe French official said Spain had flagged a rented Kangoo utility vehicle that was believed to have been rented in Spain by a suspect in Thursday's attacks that might have crossed the border.\n\nAlso named on the list is 17-year-old Moussa Oukabir, whose brother Driss reported his documents stolen to police in Ripoll. Ripoll's mayor confirmed the documents were found in one of the vehicles used in the attacks.\n\nThe brothers were born and raised in Ripoll, where the family's first-floor apartment was searched Friday. No one was home.\n\nNeighbours said they were shocked by the news of Moussa Oukabir's alleged involvement. One teenager, who identified himself only by his first name, Pau, said they played together when they were younger and he was \"a good boy.\"\n\nIn addition to the five people killed in Cambrils, police said they arrested two people Friday, after the two arrests a day earlier. In custody are three Moroccans and one Spaniard, none with terrorism-related records.\n\n\"We are not talking about a group of one or two people, but rather a numerous group,\" regional Interior Ministry chief Joaquim Forn told Onda Cero radio.\n\nThe sheer size of the cell recalled the November 2015 attacks in Paris, in which trained Islamic State attackers struck the national stadium, a concert hall and bars and restaurants nearly simultaneously. Since then, the extremist group has steadily lost ground in its self-declared caliphate in Iraq and Syria, most recently with its defeat in Mosul.\n\n\"This shows there is no correlation between what is happening over there with Daesh and the operational capacity of the group,\" said Jean-Charles Brisard, a French security analyst, using another name for the group.\n\nSpanish authorities had not yet drawn any direct links between IS extremists and the suspects in the Spanish attacks, but the possibility that members of the Spanish group could still be at large was chilling. Those who have survived prior attacks nearly always ended their lives with new bloodshed and a hail of police bullets.\n\n\"There is the danger they will not let themselves get caught and will do something dramatic,\" said Alain Chouet, a former French intelligence official.\n\nThe attacks unnerved a country that hasn't seen an Islamic extremist attack since 2004, when al-Qaida-inspired bombers killed 191 people in co-ordinated assaults on Madrid's commuter trains. Unlike France, Britain, Sweden and Germany, Spain has largely been spared, thanks in part to a crackdown that has netted about 200 suspected jihadis in recent years.\n\nOn Saturday, Spain decided to maintain its terrorist threat alert at level 4, declaring that no new attacks were imminent. Interior Minister Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido said the country would nevertheless reinforce security for events that draw large crowds and popular tourist sites.\n\nIslamic extremists have targeted Europe's major tourist attractions in recent years. Rented or hijacked vehicles have formed the backbone of a strategy to attack the West and its cultural symbols. Barcelona's Las Ramblas is one of the most popular attractions in a city that swarms with foreign tourists in August.\n\nThe dead and wounded in the two attacks came from 34 countries.\n\n___\n\nAP writers Angela Charlton in Paris and Nicole Winfield in Rome contributed.", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-3374007", "id": "10051499", "url": "https://www.brandonsun.com/world/breaking-news/philippines-says-7-year-old-boy-missing-in-spain-van-attack-441071213.html", "sim": 0.9607843160629272, "details": {}, "uri": "711881009", "extractedDates": [{"date": "2015-11-", "textStart": 4312, "textEnd": 4325, "amb": false}], "eventUri": "eng-3374007", "image": "https://media.brandonsun.com/images/648*432/EM101-819_2017_050156.jpg", "timeCrawl": "11:31:00", "isDuplicate": false, "dateTime": "2017-08-19T11:31:00Z", "lang": "eng", "title": "Spain, France press manhunt for ringleader in dual attacks", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "id": 161}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "id": 164}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "id": 203}], "time": "11:31:00", "source": {"uri": "brandonsun.com", "title": "Brandon Sun", "id": "2087"}, "date": "2017-08-19", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19"}

Associated Press on August 19, 2017.\n\nBARCELONA, Spain - Authorities in Spain and France pressed the search Saturday for the supposed ringleader of an Islamic extremist cell that carried out vehicle attacks in Barcelona and a seaside resort, as the investigation focused on links among the Moroccan members and the house where they plotted the carnage.\n\nEarly Saturday, police searched two buses in northwest Catalonia in the hunt for any remaining members of the cell. Nothing was found in the searches in Girona and Garrigas, police tweeted.\n\nAcross the Pyrenees, French police carried out extra border checks on people coming from Spain - a routine beefing-up of patrols anytime a neighbouring country flags a potential risk, a French security official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. No arrests were made.\n\nPolice also announced a series of controlled explosions Saturday in the town of Alcanar, south of Barcelona, where the attacks were planned in a rental house destroyed Wednesday by an apparently accidental blast. Authorities had initially written off the incident as a household gas accident, but took another look on Friday and returned on Saturday.\n\nPolice believe the Wednesday night blast, which killed at least one person and injured one of the people currently in custody, actually prevented a far deadlier attack using explosives, forcing the extremists to use more \"rudimentary\" vehicles instead.\n\nIn a tweet Saturday, Catalan police urged Alcanar residents not to be alarmed by the controlled explosions.\n\nPolice also said tests were underway to determine if human remains found at the house on Friday were from a second victim.\n\nIn the carnage claimed by the Islamic State group, a white van swerved onto Barcelona's historic Las Ramblas pedestrian promenade Thursday afternoon, killing 13 people and injuring more than 100 as it plowed down unsuspecting tourists and locals. A few hours later, five extremists began mowing down people along the boardwalk in the seaside resort of Cambrils.\n\nOne woman died and five others were injured before police shot and killed all five attackers. They were armed with an axe, knives and fake explosive belts.\n\nAuthorities said the two attacks were related and the work of a large terrorist cell that had been plotting for a long time from the house in Alcanar, 200 kilometres (125 miles) down the coast from Barcelona.\n\nOne of the main suspects in the attacks, Younes Abouyaaquoub, a 22-year-old Moroccan, was believed to be at large. His name figures on a police list of four main suspects sought in the attacks. All the suspects on the list hail from Ripoll, a quiet, upscale town of 10,000 about 100 kilometres north of Barcelona.\n\nOn Friday, police searched the apartment of Ripoll's imam, neighbours said. An apparent search warrant seen by The Associated Press authorized police to extract any terrorism-related \"weapons, ammunition, explosives, instruments, documents or papers\" found in the apartment.\n\nThe suspect list was issued throughout Spain and into France, according to a Spanish official and a French police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the document.\n\nThe French official said Spain had flagged a rented Kangoo utility vehicle that was believed to have been rented in Spain by a suspect in Thursday's attacks that might have crossed the border.\n\nAlso named on the list is 17-year-old Moussa Oukabir, whose brother Driss reported his documents stolen to police in Ripoll. Ripoll's mayor confirmed the documents were found in one of the vehicles used in the attacks.\n\nThe brothers were born and raised in Ripoll, where the family's first-floor apartment was searched Friday. No one was home.\n\nNeighbours said they were shocked by the news of Moussa Oukabir's alleged involvement. One teenager, who identified himself only by his first name, Pau, said they played together when they were younger and he was \"a good boy.\"\n\nIn addition to the five people killed in Cambrils, police said they arrested two people Friday, after the two arrests a day earlier. In custody are three Moroccans and one Spaniard, none with terrorism-related records.\n\n\"We are not talking about a group of one or two people, but rather a numerous group,\" regional Interior Ministry chief Joaquim Forn told Onda Cero radio.\n\nThe sheer size of the cell recalled the November 2015 attacks in Paris, in which trained Islamic State attackers struck the national stadium, a concert hall and bars and restaurants nearly simultaneously. Since then, the extremist group has steadily lost ground in its self-declared caliphate in Iraq and Syria, most recently with its defeat in Mosul.\n\n\"This shows there is no correlation between what is happening over there with Daesh and the operational capacity of the group,\" said Jean-Charles Brisard, a French security analyst, using another name for the group.\n\nSpanish authorities had not yet drawn any direct links between IS extremists and the suspects in the Spanish attacks, but the possibility that members of the Spanish group could still be at large was chilling. Those who have survived prior attacks nearly always ended their lives with new bloodshed and a hail of police bullets.\n\n\"There is the danger they will not let themselves get caught and will do something dramatic,\" said Alain Chouet, a former French intelligence official.\n\nThe attacks unnerved a country that hasn't seen an Islamic extremist attack since 2004, when al-Qaida-inspired bombers killed 191 people in co-ordinated assaults on Madrid's commuter trains. Unlike France, Britain, Sweden and Germany, Spain has largely been spared, thanks in part to a crackdown that has netted about 200 suspected jihadis in recent years.\n\nOn Saturday, Spain decided to maintain its terrorist threat alert at level 4, declaring that no new attacks were imminent. Interior Minister Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido said the country would nevertheless reinforce security for events that draw large crowds and popular tourist sites.\n\nIslamic extremists have targeted Europe's major tourist attractions in recent years. Rented or hijacked vehicles have formed the backbone of a strategy to attack the West and its cultural symbols. Barcelona's Las Ramblas is one of the most popular attractions in a city that swarms with foreign tourists in August.\n\nThe dead and wounded in the two attacks came from 34 countries.\n\n___\n\nAP writers Angela Charlton in Paris and Nicole Winfield in Rome contributed.", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-3374007", "id": "10054180", "url": "http://medicinehatnews.com/news/world-news/2017/08/19/spain-france-press-manhunt-for-ringleader-in-dual-attacks/", "sim": 0.95686274766922, "details": {}, "uri": "711888376", "extractedDates": [{"date": "2017-08-19", "textStart": 71, "textEnd": 86, "amb": false}, {"date": "2015-11-", "textStart": 4400, "textEnd": 4413, "amb": false}], "eventUri": "eng-3374007", "image": null, "timeCrawl": "11:56:00", "isDuplicate": false, "dateTime": "2017-08-19T11:56:00Z", "lang": "eng", "title": "Spain, France press manhunt for ringleader in dual attacks", "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "id": 161}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "id": 164}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "id": 203}], "time": "11:56:00", "source": {"uri": "medicinehatnews.com", "title": "Medicine Hat News", "id": "5619"}, "date": "2017-08-19", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19"}

Barcelona on Thursday, killing 13 and injuring 120.\n\nA Canadian was among those killed in the terrorist attack. Ian Moore Wilson was the father of a Vancouver police officer.\n\nEven with Abouyaaquoub still at large, Spanish Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido declared the terrorist cell responsible for the carnage had been effectively \"broken\" after five members were killed by police in a shootout, four were in custody and as many as two were killed in an explosion earlier in the week. He said there was no new imminent threat of attack.\n\nEarly Saturday, police searched two buses in northwest Catalonia. Nothing was found in the searches in Girona and Garrigas, police tweeted.\n\nAcross the Pyrenees, French police carried out extra border checks on people coming from Spain - a routine beefing-up of patrols anytime a neighbouring country flags a potential risk, a French security official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. No arrests were made.\n\nPolice also announced a series of controlled explosions Saturday in the town of Alcanar, south of Barcelona, where the attacks were planned in a rental house destroyed Wednesday by an apparently accidental blast. Authorities had initially written off the incident as a household gas accident, but took another look on Friday and returned on Saturday.\n\nPolice believe the Wednesday night blast prevented a far deadlier attack using explosives, forcing the extremists to use more \"rudimentary\" vehicles instead.\n\nInitially, only one person was believed killed in the blast. But police said tests were underway to determine if human remains found at the house on Friday were from a second victim.\n\nThe Islamic State group initially claimed responsibility for the Barcelona attack. In a new statement Saturday, it also claimed the attack a few hours later in Cambrils, in which five extremists mowed down people along the boardwalk in the seaside resort.\n\nOne woman died and five others were injured in Cambrils before police shot and killed all five attackers. They were armed with an axe, knives and fake explosive belts. The Islamic State statement provided no information beyond what had been previously reported.\n\nAuthorities said the two attacks were related and the work of a large terrorist cell that had been plotting for a long time from the house in Alcanar, 200 kilometres (125 miles) down the coast from Barcelona.\n\nThe name of the lone suspect at large, Abouyaaquoub, figures on a police list of four main suspects sought in the attacks. All the suspects on the list hail from Ripoll, a quiet, upscale town of 10,000 about 100 kilometres north of Barcelona.\n\nOn Friday, police searched the apartment of Ripoll's imam, neighbours said. An apparent search warrant seen by The Associated Press authorized police to extract any terrorism-related \"weapons, ammunition, explosives, instruments, documents or papers\" found in the apartment.\n\nThe suspect list was issued throughout Spain and into France, according to a Spanish official and a French police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the document.\n\nThe French official said Spain had flagged a rented Kangoo utility vehicle that was believed to have been rented in Spain by a suspect in Thursday's attacks that might have crossed the border.\n\nAlso named on the list is 17-year-old Moussa Oukabir, whose brother Driss reported his documents stolen to police in Ripoll. Ripoll's mayor confirmed the documents were found in one of the vehicles used in the attacks.\n\nThe brothers were born and raised in Ripoll, where the family's first-floor apartment was searched Friday. No one was home.\n\nNeighbours said they were shocked by the news of Moussa Oukabir's alleged involvement. One teenager, who identified himself only by his first name, Pau, said they played together when they were younger and he was \"a good boy.\"\n\nIn addition to the five people killed in Cambrils, police said they arrested two people Friday, after the two arrests a day earlier. In custody are three Moroccans and one Spaniard, none with terrorism-related records.\n\n\"We are not talking about a group of one or two people, but rather a numerous group,\" regional Interior Ministry chief Joaquim Forn told Onda Cero radio.\n\nThe sheer size of the cell recalled the November 2015 attacks in Paris, in which trained Islamic State attackers struck the national stadium, a concert hall and bars and restaurants nearly simultaneously. Since then, the extremist group has steadily lost ground in its self-declared caliphate in Iraq and Syria, most recently with its defeat in Mosul.\n\n\"This shows there is no correlation between what is happening over there with Daesh and the operational capacity of the group,\" said Jean-Charles Brisard, a French security analyst, using another name for the group.\n\nSpanish authorities had not yet drawn any direct links between IS extremists and the suspects in the Spanish attacks, but the possibility that members of the Spanish group could still be at large was chilling. Those who have survived prior attacks nearly always ended their lives with new bloodshed and a hail of police bullets.\n\n\"There is the danger they will not let themselves get caught and will do something dramatic,\" said Alain Chouet, a former French intelligence official.\n\nThe attacks unnerved a country that hasn't seen an Islamic extremist attack since 2004, when al-Qaida-inspired bombers killed 191 people in co-ordinated assaults on Madrid's commuter trains. Unlike France, Britain, Sweden and Germany, Spain has largely been spared, thanks in part to a crackdown that has netted about 200 suspected jihadis in recent years.\n\nOn Saturday, Spain decided to maintain its terrorist threat alert at level 4, declaring that no new attacks were imminent. Interior Minister Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido said the country would nevertheless reinforce security for events that draw large crowds and popular tourist sites.\n\nIslamic extremists have targeted Europe's major tourist attractions in recent years. Rented or hijacked vehicles have formed the backbone of a strategy to attack the West and its cultural symbols. Barcelona's Las Ramblas is one of the most popular attractions in a city that swarms with foreign tourists in August.\n\nThe dead and wounded in the two attacks came from 34 countries.", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-3374007", "id": "10063884", "url": "http://www.citynews.ca/2017/08/19/spain-ramps-manhunt-ringleader-dual-attacks/", "sim": 0.9450980424880981, "details": {}, "uri": "711916455", "extractedDates": [{"date": "2015-11-", "textStart": 4759, "textEnd": 4772, "amb": false}], "eventUri": "eng-3374007", "image": "http://www.citynews.ca/wp-content/blogs.dir/sites/10/2017/08/19/16748705.jpg", "timeCrawl": "13:36:00", "isDuplicate": false, "dateTime": "2017-08-19T13:36:00Z", "lang": "eng", "title": "Spain ramps up manhunt for ringleader in dual attacks - CityNews", "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "id": 161}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "id": 164}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "id": 203}], "time": "13:36:00", "source": {"uri": "citynews.ca", "title": "CityNews", "id": "2068"}, "date": "2017-08-19", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19"}

Since then, the extremist group has steadily lost ground in its self-declared caliphate in Iraq and Syria, most recently with its defeat in Mosul.\n\n\"This shows there is no correlation between what is happening over there with Daesh and the operational capacity of the group,\" said Jean-Charles Brisard, a French security analyst, using another name for the group.\n\nSpanish authorities had not yet drawn any direct links between IS extremists and the suspects in the Spanish attacks, but the possibility that members of the Spanish group could still be at large was chilling. Those who have survived prior attacks nearly always ended their lives with new bloodshed and a hail of police bullets.\n\n\"There is the danger they will not let themselves get caught and will do something dramatic,\" said Alain Chouet, a former French intelligence official.\n\nThe attacks unnerved a country that hasn't seen an Islamic extremist attack since 2004, when al-Qaida-inspired bombers killed 191 people in coordinated assaults on Madrid's commuter trains. Unlike France, Britain, Sweden and Germany, Spain has largely been spared, thanks in part to a crackdown that has netted about 200 suspected jihadis in recent years.\n\nOn Saturday, Spain decided to maintain its terrorist threat alert at level 4, declaring that no new attacks were imminent. Interior Minister Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido said the country would nevertheless reinforce security for events that draw large crowds and popular tourist sites.\n\nIslamic extremists have targeted Europe's major tourist attractions in recent years. Rented or hijacked vehicles have formed the backbone of a strategy to attack the West and its cultural symbols. Barcelona's Las Ramblas is one of the most popular attractions in a city that swarms with foreign tourists in August.\n\nThe dead and wounded in the two attacks came from 34 countries.\n\n___\n\nAP writers Angela Charlton in Paris and Nicole Winfield in Rome contributed.", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-3374007", "id": "10061450", "url": "http://hosted2.ap.org/CARIE/0260ea4c3e85456b80715585ba3c7b5b/Article_2017-08-19-EU--Spain-Attacks/id-84576092489e4ca0bc61aac326309c77", "sim": 0.9372549057006836, "details": {}, "uri": "711909591", "extractedDates": [{"date": "2015-11-", "textStart": 4660, "textEnd": 4673, "amb": false}], "eventUri": "eng-3374007", "image": "http://hosted2.ap.org/CBImages/?media=photo&contentId=cf56ab905ada4bfbaedf30674c8f9d36&fmt=jpg&Role=Preview&reldt=2017-08-19T12:22:07GMT&authToken=eNoNwbkNwDAIAMCJkIz4Cw%2bDHyR3KVN4%2bOTu7rcrKbkTsmj7ofmdp88SzRENJFcCjxqQexVQU%2bPpFYv0nqcDChoHo8UHObsU%2bA%3d%3d", "timeCrawl": "13:12:00", "isDuplicate": false, "dateTime": "2017-08-19T12:48:00Z", "lang": "eng", "title": "Spain, France press manhunt for ringleader in dual attacks", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "id": 161}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "id": 164}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "id": 203}], "time": "12:48:00", "source": {"uri": "hosted2.ap.org", "title": "Associated Press", "id": "566"}, "date": "2017-08-19", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19"}

hell let loose'\n\nAuthorities in Spain and France are pressing ahead with their search for the supposed ringleader of an Islamic extremist cell that carried out vehicle attacks in Barcelona and the seaside resort of Cambrils, as the investigation focused on links among the Moroccan members and the house where they plotted the carnage.\n\nCatalan police said the manhunt was centred on Younes Abouyaaquoub, a 22-year-old Moroccan suspected of driving the van that plowed into a promenade packed with pedestrians in Barcelona on Thursday, killing 13 and injuring 120.\n\nEven with Abouyaaquoub still at large, Spanish Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido declared that the terrorist cell responsible for the carnage had been effectively \"broken\" after five members were killed by police in a shootout, four were in custody, and as many as two were killed in an explosion earlier in the week.\n\nHe said there was no new imminent threat of attack.\n\nEarly Saturday, police searched two buses in northwest Catalonia. Nothing was found in the searches in Girona and Garrigas, police tweeted.\n\nAcross the Pyrenees, French police carried out extra border checks on people coming from Spain -- a routine beefing-up of patrols any time a neighbouring country flags a potential risk, a French security official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. No arrests were made.\n\nPolice also announced a series of controlled explosions Saturday in the town of Alcanar, south of Barcelona, where the attacks were planned in a rental house destroyed Wednesday by an apparently accidental blast. Authorities had initially written off the incident as a household gas accident, but took another look on Friday and returned on Saturday.\n\nPolice believe the Wednesday night blast prevented a far deadlier attack using explosives, forcing the extremists to use more \"rudimentary\" vehicles instead.\n\nInitially, only one person was believed killed in the blast. But police said tests were underway to determine if human remains found at the house on Friday were from a second victim.\n\nThe Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) initially claimed responsibility for the Barcelona attack, which took place on the city's famed Las Ramblas. In a new statement Saturday, it also claimed the attack a few hours later in Cambrils, in which five extremists mowed down people along the boardwalk in the seaside resort.\n\nOne woman died and five others were injured in Cambrils before police shot and killed all five attackers. They were armed with an axe, knives and fake explosives belts. The ISIS statement provided no information beyond what had been previously reported.\n\nAuthorities said the two attacks were related and the work of a large terrorist cell that had been plotting for a long time from the house in Alcanar, 200 kilometres down the coast from Barcelona.\n\nThe name of the lone suspect at large, Abouyaaquoub, figures on a police list of four main suspects sought in the attacks. All the suspects on the list hail from Ripoll, a quiet, upscale town of 10,000 about 100 kilometres north of Barcelona.\n\nOn Friday, police searched the apartment of Ripoll's imam, neighbours said.\n\nThe suspect list was issued throughout Spain and into France, according to a Spanish official and a French police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe French official said Spain had flagged a rented Kangoo utility vehicle that was believed to have been rented in Spain by a suspect in Thursday's attacks that might have crossed the border.\n\nAlso named on the list is 17-year-old Moussa Oukabir, whose brother, Driss, reported his documents stolen to police in Ripoll. Ripoll's mayor confirmed the documents were found in one of the vehicles used in the attacks.\n\nThe brothers were born and raised in Ripoll, where the family's first-floor apartment was searched Friday. No one was home.\n\nNeighbours said they were shocked by the news of Moussa Oukabir's alleged involvement. One teenager, who identified himself only by his first name, Pau, said they played together when they were younger and he was \"a good boy.\"\n\nIn addition to the five people killed in Cambrils, police said they arrested two people Friday, after the two arrests a day earlier. In custody are three Moroccans and one Spaniard, none with terrorism-related records.\n\n\"We are not talking about a group of one or two people, but rather a numerous group,\" regional Interior Ministry chief Joaquim Forn told Onda Cero radio.\n\nThe sheer size of the cell recalled the November 2015 attacks in Paris, in which trained ISIS attackers struck the national stadium, a concert hall, and bars and restaurants nearly simultaneously. Since then, the extremist group has steadily lost ground in its self-declared caliphate in Iraq and Syria, most recently with its defeat in Mosul.\n\n\"This shows there is no correlation between what is happening over there with Daesh and the operational capacity of the group,\" said Jean-Charles Brisard, a French security analyst, using another name for the group.\n\nSpanish authorities had not yet drawn any direct links between ISIS extremists and the suspects in the Spanish attacks, but the possibility that members of the Spanish group could still be at large was chilling.

supposed ringleader of an Islamic extremist cell that carried out vehicle attacks in Barcelona and a seaside resort, as the investigation focused on links among the Moroccan members and the house where they plotted the carnage.\n\nCatalan police said the manhunt was centered on Younes Abouyaaquoub, a 22-year-old Moroccan suspected of being the driver of the van that plowed into a promenade packed with pedestrians in Barcelona on Thursday, killing 13 and injuring 120.\n\nEven with Abouyaaquoub still at large, Spanish Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido declared the terrorist cell responsible for the carnage had been effectively \"broken\" after five members were killed by police in a shootout, four were in custody and as many as two were killed in an explosion earlier in the week. He said there was no new imminent threat of attack.\n\nEarly Saturday, police searched two buses in northwest Catalonia. Nothing was found in the searches in Girona and Garrigas, police tweeted.\n\nAcross the Pyrenees, French police carried out extra border checks on people coming from Spain - a routine beefing-up of patrols anytime a neighboring country flags a potential risk, a French security official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. No arrests were made.\n\nPolice also announced a series of controlled explosions Saturday in the town of Alcanar, south of Barcelona, where the attacks were planned in a rental house destroyed Wednesday by an apparently accidental blast. Authorities had initially written off the incident as a household gas accident, but took another look on Friday and returned on Saturday.\n\nPolice believe the Wednesday night blast prevented a far deadlier attack using explosives, forcing the extremists to use more \"rudimentary\" vehicles instead.\n\nInitially, only one person was believed killed in the blast. But police said tests were underway to determine if human remains found at the house on Friday were from a second victim.\n\nThe Islamic State group initially claimed responsibility for the Barcelona attack. In a new statement Saturday, it also claimed the attack a few hours later in Cambrils, in which five extremists mowed down people along the boardwalk in the seaside resort.\n\nOne woman died and five others were injured in Cambrils before police shot and killed all five attackers. They were armed with an axe, knives and fake explosive belts. The Islamic State statement provided no information beyond what had been previously reported.\n\nAuthorities said the two attacks were related and the work of a large terrorist cell that had been plotting for a long time from the house in Alcanar, 200 kilometers (125 miles) down the coast from Barcelona.\n\nThe name of the lone suspect at large, Abouyaaquoub, figures on a police list of four main suspects sought in the attacks. All the suspects on the list hail from Ripoll, a quiet, upscale town of 10,000 about 100 kilometers north of Barcelona.\n\nOn Friday, police searched the apartment of Ripoll's imam, neighbors said. An apparent search warrant seen by The Associated Press authorized police to extract any terrorism-related \"weapons, ammunition, explosives, instruments, documents or papers\" found in the apartment.\n\nThe suspect list was issued throughout Spain and into France, according to a Spanish official and a French police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the document.\n\nThe French official said Spain had flagged a rented Kangoo utility vehicle that was believed to have been rented in Spain by a suspect in Thursday's attacks that might have crossed the border.\n\nAlso named on the list is 17-year-old Moussa Oukabir, whose brother Driss reported his documents stolen to police in Ripoll. Ripoll's mayor confirmed the documents were found in one of the vehicles used in the attacks.\n\nThe brothers were born and raised in Ripoll, where the family's first-floor apartment was searched Friday. No one was home.\n\nNeighbors said they were shocked by the news of Moussa Oukabir's alleged involvement. One teenager, who identified himself only by his first name, Pau, said they played together when they were younger and he was \"a good boy.\"\n\nIn addition to the five people killed in Cambrils, police said they arrested two people Friday, after the two arrests a day earlier. In custody are three Moroccans and one Spaniard, none with terrorism-related records.\n\n\"We are not talking about a group of one or two people, but rather a numerous group,\" regional Interior Ministry chief Joaquim Forn told Onda Cero radio.\n\nThe sheer size of the cell recalled the November 2015 attacks in Paris, in which trained Islamic State attackers struck the national stadium, a concert hall and bars and restaurants nearly simultaneously. Since then, the extremist group has steadily lost ground in its self-declared caliphate in Iraq and Syria, most recently with its defeat in Mosul.\n\n\"This shows there is no correlation between what is happening over there with Daesh and the operational capacity of the group,\" said Jean-Charles Brisard, a French security analyst, using another name for the group.\n\nSpanish authorities had not yet drawn any direct links between IS extremists and the suspects in the Spanish attacks, but the possibility that members of the Spanish group could still be at large was chilling. Those who have survived prior attacks nearly always ended their lives with new bloodshed and a hail of police bullets.\n\n\"There is the danger they will not let themselves get caught and will do something dramatic,\" said Alain Chouet, a former French intelligence official.\n\nThe attacks unnerved a country that hasn't seen an Islamic extremist attack since 2004, when al-Qaida-inspired bombers killed 191 people in coordinated assaults on Madrid's commuter trains. Unlike France, Britain, Sweden and Germany, Spain has largely been spared, thanks in part to a crackdown that has netted about 200 suspected jihadis in recent years.\n\nOn Saturday, Spain decided to maintain its terrorist threat alert at level 4, declaring that no new attacks were imminent. Interior Minister Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido said the country would nevertheless reinforce security for events that draw large crowds and popular tourist sites.\n\nIslamic extremists have targeted Europe's major tourist attractions in recent years. Rented or hijacked vehicles have formed the backbone of a strategy to attack the West and its cultural symbols. Barcelona's Las Ramblas is one of the most popular attractions in a city that swarms with foreign tourists in August.\n\nThe dead and wounded in the two attacks came from 34 countries.\n\n___\n\nAP writers Angela Charlton in Paris and Nicole Winfield in Rome contributed.\n\nPublished: August 19, 2017 \u00e2\u0080\" 7:22 AM EDT | Updated: August 19, 2017 \u00e2\u0080\" 7:48 AM EDT\n\nThanks for your continued support...\n\nWe recently asked you to support our journalism.

extremist cell that staged vehicle attacks in Barcelona and a seaside resort, focusing on links with his Moroccan comrades, a missing imam believed to have radicalized them and a house that blew up days ago.\n\nCatalan police said the manhunt was centered on Younes Abouyaaquoub, a 22-year-old Moroccan suspected of driving the van that plowed into a Barcelona promenade packed with pedestrians Thursday, killing 13 people and injuring 120. Another attack early Friday killed one person and wounded five in the resort of Cambrils.\n\nBut the investigation was also focusing on a Moroccan imam who is thought to have radicalized the cell and was believed to have died on the eve of the Barcelona attack, police said.\n\nEven with Abouyaaquoub still at large, Spanish Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido declared the cell \"broken\" after five members were killed by police early Friday in a shootout, four were in custody and one or two were killed in a house explosion Wednesday. He said there was no new imminent threat of attack.\n\nThe manhunt spanned Spain and southern France, with Spanish police searching nine homes in the northeastern town of Ripoll, where most of the suspects lived, and two buses in northwest Catalonia.\n\nAcross the Pyrenees, French police carried out extra border checks on people coming from Spain.\n\nPolice also conducted a series of controlled explosions Saturday in the town of Alcanar, south of Barcelona, where the attacks were planned in a rental house that was destroyed Wednesday by an apparently accidental blast. Authorities had initially thought it was a household gas accident, but took another look Friday and returned on Saturday.\n\nInitially, only one person was believed killed in the Wednesday blast. But officials said DNA tests were underway to determine if human remains found there Friday were from a second victim.\n\nA police official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said investigators believed a Moroccan imam, Abdelbaki Es Satty, might have been the second victim of the house explosion.\n\nPolice on Friday searched his home in the northern town of Ripoll. A search warrant seen by The Associated Press authorized police to extract any terrorism-related \"weapons, ammunition, explosives, instruments, documents or papers\" found.\n\nEs Satty wasn't there, and the president of the mosque where he preached, Ali Yassine, said he hadn't seen him since June, when he announced he was returning to Morocco for three months.\n\nIn a notice Saturday posted on that Ripoll mosque, members of the Muslim community denounced the vehicle attacks and offered their sympathy to the families of the victims.\n\nThe Islamic State group initially claimed responsibility for the Barcelona attack.

The royal couple talked with one family in which two children and their father were recovering.\n\nThe 14 people killed in the attacked spanned generations -- from age 3 to age 80 -- and leave behind devastated loved ones.\n\nThey included Francisco Lopez Rodriguez, 57, who was killed with his 3-year-old grand-nephew, Javier Martinez, while walking along the Las Ramblas promenade.

extremist cell that staged vehicle attacks in Barcelona and a seaside resort, focusing on links with his Moroccan comrades, a missing imam believed to have radicalized them and a house that blew up days ago.\n\nCatalan police said the manhunt was centered on Younes Abouyaaquoub, a 22-year-old Moroccan suspected of driving the van that plowed into a Barcelona promenade packed with pedestrians Thursday, killing 13 people and injuring 120. Another attack early Friday killed one person and wounded five in the resort of Cambrils.\n\nBut the investigation was also focusing on a Moroccan imam who is thought to have radicalized the cell and was believed to have died on the eve of the Barcelona attack, police said.\n\nEven with Abouyaaquoub still at large, Spanish Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido declared the cell \"broken\" after five members were killed by police early Friday in a shootout, four were in custody and one or two were killed in a house explosion Wednesday. He said there was no new imminent threat of attack.\n\nThe manhunt spanned Spain and southern France, with Spanish police searching nine homes in the northeastern town of Ripoll, where most of the suspects lived, and two buses in northwest Catalonia.\n\nAcross the Pyrenees, French police carried out extra border checks on people coming from Spain.\n\nPolice also conducted a series of controlled explosions Saturday in the town of Alcanar, south of Barcelona, where the attacks were planned in a rental house that was destroyed Wednesday by an apparently accidental blast. Authorities had initially thought it was a household gas accident, but took another look Friday and returned on Saturday.\n\nInitially, only one person was believed killed in the Wednesday blast. But officials said DNA tests were underway to determine if human remains found there Friday were from a second victim.\n\nA police official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said investigators believed a Moroccan imam, Abdelbaki Es Satty, might have been the second victim of the house explosion.\n\nPolice on Friday searched his home in the northern town of Ripoll. A search warrant seen by The Associated Press authorized police to extract any terrorism-related \"weapons, ammunition, explosives, instruments, documents or papers\" found.\n\nEs Satty wasn't there, and the president of the mosque where he preached, Ali Yassine, said he hadn't seen him since June, when he announced he was returning to Morocco for three months.\n\nIn a notice Saturday posted on that Ripoll mosque, members of the Muslim community denounced the vehicle attacks and offered their sympathy to the families of the victims.\n\nThe Islamic State group initially claimed responsibility for the Barcelona attack. In a new statement Saturday, it also claimed the attack early Friday in Cambrils, in which five extremists mowed down people along the boardwalk before police killed them.\n\nAuthorities said the two attacks were related and were the work of a large terrorist cell that had been plotting for a long time from the house in Alcanar, 200 kilometers (125 miles) down the coast from Barcelona.\n\nThe name of the lone suspect at large, Abouyaaquoub, figures on a police list of four main suspects sought in the attacks. All on the list hailed from Ripoll, a quiet, upscale town of 10,000 about 100 kilometers (62 miles) north of Barcelona.\n\nThe list was issued throughout Spain and into France, according to a Spanish official and a French police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the document.\n\nThe French official said Spain had also flagged a Kangoo utility vehicle that was believed to have been rented in Spain by a suspect in Thursday's Barcelona attack that might have crossed the border.\n\nAlso named on the list is 17-year-old Moussa Oukabir, whose brother Driss reported his documents stolen to police in Ripoll. Ripoll's mayor confirmed the documents were found in one of the vehicles used in the attacks.\n\nThe brothers were born and raised in Ripoll, where the family's first-floor apartment was searched Friday. No one was home.\n\nNeighbors said they were shocked by the news of Moussa Oukabir's alleged involvement. One teenager, who identified himself only by his first name, Pau, said they played together when they were younger and he was \"a good boy.\"\n\nThe sheer size of the cell recalled the November 2015 attacks in Paris, in which trained Islamic State attackers struck the national stadium, a Paris concert hall and bars and restaurants nearly simultaneously. Since then, the extremist group has steadily lost ground in its self-declared caliphate in Iraq and Syria, most recently with its defeat in Mosul.\n\n\"This shows there is no correlation between what is happening over there with Daesh and the operational capacity of the group,\" said Jean-Charles Brisard, a French security analyst, using another name for the group.\n\nThe attacks unnerved Spain, a country that hasn't seen an Islamic extremist attack since 2004, when al-Qaida-inspired bombers killed 191 people in coordinated assaults on Madrid's commuter trains. Unlike France, Britain, Sweden and Germany, Spain has largely been spared, thanks in part to a crackdown that has netted about 200 suspected jihadis in recent years.\n\nBut Spain decided to maintain its terrorist threat alert at level 4, declaring Saturday that no new attacks were imminent. Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido said the country would nevertheless reinforce security for events that draw large crowds - like concerts and sports events - and popular tourist sites.\n\nIslamic extremists have made a habit of targeting Europe's major tourist attractions in recent years. Rented or hijacked vehicles have formed the backbone of a strategy to attack the West and its cultural symbols. Barcelona's Las Ramblas promanade, which was struck Thursday, is one of the most popular attractions in a city that swarms with foreign tourists in August.\n\nThe dead and wounded in the two attacks came from 34 countries. The Catalan emergency service said 54 people remained hospitalized Saturday, 12 of them in critical condition.\n\nSpain's King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia visited attack victims Saturday and spoke with the medical staff of Barcelona's Hospital del Mar. The royal couple talked with one family in which two children and their father were recovering.\n\nThe 14 people killed in the attacked spanned generations - from age 3 to age 80 - and leave behind devastated loved ones.\n\nThey included Francisco Lopez Rodriguez, 57, who was killed with his 3-year-old grand-nephew, Javier Martinez, while walking along the Las Ramblas promenade. His wife Roser is recovering from her wounds in a hospital.\n\n\"We are a broken family,\" niece Raquel Baron Lopez posted on Twitter.\n\n___\n\nAP writers Angela Charlton in Paris and Nicole Winfield in Rome contributed.\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Since then, the extremist group has steadily lost ground in its self-declared caliphate in Iraq and Syria, most recently with its defeat in Mosul.\n\n\"This shows there is no correlation between what is happening over there with Daesh and the operational capacity of the group,\" said Jean-Charles Brisard, a French security analyst, using another name for the group.\n\nThe attacks unnerved Spain, a country that hasn't seen an Islamic extremist attack since 2004, when al-Qaida-inspired bombers killed 191 people in co-ordinated assaults on Madrid's commuter trains. Unlike France, Britain, Sweden and Germany, Spain has largely been spared, thanks in part to a crackdown that has netted about 200 suspected jihadis in recent years.\n\nBut Spain decided to maintain its terrorist threat alert at level 4, declaring Saturday that no new attacks were imminent. Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido said the country would nevertheless reinforce security for events that draw large crowds - like concerts and sports events - and popular tourist sites.\n\nIslamic extremists have made a habit of targeting Europe's major tourist attractions in recent years. Rented or hijacked vehicles have formed the backbone of a strategy to attack the West and its cultural symbols. Barcelona's Las Ramblas promanade, which was struck Thursday, is one of the most popular attractions in a city that swarms with foreign tourists in August.\n\nThe dead and wounded in the two attacks came from 34 countries. The Catalan emergency service said 54 people remained hospitalized Saturday, 12 of them in critical condition.\n\nSpain's King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia visited attack victims Saturday and spoke with the medical staff of Barcelona's Hospital del Mar. The royal couple talked with one family in which two children and their father were recovering.\n\nThe 14 people killed in the attacked spanned generations - from age 3 to age 80 - and leave behind devastated loved ones.\n\nThey included Francisco Lopez Rodriguez, 57, who was killed with his 3-year-old grand-nephew, Javier Martinez, while walking along the Las Ramblas promenade. His wife Roser is recovering from her wounds in a hospital.\n\n\"We are a broken family,\" niece Raquel Baron Lopez posted on Twitter.\n\n___\n\nAP writers Angela Charlton in Paris and Nicole Winfield in Rome contributed.", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-3374007", "id": "10088783", "url": "http://medicinehatnews.com/news/world-news/2017/08/19/police-search-for-spain-van-driver-and-missing-moroccan-imam/", "sim": 0.8352941274642944, "details": {}, "uri": "711982726", "extractedDates": [{"date": "2017-08-19", "textStart": 71, "textEnd": 86, "amb": false}, {"date": "2015-11-", "textStart": 4516, "textEnd": 4529, "amb": false}], "eventUri": "eng-3374007", "image": null, "timeCrawl": "17:22:00", "isDuplicate": false, "dateTime": "2017-08-19T17:22:00Z", "lang": "eng", "title": "Police search for Spain van driver and missing Moroccan imam", "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "id": 161}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "id": 164}], "time": "17:22:00", "source": {"uri": "medicinehatnews.com", "title": "Medicine Hat News", "id": "5619"}, "date": "2017-08-19", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19"}

cell that staged vehicle attacks in Barcelona and a seaside resort, focusing on links with his Moroccan comrades, a missing imam believed to have radicalized them and a house that blew up days ago.\n\nCatalan police said the manhunt was centred on Younes Abouyaaquoub, a 22-year-old Moroccan suspected of driving the van that plowed into a Barcelona promenade packed with pedestrians Thursday, killing 13 people and injuring 120. Another attack early Friday killed one person and wounded five in the resort of Cambrils.\n\nBut the investigation was also focusing on a Moroccan imam who is thought to have radicalized the cell and was believed to have died on the eve of the Barcelona attack, police said.\n\nEven with Abouyaaquoub still at large, Spanish Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido declared the cell \"broken\" after five members were killed by police early Friday in a shootout, four were in custody and one or two were killed in a house explosion Wednesday. He said there was no new imminent threat of attack.\n\nThe manhunt spanned Spain and southern France, with Spanish police searching nine homes in the northeastern town of Ripoll, where most of the suspects lived, and two buses in northwest Catalonia.\n\nAcross the Pyrenees, French police carried out extra border checks on people coming from Spain.\n\nPolice also conducted a series of controlled explosions Saturday in the town of Alcanar, south of Barcelona, where the attacks were planned in a rental house that was destroyed Wednesday by an apparently accidental blast. Authorities had initially thought it was a household gas accident, but took another look Friday and returned on Saturday.\n\nInitially, only one person was believed killed in the Wednesday blast. But officials said DNA tests were underway to determine if human remains found there Friday were from a second victim.\n\nA police official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said investigators believed a Moroccan imam, Abdelbaki Es Satty, might have been the second victim of the house explosion.\n\nPolice on Friday searched his home in the northern town of Ripoll. A search warrant seen by The Associated Press authorized police to extract any terrorism-related \"weapons, ammunition, explosives, instruments, documents or papers\" found.\n\nEs Satty wasn't there, and the president of the mosque where he preached, Ali Yassine, said he hadn't seen him since June, when he announced he was returning to Morocco for three months.\n\nIn a notice Saturday posted on that Ripoll mosque, members of the Muslim community denounced the vehicle attacks and offered their sympathy to the families of the victims.\n\nThe Islamic State group initially claimed responsibility for the Barcelona attack. In a new statement Saturday, it also claimed the attack early Friday in Cambrils, in which five extremists mowed down people along the boardwalk before police killed them.\n\nAuthorities said the two attacks were related and were the work of a large terrorist cell that had been plotting for a long time from the house in Alcanar, 200 kilometres (125 miles) down the coast from Barcelona.\n\nThe name of the lone suspect at large, Abouyaaquoub, figures on a police list of four main suspects sought in the attacks. All on the list hailed from Ripoll, a quiet, upscale town of 10,000 about 100 kilometres (62 miles) north of Barcelona.\n\nThe list was issued throughout Spain and into France, according to a Spanish official and a French police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the document.\n\nThe French official said Spain had also flagged a Kangoo utility vehicle that was believed to have been rented in Spain by a suspect in Thursday's Barcelona attack that might have crossed the border.\n\nAlso named on the list is 17-year-old Moussa Oukabir, whose brother Driss reported his documents stolen to police in Ripoll. Ripoll's mayor confirmed the documents were found in one of the vehicles used in the attacks.\n\nThe brothers were born and raised in Ripoll, where the family's first-floor apartment was searched Friday. No one was home.\n\nNeighbours said they were shocked by the news of Moussa Oukabir's alleged involvement. One teenager, who identified himself only by his first name, Pau, said they played together when they were younger and he was \"a good boy.\"\n\nThe sheer size of the cell recalled the November 2015 attacks in Paris, in which trained Islamic State attackers struck the national stadium, a Paris concert hall and bars and restaurants nearly simultaneously. Since then, the extremist group has steadily lost ground in its self-declared caliphate in Iraq and Syria, most recently with its defeat in Mosul.\n\n\"This shows there is no correlation between what is happening over there with Daesh and the operational capacity of the group,\" said Jean-Charles Brisard, a French security analyst, using another name for the group.\n\nThe attacks unnerved Spain, a country that hasn't seen an Islamic extremist attack since 2004, when al-Qaida-inspired bombers killed 191 people in co-ordinated assaults on Madrid's commuter trains. Unlike France, Britain, Sweden and Germany, Spain has largely been spared, thanks in part to a crackdown that has netted about 200 suspected jihadis in recent years.\n\nBut Spain decided to maintain its terrorist threat alert at level 4, declaring Saturday that no new attacks were imminent. Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido said the country would nevertheless reinforce security for events that draw large crowds -- like concerts and sports events -- and popular tourist sites.\n\nIslamic extremists have made a habit of targeting Europe's major tourist attractions in recent years. Rented or hijacked vehicles have formed the backbone of a strategy to attack the West and its cultural symbols. Barcelona's Las Ramblas promanade, which was struck Thursday, is one of the most popular attractions in a city that swarms with foreign tourists in August.\n\nThe dead and wounded in the two attacks came from 34 countries. The Catalan emergency service said 54 people remained hospitalized Saturday, 12 of them in critical condition.\n\nSpain's King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia visited attack victims Saturday and spoke with the medical staff of Barcelona's Hospital del Mar. The royal couple talked with one family in which two children and their father were recovering.\n\nThe 14 people killed in the attacked spanned generations -- from age 3 to age 80 -- and leave behind devastated loved ones.\n\nThey included Francisco Lopez Rodriguez, 57, who was killed with his 3-year-old grand-nephew, Javier Martinez, while walking along the Las Ramblas promenade. His wife Roser is recovering from her wounds in a hospital.\n\n\"We are a broken family,\" niece Raquel Baron Lopez posted on Twitter.\n\n___\n\nAP writers Angela Charlton in Paris and Nicole Winfield in Rome contributed.", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-3374007", "id": "10087237", "url": "http://www.timescolonist.com/police-search-for-spain-van-driver-and-missing-moroccan-imam-1.22017121", "sim": 0.8117647171020508, "details": {}, "uri": "711978123", "extractedDates": [{"date": "2015-11-", "textStart": 4428, "textEnd": 4441, "amb": false}], "eventUri": "eng-3374007", "image": "http://images.glaciermedia.ca/polopoly_fs/1.22017122.1503162356!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/facebookogimage_560_292/em104-819-2017-052153-jpg.jpg", "timeCrawl": "17:08:00", "isDuplicate": false, "dateTime": "2017-08-19T17:08:00Z", "lang": "eng", "title": "Police search for Spain van driver and missing Moroccan imam", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "id": 161}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "id": 164}], "time": "17:08:00", "source": {"uri": "timescolonist.com", "title": "Times Colonist", "id": "1066"}, "date": "2017-08-19", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19"}

people, including small children, have created a human tower among the crowds visiting the attack site on Barcelona's Las Ramblas promenade in homage to the victims.\n\nThe performance Saturday was greeted by strong applause when a young child with a protective helmet on climbed over his colleagues to reach the top of the multi-level tower.\n\nBuilding human towers, or castells, are a very popular cultural event in many town festivals in Catalonia and date back to the 18th century.\n\nTeams compete to build the tallest and most complex towers. A castell is considered successful when it is built and taken apart without anyone falling.\n\nSpain's king and queen have paid a somber visit to the Las Ramblas attack site in Barcelona, placing a wreath and two candles on the ground in memory of the victims.\n\nKing Felipe VI and Queen Letizia were accompanied Saturday by Catalan regional President Carles Puigdemont and Barcelona Mayor Ada Colau. As he left, the king shook hands with bystanders. Shouts of \"Long live the king!\" and others for Spain, Catalonia and Barcelona could be heard.\n\nEarlier, the royal couple met with victims hospitalized after Thursday's van attack -- including one family in which two children and their father were recovering -- and spoke with the medical staff at Barcelona's Hospital del Mar.\n\nCatalonia's emergency services said by Saturday night, 53 attack victims remained in the hospital, with 13 of them in critical condition.\n\nThe families of a group of young men in northern Spain who are attack suspects are denouncing terrorism.\n\nThe families from Ripoll, where the entire Islamic State cell behind the deadly attacks in Barcelona and a seaside town is believed to have originated, arrived in a group Saturday in the town's central square. Mothers and sisters tearfully insisted they did not know what had happened to their sons and brothers.\n\nPolice on Saturday searched the home of a missing imam who is believed to have been the group's ideological leader. The imam hasn't been seen in Ripoll since June, according to the mosque where he abruptly quit his job.\n\nAn official with knowledge of the investigation said authorities are looking into whether the imam was killed Wednesday in a botched bomb-making operation in a house south of Barcelona.\n\nA police official in Spain says an imam whose home was searched as part of the investigation into two deadly vehicle attacks is believed to be the radicalizing force behind the cell of young men -- and is now thought to have died in an explosion linked to the attacks.\n\nThe official spoke on condition of anonymity to reveal details of the new suspicions surrounding imam Abdelbaki Es Satty. Officials in Es Satty's former mosque in the northern town of Ripoll, which he left abruptly in June, on Saturday denounced the attacks in Barcelona and a nearby seaside town.\n\nThe mosque president, Ali Yassine, said Es Satty told him he wanted to return to Morocco for three months and hasn't seen him since. The police official says Es Satty is believed to have died in an explosion Wednesday that destroyed a house south of Barcelona.\n\nThe two vehicle attacks in Spain left 14 dead and over 120 wounded. Possible suspects whose names have emerged so far in the investigation are all from Ripoll.\n\nThe Muslim community in the northern Spanish town of Ripoll has condemned the two deadly vehicle attacks that have been blamed on some local Moroccans.\n\nIn a notice posted on a Ripoll mosque Saturday, the Annour Islamic Community of Ripoll said it wanted to offer its sympathy to the families of the victims and its solidarity with Barcelona, Catalonia and Spain.\n\nIt said: \"Faced with this criminal act, the Annour Islamic Community of Ripoll reiterates its complete commitment to the fight against any form of terrorism, and we hope that those responsible for this attack are arrested and taken before a judge as soon as possible.\"\n\nMost of the main suspects in the twin attacks were Moroccans from Ripoll. The attacks in Barcelona and the seaside resort of Cambrils left 14 people dead and over 120 injured.\n\nCatalan emergency services say they have identified seven of the 14 people killed in the attacks in Barcelona and the nearby seaside town of Cambrils.\n\nOf the 13 dead from the Barcelona attack, officials have identified four Spaniards, two Portuguese and one Italian. Family members or government officials also say an American man, another Italian man and a woman from Belgium were also killed there.\n\nThe one fatality from the attack in Cambrils was a Spanish woman.\n\nThe emergency service says Saturday that 54 people remained in the hospital, 12 of them in critical condition. They say 78 people have been released after being treated.\n\nExcavation work is continuing at a house south of Barcelona where, according to Spanish police, members of an Islamic extremist cell plotted their attacks.\n\nThe deputy mayor of Alcanar, Jordi Bort, says police are trying to determine if any explosives were still in the house, and to secure them through controlled explosions.\n\nThe house was effectively destroyed on Wednesday during an accidental explosion. Authorities had initially dismissed the blast as a household gas accident, but now say it appears to be related to the plans for an even more deadly attack involving gas or explosives.\n\nOne person was killed during the Wednesday blast. Bort says police are also looking to determine if human remains found at the site belong to a second victim. Bort says so far positive identification hasn't been possible because DNA results haven't come in yet.\n\nMuslims in the hometown of suspects arrested over last week's attacks in Spain have expressed their condolences to the victims.\n\nIn a note posted Saturday on the door of the mosque in Ripoll, a quiet, upscale town of 10,000 about 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of Barcelona, the community said it condemned the attack.\n\nIt said \"The Annour Islamic Community of Ripoll expresses its strongest condemnation and rejection of the terrorist attack committed on Thursday in Barcelona.\n\n\"Catalan Muslims express their sympathy for the families of the victims, wishing for the complete recovery of the injured, and offering their solidarity with the people of Barcelona, Catalonia and Spain.\n\n\"Faced with this criminal act, the Annour Islamic Community of Ripoll reiterates its complete commitment to the fight against any form of terrorism, and we hope that those responsible for this attack are arrested and taken before a judge as soon as possible.\"\n\nSpain's king and queen have visited the victims of the van attack in Barcelona who are recovering in local hospitals.\n\nA video posted on the Royal House Twitter account shows King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia visiting patients and speaking with the medical staff of Barcelona's Hospital del Mar.\n\nThe royal couple visited one family in which two children and their father were recovering from wounds received when a van plowed down the city's main pedestrian promenade, killing 13 people and injuring 120 on Thursday.\n\nA separate car attack a few hours later in the nearby coastal town of Cambrils killed one person and injured five early Friday.\n\nCatalonia's emergency services say by Saturday, 54 people remained in the hospital, with 12 of them in critical condition, from both attacks.\n\nCatalan police are confirming that the manhunt underway for any remaining members of the Islamic extremist cell is focusing on Younes Abouyaaquoub, a 22-year-old Moroccan.\n\nPolice spokesman Albert Oliva says police have carried out nine searches of apartments in Ripoll, the northern Catalan town where Abouyaaquoub and other suspects lived.\n\nOliva said Saturday: \"We can confirm that the manhunt is on for the person\" identified in the media. Spanish media have named Abouyaaquoub as the presumed ringleader of the cell and driver of the van that plowed into pedestrians in Barcelona.\n\nSpanish Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido has declared that the cell was effectively broken after five members were killed, four were in detention and as many as two were killed in a previous explosion. That leaves only one remaining member: Abouyaaquoub.\n\nItaly's foreign ministry is confirming a third Italian was killed in the dual attacks in Spain.\n\nThe ministry said in a statement Saturday that Carmen Lopardo, 80, was killed in the \"vile terrorist attack in Barcelona.\"\n\nNews reports said Lopardo had immigrated to Argentina in 1950 and was visiting Barcelona.\n\nTwo other Italians were among the 14 dead: Bruno Gulotta, 35, and Luca Russo, 25.\n\nA small group of Muslims have gathered at Barcelona's Las Ramblas promenade to insist they aren't terrorists in the wake of the twin vehicle attacks that killed 14 people and injured dozens.\n\nThe protest by about 100 members of Barcelona's Muslim community was held at the Canaletas Fountain at the top of the promenade.\n\nThey shouted \"We are not terrorists\" and \"Islam is peace.\"\n\nCatalan's Moroccan community, in particular, has been in the spotlight after the four main suspects in the attacks claimed Moroccan roots.\n\nPortugal's prime minister says a 20-year-old woman from Lisbon is among those killed in the Barcelona attacks.\n\nThe woman, whose 74-year-old grandmother was also killed in Thursday's attack on Las Ramblas, had initially been considered missing but Prime Minister Antonio Costa confirmed her death in a statement to reporters Saturday.\n\nPortuguese media reported that the two were in Barcelona to celebrate the grandmother's birthday. Their names were not released.\n\nThe two Portuguese women are among 14 people killed in car attacks on Barcelona and the town of Cambrils, as part of what authorities call a terrorist plot claimed by the Islamic State group.\n\nSpanish authorities have decided to maintain the country's terrorist threat rating at level 4, declaring that no new attacks were imminent.\n\nInterior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido says Saturday that the country would nevertheless reinforce security for events that draw large crowds and popular tourist sites.\n\nFrench police are carrying out extra border checks on people arriving from Spain as authorities search for a fugitive suspect in the Barcelona attacks.\n\nNo arrests had been made by Saturday morning, according to a French security official, who described the checks along the normally open border as routine whenever neighboring countries signal a potential risk.\n\nAnother French security official said Spanish authorities flagged a Kangoo utility vehicle believed to have been rented in Spain by a suspect in Thursday's attacks and that may have crossed the nearby border into France.\n\nBoth officials were not authorized to be publicly named.\n\nAt multiple border posts in the winding roads crossing the western Pyrenees on Saturday, gendarmes stopped certain vehicles to check drivers' IDs and the contents of their cars. They targeted primarily vans, trucks and utility vehicles.\n\nCatalan police say they are carrying out controlled explosions in the town where an extremist cell plotted the attacks in Barcelona and a seaside resort.\n\nIn a tweet Saturday, police urged residents of Alcanar not to be alarmed by the detonations in the town, where they believe the extremists rented a house used to prepare their attacks.\n\nThe house was destroyed by an apparently accidental explosion on Wednesday. Police believe the blast actually prevented a far more deadlier attack using explosives, forcing the extremists to use more \"rudimentary\" vehicles instead.\n\nRepresentatives from the Spanish and Catalan government are meeting to determine the terrorist threat level for the country and its Catalan region, after Barcelona and the southern resort town of Cambrils were hit with terrorist attacks.\n\nFollowing the Thursday afternoon and early Friday morning attacks that killed 14 people and wounded more than a hundred, Spain's threat level is now four on a scale that goes to five, a ranking that would warrant military deployments.\n\nAuthorities say the attacks were the work of a large terrorist cell that had been plotting for a long time from a house in Alcanar, 200 kilometers (124 miles) down the coast from Barcelona.\n\nSenior police official Josep Lluis Trapero said that an apparently accidental butane gas explosion at the house, which killed one person, likely prevented the suspects from carrying out a far deadlier attack.\n\nThe Philippines government says a child missing after a vehicle plowed into pedestrians in Barcelona is the 7-year-old son of a Filipino woman who had been living in Australia.\n\nThe Philippines' Foreign Affairs Undersecretary for Migrant Workers Affairs Sarah Arriola said in a statement on Saturday that the 43-year-old Filipino woman was seriously injured in Thursday's attack. She had been based in Australia for the past three or four years.\n\nArriola says the woman and her son were in Barcelona to attend the wedding of a cousin from the Philippines.\n\nArriola says the woman's British husband is en route to Barcelona to help find his son. Arriola says the boy was separated from his mother during the attack.\n\nAustralia's prime minister has urged people to pray for the child.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has asked people to pray for a young Australian boy who is missing after a vehicle attack on a popular Barcelona promenade that killed 13 people.\n\nTurnbull said Saturday that the boy's mother was badly injured and is in a hospital following Friday's attack at the Las Ramblas promenade. Turnbull says the boy's family is searching for him. He did not release the boy's name.\n\nTurnbull says: \"All of us as parents know the anguish his father is going through, and his whole family is going through, as they rush to seek to find him in Barcelona.\"\n\nAustralian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop says four Australians were injured in the attack.\n\nPolice in Catalonia say they have searched two buses in their hunt for violent extremists believed responsible for a pair of deadly attacks in the northwestern region of Spain.\n\nPolice say on their Twitter feed that they searched the buses in Girona and Garrigas, towns in the northwest of Catalonia, but the operation yielded nothing of importance.

than 20 people, including small children, have created a human tower among the crowds visiting the attack site on Barcelona's Las Ramblas promenade in homage to the victims.\n\nThe performance Saturday was greeted by strong applause when a young child with a protective helmet on climbed over his colleagues to reach the top of the multi-level tower.\n\nBuilding human towers, or castells, are a very popular cultural event in many town festivals in Catalonia and date back to the 18th century.\n\nTeams compete to build the tallest and most complex towers. A castell is considered successful when it is built and taken apart without anyone falling.\n\n-- -- --\n\n8:30 p.m.\n\nSpain's king and queen have paid a somber visit to the Las Ramblas attack site in Barcelona, placing a wreath and two candles on the ground in memory of the victims.\n\nKing Felipe VI and Queen Letizia were accompanied Saturday by Catalan regional President Carles Puigdemont and Barcelona Mayor Ada Colau. As he left, the king shook hands with bystanders. Shouts of \"Long live the king!\" and others for Spain, Catalonia and Barcelona could be heard.\n\nEarlier, the royal couple met with victims hospitalized after Thursday's van attack -- including one family in which two children and their father were recovering -- and spoke with the medical staff at Barcelona's Hospital del Mar.\n\nCatalonia's emergency services said by Saturday night, 53 attack victims remained in the hospital, with 13 of them in critical condition.\n\n-- -- --\n\n7:25 p.m.\n\nThe families of a group of young men in northern Spain who are attack suspects are denouncing terrorism.\n\nThe families from Ripoll, where the entire Islamic State cell behind the deadly attacks in Barcelona and a seaside town is believed to have originated, arrived in a group Saturday in the town's central square. Mothers and sisters tearfully insisted they did not know what had happened to their sons and brothers.\n\nPolice on Saturday searched the home of a missing imam who is believed to have been the group's ideological leader. The imam hasn't been seen in Ripoll since June, according to the mosque where he abruptly quit his job.\n\nAn official with knowledge of the investigation said authorities are looking into whether the imam was killed Wednesday in a botched bomb-making operation in a house south of Barcelona.\n\n-- -- --\n\n5:40 p.m.\n\nA police official in Spain says an imam whose home was searched as part of the investigation into two deadly vehicle attacks is believed to be the radicalizing force behind the cell of young men -- and is now thought to have died in an explosion linked to the attacks.\n\nThe official spoke on condition of anonymity to reveal details of the new suspicions surrounding imam Abdelbaki Es Satty. Officials in Es Satty's former mosque in the northern town of Ripoll, which he left abruptly in June, on Saturday denounced the attacks in Barcelona and a nearby seaside town.\n\nThe mosque president, Ali Yassine, said Es Satty told him he wanted to return to Morocco for three months and hasn't seen him since. The police official says Es Satty is believed to have died in an explosion Wednesday that destroyed a house south of Barcelona.\n\nThe two vehicle attacks in Spain left 14 dead and over 120 wounded. Possible suspects whose names have emerged so far in the investigation are all from Ripoll.\n\n-- By Joseph Wilson, Alex Oller and Lori Hinnant\n\n-- -- --\n\n5:10 p.m.\n\nThe Muslim community in the northern Spanish town of Ripoll has condemned the two deadly vehicle attacks that have been blamed on some local Moroccans.\n\nIn a notice posted on a Ripoll mosque Saturday, the Annour Islamic Community of Ripoll said it wanted to offer its sympathy to the families of the victims and its solidarity with Barcelona, Catalonia and Spain.\n\nIt said: \"Faced with this criminal act, the Annour Islamic Community of Ripoll reiterates its complete commitment to the fight against any form of terrorism, and we hope that those responsible for this attack are arrested and taken before a judge as soon as possible.\"\n\nMost of the main suspects in the twin attacks were Moroccans from Ripoll. The attacks in Barcelona and the seaside resort of Cambrils left 14 people dead and over 120 injured.\n\n-- -- --\n\n4:25 p.m.\n\nCatalan emergency services say they have identified seven of the 14 people killed in the attacks in Barcelona and the nearby seaside town of Cambrils.\n\nOf the 13 dead from the Barcelona attack, officials have identified four Spaniards, two Portuguese and one Italian. Family members or government officials also say an American man, another Italian man and a woman from Belgium were also killed there.\n\nThe one fatality from the attack in Cambrils was a Spanish woman.\n\nThe emergency service says Saturday that 54 people remained in the hospital, 12 of them in critical condition. They say 78 people have been released after being treated.\n\n-- -- --\n\n3:45 p.m.\n\nExcavation work is continuing at a house south of Barcelona where, according to Spanish police, members of an Islamic extremist cell plotted their attacks.\n\nThe deputy mayor of Alcanar, Jordi Bort, says police are trying to determine if any explosives were still in the house, and to secure them through controlled explosions.\n\nThe house was effectively destroyed on Wednesday during an accidental explosion. Authorities had initially dismissed the blast as a household gas accident, but now say it appears to be related to the plans for an even more deadly attack involving gas or explosives.\n\nOne person was killed during the Wednesday blast. Bort says police are also looking to determine if human remains found at the site belong to a second victim. Bort says so far positive identification hasn't been possible because DNA results haven't come in yet.\n\n-- -- --\n\n3:30 p.m.\n\nMuslims in the hometown of suspects arrested over last week's attacks in Spain have expressed their condolences to the victims.\n\nIn a note posted Saturday on the door of the mosque in Ripoll, a quiet, upscale town of 10,000 about 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of Barcelona, the community said it condemned the attack.\n\nIt said \"The Annour Islamic Community of Ripoll expresses its strongest condemnation and rejection of the terrorist attack committed on Thursday in Barcelona.\n\n\"Catalan Muslims express their sympathy for the families of the victims, wishing for the complete recovery of the injured, and offering their solidarity with the people of Barcelona, Catalonia and Spain.\n\n\"Faced with this criminal act, the Annour Islamic Community of Ripoll reiterates its complete commitment to the fight against any form of terrorism, and we hope that those responsible for this attack are arrested and taken before a judge as soon as possible.\"\n\n-- -- --\n\n2:55 p.m.\n\nSpain's king and queen have visited the victims of the van attack in Barcelona who are recovering in local hospitals.\n\nA video posted on the Royal House Twitter account shows King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia visiting patients and speaking with the medical staff of Barcelona's Hospital del Mar.\n\nThe royal couple visited one family in which two children and their father were recovering from wounds received when a van plowed down the city's main pedestrian promenade, killing 13 people and injuring 120 on Thursday.\n\nA separate car attack a few hours later in the nearby coastal town of Cambrils killed one person and injured five early Friday.\n\nCatalonia's emergency services say by Saturday, 54 people remained in the hospital, with 12 of them in critical condition, from both attacks.\n\n-- -- --\n\n2:15 p.m.\n\nCatalan police are confirming that the manhunt underway for any remaining members of the Islamic extremist cell is focusing on Younes Abouyaaquoub, a 22-year-old Moroccan.\n\nPolice spokesman Albert Oliva says police have carried out nine searches of apartments in Ripoll, the northern Catalan town where Abouyaaquoub and other suspects lived.\n\nOliva said Saturday: \"We can confirm that the manhunt is on for the person\" identified in the media. Spanish media have named Abouyaaquoub as the presumed ringleader of the cell and driver of the van that plowed into pedestrians in Barcelona.\n\nSpanish Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido has declared that the cell was effectively broken after five members were killed, four were in detention and as many as two were killed in a previous explosion. That leaves only one remaining member: Abouyaaquoub.\n\n-- -- --\n\n2:00 p.m.\n\nItaly's foreign ministry is confirming a third Italian was killed in the dual attacks in Spain.\n\nThe ministry said in a statement Saturday that Carmen Lopardo, 80, was killed in the \"vile terrorist attack in Barcelona.\"\n\nNews reports said Lopardo had immigrated to Argentina in 1950 and was visiting Barcelona.\n\nTwo other Italians were among the 14 dead: Bruno Gulotta, 35, and Luca Russo, 25.\n\n-- -- --\n\n1:45 p.m.\n\nA small group of Muslims have gathered at Barcelona's Las Ramblas promenade to insist they aren't terrorists in the wake of the twin vehicle attacks that killed 14 people and injured dozens.\n\nThe protest by about 100 members of Barcelona's Muslim community was held at the Canaletas Fountain at the top of the promenade.\n\nThey shouted \"We are not terrorists\" and \"Islam is peace.\"\n\nCatalan's Moroccan community, in particular, has been in the spotlight after the four main suspects in the attacks claimed Moroccan roots.\n\n-- -- --\n\n1:30 p.m.\n\nPortugal's prime minister says a 20-year-old woman from Lisbon is among those killed in the Barcelona attacks.\n\nThe woman, whose 74-year-old grandmother was also killed in Thursday's attack on Las Ramblas, had initially been considered missing but Prime Minister Antonio Costa confirmed her death in a statement to reporters Saturday.\n\nPortuguese media reported that the two were in Barcelona to celebrate the grandmother's birthday. Their names were not released.\n\nThe two Portuguese women are among 14 people killed in car attacks on Barcelona and the town of Cambrils, as part of what authorities call a terrorist plot claimed by the Islamic State group.\n\n-- -- --\n\n1:15 p.m.\n\nSpanish authorities have decided to maintain the country's terrorist threat rating at level 4, declaring that no new attacks were imminent.\n\nInterior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido says Saturday that the country would nevertheless reinforce security for events that draw large crowds and popular tourist sites.\n\n-- -- --\n\n11:45 a.m.\n\nFrench police are carrying out extra border checks on people arriving from Spain as authorities search for a fugitive suspect in the Barcelona attacks.\n\nNo arrests had been made by Saturday morning, according to a French security official, who described the checks along the normally open border as routine whenever neighboring countries signal a potential risk.\n\nAnother French security official said Spanish authorities flagged a Kangoo utility vehicle believed to have been rented in Spain by a suspect in Thursday's attacks and that may have crossed the nearby border into France.\n\nBoth officials were not authorized to be publicly named.\n\nAt multiple border posts in the winding roads crossing the western Pyrenees on Saturday, gendarmes stopped certain vehicles to check drivers' IDs and the contents of their cars. They targeted primarily vans, trucks and utility vehicles.\n\n-- -- --\n\n10 a.m.\n\nCatalan police say they are carrying out controlled explosions in the town where an extremist cell plotted the attacks in Barcelona and a seaside resort.\n\nIn a tweet Saturday, police urged residents of Alcanar not to be alarmed by the detonations in the town, where they believe the extremists rented a house used to prepare their attacks.\n\nThe house was destroyed by an apparently accidental explosion on Wednesday. Police believe the blast actually prevented a far more deadlier attack using explosives, forcing the extremists to use more \"rudimentary\" vehicles instead.\n\n-- -- --\n\n9:30 a.m.\n\nRepresentatives from the Spanish and Catalan government are meeting to determine the terrorist threat level for the country and its Catalan region, after Barcelona and the southern resort town of Cambrils were hit with terrorist attacks.\n\nFollowing the Thursday afternoon and early Friday morning attacks that killed 14 people and wounded more than a hundred, Spain's threat level is now four on a scale that goes to five, a ranking that would warrant military deployments.\n\nAuthorities say the attacks were the work of a large terrorist cell that had been plotting for a long time from a house in Alcanar, 200 kilometers (124 miles) down the coast from Barcelona.\n\nSenior police official Josep Lluis Trapero said that an apparently accidental butane gas explosion at the house, which killed one person, likely prevented the suspects from carrying out a far deadlier attack.\n\n-- -- --\n\n9:15 a.m.\n\nThe Philippines government says a child missing after a vehicle plowed into pedestrians in Barcelona is the 7-year-old son of a Filipino woman who had been living in Australia.\n\nThe Philippines' Foreign Affairs Undersecretary for Migrant Workers Affairs Sarah Arriola said in a statement on Saturday that the 43-year-old Filipino woman was seriously injured in Thursday's attack. She had been based in Australia for the past three or four years.\n\nArriola says the woman and her son were in Barcelona to attend the wedding of a cousin from the Philippines.\n\nArriola says the woman's British husband is en route to Barcelona to help find his son. Arriola says the boy was separated from his mother during the attack.\n\nAustralia's prime minister has urged people to pray for the child.\n\n-- -- --\n\n5:15 a.m.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has asked people to pray for a young Australian boy who is missing after a vehicle attack on a popular Barcelona promenade that killed 13 people.\n\nTurnbull said Saturday that the boy's mother was badly injured and is in a hospital following Friday's attack at the Las Ramblas promenade. Turnbull says the boy's family is searching for him. He did not release the boy's name.\n\nTurnbull says: \"All of us as parents know the anguish his father is going through, and his whole family is going through, as they rush to seek to find him in Barcelona.\"\n\nAustralian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop says four Australians were injured in the attack.\n\n-- -- --\n\n2:35 a.m.\n\nPolice in Catalonia say they have searched two buses in their hunt for violent extremists believed responsible for a pair of deadly attacks in the northwestern region of Spain.\n\nPolice say on their Twitter feed that they searched the buses in Girona and Garrigas, towns in the northwest of Catalonia, but the operation yielded nothing of importance. They provided no further information.\n\nAuthorities launched a manhunt for members of what they believe to be a Catalonia-based extremist group after 14 people were killed and more than 100 injured in attacks in Barcelona on Thursday and in Cambrils, south of Barcelona, on Friday.\n\nOfficials say at least one suspect is still at large.\n\nPolice say they have identified the five people, presumed to be the attackers, shot to death by police in the Cambrils incident but gave no details.\n\nFour people have been arrested as part of the investigation.\n\n-- -- --\n\n12:50 a.m.\n\nSurveillance video from inside a Barcelona museum captured images of the van used in the fatal attack on pedestrians speeding down the Las Ramblas promenade where 13 people were killed and many more were wounded.\n\nThe video shows a person with a stroller just barely getting out of the white van's way and other people on the walkway scattering as it barreled down the walkway.\n\nThe footage was shot Thursday from a security camera inside the Erotic Museum of Barcelona on an upper floor that pointed toward a window with a view of the promenade.\n\nMuseum goers who apparently either heard the van or people outside just after it went by are seen in the images gathering near the window and looking outside.\n\nAuthorities said the assailants after striking in Barcelona drove a second vehicle to the resort town of Cambrils and fatally injured one person early Friday morning.\n\nPolice shot five of those attackers dead.\n\n-- -- --\n\n12:10 a.m. Saturday\n\nPresident Donald Trump has personally offered his condolences to Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy after Thursday's deadly van attacks in Barcelona and Cambrils.\n\nThe White House says Trump pledged to support Spanish authorities in their investigation and in bringing the perpetrators to justice.\n\nTrump initially offered supportive words to Spain in a tweet Thursday after a van plowed through pedestrians in Barcelona. Thirteen people were killed. The State Department says at least one American was killed and one was injured in that attack.\n\nOne person was killed in a separate van attack in Cambrils, Spain\n\nSubscribe", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-3374007", "id": "10102135", "url": "http://www.timesdaily.com/news/nation/the-latest-human-tower-is-built-to-honor-barcelona-victims/article_2bc4dd81-1593-5902-8cc4-ce8106a45b8f.html", "sim": 0.7882353067398071, "details": {}, "uri": "712020800", "extractedDates": null, "eventUri": "eng-3374007", "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/timesdaily.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/81/581499ba-4dd0-5e02-b978-08cf07c6174e/599839ed1f1b4.image.jpg?resize=512%2C341", "timeCrawl": "19:50:00", "isDuplicate": false, "dateTime": "2017-08-19T19:50:00Z", "lang": "eng", "title": "The Latest: Human tower is built to honor Barcelona victims", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "id": 161}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "id": 164}], "time": "19:50:00", "source": {"uri": "timesdaily.com", "title": "TimesDaily", "id": "81"}, "date": "2017-08-19", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19"}

than 20 people, including small children, have created a human tower among the crowds visiting the attack site on Barcelona's Las Ramblas promenade in homage to the victims.\n\nThe performance Saturday was greeted by strong applause when a young child with a protective helmet on climbed over his colleagues to reach the top of the multi-level tower.\n\nBuilding human towers, or castells, are a very popular cultural event in many town festivals in Catalonia and date back to the 18th century.\n\nTeams compete to build the tallest and most complex towers. A castell is considered successful when it is built and taken apart without anyone falling.\n\nSpain's king and queen have paid a somber visit to the Las Ramblas attack site in Barcelona, placing a wreath and two candles on the ground in memory of the victims.\n\nKing Felipe VI and Queen Letizia were accompanied Saturday by Catalan regional President Carles Puigdemont and Barcelona Mayor Ada Colau. As he left, the king shook hands with bystanders. Shouts of \"Long live the king!\" and others for Spain, Catalonia and Barcelona could be heard.\n\nEarlier, the royal couple met with victims hospitalized after Thursday's van attack - including one family in which two children and their father were recovering - and spoke with the medical staff at Barcelona's Hospital del Mar.\n\nCatalonia's emergency services said by Saturday night, 53 attack victims remained in the hospital, with 13 of them in critical condition.\n\nThe families of a group of young men in northern Spain who are attack suspects are denouncing terrorism.\n\nThe families from Ripoll, where the entire Islamic State cell behind the deadly attacks in Barcelona and a seaside town is believed to have originated, arrived in a group Saturday in the town's central square. Mothers and sisters tearfully insisted they did not know what had happened to their sons and brothers.\n\nPolice on Saturday searched the home of a missing imam who is believed to have been the group's ideological leader. The imam hasn't been seen in Ripoll since June, according to the mosque where he abruptly quit his job.\n\nAn official with knowledge of the investigation said authorities are looking into whether the imam was killed Wednesday in a botched bomb-making operation in a house south of Barcelona.\n\nA police official in Spain says an imam whose home was searched as part of the investigation into two deadly vehicle attacks is believed to be the radicalizing force behind the cell of young men - and is now thought to have died in an explosion linked to the attacks.\n\nThe official spoke on condition of anonymity to reveal details of the new suspicions surrounding imam Abdelbaki Es Satty. Officials in Es Satty's former mosque in the northern town of Ripoll, which he left abruptly in June, on Saturday denounced the attacks in Barcelona and a nearby seaside town.\n\nThe mosque president, Ali Yassine, said Es Satty told him he wanted to return to Morocco for three months and hasn't seen him since. The police official says Es Satty is believed to have died in an explosion Wednesday that destroyed a house south of Barcelona.\n\nThe two vehicle attacks in Spain left 14 dead and over 120 wounded. Possible suspects whose names have emerged so far in the investigation are all from Ripoll.\n\nThe Muslim community in the northern Spanish town of Ripoll has condemned the two deadly vehicle attacks that have been blamed on some local Moroccans.\n\nIn a notice posted on a Ripoll mosque Saturday, the Annour Islamic Community of Ripoll said it wanted to offer its sympathy to the families of the victims and its solidarity with Barcelona, Catalonia and Spain.\n\nIt said: \"Faced with this criminal act, the Annour Islamic Community of Ripoll reiterates its complete commitment to the fight against any form of terrorism, and we hope that those responsible for this attack are arrested and taken before a judge as soon as possible.\"\n\nMost of the main suspects in the twin attacks were Moroccans from Ripoll. The attacks in Barcelona and the seaside resort of Cambrils left 14 people dead and over 120 injured.\n\nCatalan emergency services say they have identified seven of the 14 people killed in the attacks in Barcelona and the nearby seaside town of Cambrils.\n\nOf the 13 dead from the Barcelona attack, officials have identified four Spaniards, two Portuguese and one Italian. Family members or government officials also say an American man, another Italian man and a woman from Belgium were also killed there.\n\nThe one fatality from the attack in Cambrils was a Spanish woman.\n\nThe emergency service says Saturday that 54 people remained in the hospital, 12 of them in critical condition. They say 78 people have been released after being treated.\n\nExcavation work is continuing at a house south of Barcelona where, according to Spanish police, members of an Islamic extremist cell plotted their attacks.\n\nThe deputy mayor of Alcanar, Jordi Bort, says police are trying to determine if any explosives were still in the house, and to secure them through controlled explosions.\n\nThe house was effectively destroyed on Wednesday during an accidental explosion. Authorities had initially dismissed the blast as a household gas accident, but now say it appears to be related to the plans for an even more deadly attack involving gas or explosives.\n\nOne person was killed during the Wednesday blast. Bort says police are also looking to determine if human remains found at the site belong to a second victim. Bort says so far positive identification hasn't been possible because DNA results haven't come in yet.\n\nMuslims in the hometown of suspects arrested over last week's attacks in Spain have expressed their condolences to the victims.\n\nIn a note posted Saturday on the door of the mosque in Ripoll, a quiet, upscale town of 10,000 about 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of Barcelona, the community said it condemned the attack.\n\nIt said \"The Annour Islamic Community of Ripoll expresses its strongest condemnation and rejection of the terrorist attack committed on Thursday in Barcelona.\n\n\"Catalan Muslims express their sympathy for the families of the victims, wishing for the complete recovery of the injured, and offering their solidarity with the people of Barcelona, Catalonia and Spain.\n\n\"Faced with this criminal act, the Annour Islamic Community of Ripoll reiterates its complete commitment to the fight against any form of terrorism, and we hope that those responsible for this attack are arrested and taken before a judge as soon as possible.\"\n\nSpain's king and queen have visited the victims of the van attack in Barcelona who are recovering in local hospitals.\n\nA video posted on the Royal House Twitter account shows King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia visiting patients and speaking with the medical staff of Barcelona's Hospital del Mar.\n\nThe royal couple visited one family in which two children and their father were recovering from wounds received when a van plowed down the city's main pedestrian promenade, killing 13 people and injuring 120 on Thursday.\n\nA separate car attack a few hours later in the nearby coastal town of Cambrils killed one person and injured five early Friday.\n\nCatalonia's emergency services say by Saturday, 54 people remained in the hospital, with 12 of them in critical condition, from both attacks.\n\nCatalan police are confirming that the manhunt underway for any remaining members of the Islamic extremist cell is focusing on Younes Abouyaaquoub, a 22-year-old Moroccan.\n\nPolice spokesman Albert Oliva says police have carried out nine searches of apartments in Ripoll, the northern Catalan town where Abouyaaquoub and other suspects lived.\n\nOliva said Saturday: \"We can confirm that the manhunt is on for the person\" identified in the media. Spanish media have named Abouyaaquoub as the presumed ringleader of the cell and driver of the van that plowed into pedestrians in Barcelona.\n\nSpanish Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido has declared that the cell was effectively broken after five members were killed, four were in detention and as many as two were killed in a previous explosion. That leaves only one remaining member: Abouyaaquoub.\n\nItaly's foreign ministry is confirming a third Italian was killed in the dual attacks in Spain.\n\nThe ministry said in a statement Saturday that Carmen Lopardo, 80, was killed in the \"vile terrorist attack in Barcelona.\"\n\nNews reports said Lopardo had immigrated to Argentina in 1950 and was visiting Barcelona.\n\nTwo other Italians were among the 14 dead: Bruno Gulotta, 35, and Luca Russo, 25.\n\nA small group of Muslims have gathered at Barcelona's Las Ramblas promenade to insist they aren't terrorists in the wake of the twin vehicle attacks that killed 14 people and injured dozens.\n\nThe protest by about 100 members of Barcelona's Muslim community was held at the Canaletas Fountain at the top of the promenade.\n\nThey shouted \"We are not terrorists\" and \"Islam is peace.\"\n\nCatalan's Moroccan community, in particular, has been in the spotlight after the four main suspects in the attacks claimed Moroccan roots.\n\nPortugal's prime minister says a 20-year-old woman from Lisbon is among those killed in the Barcelona attacks.\n\nThe woman, whose 74-year-old grandmother was also killed in Thursday's attack on Las Ramblas, had initially been considered missing but Prime Minister Antonio Costa confirmed her death in a statement to reporters Saturday.\n\nPortuguese media reported that the two were in Barcelona to celebrate the grandmother's birthday. Their names were not released.\n\nThe two Portuguese women are among 14 people killed in car attacks on Barcelona and the town of Cambrils, as part of what authorities call a terrorist plot claimed by the Islamic State group.\n\nSpanish authorities have decided to maintain the country's terrorist threat rating at level 4, declaring that no new attacks were imminent.\n\nInterior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido says Saturday that the country would nevertheless reinforce security for events that draw large crowds and popular tourist sites.\n\nFrench police are carrying out extra border checks on people arriving from Spain as authorities search for a fugitive suspect in the Barcelona attacks.\n\nNo arrests had been made by Saturday morning, according to a French security official, who described the checks along the normally open border as routine whenever neighboring countries signal a potential risk.\n\nAnother French security official said Spanish authorities flagged a Kangoo utility vehicle believed to have been rented in Spain by a suspect in Thursday's attacks and that may have crossed the nearby border into France.\n\nBoth officials were not authorized to be publicly named.\n\nAt multiple border posts in the winding roads crossing the western Pyrenees on Saturday, gendarmes stopped certain vehicles to check drivers' IDs and the contents of their cars. They targeted primarily vans, trucks and utility vehicles.\n\nCatalan police say they are carrying out controlled explosions in the town where an extremist cell plotted the attacks in Barcelona and a seaside resort.\n\nIn a tweet Saturday, police urged residents of Alcanar not to be alarmed by the detonations in the town, where they believe the extremists rented a house used to prepare their attacks.\n\nThe house was destroyed by an apparently accidental explosion on Wednesday. Police believe the blast actually prevented a far more deadlier attack using explosives, forcing the extremists to use more \"rudimentary\" vehicles instead.\n\nRepresentatives from the Spanish and Catalan government are meeting to determine the terrorist threat level for the country and its Catalan region, after Barcelona and the southern resort town of Cambrils were hit with terrorist attacks.\n\nFollowing the Thursday afternoon and early Friday morning attacks that killed 14 people and wounded more than a hundred, Spain's threat level is now four on a scale that goes to five, a ranking that would warrant military deployments.\n\nAuthorities say the attacks were the work of a large terrorist cell that had been plotting for a long time from a house in Alcanar, 200 kilometers (124 miles) down the coast from Barcelona.\n\nSenior police official Josep Lluis Trapero said that an apparently accidental butane gas explosion at the house, which killed one person, likely prevented the suspects from carrying out a far deadlier attack.\n\nThe Philippines government says a child missing after a vehicle plowed into pedestrians in Barcelona is the 7-year-old son of a Filipino woman who had been living in Australia.\n\nThe Philippines' Foreign Affairs Undersecretary for Migrant Workers Affairs Sarah Arriola said in a statement on Saturday that the 43-year-old Filipino woman was seriously injured in Thursday's attack. She had been based in Australia for the past three or four years.\n\nArriola says the woman and her son were in Barcelona to attend the wedding of a cousin from the Philippines.\n\nArriola says the woman's British husband is en route to Barcelona to help find his son. Arriola says the boy was separated from his mother during the attack.\n\nAustralia's prime minister has urged people to pray for the child.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has asked people to pray for a young Australian boy who is missing after a vehicle attack on a popular Barcelona promenade that killed 13 people.\n\nTurnbull said Saturday that the boy's mother was badly injured and is in a hospital following Friday's attack at the Las Ramblas promenade. Turnbull says the boy's family is searching for him. He did not release the boy's name.\n\nTurnbull says: \"All of us as parents know the anguish his father is going through, and his whole family is going through, as they rush to seek to find him in Barcelona.\"\n\nAustralian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop says four Australians were injured in the attack.\n\nPolice in Catalonia say they have searched two buses in their hunt for violent extremists believed responsible for a pair of deadly attacks in the northwestern region of Spain.\n\nPolice say on their Twitter feed that they searched the buses in Girona and Garrigas, towns in the northwest of Catalonia, but the operation yielded nothing of importance. They provided no further information.\n\nAuthorities launched a manhunt for members of what they believe to be a Catalonia-based extremist group after 14 people were killed and more than 100 injured in attacks in Barcelona on Thursday and in Cambrils, south of Barcelona, on Friday.\n\nOfficials say at least one suspect is still at large.\n\nPolice say they have identified the five people, presumed to be the attackers, shot to death by police in the Cambrils incident but gave no details.\n\nFour people have been arrested as part of the investigation.\n\nSurveillance video from inside a Barcelona museum captured images of the van used in the fatal attack on pedestrians speeding down the Las Ramblas promenade where 13 people were killed and many more were wounded.\n\nThe video shows a person with a stroller just barely getting out of the white van's way and other people on the walkway scattering as it barreled down the walkway.\n\nThe footage was shot Thursday from a security camera inside the Erotic Museum of Barcelona on an upper floor that pointed toward a window with a view of the promenade.\n\nMuseum goers who apparently either heard the van or people outside just after it went by are seen in the images gathering near the window and looking outside.\n\nAuthorities said the assailants after striking in Barcelona drove a second vehicle to the resort town of Cambrils and fatally injured one person early Friday morning.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has personally offered his condolences to Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy after Thursday's deadly van attacks in Barcelona and Cambrils.\n\nThe White House says Trump pledged to support Spanish authorities in their investigation and in bringing the perpetrators to justice.\n\nTrump initially offered supportive words to Spain in a tweet Thursday after a van plowed through pedestrians in Barcelona. Thirteen people were killed. The State Department says at least one American was killed and one was injured in that attack.\n\nOne person was killed in a separate van attack in Cambrils, Spain\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Shouts of \"Long live the king!\" and others for Spain, Catalonia and Barcelona could be heard.\n\nEarlier, the royal couple met with victims hospitalized after Thursday's van attack -- including one family in which two children and their father were recovering -- and spoke with the medical staff at Barcelona's Hospital del Mar.\n\nCatalonia's emergency services said by Saturday night, 53 attack victims remained in the hospital, with 13 of them in critical condition.\n\n-- -- --\n\n7:25 p.m.\n\nThe families of a group of young men in northern Spain who are attack suspects are denouncing terrorism.\n\nThe families from Ripoll, where the entire Islamic State cell behind the deadly attacks in Barcelona and a seaside town is believed to have originated, arrived in a group Saturday in the town's central square. Mothers and sisters tearfully insisted they did not know what had happened to their sons and brothers.\n\nPolice on Saturday searched the home of a missing imam who is believed to have been the group's ideological leader. The imam hasn't been seen in Ripoll since June, according to the mosque where he abruptly quit his job.\n\nAn official with knowledge of the investigation said authorities are looking into whether the imam was killed Wednesday in a botched bomb-making operation in a house south of Barcelona.\n\n-- -- --\n\n5:40 p.m.\n\nA police official in Spain says an imam whose home was searched as part of the investigation into two deadly vehicle attacks is believed to be the radicalizing force behind the cell of young men -- and is now thought to have died in an explosion linked to the attacks.\n\nThe official spoke on condition of anonymity to reveal details of the new suspicions surrounding imam Abdelbaki Es Satty. Officials in Es Satty's former mosque in the northern town of Ripoll, which he left abruptly in June, on Saturday denounced the attacks in Barcelona and a nearby seaside town.\n\nThe mosque president, Ali Yassine, said Es Satty told him he wanted to return to Morocco for three months and hasn't seen him since. The police official says Es Satty is believed to have died in an explosion Wednesday that destroyed a house south of Barcelona.\n\nThe two vehicle attacks in Spain left 14 dead and over 120 wounded. Possible suspects whose names have emerged so far in the investigation are all from Ripoll.\n\n-- By Joseph Wilson, Alex Oller and Lori Hinnant\n\n-- -- --\n\n5:10 p.m.\n\nThe Muslim community in the northern Spanish town of Ripoll has condemned the two deadly vehicle attacks that have been blamed on some local Moroccans.\n\nIn a notice posted on a Ripoll mosque Saturday, the Annour Islamic Community of Ripoll said it wanted to offer its sympathy to the families of the victims and its solidarity with Barcelona, Catalonia and Spain.\n\nIt said: \"Faced with this criminal act, the Annour Islamic Community of Ripoll reiterates its complete commitment to the fight against any form of terrorism, and we hope that those responsible for this attack are arrested and taken before a judge as soon as possible.\"\n\nMost of the main suspects in the twin attacks were Moroccans from Ripoll. The attacks in Barcelona and the seaside resort of Cambrils left 14 people dead and over 120 injured.\n\n-- -- --\n\n4:25 p.m.\n\nCatalan emergency services say they have identified seven of the 14 people killed in the attacks in Barcelona and the nearby seaside town of Cambrils.\n\nOf the 13 dead from the Barcelona attack, officials have identified four Spaniards, two Portuguese and one Italian. Family members or government officials also say an American man, another Italian man and a woman from Belgium were also killed there.\n\nThe one fatality from the attack in Cambrils was a Spanish woman.\n\nThe emergency service says Saturday that 54 people remained in the hospital, 12 of them in critical condition. They say 78 people have been released after being treated.\n\n-- -- --\n\n3:45 p.m.\n\nExcavation work is continuing at a house south of Barcelona where, according to Spanish police, members of an Islamic extremist cell plotted their attacks.\n\nThe deputy mayor of Alcanar, Jordi Bort, says police are trying to determine if any explosives were still in the house, and to secure them through controlled explosions.\n\nThe house was effectively destroyed on Wednesday during an accidental explosion. Authorities had initially dismissed the blast as a household gas accident, but now say it appears to be related to the plans for an even more deadly attack involving gas or explosives.\n\nOne person was killed during the Wednesday blast. Bort says police are also looking to determine if human remains found at the site belong to a second victim. Bort says so far positive identification hasn't been possible because DNA results haven't come in yet.\n\n-- -- --\n\n3:30 p.m.\n\nMuslims in the hometown of suspects arrested over last week's attacks in Spain have expressed their condolences to the victims.\n\nIn a note posted Saturday on the door of the mosque in Ripoll, a quiet, upscale town of 10,000 about 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of Barcelona, the community said it condemned the attack.\n\nIt said \"The Annour Islamic Community of Ripoll expresses its strongest condemnation and rejection of the terrorist attack committed on Thursday in Barcelona.\n\n\"Catalan Muslims express their sympathy for the families of the victims, wishing for the complete recovery of the injured, and offering their solidarity with the people of Barcelona, Catalonia and Spain.\n\n\"Faced with this criminal act, the Annour Islamic Community of Ripoll reiterates its complete commitment to the fight against any form of terrorism, and we hope that those responsible for this attack are arrested and taken before a judge as soon as possible.\"\n\n-- -- --\n\n2:55 p.m.\n\nSpain's king and queen have visited the victims of the van attack in Barcelona who are recovering in local hospitals.\n\nA video posted on the Royal House Twitter account shows King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia visiting patients and speaking with the medical staff of Barcelona's Hospital del Mar.\n\nThe royal couple visited one family in which two children and their father were recovering from wounds received when a van plowed down the city's main pedestrian promenade, killing 13 people and injuring 120 on Thursday.\n\nA separate car attack a few hours later in the nearby coastal town of Cambrils killed one person and injured five early Friday.\n\nCatalonia's emergency services say by Saturday, 54 people remained in the hospital, with 12 of them in critical condition, from both attacks.\n\n-- -- --\n\n2:15 p.m.\n\nCatalan police are confirming that the manhunt underway for any remaining members of the Islamic extremist cell is focusing on Younes Abouyaaquoub, a 22-year-old Moroccan.\n\nPolice spokesman Albert Oliva says police have carried out nine searches of apartments in Ripoll, the northern Catalan town where Abouyaaquoub and other suspects lived.\n\nOliva said Saturday: \"We can confirm that the manhunt is on for the person\" identified in the media. Spanish media have named Abouyaaquoub as the presumed ringleader of the cell and driver of the van that plowed into pedestrians in Barcelona.\n\nSpanish Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido has declared that the cell was effectively broken after five members were killed, four were in detention and as many as two were killed in a previous explosion. That leaves only one remaining member: Abouyaaquoub.\n\n-- -- --\n\n2:00 p.m.\n\nItaly's foreign ministry is confirming a third Italian was killed in the dual attacks in Spain.\n\nThe ministry said in a statement Saturday that Carmen Lopardo, 80, was killed in the \"vile terrorist attack in Barcelona.\"\n\nNews reports said Lopardo had immigrated to Argentina in 1950 and was visiting Barcelona.\n\nTwo other Italians were among the 14 dead: Bruno Gulotta, 35, and Luca Russo, 25.\n\n-- -- --\n\n1:45 p.m.\n\nA small group of Muslims have gathered at Barcelona's Las Ramblas promenade to insist they aren't terrorists in the wake of the twin vehicle attacks that killed 14 people and injured dozens.\n\nThe protest by about 100 members of Barcelona's Muslim community was held at the Canaletas Fountain at the top of the promenade.\n\nThey shouted \"We are not terrorists\" and \"Islam is peace.\"\n\nCatalan's Moroccan community, in particular, has been in the spotlight after the four main suspects in the attacks claimed Moroccan roots.\n\n-- -- --\n\n1:30 p.m.\n\nPortugal's prime minister says a 20-year-old woman from Lisbon is among those killed in the Barcelona attacks.\n\nThe woman, whose 74-year-old grandmother was also killed in Thursday's attack on Las Ramblas, had initially been considered missing but Prime Minister Antonio Costa confirmed her death in a statement to reporters Saturday.\n\nPortuguese media reported that the two were in Barcelona to celebrate the grandmother's birthday. Their names were not released.\n\nThe two Portuguese women are among 14 people killed in car attacks on Barcelona and the town of Cambrils, as part of what authorities call a terrorist plot claimed by the Islamic State group.\n\n-- -- --\n\n1:15 p.m.\n\nSpanish authorities have decided to maintain the country's terrorist threat rating at level 4, declaring that no new attacks were imminent.\n\nInterior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido says Saturday that the country would nevertheless reinforce security for events that draw large crowds and popular tourist sites.\n\n-- -- --\n\n11:45 a.m.\n\nFrench police are carrying out extra border checks on people arriving from Spain as authorities search for a fugitive suspect in the Barcelona attacks.\n\nNo arrests had been made by Saturday morning, according to a French security official, who described the checks along the normally open border as routine whenever neighboring countries signal a potential risk.\n\nAnother French security official said Spanish authorities flagged a Kangoo utility vehicle believed to have been rented in Spain by a suspect in Thursday's attacks and that may have crossed the nearby border into France.\n\nBoth officials were not authorized to be publicly named.\n\nAt multiple border posts in the winding roads crossing the western Pyrenees on Saturday, gendarmes stopped certain vehicles to check drivers' IDs and the contents of their cars. They targeted primarily vans, trucks and utility vehicles.\n\n-- -- --\n\n10 a.m.\n\nCatalan police say they are carrying out controlled explosions in the town where an extremist cell plotted the attacks in Barcelona and a seaside resort.\n\nIn a tweet Saturday, police urged residents of Alcanar not to be alarmed by the detonations in the town, where they believe the extremists rented a house used to prepare their attacks.\n\nThe house was destroyed by an apparently accidental explosion on Wednesday. Police believe the blast actually prevented a far more deadlier attack using explosives, forcing the extremists to use more \"rudimentary\" vehicles instead.\n\n-- -- --\n\n9:30 a.m.\n\nRepresentatives from the Spanish and Catalan government are meeting to determine the terrorist threat level for the country and its Catalan region, after Barcelona and the southern resort town of Cambrils were hit with terrorist attacks.\n\nFollowing the Thursday afternoon and early Friday morning attacks that killed 14 people and wounded more than a hundred, Spain's threat level is now four on a scale that goes to five, a ranking that would warrant military deployments.\n\nAuthorities say the attacks were the work of a large terrorist cell that had been plotting for a long time from a house in Alcanar, 200 kilometers (124 miles) down the coast from Barcelona.\n\nSenior police official Josep Lluis Trapero said that an apparently accidental butane gas explosion at the house, which killed one person, likely prevented the suspects from carrying out a far deadlier attack.\n\n-- -- --\n\n9:15 a.m.\n\nThe Philippines government says a child missing after a vehicle plowed into pedestrians in Barcelona is the 7-year-old son of a Filipino woman who had been living in Australia.\n\nThe Philippines' Foreign Affairs Undersecretary for Migrant Workers Affairs Sarah Arriola said in a statement on Saturday that the 43-year-old Filipino woman was seriously injured in Thursday's attack. She had been based in Australia for the past three or four years.\n\nArriola says the woman and her son were in Barcelona to attend the wedding of a cousin from the Philippines.\n\nArriola says the woman's British husband is en route to Barcelona to help find his son. Arriola says the boy was separated from his mother during the attack.\n\nAustralia's prime minister has urged people to pray for the child.\n\n-- -- --\n\n5:15 a.m.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has asked people to pray for a young Australian boy who is missing after a vehicle attack on a popular Barcelona promenade that killed 13 people.\n\nTurnbull said Saturday that the boy's mother was badly injured and is in a hospital following Friday's attack at the Las Ramblas promenade. Turnbull says the boy's family is searching for him. He did not release the boy's name.\n\nTurnbull says: \"All of us as parents know the anguish his father is going through, and his whole family is going through, as they rush to seek to find him in Barcelona.\"\n\nAustralian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop says four Australians were injured in the attack.\n\n-- -- --\n\n2:35 a.m.\n\nPolice in Catalonia say they have searched two buses in their hunt for violent extremists believed responsible for a pair of deadly attacks in the northwestern region of Spain.\n\nPolice say on their Twitter feed that they searched the buses in Girona and Garrigas, towns in the northwest of Catalonia, but the operation yielded nothing of importance. They provided no further information.\n\nAuthorities launched a manhunt for members of what they believe to be a Catalonia-based extremist group after 14 people were killed and more than 100 injured in attacks in Barcelona on Thursday and in Cambrils, south of Barcelona, on Friday.\n\nOfficials say at least one suspect is still at large.\n\nPolice say they have identified the five people, presumed to be the attackers, shot to death by police in the Cambrils incident but gave no details.\n\nFour people have been arrested as part of the investigation.\n\n-- -- --\n\n12:50 a.m.\n\nSurveillance video from inside a Barcelona museum captured images of the van used in the fatal attack on pedestrians speeding down the Las Ramblas promenade where 13 people were killed and many more were wounded.\n\nThe video shows a person with a stroller just barely getting out of the white van's way and other people on the walkway scattering as it barreled down the walkway.\n\nThe footage was shot Thursday from a security camera inside the Erotic Museum of Barcelona on an upper floor that pointed toward a window with a view of the promenade.\n\nMuseum goers who apparently either heard the van or people outside just after it went by are seen in the images gathering near the window and looking outside.\n\nAuthorities said the assailants after striking in Barcelona drove a second vehicle to the resort town of Cambrils and fatally injured one person early Friday morning.\n\nPolice shot five of those attackers dead.\n\n-- -- --\n\n12:10 a.m. Saturday\n\nPresident Donald Trump has personally offered his condolences to Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy after Thursday's deadly van attacks in Barcelona and Cambrils.\n\nThe White House says Trump pledged to support Spanish authorities in their investigation and in bringing the perpetrators to justice.\n\nTrump initially offered supportive words to Spain in a tweet Thursday after a van plowed through pedestrians in Barcelona. Thirteen people were killed. The State Department says at least one American was killed and one was injured in that attack.\n\nOne person was killed in a separate van attack in Cambrils, Spain", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-3374007", "id": "10099256", "url": "http://www.postbulletin.com/news/world/the-latest-spain-s-royals-place-candles-at-barcelona-site/article_f30138bb-236c-59e1-b97a-6e80d337e5fe.html", "sim": 0.7686274647712708, "details": {}, "uri": "712012748", "extractedDates": null, "eventUri": "eng-3374007", "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postbulletin.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/2e/b2e0c209-1b9a-52a3-a95a-abc83f23676a/5997e94cc7f52.image.jpg?crop=455%2C341%2C28%2C0&resize=455%2C341&order=crop%2Cresize", "timeCrawl": "19:17:00", "isDuplicate": false, "dateTime": "2017-08-19T19:17:00Z", "lang": "eng", "title": "The Latest: Spain's royals place candles at Barcelona site", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "id": 161}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "id": 164}], "time": "19:17:00", "source": {"uri": "postbulletin.com", "title": "PostBulletin.com", "id": "3887"}, "date": "2017-08-19", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19"}

All the suspects on the list hail from Ripoll, a quiet, upscale town of 10,000 about 100km north of Barcelona.\n\nAlso named on the list is 17-year-old Moussa Oukabir, whose brother Driss reported his documents stolen to police in Ripoll.", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-3374007", "id": "10083066", "url": "http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/breaking-news/spain-presses-manhunt-for-terror-leader/news-story/617207c31fc5863afdab20f857e946da", "sim": 0.7529411911964417, "details": {}, "uri": "711962259", "extractedDates": null, "eventUri": "eng-3374007", "image": "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=www.heraldsun.com.au&#038;blog=87782236&#038;post=2909302&#038;subd=heraldsunatnewscorpau&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1", "timeCrawl": "16:13:00", "isDuplicate": false, "dateTime": "2017-08-19T16:13:00Z", "lang": "eng", "title": "Spain presses manhunt for terror leader", "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "id": 161}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "id": 164}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "id": 203}], "time": "16:13:00", "source": {"uri": "heraldsun.com.au", "title": "Herald Sun", "id": "1228"}, "date": "2017-08-19", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19"}

p.m.\n\nSpain's king and queen have paid a somber visit to the Las Ramblas attack site in Barcelona, placing a wreath and two candles on the ground in memory of the victims.\n\nKing Felipe VI and Queen Letizia were accompanied Saturday by Catalan regional President Carles Puigdemont and Barcelona Mayor Ada Colau. As he left, the king shook hands with bystanders. Shouts of \"Long live the king!\" and others for Spain, Catalonia and Barcelona could be heard.\n\nEarlier, the royal couple met with victims hospitalized after Thursday's van attack - including one family in which two children and their father were recovering - and spoke with the medical staff at Barcelona's Hospital del Mar.\n\nCatalonia's emergency services said by Saturday night, 53 attack victims remained in the hospital, with 13 of them in critical condition.\n\nThe families of a group of young men in northern Spain who are attack suspects are denouncing terrorism.\n\nThe families from Ripoll, where the entire Islamic State cell behind the deadly attacks in Barcelona and a seaside town is believed to have originated, arrived in a group Saturday in the town's central square. Mothers and sisters tearfully insisted they did not know what had happened to their sons and brothers.\n\nPolice on Saturday searched the home of a missing imam who is believed to have been the group's ideological leader. The imam hasn't been seen in Ripoll since June, according to the mosque where he abruptly quit his job.\n\nAn official with knowledge of the investigation said authorities are looking into whether the imam was killed Wednesday in a botched bomb-making operation in a house south of Barcelona.\n\nA police official in Spain says an imam whose home was searched as part of the investigation into two deadly vehicle attacks is believed to be the radicalizing force behind the cell of young men - and is now thought to have died in an explosion linked to the attacks.\n\nThe official spoke on condition of anonymity to reveal details of the new suspicions surrounding imam Abdelbaki Es Satty. Officials in Es Satty's former mosque in the northern town of Ripoll, which he left abruptly in June, on Saturday denounced the attacks in Barcelona and a nearby seaside town.\n\nThe mosque president, Ali Yassine, said Es Satty told him he wanted to return to Morocco for three months and hasn't seen him since. The police official says Es Satty is believed to have died in an explosion Wednesday that destroyed a house south of Barcelona.\n\nThe two vehicle attacks in Spain left 14 dead and over 120 wounded. Possible suspects whose names have emerged so far in the investigation are all from Ripoll.\n\nThe Muslim community in the northern Spanish town of Ripoll has condemned the two deadly vehicle attacks that have been blamed on some local Moroccans.\n\nIn a notice posted on a Ripoll mosque Saturday, the Annour Islamic Community of Ripoll said it wanted to offer its sympathy to the families of the victims and its solidarity with Barcelona, Catalonia and Spain.\n\nIt said: \"Faced with this criminal act, the Annour Islamic Community of Ripoll reiterates its complete commitment to the fight against any form of terrorism, and we hope that those responsible for this attack are arrested and taken before a judge as soon as possible.\"\n\nMost of the main suspects in the twin attacks were Moroccans from Ripoll. The attacks in Barcelona and the seaside resort of Cambrils left 14 people dead and over 120 injured.\n\nCatalan emergency services say they have identified seven of the 14 people killed in the attacks in Barcelona and the nearby seaside town of Cambrils.\n\nOf the 13 dead from the Barcelona attack, officials have identified four Spaniards, two Portuguese and one Italian. Family members or government officials also say an American man, another Italian man and a woman from Belgium were also killed there.\n\nThe one fatality from the attack in Cambrils was a Spanish woman.\n\nThe emergency service says Saturday that 54 people remained in the hospital, 12 of them in critical condition. They say 78 people have been released after being treated.\n\nExcavation work is continuing at a house south of Barcelona where, according to Spanish police, members of an Islamic extremist cell plotted their attacks.\n\nThe deputy mayor of Alcanar, Jordi Bort, says police are trying to determine if any explosives were still in the house, and to secure them through controlled explosions.\n\nThe house was effectively destroyed on Wednesday during an accidental explosion. Authorities had initially dismissed the blast as a household gas accident, but now say it appears to be related to the plans for an even more deadly attack involving gas or explosives.\n\nOne person was killed during the Wednesday blast. Bort says police are also looking to determine if human remains found at the site belong to a second victim. Bort says so far positive identification hasn't been possible because DNA results haven't come in yet.\n\nMuslims in the hometown of suspects arrested over last week's attacks in Spain have expressed their condolences to the victims.\n\nIn a note posted Saturday on the door of the mosque in Ripoll, a quiet, upscale town of 10,000 about 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of Barcelona, the community said it condemned the attack.\n\nIt said \"The Annour Islamic Community of Ripoll expresses its strongest condemnation and rejection of the terrorist attack committed on Thursday in Barcelona.\n\n\"Catalan Muslims express their sympathy for the families of the victims, wishing for the complete recovery of the injured, and offering their solidarity with the people of Barcelona, Catalonia and Spain.\n\n\"Faced with this criminal act, the Annour Islamic Community of Ripoll reiterates its complete commitment to the fight against any form of terrorism, and we hope that those responsible for this attack are arrested and taken before a judge as soon as possible.\"\n\nSpain's king and queen have visited the victims of the van attack in Barcelona who are recovering in local hospitals.\n\nA video posted on the Royal House Twitter account shows King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia visiting patients and speaking with the medical staff of Barcelona's Hospital del Mar.\n\nThe royal couple visited one family in which two children and their father were recovering from wounds received when a van plowed down the city's main pedestrian promenade, killing 13 people and injuring 120 on Thursday.\n\nA separate car attack a few hours later in the nearby coastal town of Cambrils killed one person and injured five early Friday.\n\nCatalonia's emergency services say by Saturday, 54 people remained in the hospital, with 12 of them in critical condition, from both attacks.\n\nCatalan police are confirming that the manhunt underway for any remaining members of the Islamic extremist cell is focusing on Younes Abouyaaquoub, a 22-year-old Moroccan.\n\nPolice spokesman Albert Oliva says police have carried out nine searches of apartments in Ripoll, the northern Catalan town where Abouyaaquoub and other suspects lived.\n\nOliva said Saturday: \"We can confirm that the manhunt is on for the person\" identified in the media. Spanish media have named Abouyaaquoub as the presumed ringleader of the cell and driver of the van that plowed into pedestrians in Barcelona.\n\nSpanish Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido has declared that the cell was effectively broken after five members were killed, four were in detention and as many as two were killed in a previous explosion. That leaves only one remaining member: Abouyaaquoub.\n\nItaly's foreign ministry is confirming a third Italian was killed in the dual attacks in Spain.\n\nThe ministry said in a statement Saturday that Carmen Lopardo, 80, was killed in the \"vile terrorist attack in Barcelona.\"\n\nNews reports said Lopardo had immigrated to Argentina in 1950 and was visiting Barcelona.\n\nTwo other Italians were among the 14 dead: Bruno Gulotta, 35, and Luca Russo, 25.\n\nA small group of Muslims have gathered at Barcelona's Las Ramblas promenade to insist they aren't terrorists in the wake of the twin vehicle attacks that killed 14 people and injured dozens.\n\nThe protest by about 100 members of Barcelona's Muslim community was held at the Canaletas Fountain at the top of the promenade.\n\nThey shouted \"We are not terrorists\" and \"Islam is peace.\"\n\nCatalan's Moroccan community, in particular, has been in the spotlight after the four main suspects in the attacks claimed Moroccan roots.\n\nPortugal's prime minister says a 20-year-old woman from Lisbon is among those killed in the Barcelona attacks.\n\nThe woman, whose 74-year-old grandmother was also killed in Thursday's attack on Las Ramblas, had initially been considered missing but Prime Minister Antonio Costa confirmed her death in a statement to reporters Saturday.\n\nPortuguese media reported that the two were in Barcelona to celebrate the grandmother's birthday. Their names were not released.\n\nThe two Portuguese women are among 14 people killed in car attacks on Barcelona and the town of Cambrils, as part of what authorities call a terrorist plot claimed by the Islamic State group.\n\nSpanish authorities have decided to maintain the country's terrorist threat rating at level 4, declaring that no new attacks were imminent.\n\nInterior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido says Saturday that the country would nevertheless reinforce security for events that draw large crowds and popular tourist sites.\n\nFrench police are carrying out extra border checks on people arriving from Spain as authorities search for a fugitive suspect in the Barcelona attacks.\n\nNo arrests had been made by Saturday morning, according to a French security official, who described the checks along the normally open border as routine whenever neighboring countries signal a potential risk.\n\nAnother French security official said Spanish authorities flagged a Kangoo utility vehicle believed to have been rented in Spain by a suspect in Thursday's attacks and that may have crossed the nearby border into France.\n\nBoth officials were not authorized to be publicly named.\n\nAt multiple border posts in the winding roads crossing the western Pyrenees on Saturday, gendarmes stopped certain vehicles to check drivers' IDs and the contents of their cars. They targeted primarily vans, trucks and utility vehicles.\n\nCatalan police say they are carrying out controlled explosions in the town where an extremist cell plotted the attacks in Barcelona and a seaside resort.\n\nIn a tweet Saturday, police urged residents of Alcanar not to be alarmed by the detonations in the town, where they believe the extremists rented a house used to prepare their attacks.\n\nThe house was destroyed by an apparently accidental explosion on Wednesday. Police believe the blast actually prevented a far more deadlier attack using explosives, forcing the extremists to use more \"rudimentary\" vehicles instead.\n\nRepresentatives from the Spanish and Catalan government are meeting to determine the terrorist threat level for the country and its Catalan region, after Barcelona and the southern resort town of Cambrils were hit with terrorist attacks.\n\nFollowing the Thursday afternoon and early Friday morning attacks that killed 14 people and wounded more than a hundred, Spain's threat level is now four on a scale that goes to five, a ranking that would warrant military deployments.\n\nAuthorities say the attacks were the work of a large terrorist cell that had been plotting for a long time from a house in Alcanar, 200 kilometers (124 miles) down the coast from Barcelona.\n\nSenior police official Josep Lluis Trapero said that an apparently accidental butane gas explosion at the house, which killed one person, likely prevented the suspects from carrying out a far deadlier attack.\n\nThe Philippines government says a child missing after a vehicle plowed into pedestrians in Barcelona is the 7-year-old son of a Filipino woman who had been living in Australia.\n\nThe Philippines' Foreign Affairs Undersecretary for Migrant Workers Affairs Sarah Arriola said in a statement on Saturday that the 43-year-old Filipino woman was seriously injured in Thursday's attack. She had been based in Australia for the past three or four years.\n\nArriola says the woman and her son were in Barcelona to attend the wedding of a cousin from the Philippines.\n\nArriola says the woman's British husband is en route to Barcelona to help find his son. Arriola says the boy was separated from his mother during the attack.\n\nAustralia's prime minister has urged people to pray for the child.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has asked people to pray for a young Australian boy who is missing after a vehicle attack on a popular Barcelona promenade that killed 13 people.\n\nTurnbull said Saturday that the boy's mother was badly injured and is in a hospital following Friday's attack at the Las Ramblas promenade. Turnbull says the boy's family is searching for him. He did not release the boy's name.\n\nTurnbull says: \"All of us as parents know the anguish his father is going through, and his whole family is going through, as they rush to seek to find him in Barcelona.\"\n\nAustralian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop says four Australians were injured in the attack.\n\nPolice in Catalonia say they have searched two buses in their hunt for violent extremists believed responsible for a pair of deadly attacks in the northwestern region of Spain.\n\nPolice say on their Twitter feed that they searched the buses in Girona and Garrigas, towns in the northwest of Catalonia, but the operation yielded nothing of importance. They provided no further information.\n\nAuthorities launched a manhunt for members of what they believe to be a Catalonia-based extremist group after 14 people were killed and more than 100 injured in attacks in Barcelona on Thursday and in Cambrils, south of Barcelona, on Friday.\n\nOfficials say at least one suspect is still at large.\n\nPolice say they have identified the five people, presumed to be the attackers, shot to death by police in the Cambrils incident but gave no details.\n\nFour people have been arrested as part of the investigation.\n\nSurveillance video from inside a Barcelona museum captured images of the van used in the fatal attack on pedestrians speeding down the Las Ramblas promenade where 13 people were killed and many more were wounded.\n\nThe video shows a person with a stroller just barely getting out of the white van's way and other people on the walkway scattering as it barreled down the walkway.\n\nThe footage was shot Thursday from a security camera inside the Erotic Museum of Barcelona on an upper floor that pointed toward a window with a view of the promenade.\n\nMuseum goers who apparently either heard the van or people outside just after it went by are seen in the images gathering near the window and looking outside.\n\nAuthorities said the assailants after striking in Barcelona drove a second vehicle to the resort town of Cambrils and fatally injured one person early Friday morning.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has personally offered his condolences to Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy after Thursday's deadly van attacks in Barcelona and Cambrils.\n\nThe White House says Trump pledged to support Spanish authorities in their investigation and in bringing the perpetrators to justice.\n\nTrump initially offered supportive words to Spain in a tweet Thursday after a van plowed through pedestrians in Barcelona. Thirteen people were killed. The State Department says at least one American was killed and one was injured in that attack.\n\nOne person was killed in a separate van attack in Cambrils, Spain\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Nothing was found in the searches in Girona and Garrigas, police tweeted.\n\nAcross the Pyrenees, French police carried out extra border checks on people coming from Spain -- a routine beefing-up of patrols anytime a neighboring country flags a potential risk, a French security official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. No arrests were made.\n\nHEARTBREAK FOR FAMILY OF AMERICAN KILLED IN SPAIN WHILE CELEBRATING ANNIVERSARY\n\nPolice also announced a series of controlled explosions Saturday in the town of Alcanar, south of Barcelona, where the carnage had been planned in a rental house destroyed a day before the attacks by an apparently accidental blast. Authorities had initially written off the Wednesday night incident as a household gas accident, but took another look on Friday and returned on Saturday.\n\nThe blast, which killed at least one person and injured one of four people currently in custody, actually prevented a far deadlier attack using explosives, forcing the extremists to use more \"rudimentary\" vehicles instead.\n\nIn the attacks that began Thursday afternoon, a white van swerved onto Barcelona's historic Las Ramblas pedestrian promenade, killing 13 people, including one American citizen, and injuring more than 100 as it plowed down unsuspecting tourists and locals. A few hours later, five extremists began mowing down people along the boardwalk in the seaside resort of Cambrils.\n\nOne woman died and five others were injured before police shot and killed all five attackers. One Spanish officer killed four of the suspects himself.\n\nAuthorities said the two attacks were related and the work of a large terrorist cell that had been plotting for a long time from the house in Alcanar, 125 miles down the coast from Barcelona.\n\nCIA WARNED BARCELONA ABOUT TERROR THREAT, REPORT SAYS\n\nThe Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack and said the perpetrators were \"soldiers of the Islamic State,\" the terrorist organization's propaganda agency said.\n\nSpanish authorities had not yet drawn any direct links between ISIS extremists and the suspects in the Spanish attacks.\n\nPolice announced that four people were currently in custody and three suspects, including Abouyaaquoub, are on the loose. All the suspects hail from Ripoll, a quiet, upscale town of 10,000 about 100 kilometers (62 miles) north of Barcelona.\n\nA French security official also confirmed Spanish police are looking for a Kangoo utility vehicle rented by suspects in the Barcelona attacks that may have crossed into France.\n\nSpanish hospital officials updated the status of the injured victims of the Barcelona and Cambrils terror attacks Saturday, saying 12 people from the Barcelona attack remain in critical condition while one person remains in serious condition from the Cambrils attack. The rest of the injuries are slightly less serious. King Felipe and Queen Leticia traveled to Barcelona's hospital to visit the injured victims of the attack.\n\nSpanish authorities confirmed they are maintaining the country's current terrorist threat alert at level 4.

p.m.\n\nSpain's king and queen have paid a somber visit to the Las Ramblas attack site in Barcelona, placing a wreath and two candles on the ground in memory of the victims.\n\nKing Felipe VI and Queen Letizia were accompanied Saturday by Catalan regional President Carles Puigdemont and Barcelona Mayor Ada Colau. As he left, the king shook hands with bystanders. Shouts of \"Long live the king!\" and others for Spain, Catalonia and Barcelona could be heard.\n\nEarlier, the royal couple met with victims hospitalized after Thursday's van attack -- including one family in which two children and their father were recovering -- and spoke with the medical staff at Barcelona's Hospital del Mar.\n\nCatalonia's emergency services said by Saturday night, 53 attack victims remained in the hospital, with 13 of them in critical condition.\n\nThe families of a group of young men in northern Spain who are attack suspects are denouncing terrorism.\n\nThe families from Ripoll, where the entire Islamic State cell behind the deadly attacks in Barcelona and a seaside town is believed to have originated, arrived in a group Saturday in the town's central square. Mothers and sisters tearfully insisted they did not know what had happened to their sons and brothers.\n\nPolice on Saturday searched the home of a missing imam who is believed to have been the group's ideological leader. The imam hasn't been seen in Ripoll since June, according to the mosque where he abruptly quit his job.\n\nAn official with knowledge of the investigation said authorities are looking into whether the imam was killed Wednesday in a botched bomb-making operation in a house south of Barcelona.\n\nA police official in Spain says an imam whose home was searched as part of the investigation into two deadly vehicle attacks is believed to be the radicalizing force behind the cell of young men -- and is now thought to have died in an explosion linked to the attacks.\n\nThe official spoke on condition of anonymity to reveal details of the new suspicions surrounding imam Abdelbaki Es Satty. Officials in Es Satty's former mosque in the northern town of Ripoll, which he left abruptly in June, on Saturday denounced the attacks in Barcelona and a nearby seaside town.\n\nThe mosque president, Ali Yassine, said Es Satty told him he wanted to return to Morocco for three months and hasn't seen him since. The police official says Es Satty is believed to have died in an explosion Wednesday that destroyed a house south of Barcelona.\n\nThe two vehicle attacks in Spain left 14 dead and over 120 wounded. Possible suspects whose names have emerged so far in the investigation are all from Ripoll.\n\nThe Muslim community in the northern Spanish town of Ripoll has condemned the two deadly vehicle attacks that have been blamed on some local Moroccans.\n\nIn a notice posted on a Ripoll mosque Saturday, the Annour Islamic Community of Ripoll said it wanted to offer its sympathy to the families of the victims and its solidarity with Barcelona, Catalonia and Spain.\n\nIt said: \"Faced with this criminal act, the Annour Islamic Community of Ripoll reiterates its complete commitment to the fight against any form of terrorism, and we hope that those responsible for this attack are arrested and taken before a judge as soon as possible.\"\n\nMost of the main suspects in the twin attacks were Moroccans from Ripoll. The attacks in Barcelona and the seaside resort of Cambrils left 14 people dead and over 120 injured.\n\nCatalan emergency services say they have identified seven of the 14 people killed in the attacks in Barcelona and the nearby seaside town of Cambrils.\n\nOf the 13 dead from the Barcelona attack, officials have identified four Spaniards, two Portuguese and one Italian. Family members or government officials also say an American man, another Italian man and a woman from Belgium were also killed there.\n\nThe one fatality from the attack in Cambrils was a Spanish woman.\n\nThe emergency service says Saturday that 54 people remained in the hospital, 12 of them in critical condition. They say 78 people have been released after being treated.\n\nExcavation work is continuing at a house south of Barcelona where, according to Spanish police, members of an Islamic extremist cell plotted their attacks.\n\nThe deputy mayor of Alcanar, Jordi Bort, says police are trying to determine if any explosives were still in the house, and to secure them through controlled explosions.\n\nThe house was effectively destroyed on Wednesday during an accidental explosion. Authorities had initially dismissed the blast as a household gas accident, but now say it appears to be related to the plans for an even more deadly attack involving gas or explosives.\n\nOne person was killed during the Wednesday blast. Bort says police are also looking to determine if human remains found at the site belong to a second victim. Bort says so far positive identification hasn't been possible because DNA results haven't come in yet.\n\nMuslims in the hometown of suspects arrested over last week's attacks in Spain have expressed their condolences to the victims.\n\nIn a note posted Saturday on the door of the mosque in Ripoll, a quiet, upscale town of 10,000 about 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of Barcelona, the community said it condemned the attack.\n\nIt said \"The Annour Islamic Community of Ripoll expresses its strongest condemnation and rejection of the terrorist attack committed on Thursday in Barcelona.\n\n\"Catalan Muslims express their sympathy for the families of the victims, wishing for the complete recovery of the injured, and offering their solidarity with the people of Barcelona, Catalonia and Spain.\n\n\"Faced with this criminal act, the Annour Islamic Community of Ripoll reiterates its complete commitment to the fight against any form of terrorism, and we hope that those responsible for this attack are arrested and taken before a judge as soon as possible.\"\n\nSpain's king and queen have visited the victims of the van attack in Barcelona who are recovering in local hospitals.\n\nA video posted on the Royal House Twitter account shows King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia visiting patients and speaking with the medical staff of Barcelona's Hospital del Mar.\n\nThe royal couple visited one family in which two children and their father were recovering from wounds received when a van plowed down the city's main pedestrian promenade, killing 13 people and injuring 120 on Thursday.\n\nA separate car attack a few hours later in the nearby coastal town of Cambrils killed one person and injured five early Friday.\n\nCatalonia's emergency services say by Saturday, 54 people remained in the hospital, with 12 of them in critical condition, from both attacks.\n\nCatalan police are confirming that the manhunt underway for any remaining members of the Islamic extremist cell is focusing on Younes Abouyaaquoub, a 22-year-old Moroccan.\n\nPolice spokesman Albert Oliva says police have carried out nine searches of apartments in Ripoll, the northern Catalan town where Abouyaaquoub and other suspects lived.\n\nOliva said Saturday: \"We can confirm that the manhunt is on for the person\" identified in the media. Spanish media have named Abouyaaquoub as the presumed ringleader of the cell and driver of the van that plowed into pedestrians in Barcelona.\n\nSpanish Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido has declared that the cell was effectively broken after five members were killed, four were in detention and as many as two were killed in a previous explosion. That leaves only one remaining member: Abouyaaquoub.\n\nItaly's foreign ministry is confirming a third Italian was killed in the dual attacks in Spain.\n\nThe ministry said in a statement Saturday that Carmen Lopardo, 80, was killed in the \"vile terrorist attack in Barcelona.\"\n\nNews reports said Lopardo had immigrated to Argentina in 1950 and was visiting Barcelona.\n\nTwo other Italians were among the 14 dead: Bruno Gulotta, 35, and Luca Russo, 25.\n\nA small group of Muslims have gathered at Barcelona's Las Ramblas promenade to insist they aren't terrorists in the wake of the twin vehicle attacks that killed 14 people and injured dozens.\n\nThe protest by about 100 members of Barcelona's Muslim community was held at the Canaletas Fountain at the top of the promenade.\n\nThey shouted \"We are not terrorists\" and \"Islam is peace.\"\n\nCatalan's Moroccan community, in particular, has been in the spotlight after the four main suspects in the attacks claimed Moroccan roots.\n\nPortugal's prime minister says a 20-year-old woman from Lisbon is among those killed in the Barcelona attacks.\n\nThe woman, whose 74-year-old grandmother was also killed in Thursday's attack on Las Ramblas, had initially been considered missing but Prime Minister Antonio Costa confirmed her death in a statement to reporters Saturday.\n\nPortuguese media reported that the two were in Barcelona to celebrate the grandmother's birthday. Their names were not released.\n\nThe two Portuguese women are among 14 people killed in car attacks on Barcelona and the town of Cambrils, as part of what authorities call a terrorist plot claimed by the Islamic State group.\n\nSpanish authorities have decided to maintain the country's terrorist threat rating at level 4, declaring that no new attacks were imminent.\n\nInterior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido says Saturday that the country would nevertheless reinforce security for events that draw large crowds and popular tourist sites.\n\nFrench police are carrying out extra border checks on people arriving from Spain as authorities search for a fugitive suspect in the Barcelona attacks.\n\nNo arrests had been made by Saturday morning, according to a French security official, who described the checks along the normally open border as routine whenever neighboring countries signal a potential risk.\n\nAnother French security official said Spanish authorities flagged a Kangoo utility vehicle believed to have been rented in Spain by a suspect in Thursday's attacks and that may have crossed the nearby border into France.\n\nBoth officials were not authorized to be publicly named.\n\nAt multiple border posts in the winding roads crossing the western Pyrenees on Saturday, gendarmes stopped certain vehicles to check drivers' IDs and the contents of their cars. They targeted primarily vans, trucks and utility vehicles.\n\nCatalan police say they are carrying out controlled explosions in the town where an extremist cell plotted the attacks in Barcelona and a seaside resort.\n\nIn a tweet Saturday, police urged residents of Alcanar not to be alarmed by the detonations in the town, where they believe the extremists rented a house used to prepare their attacks.\n\nThe house was destroyed by an apparently accidental explosion on Wednesday. Police believe the blast actually prevented a far more deadlier attack using explosives, forcing the extremists to use more \"rudimentary\" vehicles instead.\n\nRepresentatives from the Spanish and Catalan government are meeting to determine the terrorist threat level for the country and its Catalan region, after Barcelona and the southern resort town of Cambrils were hit with terrorist attacks.\n\nFollowing the Thursday afternoon and early Friday morning attacks that killed 14 people and wounded more than a hundred, Spain's threat level is now four on a scale that goes to five, a ranking that would warrant military deployments.\n\nAuthorities say the attacks were the work of a large terrorist cell that had been plotting for a long time from a house in Alcanar, 200 kilometers (124 miles) down the coast from Barcelona.\n\nSenior police official Josep Lluis Trapero said that an apparently accidental butane gas explosion at the house, which killed one person, likely prevented the suspects from carrying out a far deadlier attack.\n\nThe Philippines government says a child missing after a vehicle plowed into pedestrians in Barcelona is the 7-year-old son of a Filipino woman who had been living in Australia.\n\nThe Philippines' Foreign Affairs Undersecretary for Migrant Workers Affairs Sarah Arriola said in a statement on Saturday that the 43-year-old Filipino woman was seriously injured in Thursday's attack. She had been based in Australia for the past three or four years.\n\nArriola says the woman and her son were in Barcelona to attend the wedding of a cousin from the Philippines.\n\nArriola says the woman's British husband is en route to Barcelona to help find his son.

Turnbull says the boy's family is searching for him.

They provided no further information.\n\nAuthorities launched a manhunt for members of what they believe to be a Catalonia-based extremist group after 14 people were killed and more than 100 injured in attacks in Barcelona on Thursday and in Cambrils, south of Barcelona, on Friday.\n\nOfficials say at least one suspect is still at large.\n\nPolice say they have identified the five people, presumed to be the attackers, shot to death by police in the Cambrils incident but gave no details.\n\nFour people have been arrested as part of the investigation.\n\nSurveillance video from inside a Barcelona museum captured images of the van used in the fatal attack on pedestrians speeding down the Las Ramblas promenade where 13 people were killed and many more were wounded.\n\nThe video shows a person with a stroller just barely getting out of the white van's way and other people on the walkway scattering as it barreled down the walkway.\n\nThe footage was shot Thursday from a security camera inside the Erotic Museum of Barcelona on an upper floor that pointed toward a window with a view of the promenade.\n\nMuseum goers who apparently either heard the van or people outside just after it went by are seen in the images gathering near the window and looking outside.\n\nAuthorities said the assailants after striking in Barcelona drove a second vehicle to the resort town of Cambrils and fatally injured one person early Friday morning.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has personally offered his condolences to Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy after Thursday's deadly van attacks in Barcelona and Cambrils.\n\nThe White House says Trump pledged to support Spanish authorities in their investigation and in bringing the perpetrators to justice.\n\nTrump initially offered supportive words to Spain in a tweet Thursday after a van plowed through pedestrians in Barcelona.

attack suspects are denouncing terrorism.\n\nThe families from Ripoll, where the entire Islamic State cell behind the deadly attacks in Barcelona and a seaside town is believed to have originated, arrived in a group Saturday in the town's central square. Mothers and sisters tearfully insisted they did not know what had happened to their sons and brothers.\n\nPolice on Saturday searched the home of a missing imam who is believed to have been the group's ideological leader. The imam hasn't been seen in Ripoll since June, according to the mosque where he abruptly quit his job.\n\nAn official with knowledge of the investigation said authorities are looking into whether the imam was killed Wednesday in a botched bomb-making operation in a house south of Barcelona.\n\nA police official in Spain says an imam whose home was searched as part of the investigation into two deadly vehicle attacks is believed to be the radicalizing force behind the cell of young men - and is now thought to have died in an explosion linked to the attacks.\n\nThe official spoke on condition of anonymity to reveal details of the new suspicions surrounding imam Abdelbaki Es Satty. Officials in Es Satty's former mosque in the northern town of Ripoll, which he left abruptly in June, on Saturday denounced the attacks in Barcelona and a nearby seaside town.\n\nThe mosque president, Ali Yassine, said Es Satty told him he wanted to return to Morocco for three months and hasn't seen him since. The police official says Es Satty is believed to have died in an explosion Wednesday that destroyed a house south of Barcelona.\n\nThe two vehicle attacks in Spain left 14 dead and over 120 wounded. Possible suspects whose names have emerged so far in the investigation are all from Ripoll.\n\nThe Muslim community in the northern Spanish town of Ripoll has condemned the two deadly vehicle attacks that have been blamed on some local Moroccans.\n\nIn a notice posted on a Ripoll mosque Saturday, the Annour Islamic Community of Ripoll said it wanted to offer its sympathy to the families of the victims and its solidarity with Barcelona, Catalonia and Spain.\n\nIt said: \"Faced with this criminal act, the Annour Islamic Community of Ripoll reiterates its complete commitment to the fight against any form of terrorism, and we hope that those responsible for this attack are arrested and taken before a judge as soon as possible.\"\n\nMost of the main suspects in the twin attacks were Moroccans from Ripoll. The attacks in Barcelona and the seaside resort of Cambrils left 14 people dead and over 120 injured.\n\nCatalan emergency services say they have identified seven of the 14 people killed in the attacks in Barcelona and the nearby seaside town of Cambrils.\n\nOf the 13 dead from the Barcelona attack, officials have identified four Spaniards, two Portuguese and one Italian. Family members or government officials also say an American man, another Italian man and a woman from Belgium were also killed there.\n\nThe one fatality from the attack in Cambrils was a Spanish woman.\n\nThe emergency service says Saturday that 54 people remained in the hospital, 12 of them in critical condition. They say 78 people have been released after being treated.\n\nExcavation work is continuing at a house south of Barcelona where, according to Spanish police, members of an Islamic extremist cell plotted their attacks.\n\nThe deputy mayor of Alcanar, Jordi Bort, says police are trying to determine if any explosives were still in the house, and to secure them through controlled explosions.\n\nThe house was effectively destroyed on Wednesday during an accidental explosion. Authorities had initially dismissed the blast as a household gas accident, but now say it appears to be related to the plans for an even more deadly attack involving gas or explosives.\n\nOne person was killed during the Wednesday blast. Bort says police are also looking to determine if human remains found at the site belong to a second victim. Bort says so far positive identification hasn't been possible because DNA results haven't come in yet.\n\nMuslims in the hometown of suspects arrested over last week's attacks in Spain have expressed their condolences to the victims.\n\nIn a note posted Saturday on the door of the mosque in Ripoll, a quiet, upscale town of 10,000 about 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of Barcelona, the community said it condemned the attack.\n\nIt said \"The Annour Islamic Community of Ripoll expresses its strongest condemnation and rejection of the terrorist attack committed on Thursday in Barcelona.\n\n\"Catalan Muslims express their sympathy for the families of the victims, wishing for the complete recovery of the injured, and offering their solidarity with the people of Barcelona, Catalonia and Spain.\n\n\"Faced with this criminal act, the Annour Islamic Community of Ripoll reiterates its complete commitment to the fight against any form of terrorism, and we hope that those responsible for this attack are arrested and taken before a judge as soon as possible.\"\n\nSpain's king and queen have visited the victims of the van attack in Barcelona who are recovering in local hospitals.\n\nA video posted on the Royal House Twitter account shows King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia visiting patients and speaking with the medical staff of Barcelona's Hospital del Mar.\n\nThe royal couple visited one family in which two children and their father were recovering from wounds received when a van plowed down the city's main pedestrian promenade, killing 13 people and injuring 120 on Thursday.\n\nA separate car attack a few hours later in the nearby coastal town of Cambrils killed one person and injured five early Friday.\n\nCatalonia's emergency services say by Saturday, 54 people remained in the hospital, with 12 of them in critical condition, from both attacks.\n\nCatalan police are confirming that the manhunt underway for any remaining members of the Islamic extremist cell is focusing on Younes Abouyaaquoub, a 22-year-old Moroccan.\n\nPolice spokesman Albert Oliva says police have carried out nine searches of apartments in Ripoll, the northern Catalan town where Abouyaaquoub and other suspects lived.\n\nOliva said Saturday: \"We can confirm that the manhunt is on for the person\" identified in the media. Spanish media have named Abouyaaquoub as the presumed ringleader of the cell and driver of the van that plowed into pedestrians in Barcelona.\n\nSpanish Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido has declared that the cell was effectively broken after five members were killed, four were in detention and as many as two were killed in a previous explosion. That leaves only one remaining member: Abouyaaquoub.\n\nItaly's foreign ministry is confirming a third Italian was killed in the dual attacks in Spain.\n\nThe ministry said in a statement Saturday that Carmen Lopardo, 80, was killed in the \"vile terrorist attack in Barcelona.\"\n\nNews reports said Lopardo had immigrated to Argentina in 1950 and was visiting Barcelona.\n\nTwo other Italians were among the 14 dead: Bruno Gulotta, 35, and Luca Russo, 25.\n\nA small group of Muslims have gathered at Barcelona's Las Ramblas promenade to insist they aren't terrorists in the wake of the twin vehicle attacks that killed 14 people and injured dozens.\n\nThe protest by about 100 members of Barcelona's Muslim community was held at the Canaletas Fountain at the top of the promenade.\n\nThey shouted \"We are not terrorists\" and \"Islam is peace.\"\n\nCatalan's Moroccan community, in particular, has been in the spotlight after the four main suspects in the attacks claimed Moroccan roots.\n\nPortugal's prime minister says a 20-year-old woman from Lisbon is among those killed in the Barcelona attacks.\n\nThe woman, whose 74-year-old grandmother was also killed in Thursday's attack on Las Ramblas, had initially been considered missing but Prime Minister Antonio Costa confirmed her death in a statement to reporters Saturday.\n\nPortuguese media reported that the two were in Barcelona to celebrate the grandmother's birthday. Their names were not released.\n\nThe two Portuguese women are among 14 people killed in car attacks on Barcelona and the town of Cambrils, as part of what authorities call a terrorist plot claimed by the Islamic State group.\n\nSpanish authorities have decided to maintain the country's terrorist threat rating at level 4, declaring that no new attacks were imminent.\n\nInterior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido says Saturday that the country would nevertheless reinforce security for events that draw large crowds and popular tourist sites.\n\nFrench police are carrying out extra border checks on people arriving from Spain as authorities search for a fugitive suspect in the Barcelona attacks.\n\nNo arrests had been made by Saturday morning, according to a French security official, who described the checks along the normally open border as routine whenever neighboring countries signal a potential risk.\n\nAnother French security official said Spanish authorities flagged a Kangoo utility vehicle believed to have been rented in Spain by a suspect in Thursday's attacks and that may have crossed the nearby border into France.\n\nBoth officials were not authorized to be publicly named.\n\nAt multiple border posts in the winding roads crossing the western Pyrenees on Saturday, gendarmes stopped certain vehicles to check drivers' IDs and the contents of their cars. They targeted primarily vans, trucks and utility vehicles.\n\nCatalan police say they are carrying out controlled explosions in the town where an extremist cell plotted the attacks in Barcelona and a seaside resort.\n\nIn a tweet Saturday, police urged residents of Alcanar not to be alarmed by the detonations in the town, where they believe the extremists rented a house used to prepare their attacks.\n\nThe house was destroyed by an apparently accidental explosion on Wednesday. Police believe the blast actually prevented a far more deadlier attack using explosives, forcing the extremists to use more \"rudimentary\" vehicles instead.\n\nRepresentatives from the Spanish and Catalan government are meeting to determine the terrorist threat level for the country and its Catalan region, after Barcelona and the southern resort town of Cambrils were hit with terrorist attacks.\n\nFollowing the Thursday afternoon and early Friday morning attacks that killed 14 people and wounded more than a hundred, Spain's threat level is now four on a scale that goes to five, a ranking that would warrant military deployments.\n\nAuthorities say the attacks were the work of a large terrorist cell that had been plotting for a long time from a house in Alcanar, 200 kilometers (124 miles) down the coast from Barcelona.\n\nSenior police official Josep Lluis Trapero said that an apparently accidental butane gas explosion at the house, which killed one person, likely prevented the suspects from carrying out a far deadlier attack.\n\nThe Philippines government says a child missing after a vehicle plowed into pedestrians in Barcelona is the 7-year-old son of a Filipino woman who had been living in Australia.\n\nThe Philippines' Foreign Affairs Undersecretary for Migrant Workers Affairs Sarah Arriola said in a statement on Saturday that the 43-year-old Filipino woman was seriously injured in Thursday's attack. She had been based in Australia for the past three or four years.\n\nArriola says the woman and her son were in Barcelona to attend the wedding of a cousin from the Philippines.\n\nArriola says the woman's British husband is en route to Barcelona to help find his son.

attack suspects are denouncing terrorism.\n\nThe families from Ripoll, where the entire Islamic State cell behind the deadly attacks in Barcelona and a seaside town is believed to have originated, arrived in a group Saturday in the town's central square. Mothers and sisters tearfully insisted they did not know what had happened to their sons and brothers.\n\nPolice on Saturday searched the home of a missing imam who is believed to have been the group's ideological leader. The imam hasn't been seen in Ripoll since June, according to the mosque where he abruptly quit his job.\n\nAn official with knowledge of the investigation said authorities are looking into whether the imam was killed Wednesday in a botched bomb-making operation in a house south of Barcelona.\n\n-- -- --\n\n5:40 p.m.\n\nA police official in Spain says an imam whose home was searched as part of the investigation into two deadly vehicle attacks is believed to be the radicalizing force behind the cell of young men -- and is now thought to have died in an explosion linked to the attacks.\n\nThe official spoke on condition of anonymity to reveal details of the new suspicions surrounding imam Abdelbaki Es Satty. Officials in Es Satty's former mosque in the northern town of Ripoll, which he left abruptly in June, on Saturday denounced the attacks in Barcelona and a nearby seaside town.\n\nThe mosque president, Ali Yassine, said Es Satty told him he wanted to return to Morocco for three months and hasn't seen him since. The police official says Es Satty is believed to have died in an explosion Wednesday that destroyed a house south of Barcelona.\n\nThe two vehicle attacks in Spain left 14 dead and over 120 wounded. Possible suspects whose names have emerged so far in the investigation are all from Ripoll.\n\n-- By Joseph Wilson, Alex Oller and Lori Hinnant\n\n-- -- --\n\n5:10 p.m.\n\nThe Muslim community in the northern Spanish town of Ripoll has condemned the two deadly vehicle attacks that have been blamed on some local Moroccans.\n\nIn a notice posted on a Ripoll mosque Saturday, the Annour Islamic Community of Ripoll said it wanted to offer its sympathy to the families of the victims and its solidarity with Barcelona, Catalonia and Spain.\n\nIt said: \"Faced with this criminal act, the Annour Islamic Community of Ripoll reiterates its complete commitment to the fight against any form of terrorism, and we hope that those responsible for this attack are arrested and taken before a judge as soon as possible.\"\n\nMost of the main suspects in the twin attacks were Moroccans from Ripoll. The attacks in Barcelona and the seaside resort of Cambrils left 14 people dead and over 120 injured.\n\n-- -- --\n\n4:25 p.m.\n\nCatalan emergency services say they have identified seven of the 14 people killed in the attacks in Barcelona and the nearby seaside town of Cambrils.\n\nOf the 13 dead from the Barcelona attack, officials have identified four Spaniards, two Portuguese and one Italian. Family members or government officials also say an American man, another Italian man and a woman from Belgium were also killed there.\n\nThe one fatality from the attack in Cambrils was a Spanish woman.\n\nThe emergency service says Saturday that 54 people remained in the hospital, 12 of them in critical condition. They say 78 people have been released after being treated.\n\n-- -- --\n\n3:45 p.m.\n\nExcavation work is continuing at a house south of Barcelona where, according to Spanish police, members of an Islamic extremist cell plotted their attacks.\n\nThe deputy mayor of Alcanar, Jordi Bort, says police are trying to determine if any explosives were still in the house, and to secure them through controlled explosions.\n\nThe house was effectively destroyed on Wednesday during an accidental explosion. Authorities had initially dismissed the blast as a household gas accident, but now say it appears to be related to the plans for an even more deadly attack involving gas or explosives.\n\nOne person was killed during the Wednesday blast. Bort says police are also looking to determine if human remains found at the site belong to a second victim. Bort says so far positive identification hasn't been possible because DNA results haven't come in yet.\n\n-- -- --\n\n3:30 p.m.\n\nMuslims in the hometown of suspects arrested over last week's attacks in Spain have expressed their condolences to the victims.\n\nIn a note posted Saturday on the door of the mosque in Ripoll, a quiet, upscale town of 10,000 about 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of Barcelona, the community said it condemned the attack.\n\nIt said \"The Annour Islamic Community of Ripoll expresses its strongest condemnation and rejection of the terrorist attack committed on Thursday in Barcelona.\n\n\"Catalan Muslims express their sympathy for the families of the victims, wishing for the complete recovery of the injured, and offering their solidarity with the people of Barcelona, Catalonia and Spain.\n\n\"Faced with this criminal act, the Annour Islamic Community of Ripoll reiterates its complete commitment to the fight against any form of terrorism, and we hope that those responsible for this attack are arrested and taken before a judge as soon as possible.\"\n\n-- -- --\n\n2:55 p.m.\n\nSpain's king and queen have visited the victims of the van attack in Barcelona who are recovering in local hospitals.\n\nA video posted on the Royal House Twitter account shows King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia visiting patients and speaking with the medical staff of Barcelona's Hospital del Mar.\n\nThe royal couple visited one family in which two children and their father were recovering from wounds received when a van plowed down the city's main pedestrian promenade, killing 13 people and injuring 120 on Thursday.\n\nA separate car attack a few hours later in the nearby coastal town of Cambrils killed one person and injured five early Friday.\n\nCatalonia's emergency services say by Saturday, 54 people remained in the hospital, with 12 of them in critical condition, from both attacks.\n\n-- -- --\n\n2:15 p.m.\n\nCatalan police are confirming that the manhunt underway for any remaining members of the Islamic extremist cell is focusing on Younes Abouyaaquoub, a 22-year-old Moroccan.\n\nPolice spokesman Albert Oliva says police have carried out nine searches of apartments in Ripoll, the northern Catalan town where Abouyaaquoub and other suspects lived.\n\nOliva said Saturday: \"We can confirm that the manhunt is on for the person\" identified in the media. Spanish media have named Abouyaaquoub as the presumed ringleader of the cell and driver of the van that plowed into pedestrians in Barcelona.\n\nSpanish Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido has declared that the cell was effectively broken after five members were killed, four were in detention and as many as two were killed in a previous explosion. That leaves only one remaining member: Abouyaaquoub.\n\n-- -- --\n\n2:00 p.m.\n\nItaly's foreign ministry is confirming a third Italian was killed in the dual attacks in Spain.\n\nThe ministry said in a statement Saturday that Carmen Lopardo, 80, was killed in the \"vile terrorist attack in Barcelona.\"\n\nNews reports said Lopardo had immigrated to Argentina in 1950 and was visiting Barcelona.\n\nTwo other Italians were among the 14 dead: Bruno Gulotta, 35, and Luca Russo, 25.\n\n-- -- --\n\n1:45 p.m.\n\nA small group of Muslims have gathered at Barcelona's Las Ramblas promenade to insist they aren't terrorists in the wake of the twin vehicle attacks that killed 14 people and injured dozens.\n\nThe protest by about 100 members of Barcelona's Muslim community was held at the Canaletas Fountain at the top of the promenade.\n\nThey shouted \"We are not terrorists\" and \"Islam is peace.\"\n\nCatalan's Moroccan community, in particular, has been in the spotlight after the four main suspects in the attacks claimed Moroccan roots.\n\n-- -- --\n\n1:30 p.m.\n\nPortugal's prime minister says a 20-year-old woman from Lisbon is among those killed in the Barcelona attacks.\n\nThe woman, whose 74-year-old grandmother was also killed in Thursday's attack on Las Ramblas, had initially been considered missing but Prime Minister Antonio Costa confirmed her death in a statement to reporters Saturday.\n\nPortuguese media reported that the two were in Barcelona to celebrate the grandmother's birthday. Their names were not released.\n\nThe two Portuguese women are among 14 people killed in car attacks on Barcelona and the town of Cambrils, as part of what authorities call a terrorist plot claimed by the Islamic State group.\n\n-- -- --\n\n1:15 p.m.\n\nSpanish authorities have decided to maintain the country's terrorist threat rating at level 4, declaring that no new attacks were imminent.\n\nInterior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido says Saturday that the country would nevertheless reinforce security for events that draw large crowds and popular tourist sites.\n\n-- -- --\n\n11:45 a.m.\n\nFrench police are carrying out extra border checks on people arriving from Spain as authorities search for a fugitive suspect in the Barcelona attacks.\n\nNo arrests had been made by Saturday morning, according to a French security official, who described the checks along the normally open border as routine whenever neighboring countries signal a potential risk.\n\nAnother French security official said Spanish authorities flagged a Kangoo utility vehicle believed to have been rented in Spain by a suspect in Thursday's attacks and that may have crossed the nearby border into France.\n\nBoth officials were not authorized to be publicly named.\n\nAt multiple border posts in the winding roads crossing the western Pyrenees on Saturday, gendarmes stopped certain vehicles to check drivers' IDs and the contents of their cars. They targeted primarily vans, trucks and utility vehicles.\n\n-- -- --\n\n10 a.m.\n\nCatalan police say they are carrying out controlled explosions in the town where an extremist cell plotted the attacks in Barcelona and a seaside resort.\n\nIn a tweet Saturday, police urged residents of Alcanar not to be alarmed by the detonations in the town, where they believe the extremists rented a house used to prepare their attacks.\n\nThe house was destroyed by an apparently accidental explosion on Wednesday. Police believe the blast actually prevented a far more deadlier attack using explosives, forcing the extremists to use more \"rudimentary\" vehicles instead.\n\n-- -- --\n\n9:30 a.m.\n\nRepresentatives from the Spanish and Catalan government are meeting to determine the terrorist threat level for the country and its Catalan region, after Barcelona and the southern resort town of Cambrils were hit with terrorist attacks.\n\nFollowing the Thursday afternoon and early Friday morning attacks that killed 14 people and wounded more than a hundred, Spain's threat level is now four on a scale that goes to five, a ranking that would warrant military deployments.\n\nAuthorities say the attacks were the work of a large terrorist cell that had been plotting for a long time from a house in Alcanar, 200 kilometers (124 miles) down the coast from Barcelona.\n\nSenior police official Josep Lluis Trapero said that an apparently accidental butane gas explosion at the house, which killed one person, likely prevented the suspects from carrying out a far deadlier attack.\n\n-- -- --\n\n9:15 a.m.\n\nThe Philippines government says a child missing after a vehicle plowed into pedestrians in Barcelona is the 7-year-old son of a Filipino woman who had been living in Australia.\n\nThe Philippines' Foreign Affairs Undersecretary for Migrant Workers Affairs Sarah Arriola said in a statement on Saturday that the 43-year-old Filipino woman was seriously injured in Thursday's attack. She had been based in Australia for the past three or four years.\n\nArriola says the woman and her son were in Barcelona to attend the wedding of a cousin from the Philippines.\n\nArriola says the woman's British husband is en route to Barcelona to help find his son. Arriola says the boy was separated from his mother during the attack.\n\nAustralia's prime minister has urged people to pray for the child.\n\n-- -- --\n\n5:15 a.m.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has asked people to pray for a young Australian boy who is missing after a vehicle attack on a popular Barcelona promenade that killed 13 people.\n\nTurnbull said Saturday that the boy's mother was badly injured and is in a hospital following Friday's attack at the Las Ramblas promenade. Turnbull says the boy's family is searching for him. He did not release the boy's name.\n\nTurnbull says: \"All of us as parents know the anguish his father is going through, and his whole family is going through, as they rush to seek to find him in Barcelona.\"\n\nAustralian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop says four Australians were injured in the attack.\n\n-- -- --\n\n2:35 a.m.\n\nPolice in Catalonia say they have searched two buses in their hunt for violent extremists believed responsible for a pair of deadly attacks in the northwestern region of Spain.\n\nPolice say on their Twitter feed that they searched the buses in Girona and Garrigas, towns in the northwest of Catalonia, but the operation yielded nothing of importance. They provided no further information.\n\nAuthorities launched a manhunt for members of what they believe to be a Catalonia-based extremist group after 14 people were killed and more than 100 injured in attacks in Barcelona on Thursday and in Cambrils, south of Barcelona, on Friday.\n\nOfficials say at least one suspect is still at large.\n\nPolice say they have identified the five people, presumed to be the attackers, shot to death by police in the Cambrils incident but gave no details.\n\nFour people have been arrested as part of the investigation.\n\n-- -- --\n\n12:50 a.m.\n\nSurveillance video from inside a Barcelona museum captured images of the van used in the fatal attack on pedestrians speeding down the Las Ramblas promenade where 13 people were killed and many more were wounded.\n\nThe video shows a person with a stroller just barely getting out of the white van's way and other people on the walkway scattering as it barreled down the walkway.\n\nThe footage was shot Thursday from a security camera inside the Erotic Museum of Barcelona on an upper floor that pointed toward a window with a view of the promenade.\n\nMuseum goers who apparently either heard the van or people outside just after it went by are seen in the images gathering near the window and looking outside.\n\nAuthorities said the assailants after striking in Barcelona drove a second vehicle to the resort town of Cambrils and fatally injured one person early Friday morning.\n\nPolice shot five of those attackers dead.\n\n-- -- --\n\n12:10 a.m. Saturday\n\nPresident Donald Trump has personally offered his condolences to Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy after Thursday's deadly van attacks in Barcelona and Cambrils.\n\nThe White House says Trump pledged to support Spanish authorities in their investigation and in bringing the perpetrators to justice.\n\nTrump initially offered supportive words to Spain in a tweet Thursday after a van plowed through pedestrians in Barcelona. Thirteen people were killed. The State Department says at least one American was killed and one was injured in that attack.\n\nOne person was killed in a separate van attack in Cambrils, Spain", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-3374007", "id": "10090467", "url": "http://www.dothaneagle.com/news/ap/world/the-latest-families-of-attack-suspects-denounce-terrorism/article_9cce3417-ad39-5989-a3b7-5d474a589169.html", "sim": 0.7176470756530762, "details": {}, "uri": "711987890", "extractedDates": null, "eventUri": "eng-3374007", "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/dothaneagle.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/eb/8eb37fed-203d-567a-9613-883200a3006a/599875e7ecb2e.image.jpg?resize=512%2C341", "timeCrawl": "17:42:00", "isDuplicate": false, "dateTime": "2017-08-19T17:42:00Z", "lang": "eng", "title": "The Latest: Families of attack suspects denounce terrorism", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "id": 161}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "id": 164}], "time": "17:42:00", "source": {"uri": "dothaneagle.com", "title": "Dothan Eagle", "id": "11193"}, "date": "2017-08-19", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19"}

A French security official also told Associated Press that Spain had flagged a Renault Kangoo utility vehicle - believed to have been rented by a suspect - that could have already crossed the border.\n\nSpanish police are still hunting Younes Abouyaaquoub, a 22-year-old Moroccan thought to have been the driver in the 17 August attack in Barcelona, which left 14 dead and 120 injured.\n\nHe is the presumed ringleader of a 12-strong terror cell police say also orchestrated a similar vehicle attack in Cambrils early 18 August morning, which killed one woman and injured five other people.\n\nThe Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for both attacks. Police in Spain said they had effectively dismantled the terror cell, with all but one of its members in custody or dead.\n\nThe hunt for Abouyaaquoub has now led to fears the terror suspect could take advantage of passport-free Schengen border area to further evade police and slip into France.\n\nAcross the Pyrenees, French police have carried out extra border checks on people coming from Spain. Authorities fear the lone suspect on-the-run will try to cause as much violence as possible as he nears capture. \"There is the danger they will not let themselves get caught and will do something dramatic,\" said Alain Chouet, a former French intelligence official.\n\nMeanwhile, in Spain the investigation has focused on a house in Alcanar, 200 kilometres (125 miles) down the coast from Barcelona. Police say the terror cell was planning a more sophisticated, and potentially more deadly, attack by using the house to prepare an explosive device.\n\nThey are believed to have chosen a simpler approach in using vehicles after preparations went awry when an explosion ripped through the house on 16 August, killing up to two people.\n\nPolice have also carried out nine searches of apartments in Ripoll, the northern Catalan town where Abouyaaquoub and other suspects lived. This reportedly included a raid on an imam's home.\n\nSpanish Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido said the terror cell had now effectively been dismantled, with five suspects killed in Cambrils, four suspects in detention and up to two other members killed in Wednesday's explosion.\n\nAmong those killed in Cambrils is 17-year-old Moussa Oukabir, who had previously been named as a prime suspect in the Barcelona attack. His brother, Driss, reported his documents stolen to police in Ripoll. They were found in one of the vehicles used in the attacks, Ripoll's mayor confirmed.\n\nThe brothers were born and raised in Ripoll, where the family's first-floor apartment was searched on 18 August.\n\nNeighbours said they were shocked by the news of Moussa Oukabir's alleged involvement. One teenager, who identified himself only by his first name, Pau, said they played together when they were younger and he was \"a good boy\".\n\nIn addition to the five people killed in Cambrils, police said they arrested two people Friday, after two arrests a day earlier. In custody are three Moroccans and one Spaniard, none with terrorism-related records.\n\n\"We are not talking about a group of one or two people, but rather a numerous group,\" regional Interior Ministry chief Joaquim Forn told Onda Cero radio. The sheer size of the cell recalled the November 2015 attacks in Paris, in which trained Islamic State attackers struck the national stadium, a concert hall and bars and restaurants nearly simultaneously.\n\nSince then, the extremist group, also known as Daesh, has steadily lost ground in its self-declared caliphate in Iraq and Syria, most recently with its defeat in Mosul. \"This shows there is no correlation between what is happening over there with Daesh and the operational capacity of the group,\" said Jean-Charles Brisard, a French security analyst.\n\nThe attacks have unnerved a country that hasn't seen an Islamic extremist attack since 2004, when al-Qaeda-inspired bombers killed 191 people in coordinated assaults on Madrid's commuter trains.\n\nUnlike France, Britain, Sweden and Germany, Spain has largely been spared, thanks in part to a crackdown that has netted about 200 suspected jihadis in recent years.\n\nOn 19 August, Spain decided to maintain its terrorist threat alert at level 4, declaring that no new attacks were imminent. Interior Minister Zoido said the country would nevertheless reinforce security for events that draw large crowds and popular tourist sites.", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-3374007", "id": "10069112", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/french-police-fear-spain-terror-suspect-younes-abouyaaquoub-could-slip-across-schengen-border-1635763", "sim": 0.7137255072593689, "details": {}, "uri": "711930468", "extractedDates": [{"date": "2017-08-17", "textEnd": 628, "textStart": 619, "imp": true, "amb": false}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-18", "textStart": 816, "freq": 2, "textEnd": 825}, {"date": "2017-08-16", "textEnd": 2056, "textStart": 2047, "imp": true, "amb": false}, {"date": "2017-08-19", "textEnd": 4446, "textStart": 4437, "imp": true, "amb": false}, {"date": "2015-11-", "textStart": 3553, "textEnd": 3566, "amb": false}], "eventUri": "eng-3374007", "image": "https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1631898/third-suspect-arrested-involvement-terror-attacks-spain.png", "timeCrawl": "14:23:00", "isDuplicate": false, "dateTime": "2017-08-19T14:23:00Z", "lang": "eng", "title": "French police fear Spain terror suspect Younes Abouyaaquoub could slip across Schengen border", "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "id": 161}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "id": 164}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "id": 203}], "time": "14:23:00", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.co.uk", "title": "International Business Times UK", "id": "713"}, "date": "2017-08-19", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19"}

are denouncing terrorism.\n\nThe families from Ripoll, where the entire Islamic State cell behind the deadly attacks in Barcelona and a seaside town is believed to have originated, arrived in a group Saturday in the town's central square. Mothers and sisters tearfully insisted they did not know what had happened to their sons and brothers.\n\nPolice on Saturday searched the home of a missing imam who is believed to have been the group's ideological leader. The imam hasn't been seen in Ripoll since June, according to the mosque where he abruptly quit his job.\n\nAn official with knowledge of the investigation said authorities are looking into whether the imam was killed Wednesday in a botched bomb-making operation in a house south of Barcelona.\n\nA police official in Spain says an imam whose home was searched as part of the investigation into two deadly vehicle attacks is believed to be the radicalizing force behind the cell of young men -- and is now thought to have died in an explosion linked to the attacks.\n\nThe official spoke on condition of anonymity to reveal details of the new suspicions surrounding imam Abdelbaki Es Satty. Officials in Es Satty's former mosque in the northern town of Ripoll, which he left abruptly in June, on Saturday denounced the attacks in Barcelona and a nearby seaside town.\n\nThe mosque president, Ali Yassine, said Es Satty told him he wanted to return to Morocco for three months and hasn't seen him since. The police official says Es Satty is believed to have died in an explosion Wednesday that destroyed a house south of Barcelona.\n\nThe two vehicle attacks in Spain left 14 dead and over 120 wounded. Possible suspects whose names have emerged so far in the investigation are all from Ripoll.\n\nThe Muslim community in the northern Spanish town of Ripoll has condemned the two deadly vehicle attacks that have been blamed on some local Moroccans.\n\nIn a notice posted on a Ripoll mosque Saturday, the Annour Islamic Community of Ripoll said it wanted to offer its sympathy to the families of the victims and its solidarity with Barcelona, Catalonia and Spain.\n\nIt said: \"Faced with this criminal act, the Annour Islamic Community of Ripoll reiterates its complete commitment to the fight against any form of terrorism, and we hope that those responsible for this attack are arrested and taken before a judge as soon as possible.\"\n\nMost of the main suspects in the twin attacks were Moroccans from Ripoll. The attacks in Barcelona and the seaside resort of Cambrils left 14 people dead and over 120 injured.\n\nCatalan emergency services say they have identified seven of the 14 people killed in the attacks in Barcelona and the nearby seaside town of Cambrils.\n\nOf the 13 dead from the Barcelona attack, officials have identified four Spaniards, two Portuguese and one Italian. Family members or government officials also say an American man, another Italian man and a woman from Belgium were also killed there.\n\nThe one fatality from the attack in Cambrils was a Spanish woman.\n\nThe emergency service says Saturday that 54 people remained in the hospital, 12 of them in critical condition. They say 78 people have been released after being treated.\n\nExcavation work is continuing at a house south of Barcelona where, according to Spanish police, members of an Islamic extremist cell plotted their attacks.\n\nThe deputy mayor of Alcanar, Jordi Bort, says police are trying to determine if any explosives were still in the house, and to secure them through controlled explosions.\n\nThe house was effectively destroyed on Wednesday during an accidental explosion. Authorities had initially dismissed the blast as a household gas accident, but now say it appears to be related to the plans for an even more deadly attack involving gas or explosives.\n\nOne person was killed during the Wednesday blast. Bort says police are also looking to determine if human remains found at the site belong to a second victim. Bort says so far positive identification hasn't been possible because DNA results haven't come in yet.\n\nMuslims in the hometown of suspects arrested over last week's attacks in Spain have expressed their condolences to the victims.\n\nIn a note posted Saturday on the door of the mosque in Ripoll, a quiet, upscale town of 10,000 about 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of Barcelona, the community said it condemned the attack.\n\nIt said \"The Annour Islamic Community of Ripoll expresses its strongest condemnation and rejection of the terrorist attack committed on Thursday in Barcelona.\n\n\"Catalan Muslims express their sympathy for the families of the victims, wishing for the complete recovery of the injured, and offering their solidarity with the people of Barcelona, Catalonia and Spain.\n\n\"Faced with this criminal act, the Annour Islamic Community of Ripoll reiterates its complete commitment to the fight against any form of terrorism, and we hope that those responsible for this attack are arrested and taken before a judge as soon as possible.\"\n\nSpain's king and queen have visited the victims of the van attack in Barcelona who are recovering in local hospitals.\n\nA video posted on the Royal House Twitter account shows King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia visiting patients and speaking with the medical staff of Barcelona's Hospital del Mar.\n\nThe royal couple visited one family in which two children and their father were recovering from wounds received when a van plowed down the city's main pedestrian promenade, killing 13 people and injuring 120 on Thursday.\n\nA separate car attack a few hours later in the nearby coastal town of Cambrils killed one person and injured five early Friday.\n\nCatalonia's emergency services say by Saturday, 54 people remained in the hospital, with 12 of them in critical condition, from both attacks.\n\nCatalan police are confirming that the manhunt underway for any remaining members of the Islamic extremist cell is focusing on Younes Abouyaaquoub, a 22-year-old Moroccan.\n\nPolice spokesman Albert Oliva says police have carried out nine searches of apartments in Ripoll, the northern Catalan town where Abouyaaquoub and other suspects lived.\n\nOliva said Saturday: \"We can confirm that the manhunt is on for the person\" identified in the media. Spanish media have named Abouyaaquoub as the presumed ringleader of the cell and driver of the van that plowed into pedestrians in Barcelona.\n\nSpanish Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido has declared that the cell was effectively broken after five members were killed, four were in detention and as many as two were killed in a previous explosion. That leaves only one remaining member: Abouyaaquoub.\n\nItaly's foreign ministry is confirming a third Italian was killed in the dual attacks in Spain.\n\nThe ministry said in a statement Saturday that Carmen Lopardo, 80, was killed in the \"vile terrorist attack in Barcelona.\"\n\nNews reports said Lopardo had immigrated to Argentina in 1950 and was visiting Barcelona.\n\nTwo other Italians were among the 14 dead: Bruno Gulotta, 35, and Luca Russo, 25.\n\nA small group of Muslims have gathered at Barcelona's Las Ramblas promenade to insist they aren't terrorists in the wake of the twin vehicle attacks that killed 14 people and injured dozens.\n\nThe protest by about 100 members of Barcelona's Muslim community was held at the Canaletas Fountain at the top of the promenade.\n\nThey shouted \"We are not terrorists\" and \"Islam is peace.\"\n\nCatalan's Moroccan community, in particular, has been in the spotlight after the four main suspects in the attacks claimed Moroccan roots.\n\nPortugal's prime minister says a 20-year-old woman from Lisbon is among those killed in the Barcelona attacks.\n\nThe woman, whose 74-year-old grandmother was also killed in Thursday's attack on Las Ramblas, had initially been considered missing but Prime Minister Antonio Costa confirmed her death in a statement to reporters Saturday.\n\nPortuguese media reported that the two were in Barcelona to celebrate the grandmother's birthday. Their names were not released.\n\nThe two Portuguese women are among 14 people killed in car attacks on Barcelona and the town of Cambrils, as part of what authorities call a terrorist plot claimed by the Islamic State group.\n\nSpanish authorities have decided to maintain the country's terrorist threat rating at level 4, declaring that no new attacks were imminent.\n\nInterior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido says Saturday that the country would nevertheless reinforce security for events that draw large crowds and popular tourist sites.\n\nFrench police are carrying out extra border checks on people arriving from Spain as authorities search for a fugitive suspect in the Barcelona attacks.\n\nNo arrests had been made by Saturday morning, according to a French security official, who described the checks along the normally open border as routine whenever neighboring countries signal a potential risk.\n\nAnother French security official said Spanish authorities flagged a Kangoo utility vehicle believed to have been rented in Spain by a suspect in Thursday's attacks and that may have crossed the nearby border into France.\n\nBoth officials were not authorized to be publicly named.\n\nAt multiple border posts in the winding roads crossing the western Pyrenees on Saturday, gendarmes stopped certain vehicles to check drivers' IDs and the contents of their cars. They targeted primarily vans, trucks and utility vehicles.\n\nCatalan police say they are carrying out controlled explosions in the town where an extremist cell plotted the attacks in Barcelona and a seaside resort.\n\nIn a tweet Saturday, police urged residents of Alcanar not to be alarmed by the detonations in the town, where they believe the extremists rented a house used to prepare their attacks.\n\nThe house was destroyed by an apparently accidental explosion on Wednesday. Police believe the blast actually prevented a far more deadlier attack using explosives, forcing the extremists to use more \"rudimentary\" vehicles instead.\n\nRepresentatives from the Spanish and Catalan government are meeting to determine the terrorist threat level for the country and its Catalan region, after Barcelona and the southern resort town of Cambrils were hit with terrorist attacks.\n\nFollowing the Thursday afternoon and early Friday morning attacks that killed 14 people and wounded more than a hundred, Spain's threat level is now four on a scale that goes to five, a ranking that would warrant military deployments.\n\nAuthorities say the attacks were the work of a large terrorist cell that had been plotting for a long time from a house in Alcanar, 200 kilometers (124 miles) down the coast from Barcelona.\n\nSenior police official Josep Lluis Trapero said that an apparently accidental butane gas explosion at the house, which killed one person, likely prevented the suspects from carrying out a far deadlier attack.\n\nThe Philippines government says a child missing after a vehicle plowed into pedestrians in Barcelona is the 7-year-old son of a Filipino woman who had been living in Australia.\n\nThe Philippines' Foreign Affairs Undersecretary for Migrant Workers Affairs Sarah Arriola said in a statement on Saturday that the 43-year-old Filipino woman was seriously injured in Thursday's attack. She had been based in Australia for the past three or four years.\n\nArriola says the woman and her son were in Barcelona to attend the wedding of a cousin from the Philippines.\n\nArriola says the woman's British husband is en route to Barcelona to help find his son. Arriola says the boy was separated from his mother during the attack.\n\nAustralia's prime minister has urged people to pray for the child.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has asked people to pray for a young Australian boy who is missing after a vehicle attack on a popular Barcelona promenade that killed 13 people.\n\nTurnbull said Saturday that the boy's mother was badly injured and is in a hospital following Friday's attack at the Las Ramblas promenade. Turnbull says the boy's family is searching for him. He did not release the boy's name.\n\nTurnbull says: \"All of us as parents know the anguish his father is going through, and his whole family is going through, as they rush to seek to find him in Barcelona.\"\n\nAustralian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop says four Australians were injured in the attack.\n\nPolice in Catalonia say they have searched two buses in their hunt for violent extremists believed responsible for a pair of deadly attacks in the northwestern region of Spain.\n\nPolice say on their Twitter feed that they searched the buses in Girona and Garrigas, towns in the northwest of Catalonia, but the operation yielded nothing of importance. They provided no further information.\n\nAuthorities launched a manhunt for members of what they believe to be a Catalonia-based extremist group after 14 people were killed and more than 100 injured in attacks in Barcelona on Thursday and in Cambrils, south of Barcelona, on Friday.\n\nOfficials say at least one suspect is still at large.\n\nPolice say they have identified the five people, presumed to be the attackers, shot to death by police in the Cambrils incident but gave no details.\n\nFour people have been arrested as part of the investigation.\n\nSurveillance video from inside a Barcelona museum captured images of the van used in the fatal attack on pedestrians speeding down the Las Ramblas promenade where 13 people were killed and many more were wounded.\n\nThe video shows a person with a stroller just barely getting out of the white van's way and other people on the walkway scattering as it barreled down the walkway.\n\nThe footage was shot Thursday from a security camera inside the Erotic Museum of Barcelona on an upper floor that pointed toward a window with a view of the promenade.\n\nMuseum goers who apparently either heard the van or people outside just after it went by are seen in the images gathering near the window and looking outside.\n\nAuthorities said the assailants after striking in Barcelona drove a second vehicle to the resort town of Cambrils and fatally injured one person early Friday morning.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has personally offered his condolences to Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy after Thursday's deadly van attacks in Barcelona and Cambrils.\n\nThe White House says Trump pledged to support Spanish authorities in their investigation and in bringing the perpetrators to justice.\n\nTrump initially offered supportive words to Spain in a tweet Thursday after a van plowed through pedestrians in Barcelona.

France searched Saturday for the supposed ringleader of an Islamic extremist cell that carried out vehicle attacks in Barcelona and a seaside resort, as the investigation focused on links among the Moroccan members and the house where they plotted the carnage.\n\nEarly Saturday, police searched two buses in northwest Catalonia in the hunt for any remaining members of the cell. Nothing was found in the searches in Girona and Garrigas, police tweeted.\n\nAcross the Pyrenees, French police carried out extra border checks on people coming from Spain -- a routine beefing-up of patrols anytime a neighboring country flags a potential risk, a French security official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. No arrests were made.\n\nPolice also announced a series of controlled explosions Saturday in the town of Alcanar, south of Barcelona, where the attacks were planned in a rental house destroyed Wednesday by an apparently accidental blast. Authorities had initially written off the incident as a household gas mishap, but took another look Friday and returned Saturday.\n\nPolice believe the Wednesday night blast, which killed at least one person and injured one of the people now in custody, actually prevented a far deadlier attack using explosives, forcing the extremists to use more \"rudimentary\" vehicles instead.\n\nIn a tweet Saturday, Catalan police urged Alcanar residents not to be alarmed by the controlled explosions.\n\nPolice also said tests were underway to determine if human remains found at the house on Friday were from a second victim.\n\nIn the carnage claimed by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, a van swerved onto Barcelona's historic Las Ramblas pedestrian promenade Thursday afternoon, killing 13 people and injuring more than 100 as it plowed down unsuspecting tourists and locals. A few hours later, five extremists began mowing down people along the boardwalk in the seaside resort of Cambrils.\n\nOne woman died and five others were injured before police shot and killed all five attackers. They were armed with an ax, knives and fake explosive belts.\n\nAuthorities said the two attacks were related and the work of a large terrorist cell that had been plotting for a long time from the house in Alcanar, 125 miles down the coast from Barcelona.\n\nOne of the main suspects in the attacks, Younes Abouyaaquoub, a 22-year-old Moroccan, was believed to be at large. His name figures on a police list of four main suspects sought in the attacks. All the suspects on the list hail from Ripoll, a quiet town of 10,000 north of Barcelona.\n\nOn Friday, police searched the apartment of Ripoll's imam, neighbors said. An apparent search warrant authorized police to extract any terrorism-related \"weapons, ammunition, explosives, instruments, documents or papers\" in the apartment.\n\nThe suspect list was issued throughout Spain and into France, according to a Spanish official and a French police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nAlso named on the list is 17-year-old Moussa Oukabir, whose brother Driss reported his documents stolen to police in Ripoll. Ripoll's mayor confirmed the documents were found in one of the vehicles used in the attacks.\n\n\"We are not talking about a group of one or two people, but rather a numerous group,\" said regional Interior Ministry chief Joaquim Forn.\n\nThe sheer size of the cell recalled the November 2015 attacks in Paris, in which trained ISIS attackers struck the national stadium, a concert hall and bars and restaurants nearly simultaneously.\n\nSpanish authorities had not yet found direct links between ISIS and the suspects in the Spanish attacks, but the possibility that members of the Spanish group could still be at large was chilling.", "eventUri": "eng-3374007", "timeCrawl": "20:16:00", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T20:16:00Z"}]}}}

Police were trying to determine whether Es Satty was killed in a botched bomb-making operation on Wednesday, the eve of the Barcelona bloodshed.\n\nHis former mosque has denounced the deadly attacks and weeping relatives marched into a Ripoll square on Saturday, tearfully denying any knowledge of the radical plans of their sons and brothers. At least one of the suspects is still on the run, and his younger brother has disappeared, as has the younger brother of one of the five attackers slain Friday by police.\n\nCatalan police said a manhunt was centered on Younes Abouyaaquoub, a 22-year-old Moroccan suspected of driving the van that plowed into a packed Barcelona promenade Thursday, killing 13 people and injuring 120. Another attack early Friday killed one person and wounded five in the resort of Cambrils.\n\nThe Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for both.\n\nEveryone so far known in the cell grew up in Ripoll, a town in the Catalan foothills near the French border 100 kilometers (62 miles) north of Barcelona. Spanish police searched nine homes in Ripoll, including Es Satty's, and two buses, and set up a roadblock that checked each car entering the town. Across the Pyrenees, French police carried out extra border checks on people coming in from Spain.\n\nNeighbors, family and even the mayor of Ripoll said they were shocked by news of the alleged involvement of the young men, whom all described as integrated Spanish and Catalan speakers with friends of all backgrounds.\n\nHalima Hychami, the weeping mother of Mohamed Hychami, one of the attackers named by police, said he told her he was leaving on vacation and would return Aug. 25. His younger brother, Omar, slept late Thursday and left mid-afternoon.\n\nMohamed Hychami is believed among the five attackers shot to death by police in Cambrils. She hasn't heard from Omar since he left.\n\n\"We found out by watching TV, same as all of you. They never talked about the imam. They were normal boys. They took care of me, booked my flight when I went on vacation. They all had jobs. They didn't steal. Never had a problem with me or anybody else. I can't understand it,\" she said.\n\nEven with Abouyaaquoub at large, Spanish Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido declared the cell \"broken\" Saturday. In addition to the five killed by police, four were in custody and one or two were killed in a house explosion Wednesday. He said there was no new imminent threat of attack.\n\nPolice also conducted a series of controlled explosions Saturday in the town of Alcanar, south of Barcelona, where the attacks were planned in house that was destroyed Wednesday by an explosion. Authorities had initially thought it was a gas accident, but took another look after the attacks.\n\nInitially, only one person was believed killed in the Wednesday blast. But officials said DNA tests were underway to determine if human remains found there Friday were from a second victim. A police official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing searches, said investigators believed the remains may belong to Es Satty.\n\nThe official said investigators also discovered ingredients of the explosive TATP, used by the Islamic State group in attacks in Paris and Brussels, as well as multiple butane tanks that the group may have wanted to combine with the homemade explosive and load into their vehicles.\n\nNeighbors on Saturday said they had seen three vehicles coming and going from the home, including an Audi used in the Cambrils attack and the van used in the Barcelona attack.\n\nThe president of the mosque where Es Satty preached, Ali Yassine, said he hadn't seen him since June, when he announced he was returning to Morocco for three months.\n\n\"He left the same way he came,\" said a bitter Wafa Marsi, a friend to many of the attackers, who appeared Saturday alongside their families to denounce terrorism.\n\nMembers of Ripoll's Muslim community denounced the vehicle attacks and offered their sympathy to the families of the victims.\n\nAuthorities said the two attacks were the work of a large terrorist cell that had been plotting for a long time from the house in Alcanar, 200 kilometers (125 miles) down the coast from Barcelona.\n\nThe lone named suspect still at large, Abouyaaquoub, figures on a police list of four main suspects sought in the attacks. Also on the list is 17-year-old Moussa Oukabir, whose brother Driss reported to police that his documents stolen. Ripoll's mayor confirmed that those documents were found in a vehicle used in the attacks. Moussa was one of the five radicals killed, and Driss is in custody, police said.\n\nCatalan regional police said they are mounting major road blocks throughout the northeastern region, warning people they may encounter traffic jams on different roads.\n\nA French police official said authorities were also looking for a Kangoo utility vehicle that was believed to have been rented in Spain by a suspect in the Barcelona attack that might have crossed the border.\n\nFatima Abouyaaquoub, sister-in-law of the Hychami brothers and the cousin of Younes Abouyaaquoub, said she found it all hard to believe.\n\n\"I'm still waiting for all of it to be a lie. I don't know if they were brainwashed or they gave them some type of medication or what. I can't explain it,\" she said.\n\nAbouyaaquoub's mother said his younger brother, Hussein, left home Thursday afternoon and hasn't returned.\n\nThe sheer size of the cell and the close family relations among the attackers recalled the November 2015 attacks in Paris, in which Islamic State attackers struck the national stadium, a Paris concert hall and bars and restaurants nearly simultaneously, leaving 130 people dead. Since then, the extremist group has steadily lost ground in its self-declared caliphate in Iraq and Syria.\n\nIslamic extremists have made a point of targeting Europe's major tourist attractions in recent years -- especially in rented or hijacked vehicles.\n\nYet Spain decided to keep its terrorist threat alert at level 4 -- out of five -- declaring Saturday that no new attacks were imminent. Zoido said the country would reinforce security for events that draw large crowds as well as at popular tourist sites.\n\nThe dead and wounded in the two attacks came from 34 countries. By late Saturday, the Catalan emergency service said 53 people remained hospitalized, 13 of them in critical condition.\n\nThe 14 people killed spanned generations -- from age 3 to age 80 -- and left behind devastated loved ones. They included a grandmother, 74, and her granddaughter, 20, from Portugal who were visiting Barcelona to celebrate a birthday; an Italian father who saved his children's lives but lost his own; an American man who was celebrating his first wedding anniversary in vibrant Barcelona.\n\nFrancisco Lopez Rodriguez, a 57-year-old Spaniard, was killed with his 3-year-old grand-nephew, Javier Martinez, while walking along the Las Ramblas promenade. His widow Roser is recovering from her wounds in a hospital.\n\n\"We are a broken family,\" niece Raquel Baron Lopez posted on Twitter.", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T03:23:00Z", "extractedDates":

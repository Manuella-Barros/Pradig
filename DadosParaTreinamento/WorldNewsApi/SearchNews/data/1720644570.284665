Cazorla was a big fan favourite at the Emirates during his six-year stint from 2012 to 2018, known for his hard-working attitude, versality and high technical ability. The 39-year-old, who won the Euros with Spain in 2008 and 2012, helped the Gunners land two FA Cup trophies and was Arsenal\u2019s Player of the Season in 2013. Cazorla left Arsenal six years ago for a third stint at Villarreal, and following a spell at Qatari side Al Sadd, the midfielder is now playing for Real Oviedo back in Spain. He could soon swap the second-tier of Spanish football to join Arsenal\u2019s coaching staff, though, with Cazorla expected to end his playing career this summer. \u2018I have a very special affection for Arsenal,\u2019 Cazorla told Sky Sports. \u2018I spent six wonderful years there and I know how much all the people love me there. \u2018Of course, I was fortunate to share a dressing room with Mikel Arteta and now he is the manager.

It is clear that Arsenal is a club that has always left the door open to me to return. \u2018But right now, I have enough on my mind with the play-offs and trying to enjoy the last days of my playing career.\u2019 Cazorla focused on promotion semi-final Santi Cazorla\u2019s boyhood club Real Oviedo face Eibar in the Spanish second division play-offs on Saturday, looking to clinch a spot in La Liga. \u2018It would be a great achievement [to get promoted] and a different achievement,\u2019 Cazorla said. \u2018When you play in your home, the feeling is different. I have been lucky to win trophies, with Spain and in England as well. But it\u2019s different when you\u2019re playing in front of your friends and family. \u2018You feel responsible because you are contributing to the club of your heart. The level of responsibility is different with that added pressure.\u2019 Arteta has certainly made no secret of his desire to add Cazorla to his coaching staff at Arsenal. \u2018Depending on the role. You know my sympathy for Santi,\u2019 the Arsenal boss said in April. \u2018We used to get on really, really well. \u2018I think he had an unbelievable energy that, as a coaching staff to have someone like that, that can trust with his knowledge, but his energy as well to the team. I think it\u2019s going to be valid.\u2019 Arsenal news, exclusives and analysisSign upPrivacy PolicyThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.", "summary": "'I have a very special affection for Arsenal.'", "url": "https://metro.co.uk/2024/06/08/arsenal-hero-confirms-spoken-mikel-arteta-making-emotional-return-20996708/", "image": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2153702204.jpg?quality=90&strip=all", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 12:38:44", "author": "Liam Grace", "authors": ["Liam Grace"], "language": "en", "catgory": "sports", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.321}

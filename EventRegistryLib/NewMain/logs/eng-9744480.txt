Violence pitting protesters against pro-government student groups and police soon spread to other cities. Six people had been reported killed on Tuesday, and hundreds more have been injured.\n\nAuthorities did not immediately confirm figures for the deaths.\n\nThe protesters are demanding an end to a quota system that reserves up to 30% of government jobs for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971.\n\nThey argue the system is discriminatory and benefits supporters of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, whose Awami League party led the independence movement, and they want it replaced with a merit-based system.\n\nHasina's party has accused opposition parties of stoking the violence.\n\nThe leading Dhaka-based newspaper Prothom Alo, which has a strong network of reporters across the country, said that by late Thursday night, they received reports of 19 deaths in Dhaka and elsewhere in the day's raging violence. The country's leading English-language Daily Star also reported 19 deaths on Thursday.\n\nProthom Alo said at least six people died in Dhaka's Uttara area alone in the latest clashes pitting the protesters against security officials and ruling party activists.

The attackers entered the building and set furniture on fire,\" the producer said by phone.\n\nHe said the station continued broadcasting, though some Dhaka residents said they were receiving no signal from the broadcaster.\n\nMeanwhile, the country was experiencing a near-total shutdown of internet services, Alp Toker, director of the London-based internet monitor NetBlocks, said on X.\n\nThe violence has continued despite a pending court decision on the legality of quota system. Hasina and Law Minister Anisul Huq urged protesters to await that decision, with Hasina saying she believes the protesters won't be disappointed by the court verdict. Huq said on Thursday that he would be willing to sit with protesters to discuss their demands.\n\nFollowing the first deaths in this week's violence on Tuesday, the government asked universities across the country to close in hopes of quelling the student unrest, and police raided the main opposition party's headquarters.\n\nProtesters responded Wednesday evening by saying they would enforce a \"complete shutdown\" of transportation across the country apart from emergency services on Thursday. The opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party said that it would join those efforts.\n\nClashes continued Thursday as protesters tried to enforce the shutdown. In Dhaka's Uttara neighborhood, police chased hundreds of protesters after they blocked a road and chanted. In other locations, police fired tear gas and charged with batons to disperse protesters, who threw stones in response.\n\nPolice said protesters vandalized police cars and set fire to a traffic police box. Scores of people, including police officers, were injured in the violence, the Dhaka Metropolitan Police said.\n\nProtesters also blocked some major highways across the country, and local broadcasters reported violence in other cities including Chattogram and Khulna.\n\nTraffic was thin on Dhaka's usually clogged streets, while many malls closed.

Rajib Dhar/Associated Press\n\nDHAKA, Bangladesh -- Police and government supporters clashed Thursday with student activists trying to shut down transportation across Bangladesh as part of dayslong protests over the allocation of government jobs, and media reports said 19 people died in the violence.\n\nThe new casualties Thursday would bring the overall toll to 25 dead since Monday when violence erupted at the prestigious Dhaka University in the capital. Violence pitting protesters against pro-government student groups and police soon spread to other cities. Six people had been reported killed on Tuesday, and hundreds more have been injured.\n\nAuthorities did not immediately confirm figures for the deaths.\n\nThe protesters are demanding an end to a quota system that reserves up to 30% of government jobs for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971.\n\nThey argue the system is discriminatory and benefits supporters of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, whose Awami League party led the independence movement, and they want it replaced with a merit-based system.\n\nHasina's party has accused opposition parties of stoking the violence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe leading Dhaka-based newspaper Prothom Alo, which has a strong network of reporters across the country, said that by late Thursday night, they received reports of 19 deaths in Dhaka and elsewhere in the day's raging violence. The country's leading English-language Daily Star also reported 19 deaths on Thursday.\n\nProthom Alo said at least six people died in Dhaka's Uttara area alone in the latest clashes pitting the protesters against security officials and ruling party activists. Thirteen others including a Dhaka-based journalist of an online portal died in other parts of the capital and elsewhere.\n\nProtesters attacked the head office of state-run Bangladesh Television, breaking through a main gate and setting vehicles and the reception area on fire, a news producer and a reporter told The Associated Press by phone. They spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.\n\n\"I escaped by leaping over the wall but some of my colleagues got stuck inside. The attackers entered the building and set furniture on fire,\" the producer said by phone.\n\nHe said the station continued broadcasting, though some Dhaka residents said they were receiving no signal from the broadcaster.\n\nMeanwhile, the country was experiencing a near-total shutdown of internet services, Alp Toker, director of the London-based internet monitor NetBlocks, said on X.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe violence has continued despite a pending court decision on the legality of quota system. Hasina and Law Minister Anisul Huq urged protesters to await that decision, with Hasina saying she believes the protesters won't be disappointed by the court verdict. Huq said on Thursday that he would be willing to sit with protesters to discuss their demands.\n\nFollowing the first deaths in this week's violence on Tuesday, the government asked universities across the country to close in hopes of quelling the student unrest, and police raided the main opposition party's headquarters.\n\nProtesters responded Wednesday evening by saying they would enforce a \"complete shutdown\" of transportation across the country apart from emergency services on Thursday. The opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party said that it would join those efforts.\n\nClashes continued Thursday as protesters tried to enforce the shutdown. In Dhaka's Uttara neighborhood, police chased hundreds of protesters after they blocked a road and chanted. In other locations, police fired tear gas and charged with batons to disperse protesters, who threw stones in response.\n\nPolice said protesters vandalized police cars and set fire to a traffic police box. Scores of people, including police officers, were injured in the violence, the Dhaka Metropolitan Police said.\n\nProtesters also blocked some major highways across the country, and local broadcasters reported violence in other cities including Chattogram and Khulna.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTraffic was thin on Dhaka's usually clogged streets, while many malls closed. Offices and banks opened, but transportation was limited. Police set up checkpoints at the entrances to Dhaka University.\n\nSalma Rahman, an official at a financial institution in Dhaka, said that she left her car at home and caught a ride on a motorcycle. \"Our office has alerted us to stay safe on the streets, as there is fear that violence could happen during the shutdown.\"\n\nHasina's government had earlier halted the job quotas following mass student protests in 2018. But last month, Bangladesh's High Court nullified that decision and reinstated the quotas after relatives of the 1971 veterans filed petitions, triggering the latest demonstrations.\n\nThe Supreme Court then suspended the High Court's ruling and said it would rule on the quotes by Aug. 7. The government has also appealed the High Court decision in the wake of the protests, according to the attorney general's office.\n\nHuq said the government was seeking an early hearing.\n\n\"I have already asked the attorney general to appeal in the Supreme Court on Sunday seeking early hearing,\" he told reporters. Friday and Saturday from the weekend in Bangladesh. The court opens on Sunday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHasina urged protesters in a televised address Wednesday evening to \"wait with patience\" for the court verdict. \"I believe our students will get justice from the apex court. They will not be disappointed.\"\n\nWhile job opportunities have expanded in Bangladesh's private sector, many people prefer government jobs because they are stable and well-paid. Each year, around 400,000 graduates compete for 3,000 jobs in the civil service exam.\n\nHasina said there would be a judicial investigation into Tuesday's deaths and vowed that those responsible would be brought to justice.\n\n\"Some precious lives have been lost unnecessarily,\" she said. \"I condemn every killing.\"\n\nU.N. Human Rights chief Volker T\u00fcrk posted on X that all acts of violence and deadly use of force must be investigated and the perpetrators held accountable. T\u00fcrk said freedom of expression and peaceful assembly are fundamental human rights.\n\nBangladesh's ruling party blamed the BNP for the chaos, and Dhaka police raided the party's headquarters late Tuesday. Detective Chief Harun-or-Rashid said police arrested seven members of the party's student wing, and said detectives found 100 crude bombs, 500 wooden and bamboo sticks, and five to six bottles of gasoline in the raid.\n\nRuhul Kabir Rizvi, a senior BNP leader, said the raid was a government attempt to divert attention from the protests.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nComments are not available on

File picture.\n\nPolice and security officials fired bullets and tear gas at protesters in Bangladesh on Friday, as internet and mobile services were cut off after days of deadly clashes over the allocation of government jobs.\n\nThe protests, which began weeks ago but escalated sharply on Monday, represent the biggest challenge to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina since she was won a fourth consecutive term in a January election that was boycotted by the main opposition parties.\n\nThe fresh clashes follow the bloodiest day of the protests to date, with local media reporting 22 people killed as protesting students attempted to impose a \"complete shutdown\" on the country.\n\nThe chaos has highlighted cracks in Bangladesh's governance and economy and the frustration of young graduates who face a lack of good jobs.\n\nAn Associated Press reporter saw border guard officials fire at a crowd of more than 1,000 protesters who had gathered outside the head office of state-run Bangladesh Television, which was attacked and set on fire by protesters the previous day.\n\nThe border guards shot at the right crowd with rifles and sound grenades, while police officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets. Bullets littered the streets, which were also marked by smears of blood.\n\nA news producer and reporter at Bangladesh Television on Thursday told the Associated Press that protesters had broken through the main gate and set fire to vehicles and the reception area. They spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.\n\n\"I escaped by leaping over the wall but some of my colleagues got stuck inside. The attackers entered the building and set furniture on fire,\" the producer said by phone.\n\nAt least 22 people were killed on Thursday, a local TV station reported, following six deaths earlier this week. Authorities could not be reached to immediately confirm figures for the deaths.\n\nOn Friday morning, internet services and mobile data appeared to be down in the capital, Dhaka, and social media platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp were not loading.\n\nA statement from the country's Telecommunication Regulatory Commission said they were unable to ensure service after their data centre was attacked Thursday by demonstrators, who set fire to some equipment. The Associated Press has not been able to independently verify this.\n\nStudent protesters said they will extend their calls to impose a shutdown on Friday as well, and urged mosques across the country to hold funeral prayers for those who have been killed.\n\nThe protesters are demanding an end to a quota system that reserves up to 30 per cent of government jobs for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971 against Pakistan.\n\nThey argue the system is discriminatory and benefits supporters of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, whose Awami League party led the independence movement, and they want it replaced with a merit-based system.\n\nBut Hasina has defended the quota system, saying that veterans deserve the highest respect for their contributions in the war regardless of their political affiliation.\n\nThe Bangladeshi leader is credited for bringing stable growth to Bangladesh, but rising inflation -- thanks in part to the global upheaval sparked by the war in Ukraine -- has triggered labour unrest and dissatisfaction with the government.\n\nEven though job opportunities have grown in some parts of the private sector, many people prefer government jobs because they are seen as more stable and lucrative. But there aren't enough to go around -- each year, some 400,000 graduates compete for around 3,000 jobs in the civil service exam.\n\n\"What is unfolding in Bangladesh is deeply unsettling for a generation that only asked for a fair opportunity in public service recruitment.

Violence pitting protesters against pro-government student groups and police soon spread to other cities. Six people had been reported killed on Tuesday, and hundreds more have been injured.\n\nAuthorities did not immediately confirm figures for the deaths.\n\nThe protesters are demanding an end to a quota system that reserves up to 30% of government jobs for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971.\n\nThey argue the system is discriminatory and benefits supporters of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, whose Awami League party led the independence movement, and they want it replaced with a merit-based system.\n\nHasina's party has accused opposition parties of stoking the violence.\n\nThe leading Dhaka-based newspaper Prothom Alo, which has a strong network of reporters across the country, said that by late Thursday night, they received reports of 19 deaths in Dhaka and elsewhere in the day's raging violence. The country's leading English-language Daily Star also reported 19 deaths on Thursday.\n\nProthom Alo said at least six people died in Dhaka's Uttara area alone in the latest clashes pitting the protesters against security officials and ruling party activists. Thirteen others including a Dhaka-based journalist of an online portal died in other parts of the capital and elsewhere.\n\nProtesters attacked the head office of state-run Bangladesh Television, breaking through a main gate and setting vehicles and the reception area on fire, a news producer and a reporter told The Associated Press by phone. They spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.\n\n\"I escaped by leaping over the wall but some of my colleagues got stuck inside. The attackers entered the building and set furniture on fire,\" the producer said by phone.\n\nHe said the station continued broadcasting, though some Dhaka residents said they were receiving no signal from the broadcaster.\n\nMeanwhile, the country was experiencing a near-total shutdown of internet services, Alp Toker, director of the London-based internet monitor NetBlocks, said on X.\n\nThe violence has continued despite a pending court decision on the legality of quota system. Hasina and Law Minister Anisul Huq urged protesters to await that decision, with Hasina saying she believes the protesters won't be disappointed by the court verdict. Huq said on Thursday that he would be willing to sit with protesters to discuss their demands.\n\nFollowing the first deaths in this week's violence on Tuesday, the government asked universities across the country to close in hopes of quelling the student unrest, and police raided the main opposition party's headquarters.\n\nProtesters responded Wednesday evening by saying they would enforce a \"complete shutdown\" of transportation across the country apart from emergency services on Thursday. The opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party said that it would join those efforts.\n\nClashes continued Thursday as protesters tried to enforce the shutdown. In Dhaka's Uttara neighborhood, police chased hundreds of protesters after they blocked a road and chanted. In other locations, police fired tear gas and charged with batons to disperse protesters, who threw stones in response.\n\nPolice said protesters vandalized police cars and set fire to a traffic police box. Scores of people, including police officers, were injured in the violence, the Dhaka Metropolitan Police said.\n\nProtesters also blocked some major highways across the country, and local broadcasters reported violence in other cities including Chattogram and Khulna.\n\nTraffic was thin on Dhaka's usually clogged streets, while many malls closed. Offices and banks opened, but transportation was limited. Police set up checkpoints at the entrances to Dhaka University.\n\nSalma Rahman, an official at a financial institution in Dhaka, said that she left her car at home and caught a ride on a motorcycle. \"Our office has alerted us to stay safe on the streets, as there is fear that violence could happen during the shutdown.\"\n\nHasina's government had earlier halted the job quotas following mass student protests in 2018. But last month, Bangladesh's High Court nullified that decision and reinstated the quotas after relatives of the 1971 veterans filed petitions, triggering the latest demonstrations.\n\nThe Supreme Court then suspended the High Court's ruling and said it would rule on the quotes by Aug. 7. The government has also appealed the High Court decision in the wake of the protests, according to the attorney general's office.\n\nHuq said the government was seeking an early hearing.\n\n\"I have already asked the attorney general to appeal in the Supreme Court on Sunday seeking early hearing,\" he told reporters. Friday and Saturday form the weekend in Bangladesh. The court opens on Sunday.\n\nHasina urged protesters in a televised address Wednesday evening to \"wait with patience\" for the court verdict. \"I believe our students will get justice from the apex court. They will not be disappointed.\"\n\nWhile job opportunities have expanded in Bangladesh's private sector, many people prefer government jobs because they are stable and well-paid. Each year, around 400,000 graduates compete for 3,000 jobs in the civil service exam.\n\nHasina said there would be a judicial investigation into Tuesday's deaths and vowed that those responsible would be brought to justice.\n\n\"Some precious lives have been lost unnecessarily,\" she said. \"I condemn every killing.\"\n\nU.N. Human Rights chief Volker T\u00fcrk posted on X that all acts of violence and deadly use of force must be investigated and the perpetrators held accountable. T\u00fcrk said freedom of expression and peaceful assembly are fundamental human rights.\n\nBangladesh's ruling party blamed the BNP for the chaos, and Dhaka police raided the party's headquarters late Tuesday. Detective Chief Harun-or-Rashid said police arrested seven members of the party's student wing, and said detectives found 100 crude bombs, 500 wooden and bamboo sticks, and five to six bottles of gasoline in the raid.\n\nRuhul Kabir Rizvi, a senior BNP leader, said the raid was a government attempt to divert attention from the protests.", "source": {"uri": "japannews.yomiuri.co.jp",

Several people were killed, media reports said.\n\nQuader said the military was deployed to help the civilian administration keep order.\n\nThe protests, which began weeks ago but escalated sharply this week, represent the biggest challenge to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina since she won a fourth consecutive term in office after elections in January. Main opposition groups boycotted those polls.\n\nThere were varying reports of the number of people killed Friday, with Independent Television reporting 17 dead and Somoy TV reporting 30. An Associated Press reporter saw 23 bodies at Dhaka Medical College and Hospital, but it was not immediately clear whether they had all died on Friday.\n\nA death toll of 22 people was reported on Thursday, in what had so far been the bloodiest day of demonstrations, according to local media, as protesting students attempted to impose a \"complete shutdown\" of the country.\n\nAuthorities could not be reached immediately to confirm figures for the deaths.\n\nThe chaos has highlighted cracks in Bangladesh's governance and economy and the frustration of young graduates who face a lack of good jobs.\n\nThe government has deployed police and paramilitary forces across the capital to lock down campuses and break up protests. On Wednesday, universities including the country's largest suspended classes and closed dormitories, and on Friday police in Dhaka said they were banning all gatherings and demonstrations in the capital.\n\nAn Associated Press reporter saw border guard officials fire at a crowd of more than 1,000 protesters who had gathered outside the head office of state-run Bangladesh Television, which was attacked and set on fire by protesters the previous day.\n\nStudents advocating for quota reform in public service held a mock funeral at Dhaka University in memory of those who died during clashes, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, Wednesday, July 17, 2024. (Rajib Dhar / AP Photo)\n\nThe border guards shot at the crowd with rifles and sound grenades, while police officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets. Bullets littered the streets, which were also marked by smears of blood.\n\nInternet services and mobile data were widely disrupted on Thursday night and remained down on Friday in the capital, Dhaka. Social media platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp were also not loading. It coincided with a widespread internet outage on Friday that disrupted flights, banks, media outlets and companies around the world, but the disruptions in Bangladesh were substantially greater than seen elsewhere.\n\nA statement from the country's Telecommunication Regulatory Commission said they were unable to ensure service after their data center was attacked Thursday by demonstrators, who set fire to some equipment. The Associated Press was not able to independently verify this.\n\nStudent protesters said they will extend their calls to impose a shutdown on Friday as well, and urged mosques across the country to hold funeral prayers for those who have been killed. Major universities have said they will close their doors until tensions ease.\n\nThe protesters are demanding an end to a quota system that reserves up to 30% of government jobs for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971 against Pakistan.\n\nThey argue the system is discriminatory and benefits supporters of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, whose Awami League party led the independence movement, and they want it replaced with a merit-based system.\n\nBut Hasina has defended the quota system, saying that veterans deserve the highest respect for their contributions to the war regardless of their political affiliation.\n\nThe Bangladeshi leader is credited for bringing stable growth to Bangladesh, but rising inflation -- thanks in part to the global upheaval sparked by the war in Ukraine -- has triggered labor unrest and dissatisfaction with the government.\n\nEven though job opportunities have grown in some parts of the private sector, many people prefer government jobs because they are seen as more stable and lucrative. But there aren't enough to go around -- each year, some 400,000 graduates compete for around 3,000 jobs in the civil service exam.\n\nStudents clash with riot police during a protest against a quota system for government jobs in Dhaka, Bangladesh on July 18, 2024. (Rajib Dhar / AP Photo)\n\n\"What is unfolding in Bangladesh is deeply unsettling for a generation that only asked for a fair opportunity in public service recruitment,\" said Saad Hammadi, a freedom of speech advocate with the Canada-based Balsillie School of International Affairs. \"That a peaceful protest against a state policy would slip into the peak of lawlessness shows the government's lack of farsightedness and inefficient policy governance,\" Hammadi said.\n\n\"The internet shutdown makes matters worse. Local news sites are inaccessible, and people in the country are left incommunicado with the rest of the world all in the pretext of conducting sweeping operations by the state that have often resulted in serious human rights violations,\" he added in an email.\n\nBangladesh has previously shut down internet services in areas affected by protests, using it as a measure to suppress dissent by opposition parties. Internet watchdog Access Now said it recorded three shutdowns in the country in 2023 - all of which overlapped with opposition rallies and were limited in scope to one city or district. That came after six shutdowns in 2022.\n\nCIVICUS, a nonprofit that tracks civic freedoms around the world, last year downgraded Bangladesh to \"closed,\" the worst rating that it could assign, along with China and Venezuela, following a crackdown on the country's opposition members and supporters ahead of its national election.\n\nThe main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party has backed the protesting students and vowed to organize its own demonstrations, and many of their supporters have joined in the students' demonstrations. On Friday, police fired tear gas at a few hundred BNP supporters, and arrested senior BNP leader Ruhul Kabir Rizvi.\n\nThe Awami League and the BNP have often accused each other of fueling political chaos and violence, most recently ahead of the country's national election, which was marred by a crackdown on several opposition figures while Hasina's government accused the party of attempting to disrupt the vote.\n\nHasina's government had earlier halted the job quotas following mass student protests in 2018, but last month, Bangladesh's High Court nullified that decision and reinstated the quotas after relatives of the 1971 veterans filed petitions, triggering the latest demonstrations.\n\nThe Supreme Court has suspended that ruling pending an appeal hearing, and said in a statement it will take up the issue on Sunday.\n\nOn Wednesday, Hasina urged protesters in a televised address to \"wait with patience\" for the court verdict, saying that she believes they \"will get justice\" and \"will not be disappointed.\"", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type":

Several people were killed, media reports said.\n\nQuader said the military was deployed to help the civilian administration keep order.\n\nThe protests, which began weeks ago but escalated sharply this week, represent the biggest challenge to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina since she won a fourth consecutive term in office after elections in January. Main opposition groups boycotted those polls.\n\nThere were varying reports of the number of people killed Friday, with Independent Television reporting 17 dead and Somoy TV reporting 30. An Associated Press reporter saw 23 bodies at Dhaka Medical College and Hospital, but it was not immediately clear whether they had all died on Friday.\n\nA death toll of 22 people was reported on Thursday, in what had so far been the bloodiest day of demonstrations, according to local media, as protesting students attempted to impose a \"complete shutdown\" of the country.\n\nAuthorities could not be reached immediately to confirm figures for the deaths.\n\nThe chaos has highlighted cracks in Bangladesh's governance and economy and the frustration of young graduates who face a lack of good jobs.\n\nThe government has deployed police and paramilitary forces across the capital to lock down campuses and break up protests. On Wednesday, universities including the country's largest suspended classes and closed dormitories, and on Friday police in Dhaka said they were banning all gatherings and demonstrations in the capital.\n\nAn Associated Press reporter saw border guard officials fire at a crowd of more than 1,000 protesters who had gathered outside the head office of state-run Bangladesh Television, which was attacked and set on fire by protesters the previous day.\n\nThe border guards shot at the crowd with rifles and sound grenades, while police officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets. Bullets littered the streets, which were also marked by smears of blood.\n\nInternet services and mobile data were widely disrupted on Thursday night and remained down on Friday in the capital, Dhaka. Social media platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp were also not loading. It coincided with a widespread internet outage on Friday that disrupted flights, banks, media outlets and companies around the world, but the disruptions in Bangladesh were substantially greater than seen elsewhere.\n\nA statement from the country's Telecommunication Regulatory Commission said they were unable to ensure service after their data center was attacked Thursday by demonstrators, who set fire to some equipment. The Associated Press was not able to independently verify this.\n\nStudent protesters said they will extend their calls to impose a shutdown on Friday as well, and urged mosques across the country to hold funeral prayers for those who have been killed. Major universities have said they will close their doors until tensions ease.\n\nThe protesters are demanding an end to a quota system that reserves up to 30% of government jobs for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971 against Pakistan.\n\nThey argue the system is discriminatory and benefits supporters of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, whose Awami League party led the independence movement, and they want it replaced with a merit-based system.\n\nBut Hasina has defended the quota system, saying that veterans deserve the highest respect for their contributions to the war regardless of their political affiliation.\n\nThe Bangladeshi leader is credited for bringing stable growth to Bangladesh, but rising inflation -- thanks in part to the global upheaval sparked by the war in Ukraine -- has triggered labor unrest and dissatisfaction with the government.\n\nEven though job opportunities have grown in some parts of the private sector, many people prefer government jobs because they are seen as more stable and lucrative. But there aren't enough to go around -- each year, some 400,000 graduates compete for around 3,000 jobs in the civil service exam.\n\n\"What is unfolding in Bangladesh is deeply unsettling for a generation that only asked for a fair opportunity in public service recruitment,\" said Saad Hammadi, a freedom of speech advocate with the Canada-based Balsillie School of International Affairs. \"That a peaceful protest against a state policy would slip into the peak of lawlessness shows the government's lack of farsightedness and inefficient policy governance,\" Hammadi said.\n\n\"The internet shutdown makes matters worse. Local news sites are inaccessible, and people in the country are left incommunicado with the rest of the world all in the pretext of conducting sweeping operations by the state that have often resulted in serious human rights violations,\" he added in an email.\n\nBangladesh has previously shut down internet services in areas affected by protests, using it as a measure to suppress dissent by opposition parties. Internet watchdog Access Now said it recorded three shutdowns in the country in 2023 - all of which overlapped with opposition rallies and were limited in scope to one city or district. That came after six shutdowns in 2022.\n\nCIVICUS, a nonprofit that tracks civic freedoms around the world, last year downgraded Bangladesh to \"closed,\" the worst rating that it could assign, along with China and Venezuela, following a crackdown on the country's opposition members and supporters ahead of its national election.\n\nThe main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party has backed the protesting students and vowed to organize its own demonstrations, and many of their supporters have joined in the students' demonstrations. On Friday, police fired tear gas at a few hundred BNP supporters, and arrested senior BNP leader Ruhul Kabir Rizvi.\n\nThe Awami League and the BNP have often accused each other of fueling political chaos and violence, most recently ahead of the country's national election, which was marred by a crackdown on several opposition figures while Hasina's government accused the party of attempting to disrupt the vote.\n\nHasina's government had earlier halted the job quotas following mass student protests in 2018, but last month, Bangladesh's High Court nullified that decision and reinstated the quotas after relatives of the 1971 veterans filed petitions, triggering the latest demonstrations.\n\nThe Supreme Court has suspended that ruling pending an appeal hearing, and said in a statement it will take up the issue on Sunday.\n\nOn Wednesday, Hasina urged protesters in a televised address to \"wait with patience\" for the court verdict, saying that she believes they \"will get justice\" and \"will not be disappointed.\"\n\nPathi reported from New Delhi, India.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Authorities could not be reached to immediately confirm figures for the deaths.\n\nOn Friday morning, internet services and mobile data appeared to be down in the capital, Dhaka, and social media platforms such as Facebook and WhatsApp were not loading.\n\nIt coincided with a widespread internet outage on Friday that disrupted flights, banks, media outlets and companies around the world, but the disruptions in Bangladesh were substantially greater than seen elsewhere.\n\nA statement from the country's Telecommunication Regulatory Commission said they were unable to ensure service after their data centre was attacked on Thursday by demonstrators, who set fire to some equipment. The Associated Press has not been able to independently verify this.\n\nStudent protesters said they will extend their calls to impose a shutdown on Friday as well, and urged mosques across the country to hold funeral prayers for those who have been killed.\n\nThe protesters are demanding an end to a quota system that reserves up to 30% of government jobs for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971 against Pakistan.\n\nThey argue the system is discriminatory and benefits supporters of Ms Hasina, whose Awami League party led the independence movement, and they want it replaced with a merit-based system.\n\nBut Ms Hasina has defended the quota system, saying that veterans deserve the highest respect for their contributions in the war regardless of their political affiliation.\n\nThe Bangladeshi leader is credited for bringing stable growth to Bangladesh, but rising inflation -- thanks in part to the global upheaval sparked by the war in Ukraine -- has triggered labour unrest and dissatisfaction with the government.\n\nEven though job opportunities have grown in some parts of the private sector, many people prefer government jobs because they are seen as more stable and lucrative. But there are not enough to go around -- each year, some 400,000 graduates compete for around 3,000 jobs in the civil service exam.\n\n\"What is unfolding in Bangladesh is deeply unsettling for a generation that only asked for a fair opportunity in public service recruitment. That a peaceful protest against a state policy would slip into the peak of lawlessness shows the government's lack of farsightedness and inefficient policy governance,\" said Saad Hammadi, policy and advocacy manager at the Canada-based Balsillie School of International Affairs who has advocated for freedom of speech in the country.\n\n\"The internet shutdown makes matters worse. Local news sites are inaccessible, and people in the country are left incommunicado with the rest of the world all in the pretext of conducting sweeping operations by the state that have often resulted in serious human rights violations,\" he added in an email.\n\nBangladesh has previously shut down internet services in areas affected by protests, using it as a measure to suppress dissent by opposition parties, according to Access Now, an internet watchdog.\n\nCIVICUS, a nonprofit that tracks civic freedoms around the world, last year downgraded Bangladesh to \"closed,\" the worst rating that it could assign, along with China and Venezuela, following a crackdown on the country's opposition members and supporters ahead of its national election.\n\nThe main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party has backed the protesting students and is expected to hold demonstrations to show their support. Ms Hasina's party has accused them of stoking the violence, raiding the BNP's headquarters and arresting activists from the party's student wing earlier this week.\n\nThe Awami League and the BNP have often accused each other of fuelling political chaos and violence, most recently ahead of the country's national election, which was marred by a crackdown on several opposition figures while Ms Hasina's government accused the party of attempting to disrupt the vote.\n\nMs Hasina's government had earlier halted the job quotas following mass student protests in 2018, but last month, Bangladesh's High Court nullified that decision and reinstated the quotas after relatives of the 1971 veterans filed petitions, triggering the latest demonstrations.\n\nThe Supreme Court has suspended that ruling pending an appeal hearing, and said in a statement it will take up the issue on Sunday.\n\nOn Wednesday, Ms Hasina urged protesters in a televised address to \"wait with patience\" for the court verdict. \"I believe our students will get justice from the apex court.

(AP Photo)\n\nPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina's government late Friday announced a nationwide curfew across Bangladesh and ordered the deployment of military forces to maintain order following days of deadly clashes over the allocation of government jobs.\n\nThe announcement was made by Obaidul Quader, the general secretary of the ruling Awami League party, and came after police and security officials fired on protesters earlier Friday and banned all gatherings in the capital. Several people were killed, media reports said.\n\nQuader said the military was deployed to help the civilian administration keep order.\n\nThe protests, which began weeks ago but escalated sharply this week, represent the biggest challenge to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina since she won a fourth consecutive term in office after elections in January. Main opposition groups boycotted those polls.\n\nThere were varying reports of the number of people killed Friday, with Independent Television reporting 17 dead and Somoy TV reporting 30. An Associated Press reporter saw 23 bodies at Dhaka Medical College and Hospital, but it was not immediately clear whether they had all died on Friday.\n\nA death toll of 22 people was reported on Thursday, in what had so far been the bloodiest day of demonstrations, according to local media, as protesting students attempted to impose a \"complete shutdown\" of the country.\n\nAuthorities could not be reached immediately to confirm figures for the deaths.\n\nThe chaos has highlighted cracks in Bangladesh's governance and economy and the frustration of young graduates who face a lack of good jobs.\n\nThe government has deployed police and paramilitary forces across the capital to lock down campuses and break up protests. On Wednesday, universities including the country's largest suspended classes and closed dormitories, and on Friday police in Dhaka said they were banning all gatherings and demonstrations in the capital.\n\nAn Associated Press reporter saw border guard officials fire at a crowd of more than 1,000 protesters who had gathered outside the head office of state-run Bangladesh Television, which was attacked and set on fire by protesters the previous day.\n\nThe border guards shot at the crowd with rifles and sound grenades, while police officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets. Bullets littered the streets, which were also marked by smears of blood.\n\nInternet services and mobile data were widely disrupted on Thursday night and remained down on Friday in the capital, Dhaka. Social media platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp were also not loading. It coincided with a widespread internet outage on Friday that disrupted flights, banks, media outlets and companies around the world, but the disruptions in Bangladesh were substantially greater than seen elsewhere.\n\nA statement from the country's Telecommunication Regulatory Commission said they were unable to ensure service after their data center was attacked Thursday by demonstrators, who set fire to some equipment. The Associated Press was not able to independently verify this.\n\nStudent protesters said they will extend their calls to impose a shutdown on Friday as well, and urged mosques across the country to hold funeral prayers for those who have been killed. Major universities have said they will close their doors until tensions ease.\n\nThe protesters are demanding an end to a quota system that reserves up to 30% of government jobs for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971 against Pakistan.\n\nThey argue the system is discriminatory and benefits supporters of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, whose Awami League party led the independence movement, and they want it replaced with a merit-based system.\n\nBut Hasina has defended the quota system, saying that veterans deserve the highest respect for their contributions to the war regardless of their political affiliation.\n\nThe Bangladeshi leader is credited for bringing stable growth to Bangladesh, but rising inflation -- thanks in part to the global upheaval sparked by the war in Ukraine -- has triggered labor unrest and dissatisfaction with the government.\n\nEven though job opportunities have grown in some parts of the private sector, many people prefer government jobs because they are seen as more stable and lucrative. But there aren't enough to go around -- each year, some 400,000 graduates compete for around 3,000 jobs in the civil service exam.\n\n\"What is unfolding in Bangladesh is deeply unsettling for a generation that only asked for a fair opportunity in public service recruitment,\" said Saad Hammadi, a freedom of speech advocate with the Canada-based Balsillie School of International Affairs. \"That a peaceful protest against a state policy would slip into the peak of lawlessness shows the government's lack of farsightedness and inefficient policy governance,\" Hammadi said.\n\n\"The internet shutdown makes matters worse. Local news sites are inaccessible, and people in the country are left incommunicado with the rest of the world all in the pretext of conducting sweeping operations by the state that have often resulted in serious human rights violations,\" he added in an email.\n\nBangladesh has previously shut down internet services in areas affected by protests, using it as a measure to suppress dissent by opposition parties. Internet watchdog Access Now said it recorded three shutdowns in the country in 2023 - all of which overlapped with opposition rallies and were limited in scope to one city or district. That came after six shutdowns in 2022.\n\nCIVICUS, a nonprofit that tracks civic freedoms around the world, last year downgraded Bangladesh to \"closed,\" the worst rating that it could assign, along with China and Venezuela, following a crackdown on the country's opposition members and supporters ahead of its national election.\n\nThe main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party has backed the protesting students and vowed to organize its own demonstrations, and many of their supporters have joined in the students' demonstrations. On Friday, police fired tear gas at a few hundred BNP supporters, and arrested senior BNP leader Ruhul Kabir Rizvi.\n\nThe Awami League and the BNP have often accused each other of fueling political chaos and violence, most recently ahead of the country's national election, which was marred by a crackdown on several opposition figures while Hasina's government accused the party of attempting to disrupt the vote.\n\nHasina's government had earlier halted the job quotas following mass student protests in 2018, but last month, Bangladesh's High Court nullified that decision and reinstated the quotas after relatives of the 1971 veterans filed petitions, triggering the latest demonstrations.\n\nThe Supreme Court has suspended that ruling pending an appeal hearing, and said in a statement it will take up the issue on Sunday.\n\nOn Wednesday, Hasina urged protesters in a televised address to \"wait with patience\" for the court verdict, saying that she believes they \"will get justice\" and \"will not be disappointed.\"", "source": {"uri": "castanet.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Castanet"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina",

The protests, which began weeks ago but escalated sharply on Monday, represent the biggest challenge to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina since she won a fourth consecutive term in a January election that was boycotted by the main opposition parties.\n\nThe fresh clashes follow the bloodiest day of the protests to date, with local media reporting 22 people killed as protesting students attempted to impose a \"complete shutdown\" on the country.\n\nThe chaos has highlighted cracks in Bangladesh's governance and economy and the frustration of young graduates who face a lack of good jobs.\n\nAn Associated press reporter saw border guard officials fire at a crowd of more than 1,000 protesters who had gathered outside the head office of state run Bangladesh Television, which was attacked and set on fire by protesters the previous day.\n\nThe border guards shot at the right crowd with rifles and sound grenades, while police officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets. Bullets littered the streets, which were also marked by smears of blood.\n\nA news producer and reporter at Bangladesh Television told the associated press on Thursday that protesters had broken through the main gate and set fire to vehicles and the reception area. They spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.\n\n\"I escaped by leaping over the wall, but some of my colleagues got stuck inside. The attackers entered the building and set furniture on fire,\" the producer said by phone.\n\nAt least 22 people were killed on Thursday, a local TV station reported, following six deaths earlier this week. Authorities could not be reached to immediately confirm the figures for the deaths.\n\nOn Friday morning, internet services and mobile data appeared to be down in the capital, Dhaka, and social media platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp were not loading.\n\nA statement from the country's telecommunications regulatory commission said they were unable to ensure service after their data centre was attacked Thursday by demonstrators, who set fire to some equipment. The Associated Press has not been able to independently verify this.\n\nStudent protesters said they would extend their calls to impose a shutdown on Friday as well, and urged mosques across the country to hold funeral prayers for those who have been killed.\n\nThe protesters are demanding an end to a quota system that reserves up to 30 percent of government jobs for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971 against Pakistan.\n\nThey argue the system is discriminatory and benefits supporters of Prime minister Sheikh Hasina, whose Awami League party led the independence movement, and they want it replaced with a merit-based system.\n\nBut Hasina has defended the quota system, saying that veterans deserve the highest respect for their contributions in the war, regardless of their political affiliation.\n\nThe Bangladeshi leader is credited with bringing stable growth to Bangladesh, but rising inflation, thanks in part to the global upheaval sparked by the war in Ukraine, has triggered labour unrest and dissatisfaction with the government.\n\nEven though job opportunities have grown in some parts of the private sector, many people prefer government jobs because they are seen as more stable and lucrative. But there aren't enough to go around; each year, some 400,000 graduates compete for around 3,000 jobs in the civil service exam.\n\n\"What is unfolding in Bangladesh is deeply unsettling for a generation that only asked for a fair opportunity in public service recruitment. That a peaceful protest against a state policy would slip into the peak of lawlessness shows the government's lack of farsightedness and inefficient policy governance,\" said Saad Hammadi, policy and advocacy manager at the Canada based Balsillie school of international affairs, who has advocated for freedom of speech in the country.\n\n\"The internet shutdown makes matters worse. Local news sites are inaccessible, and people in the country are left incommunicado with the rest of the world, all under the pretext of conducting sweeping operations by the state that have often resulted in serious human rights violations,\" he added in an email.\n\nBangladesh has previously shut down internet services in areas affected by protests, using it as a measure to suppress dissent by opposition parties, according to Access Now, an internet watchdog.\n\nCIVICUS, a non profit that tracks civic freedoms around the world, last year downgraded Bangladesh to \"closed,\" the worst rating that it could assign, along with China and Venezuela, following a crackdown on the country's opposition members and supporters ahead of its national election.\n\nThe main opposition Bangladesh nationalist party has backed the protesting students and is expected to hold demonstrations to show their support. Hasina's party has accused them of stoking the violence, raiding the BNP's headquarters and arresting activists from the party's student wing earlier this week.\n\nThe Awami League and the BNP have often accused each other of fuelling political chaos and violence, most recently ahead of the country's national election, which was marred by a crackdown on several opposition figures while Hasina's government accused the party of attempting to disrupt the vote.\n\nHasina's government had earlier halted the job quotas following mass student protests in 2018, but last month, Bangladesh's high court nullified that decision and reinstated the quotas after relatives of the 1971 veterans filed petitions, triggering the latest demonstrations.\n\nThe supreme court has suspended that ruling pending an appeal hearing and said in a statement it will take up the issue on Sunday.\n\nOn Wednesday, Hasina urged protesters in a televised address to \"wait with patience\" for the court verdict. \"I believe our students will get justice from the apex court. They will not be disappointed.\"", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of India"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The protest is against the government against a quota system for government jobs. Till now 39 people have been killed in the violence\n\nThe ones organizing protests say that they are imposing a complete shutdown across Bangladesh on Thursday that will exclude the essential services. This step was taken after several major universities in Bangladesh agreed to close untill the violence eases.\n\nProtests in Bangladesh that started late last month, drawing tens of thousands to the streets, saw a sharp increase in tension on Monday. Student activists from Dhaka University, the largest in the country, clashed with police and counter-protesters supported by the ruling Awami League. Over 100 people were injured in these confrontations.\n\nThe violence spread the next day, resulting in six deaths as unrest continued at campuses across Bangladesh. More clashes were reported on Wednesday and Thursday, leading to paramilitary forces being sent to patrol major cities. On Thursday, media reports indicated that at least 19 additional people were killed.\n\nThe protesters have vowed to keep demonstrating but are open to negotiating with the government. On Thursday, further violence erupted in Dhaka and other parts of the country, with police using tear gas on protesters, according to local officials and media reports.\n\nThe protests are centered around a quota system that reserves up to 30% of government jobs for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's 1971 independence war against Pakistan.\n\nProtesters demand to end this system, which they argue is unfair and benefits supporters of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's Awami League party, which led the independence movement. They are calling for a merit-based system instead.\n\nWhile job opportunities in the private sector have increased, many people still prefer government jobs for their stability and benefits. However, the number of available positions is limited -- about 400,000 graduates compete each year for roughly 3,000 civil service jobs.\n\nThe quota system also includes job reservations for women, disabled individuals, and ethnic minorities, but the main focus of the protests is the quota for veterans' families.\n\nBangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina has defended the quota system, arguing that veterans should be honored for their contributions to the war, regardless of their political ties.\n\nHer government has also accused the main opposition parties, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the right-wing Jamaat-e-Islami, of causing unrest. The BNP has supported the students' call for a shutdown on Thursday.\n\nOn Wednesday, authorities raided the BNP's headquarters and arrested several activists from the party's student wing. These clashes follow months after Hasina secured re-election in a vote that opposition parties boycotted and during which opposition members were jailed.\n\nIn 2018, Hasina's government ended the quotas following large student protests.\n\nHowever, last month the High Court overturned that decision and restored the quotas after veterans' relatives filed petitions, leading to new protests. The Supreme Court has put a hold on this decision and will make a ruling on August 7. Despite this, the protests continue.\n\n\"I urge everyone to be patient until the verdict is given,\" Hasina said in a televised speech on Wednesday evening. \"I believe our students will receive justice from the Supreme Court and will not be let down.\"\n\nThe uproar has also revealed issues in Bangladesh's governance and economy, worsened by the pandemic and global conflicts like the wars in Ukraine and Gaza. It reflects the shortage of quality jobs for young graduates.\n\nAnu Muhammad, a former economics professor, wrote in the Daily Star that the large protests stem from students struggling to find suitable jobs after graduation. He also pointed to widespread corruption and problems in government job recruitment as major sources of frustration.\n\n\"Although the economy shows growth, jobs are not being created,\" he added.\n\nProtest coordinator Hasnat Abdullah stated that students want to return to their studies but will do so only if their demands are met.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, Law Minister Anisul Huq said Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina had asked him to meet with the protesters for talks.

Authorities could not be reached to immediately confirm figures for the deaths.\n\nThe chaos has highlighted cracks in Bangladesh's governance and economy and the frustration of young graduates who face a lack of good jobs.\n\nThe government has deployed police and paramilitary forces across the capital to lock down campuses and break up protests. On Wednesday, univerisites including the country's largest suspended classes and closed dormitories, and on Friday Dhaka police said they were banning all gatherings and demonstrations in the capital.\n\nAn Associated Press reporter saw border guard officials fire at a crowd of more than 1,000 protesters who had gathered outside the head office of state-run Bangladesh Television, which was attacked and set on fire by protesters the previous day.\n\nThe border guards shot at the right crowd with rifles and sound grenades, while police officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets. Bullets littered the streets, which were also marked by smears of blood.\n\nA news producer and reporter at Bangladesh Television on Thursday told the Associated Press that protesters had broken through the main gate and set fire to vehicles and the reception area. They spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.\n\n\"I escaped by leaping over the wall but some of my colleagues got stuck inside. The attackers entered the building and set furniture on fire,\" the producer said by phone.\n\nInternet services and mobile data were widely disrupted on Thursday night and remained down on Friday in the capital, Dhaka. Social media platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp were also not loading. It coincided with a widespread internet outage on Friday that disrupted flights, banks, media outlets and companies around the world, but the disruptions in Bangladesh were substantially greater than seen elsewhere.\n\nA statement from the country's Telecommunication Regulatory Commission said they were unable to ensure service after their data center was attacked Thursday by demonstrators, who set fire to some equipment. The Associated Press has not been able to independently verify this.\n\nStudent protesters said they will extend their calls to impose a shutdown on Friday as well, and urged mosques across the country to hold funeral prayers for those who have been killed. Major universities have said they will close their doors until tensions ease.\n\nThe protesters are demanding an end to a quota system that reserves up to 30% of government jobs for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971 against Pakistan.\n\nThey argue the system is discriminatory and benefits supporters of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, whose Awami League party led the independence movement, and they want it replaced with a merit-based system.\n\nBut Hasina has defended the quota system, saying that veterans deserve the highest respect for their contributions in the war regardless of their political affiliation.\n\nThe Bangladeshi leader is credited for bringing stable growth to Bangladesh, but rising inflation -- thanks in part to the global upheaval sparked by the war in Ukraine -- has triggered labor unrest and dissatisfaction with the government.\n\nEven though job opportunities have grown in some parts of the private sector, many people prefer government jobs because they are seen as more stable and lucrative. But there aren't enough to go around -- each year, some 400,000 graduates compete for around 3,000 jobs in the civil service exam.\n\n\"What is unfolding in Bangladesh is deeply unsettling for a generation that only asked for a fair opportunity in public service recruitment. That a peaceful protest against a state policy would slip into the peak of lawlessness shows the government's lack of farsightedness and inefficient policy governance,\" said Saad Hammadi, policy and advocacy manager at the Canada-based Balsillie School of International Affairs who has advocated for freedom of speech in the country.\n\n\"The internet shutdown makes matters worse. Local news sites are inaccessible, and people in the country are left incommunicado with the rest of the world all in the pretext of conducting sweeping operations by the state that have often resulted in serious human rights violations,\" he added in an email.\n\nBangladesh has previously shut down internet services in areas affected by protests, using it as a measure to suppress dissent by opposition parties, according to Access Now, an internet watchdog.\n\nCIVICUS, a nonprofit that tracks civic freedoms around the world, last year downgraded Bangladesh to \"closed,\" the worst rating that it could assign, along with China and Venezuela, following a crackdown on the country's opposition members and supporters ahead of its national election.\n\nThe main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party has backed the protesting students and vowed to organize its own demonstrations, and many of their supporters have joined in the students' demonstrations. On Friday, police fired tear gas at a few hundred BNP supporters, and arrested senior BNP leader Ruhul Kabir Rizvi.\n\nHasina's government has accused the BNP of stoking the violence, with authorities raiding the opposition party's headquarters earlier this week and arresting activists from the party's student wing.\n\nThe Awami League and the BNP have often accused each other of fueling political chaos and violence, most recently ahead of the country's national election, which was marred by a crackdown on several opposition figures while Hasina's government accused the party of attempting to disrupt the vote.\n\nHasina's government had earlier halted the job quotas following mass student protests in 2018, but last month, Bangladesh's High Court nullified that decision and reinstated the quotas after relatives of the 1971 veterans filed petitions, triggering the latest demonstrations.\n\nThe Supreme Court has suspended that ruling pending an appeal hearing, and said in a statement it will take up the issue on Sunday.\n\nOn Wednesday, Hasina urged protesters in a televised address to \"wait with patience\" for the court verdict. \"I believe our students will get justice from the apex court. They will not be disappointed.\"\n\nPathi reported from New Delhi, India.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri":

(AP Photo/Rajib Dhar)DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) - Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's government late Friday announced a nationwide curfew across Bangladesh and ordered the deployment of military forces to maintain order following days of deadly clashes over the allocation of government jobs. The announcement was made by Obaidul Quader, the general secretary of the ruling Awami League party, and came after police and security officials fired on protesters earlier Friday and banned all gatherings in the capital. Several people were killed, media reports said. Quader said the military was deployed to help the civilian administration keep order. The protests, which began weeks ago but escalated sharply this week, represent the biggest challenge to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina since she won a fourth consecutive term in office after elections in January. Main opposition groups boycotted those polls. There were varying reports of the number of people killed Friday, with Independent Television reporting 17 dead and Somoy TV reporting 30. An Associated Press reporter saw 23 bodies at Dhaka Medical College and Hospital, but it was not immediately clear whether they had all died on Friday. A death toll of 22 people was reported on Thursday, in what had so far been the bloodiest day of demonstrations, according to local media, as protesting students attempted to impose a \"complete shutdown\"\u009d of the country. Authorities could not be reached immediately to confirm figures for the deaths. The chaos has highlighted cracks in Bangladesh's governance and economy and the frustration of young graduates who face a lack of good jobs. The government has deployed police and paramilitary forces across the capital to lock down campuses and break up protests. On Wednesday, universities including the country's largest suspended classes and closed dormitories, and on Friday police in Dhaka said they were banning all gatherings and demonstrations in the capital. An Associated Press reporter saw border guard officials fire at a crowd of more than 1,000 protesters who had gathered outside the head office of state-run Bangladesh Television, which was attacked and set on fire by protesters the previous day. The border guards shot at the crowd with rifles and sound grenades, while police officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets. Bullets littered the streets, which were also marked by smears of blood. Internet services and mobile data were widely disrupted on Thursday night and remained down on Friday in the capital, Dhaka. Social media platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp were also not loading. It coincided with a widespread internet outage on Friday that disrupted flights, banks, media outlets and companies around the world, but the disruptions in Bangladesh were substantially greater than seen elsewhere. A statement from the country's Telecommunication Regulatory Commission said they were unable to ensure service after their data center was attacked Thursday by demonstrators, who set fire to some equipment. The Associated Press was not able to independently verify this. Student protesters said they will extend their calls to impose a shutdown on Friday as well, and urged mosques across the country to hold funeral prayers for those who have been killed. Major universities have said they will close their doors until tensions ease. The protesters are demanding an end to a quota system that reserves up to 30% of government jobs for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971 against Pakistan. They argue the system is discriminatory and benefits supporters of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, whose Awami League party led the independence movement, and they want it replaced with a merit-based system. But Hasina has defended the quota system, saying that veterans deserve the highest respect for their contributions to the war regardless of their political affiliation. The Bangladeshi leader is credited for bringing stable growth to Bangladesh, but rising inflation - thanks in part to the global upheaval sparked by the war in Ukraine - has triggered labor unrest and dissatisfaction with the government. Even though job opportunities have grown in some parts of the private sector, many people prefer government jobs because they are seen as more stable and lucrative. But there aren't enough to go around - each year, some 400,000 graduates compete for around 3,000 jobs in the civil service exam. \"What is unfolding in Bangladesh is deeply unsettling for a generation that only asked for a fair opportunity in public service recruitment,\" said Saad Hammadi, a freedom of speech advocate with the Canada-based Balsillie School of International Affairs. \"That a peaceful protest against a state policy would slip into the peak of lawlessness shows the government's lack of farsightedness and inefficient policy governance,\"\u009d Hammadi said. \"The internet shutdown makes matters worse. Local news sites are inaccessible, and people in the country are left incommunicado with the rest of the world all in the pretext of conducting sweeping operations by the state that have often resulted in serious human rights violations,\"\u009d he added in an email. Bangladesh has previously shut down internet services in areas affected by protests, using it as a measure to suppress dissent by opposition parties. Internet watchdog Access Now said it recorded three shutdowns in the country in 2023 - all of which overlapped with opposition rallies and were limited in scope to one city or district. That came after six shutdowns in 2022. CIVICUS, a nonprofit that tracks civic freedoms around the world, last year downgraded Bangladesh to \"closed,\"\u009d the worst rating that it could assign, along with China and Venezuela, following a crackdown on the country's opposition members and supporters ahead of its national election. The main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party has backed the protesting students and vowed to organize its own demonstrations, and many of their supporters have joined in the students' demonstrations. On Friday, police fired tear gas at a few hundred BNP supporters, and arrested senior BNP leader Ruhul Kabir Rizvi. The Awami League and the BNP have often accused each other of fueling political chaos and violence, most recently ahead of the country's national election, which was marred by a crackdown on several opposition figures while Hasina's government accused the party of attempting to disrupt the vote. Hasina's government had earlier halted the job quotas following mass student protests in 2018, but last month, Bangladesh's High Court nullified that decision and reinstated the quotas after relatives of the 1971 veterans filed petitions, triggering the latest demonstrations. The Supreme Court has suspended that ruling pending an appeal hearing, and said in a statement it will take up the issue on Sunday. On Wednesday, Hasina urged protesters in a televised address to \"wait with patience\"\u009d for the court verdict, saying that she believes they \"will get justice\"\u009d and \"will not be disappointed.\"\u009d ___ Pathi reported from New Delhi, India.", "source": {"uri": "medicinehatnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medicine Hat News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

This comes after several major universities in the country agreed to shut their doors indefinitely until tensions ease.\n\nHere's what we know:\n\nWhat's happened so far?\n\nThe protests, which have drawn tens of thousands out on the streets, began late last month but tensions escalated on Monday when student activists at Dhaka University, the country's largest, clashed with police and counter-protesters backed by the ruling Awami League. At least 100 people were injured in the aftermath.\n\nThe next day, as violence continued to roil campuses across Bangladesh, six people were killed. More clashes were also reported on Wednesday and Thursday and paramilitary forces were deployed to patrol the streets of major cities. Media reports said at least 19 more people died on Thursday.\n\nIn response, major universities said they will close until the situation is resolved in order to protect students.\n\nThe protesters say they will continue to demonstrate but are open to discussions with the government. More violence took place on Thursday in Dhaka and elsewhere in the country as police fired tear gas at protesters, according to police officials and local television.\n\nWhy are they protesting?\n\nAt the heart of the demonstrations is a quota system that reserves up to 30% of government jobs for family members of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's 1971 war of independence against Pakistan.\n\nProtesters want to abolish this system, which they say is discriminatory and benefits supporters of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's Awami League party, which led the independence movement. They want it replaced with a system that's based on merit.\n\nEven though job opportunities have grown in some parts of the private sector, many people prefer government jobs because they are seen as more stable and lucrative. But there aren't enough to go around -- each year, some 400,000 graduates compete for around 3,000 jobs in the civil service exam.\n\nUnder the quota system, government jobs are also reserved for women, disabled people and members of ethnic minorities, but students have mainly protested against jobs reserved for veterans' families.\n\nWhat does the government say?\n\nHasina has defended the quota system, saying that veterans deserve the highest respect for their contributions in the war regardless of their political affiliation.\n\nHer government has also accused the main opposition parties, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and the right wing Jamaat-e-Islami party, of fueling chaos. The BNP has backed the students' calls for shutdown on Thursday.\n\nOn Wednesday, authorities also raided the headquarters of the BNP and arrested several activists from the party's student wing.\n\nThe clashes come months after Hasina maintained power in an election that was boycotted by opposition parties and saw opposition members jailed ahead of the polls.\n\nWhy are the students protesting now?\n\nThis isn't the first time there's been uproar over this issue. In 2018, Hasina's government halted the quotas after mass student protests.\n\nHowever, the High Court nullified that decision last month and reinstated the quotas after relatives of the 1971 veterans filed petitions, sparking the latest round of protests. The Supreme Court suspended that decision and promised to rule on the issue on Aug. 7. Despite this, the protests have persisted.\n\n\"I am requesting all to wait with patience until the verdict is delivered,\" Hasina said in a televised address Wednesday evening. \"I believe our students will get justice from the apex court. They will not be disappointed.\"\n\nWhat could happen next?\n\nThe furore has also highlighted cracks in Bangladesh's governance and economy following the pandemic and global upheaval of the wars in Ukraine and Gaza and reflect a lack of good quality jobs available for young graduates.\n\n\"The reason behind such huge participation is that many students go through the bitter experience of not finding the jobs they deserve after completing their education,\" wrote Anu Muhammad, a former economics professor and analyst, in the Dhaka-based Daily Star newspaper. \"In addition, rampant corruption and irregularities in government job recruitment exams and selection processes have created immense frustration and anger.\"\n\n\"The country's economy shows growth, but jobs are not being created,\" he wrote.\n\nHasnat Abdullah, a protest coordinator, said the students want to return to classes but will do so once their demands are met.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, Bangladesh's Law Minister Anisul Huq said that Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina asked him to sit with the protesters for a dialogue, and he was ready to sit down on Thursday if protesters were willing.\n\nAP writer

Several people were killed, media reports said.\n\nQuader said the military was deployed to help the civilian administration keep order.\n\nThe protests, which began weeks ago but escalated sharply this week, represent the biggest challenge to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina since she won a fourth consecutive term in office after elections in January. Main opposition groups boycotted those polls.\n\nThere were varying reports of the number of people killed Friday, with Independent Television reporting 17 dead and Somoy TV reporting 30. An Associated Press reporter saw 23 bodies at Dhaka Medical College and Hospital, but it was not immediately clear whether they had all died on Friday.\n\nA death toll of 22 people was reported on Thursday, in what had so far been the bloodiest day of demonstrations, according to local media, as protesting students attempted to impose a \"complete shutdown\" of the country.\n\nAuthorities could not be reached immediately to confirm figures for the deaths.\n\nThe chaos has highlighted cracks in Bangladesh's governance and economy and the frustration of young graduates who face a lack of good jobs.\n\nThe government has deployed police and paramilitary forces across the capital to lock down campuses and break up protests. On Wednesday, universities including the country's largest suspended classes and closed dormitories, and on Friday police in Dhaka said they were banning all gatherings and demonstrations in the capital.\n\nAn Associated Press reporter saw border guard officials fire at a crowd of more than 1,000 protesters who had gathered outside the head office of state-run Bangladesh Television, which was attacked and set on fire by protesters the previous day.\n\nThe border guards shot at the crowd with rifles and sound grenades, while police officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets. Bullets littered the streets, which were also marked by smears of blood.\n\nInternet services and mobile data were widely disrupted on Thursday night and remained down on Friday in the capital, Dhaka. Social media platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp were also not loading. It coincided with a widespread internet outage on Friday that disrupted flights, banks, media outlets and companies around the world, but the disruptions in Bangladesh were substantially greater than seen elsewhere.\n\nA statement from the country's Telecommunication Regulatory Commission said they were unable to ensure service after their data center was attacked Thursday by demonstrators, who set fire to some equipment. The Associated Press was not able to independently verify this.\n\nStudent protesters said they will extend their calls to impose a shutdown on Friday as well, and urged mosques across the country to hold funeral prayers for those who have been killed. Major universities have said they will close their doors until tensions ease.\n\nThe protesters are demanding an end to a quota system that reserves up to 30% of government jobs for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971 against Pakistan.\n\nThey argue the system is discriminatory and benefits supporters of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, whose Awami League party led the independence movement, and they want it replaced with a merit-based system.\n\nBut Hasina has defended the quota system, saying that veterans deserve the highest respect for their contributions to the war regardless of their political affiliation.\n\nThe Bangladeshi leader is credited for bringing stable growth to Bangladesh, but rising inflation -- thanks in part to the global upheaval sparked by the war in Ukraine -- has triggered labor unrest and dissatisfaction with the government.\n\nEven though job opportunities have grown in some parts of the private sector, many people prefer government jobs because they are seen as more stable and lucrative. But there aren't enough to go around -- each year, some 400,000 graduates compete for around 3,000 jobs in the civil service exam.\n\n\"What is unfolding in Bangladesh is deeply unsettling for a generation that only asked for a fair opportunity in public service recruitment,\" said Saad Hammadi, a freedom of speech advocate with the Canada-based Balsillie School of International Affairs. \"That a peaceful protest against a state policy would slip into the peak of lawlessness shows the government's lack of farsightedness and inefficient policy governance,\" Hammadi said.\n\n\"The internet shutdown makes matters worse. Local news sites are inaccessible, and people in the country are left incommunicado with the rest of the world all in the pretext of conducting sweeping operations by the state that have often resulted in serious human rights violations,\" he added in an email.\n\nBangladesh has previously shut down internet services in areas affected by protests, using it as a measure to suppress dissent by opposition parties. Internet watchdog Access Now said it recorded three shutdowns in the country in 2023 - all of which overlapped with opposition rallies and were limited in scope to one city or district. That came after six shutdowns in 2022.\n\nCIVICUS, a nonprofit that tracks civic freedoms around the world, last year downgraded Bangladesh to \"closed,\" the worst rating that it could assign, along with China and Venezuela, following a crackdown on the country's opposition members and supporters ahead of its national election.\n\nThe main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party has backed the protesting students and vowed to organize its own demonstrations, and many of their supporters have joined in the students' demonstrations. On Friday, police fired tear gas at a few hundred BNP supporters, and arrested senior BNP leader Ruhul Kabir Rizvi.\n\nThe Awami League and the BNP have often accused each other of fueling political chaos and violence, most recently ahead of the country's national election, which was marred by a crackdown on several opposition figures while Hasina's government accused the party of attempting to disrupt the vote.\n\nHasina's government had earlier halted the job quotas following mass student protests in 2018, but last month, Bangladesh's High Court nullified that decision and reinstated the quotas after relatives of the 1971 veterans filed petitions, triggering the latest demonstrations.\n\nThe Supreme Court has suspended that ruling pending an appeal hearing, and said in a statement it will take up the issue on Sunday.\n\nOn Wednesday, Hasina urged protesters in a televised address to \"wait with patience\" for the court verdict, saying that she believes they \"will get justice\" and \"will not be disappointed.\"\n\nPathi reported from New Delhi, India.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Main opposition groups boycotted those polls.\n\nSomoy TR, a local television channel, reported that four more people died in the latest clashes.\n\nREAD MORE: Hasina re-elected for fourth term in controversial boycotted Bangladeshi election\n\nThis comes a day after the bloodiest day of demonstrations to date when 22 people were killed, according to local media, as protesting students attempted to impose a \"complete shutdown\" on the country.\n\nAuthorities could not be reached immediately to confirm figures for the deaths.\n\nThe chaos has highlighted cracks in Bangladesh's governance and economy and the frustration of young graduates who face a lack of good jobs.\n\nThe government has deployed police and paramilitary forces across the capital to lock down campuses and break up protests. On Wednesday, universities including the country's largest suspended classes and closed dormitories, and on Friday Dhaka police said they were banning all gatherings and demonstrations in the capital.\n\nAn Associated Press reporter saw border guard officials fire at a crowd of more than 1,000 protesters who had gathered outside the head office of state-run Bangladesh Television, which was attacked and set on fire by protesters the previous day.\n\nThe border guards shot at the right crowd with rifles and sound grenades, while police officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets. Bullets littered the streets, which were also marked by smears of blood.\n\nA news producer and reporter at Bangladesh Television on Thursday told the AP that protesters had broken through the main gate and set fire to vehicles and the reception area. They spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.\n\n\"I escaped by leaping over the wall but some of my colleagues got stuck inside. The attackers entered the building and set furniture on fire,\" the producer said by phone.\n\nInternet services and mobile data were widely disrupted on Thursday night and remained down on Friday in the capital, Dhaka. Social media platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp were also not loading. It coincided with a widespread internet outage on Friday that disrupted flights, banks, media outlets and companies around the world, but the disruptions in Bangladesh were substantially greater than seen elsewhere.\n\nA statement from the country's Telecommunication Regulatory Commission said they were unable to ensure service after their data center was attacked Thursday by demonstrators, who set fire to some equipment. The Associated Press has not been able to independently verify this.\n\nStudent protesters said they will extend their calls to impose a shutdown on Friday as well, and urged mosques across the country to hold funeral prayers for those who have been killed. Major universities have said they will close their doors until tensions ease.\n\nREAD MORE: Nobel Peace Prize winner defends reputation against corruption charges in Bangladesh\n\nThe protesters are demanding an end to a quota system that reserves up to 30% of government jobs for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971 against Pakistan.\n\nThey argue the system is discriminatory and benefits supporters of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, whose Awami League party led the independence movement, and they want it replaced with a merit-based system.\n\nBut Hasina has defended the quota system, saying that veterans deserve the highest respect for their contributions to the war regardless of their political affiliation.\n\nThe Bangladeshi leader is credited for bringing stable growth to Bangladesh, but rising inflation -- thanks in part to the global upheaval sparked by the war in Ukraine -- has triggered labor unrest and dissatisfaction with the government.\n\nEven though job opportunities have grown in some parts of the private sector, many people prefer government jobs because they are seen as more stable and lucrative. But there aren't enough to go around -- each year, some 400,000 graduates compete for around 3,000 jobs in the civil service exam.\n\n\"What is unfolding in Bangladesh is deeply unsettling for a generation that only asked for a fair opportunity in public service recruitment. That a peaceful protest against a state policy would slip into the peak of lawlessness shows the government's lack of farsightedness and inefficient policy governance,\" said Saad Hammadi, policy and advocacy manager at the Canada-based Balsillie School of International Affairs who has advocated for freedom of speech in the country.\n\n\"The internet shutdown makes matters worse. Local news sites are inaccessible, and people in the country are left incommunicado with the rest of the world all in the pretext of conducting sweeping operations by the state that have often resulted in serious human rights violations,\" he added in an email.\n\nBangladesh has previously shut down internet services in areas affected by protests, using it as a measure to suppress dissent by opposition parties. Internet watchdog Access Now said it recorded three shutdowns in the country in 2023 - all of which overlapped with opposition rallies and were limited in scope to one city or district. That came after six shutdowns in 2022.\n\nCIVICUS, a nonprofit that tracks civic freedoms around the world, last year downgraded Bangladesh to \"closed,\" the worst rating that it could assign, along with China and Venezuela, following a crackdown on the country's opposition members and supporters ahead of its national election.\n\nREAD MORE: Activists in Bangladesh universities march to demand an end to the Israel-Hamas war\n\nThe main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party has backed the protesting students and vowed to organize its own demonstrations, and many of their supporters have joined in the students' demonstrations. On Friday, police fired tear gas at a few hundred BNP supporters, and arrested senior BNP leader Ruhul Kabir Rizvi.\n\nHasina's government has accused the BNP of stoking the violence, with authorities raiding the opposition party's headquarters earlier this week and arresting activists from the party's student wing.\n\nThe Awami League and the BNP have often accused each other of fueling political chaos and violence, most recently ahead of the country's national election, which was marred by a crackdown on several opposition figures while Hasina's government accused the party of attempting to disrupt the vote.\n\nHasina's government had earlier halted the job quotas following mass student protests in 2018, but last month, Bangladesh's High Court nullified that decision and reinstated the quotas after relatives of the 1971 veterans filed petitions, triggering the latest demonstrations.\n\nThe Supreme Court has suspended that ruling pending an appeal hearing, and said in a statement it will take up the issue on Sunday.\n\nOn Wednesday, Hasina urged protesters in a televised address to \"wait with patience\" for the court verdict. \"I believe our students will get justice from the apex court.

Several people were killed, media reports said.\n\nQuader said the military was deployed to help the civilian administration keep order.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nDHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Police and security officials in Bangladesh fired bullets and tear gas at protesters Friday and banned all gatherings in the capital as internet and mobile services were cut off following days of deadly clashes over the allocation of government jobs. Several people were killed, media reports said.\n\nThe protests, which began weeks ago but escalated sharply this week, represent the biggest challenge to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina since she won a fourth consecutive term in office after elections in January. Main opposition groups boycotted those polls.\n\nThere were varying reports of the number of people killed Friday, with Independent Television reporting 17 dead and Somoy TV reporting 30. An Associated Press reporter saw 23 bodies at Dhaka Medical College and Hospital, but it was not immediately clear whether they had all died on Friday.\n\nA death toll of 22 people was reported on Thursday, in what had so far been the bloodiest day of demonstrations, according to local media, as protesting students attempted to impose a \"complete shutdown\" of the country.\n\nAuthorities could not be reached immediately to confirm figures for the deaths.\n\nThe chaos has highlighted cracks in Bangladesh's governance and economy and the frustration of young graduates who face a lack of good jobs.\n\nThe government has deployed police and paramilitary forces across the capital to lock down campuses and break up protests. On Wednesday, universities including the country's largest suspended classes and closed dormitories, and on Friday police in Dhaka said they were banning all gatherings and demonstrations in the capital.\n\nAn Associated Press reporter saw border guard officials fire at a crowd of more than 1,000 protesters who had gathered outside the head office of state-run Bangladesh Television, which was attacked and set on fire by protesters the previous day.\n\nThe border guards shot at the crowd with rifles and sound grenades, while police officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets. Bullets littered the streets, which were also marked by smears of blood.\n\nInternet services and mobile data were widely disrupted on Thursday night and remained down on Friday in the capital, Dhaka. Social media platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp were also not loading. It coincided with a widespread internet outage on Friday that disrupted flights, banks, media outlets and companies around the world, but the disruptions in Bangladesh were substantially greater than seen elsewhere.\n\nA statement from the country's Telecommunication Regulatory Commission said they were unable to ensure service after their data center was attacked Thursday by demonstrators, who set fire to some equipment. The Associated Press was not able to independently verify this.\n\nStudent protesters said they will extend their calls to impose a shutdown on Friday as well, and urged mosques across the country to hold funeral prayers for those who have been killed. Major universities have said they will close their doors until tensions ease.\n\nThe protesters are demanding an end to a quota system that reserves up to 30% of government jobs for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971 against Pakistan.\n\nThey argue the system is discriminatory and benefits supporters of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, whose Awami League party led the independence movement, and they want it replaced with a merit-based system.\n\nBut Hasina has defended the quota system, saying that veterans deserve the highest respect for their contributions to the war regardless of their political affiliation.\n\nThe Bangladeshi leader is credited for bringing stable growth to Bangladesh, but rising inflation -- thanks in part to the global upheaval sparked by the war in Ukraine -- has triggered labor unrest and dissatisfaction with the government.\n\nEven though job opportunities have grown in some parts of the private sector, many people prefer government jobs because they are seen as more stable and lucrative. But there aren't enough to go around -- each year, some 400,000 graduates compete for around 3,000 jobs in the civil service exam.\n\n\"What is unfolding in Bangladesh is deeply unsettling for a generation that only asked for a fair opportunity in public service recruitment,\" said Saad Hammadi, a freedom of speech advocate with the Canada-based Balsillie School of International Affairs. \"That a peaceful protest against a state policy would slip into the peak of lawlessness shows the government's lack of farsightedness and inefficient policy governance,\" Hammadi said.\n\n\"The internet shutdown makes matters worse. Local news sites are inaccessible, and people in the country are left incommunicado with the rest of the world all in the pretext of conducting sweeping operations by the state that have often resulted in serious human rights violations,\" he added in an email.\n\nBangladesh has previously shut down internet services in areas affected by protests, using it as a measure to suppress dissent by opposition parties. Internet watchdog Access Now said it recorded three shutdowns in the country in 2023 - all of which overlapped with opposition rallies and were limited in scope to one city or district. That came after six shutdowns in 2022.\n\nCIVICUS, a nonprofit that tracks civic freedoms around the world, last year downgraded Bangladesh to \"closed,\" the worst rating that it could assign, along with China and Venezuela, following a crackdown on the country's opposition members and supporters ahead of its national election.\n\nThe main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party has backed the protesting students and vowed to organize its own demonstrations, and many of their supporters have joined in the students' demonstrations. On Friday, police fired tear gas at a few hundred BNP supporters, and arrested senior BNP leader Ruhul Kabir Rizvi.\n\nThe Awami League and the BNP have often accused each other of fueling political chaos and violence, most recently ahead of the country's national election, which was marred by a crackdown on several opposition figures while Hasina's government accused the party of attempting to disrupt the vote.\n\nHasina's government had earlier halted the job quotas following mass student protests in 2018, but last month, Bangladesh's High Court nullified that decision and reinstated the quotas after relatives of the 1971 veterans filed petitions, triggering the latest demonstrations.\n\nThe Supreme Court has suspended that ruling pending an appeal hearing, and said in a statement it will take up the issue on Sunday.\n\nOn Wednesday, Hasina urged protesters in a televised address to \"wait with patience\" for the court verdict, saying that she believes they \"will get justice\" and \"will not be disappointed.\"\n\nPathi reported from New Delhi, India.", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party said that it would join those efforts.\n\nClashes continued Thursday as protesters tried to enforce the shutdown.

Violence pitting protesters against pro-government student groups and police soon spread to other cities. Six people had been reported killed on Tuesday, and hundreds more have been injured.\n\nAuthorities did not immediately confirm figures for the deaths. The protesters are demanding an end to a quota system that reserves up to 30% of government jobs for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971.\n\nThey argue the system is discriminatory and benefits supporters of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, whose Awami League party led the independence movement, and they want it replaced with a merit-based system.\n\nHasina's party has accused opposition parties of stoking the violence. The leading Dhaka-based newspaper Prothom Alo, which has a strong network of reporters across the country, said that by late Thursday night, they received reports of 19 deaths in Dhaka and elsewhere in the day's raging violence. The country's leading English-language Daily Star also reported 19 deaths on Thursday.\n\nProthom Alo said at least six people died in Dhaka's Uttara area alone in the latest clashes pitting the protesters against security officials and ruling party activists. Thirteen others including a Dhaka-based journalist of an online portal died in other parts of the capital and elsewhere.\n\nProtesters attacked the head office of state-run Bangladesh Television, breaking through a main gate and setting vehicles and the reception area on fire, a news producer and a reporter told The Associated Press by phone. They spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.\n\n\"I escaped by leaping over the wall but some of my colleagues got stuck inside. The attackers entered the building and set furniture on fire,\" the producer said by phone.\n\nHe said the station continued broadcasting, though some Dhaka residents said they were receiving no signal from the broadcaster. Meanwhile, the country was experiencing a near-total shutdown of internet services, Alp Toker, director of the London-based internet monitor NetBlocks, said on X.\n\nThe violence has continued despite a pending court decision on the legality of quota system. Hasina and Law Minister Anisul Huq urged protesters to await that decision, with Hasina saying she believes the protesters won't be disappointed by the court verdict. Huq said on Thursday that he would be willing to sit with protesters to discuss their demands.\n\nFollowing the first deaths in this week's violence on Tuesday, the government asked universities across the country to close in hopes of quelling the student unrest, and police raided the main opposition party's headquarters.\n\nProtesters responded Wednesday evening by saying they would enforce a \"complete shutdown\" of transportation across the country apart from emergency services on Thursday.

(AP Photo/Rajib Dhar)DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) - Police and security officials in Bangladesh fired bullets and tear gas at protesters Friday and banned all gatherings in the capital as internet and mobile services were cut off following days of deadly clashes over the allocation of government jobs. Several people were killed, media reports said. The protests, which began weeks ago but escalated sharply this week, represent the biggest challenge to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina since she won a fourth consecutive term in office after elections in January. Main opposition groups boycotted those polls. There were varying reports of the number of people killed Friday, with Independent Television reporting 17 dead and Somoy TV reporting 30. An Associated Press reporter saw 23 bodies at Dhaka Medical College and Hospital, but it was not immediately clear whether they had all died on Friday. A death toll of 22 people was reported on Thursday, in what had so far been the bloodiest day of demonstrations, according to local media, as protesting students attempted to impose a \"complete shutdown\"\u009d of the country. Authorities could not be reached immediately to confirm figures for the deaths. The chaos has highlighted cracks in Bangladesh's governance and economy and the frustration of young graduates who face a lack of good jobs. The government has deployed police and paramilitary forces across the capital to lock down campuses and break up protests. On Wednesday, universities including the country's largest suspended classes and closed dormitories, and on Friday police in Dhaka said they were banning all gatherings and demonstrations in the capital. An Associated Press reporter saw border guard officials fire at a crowd of more than 1,000 protesters who had gathered outside the head office of state-run Bangladesh Television, which was attacked and set on fire by protesters the previous day. The border guards shot at the crowd with rifles and sound grenades, while police officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets. Bullets littered the streets, which were also marked by smears of blood. Internet services and mobile data were widely disrupted on Thursday night and remained down on Friday in the capital, Dhaka. Social media platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp were also not loading. It coincided with a widespread internet outage on Friday that disrupted flights, banks, media outlets and companies around the world, but the disruptions in Bangladesh were substantially greater than seen elsewhere. A statement from the country's Telecommunication Regulatory Commission said they were unable to ensure service after their data center was attacked Thursday by demonstrators, who set fire to some equipment. The Associated Press was not able to independently verify this. Student protesters said they will extend their calls to impose a shutdown on Friday as well, and urged mosques across the country to hold funeral prayers for those who have been killed. Major universities have said they will close their doors until tensions ease. The protesters are demanding an end to a quota system that reserves up to 30% of government jobs for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971 against Pakistan. They argue the system is discriminatory and benefits supporters of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, whose Awami League party led the independence movement, and they want it replaced with a merit-based system. But Hasina has defended the quota system, saying that veterans deserve the highest respect for their contributions to the war regardless of their political affiliation. The Bangladeshi leader is credited for bringing stable growth to Bangladesh, but rising inflation - thanks in part to the global upheaval sparked by the war in Ukraine - has triggered labor unrest and dissatisfaction with the government. Even though job opportunities have grown in some parts of the private sector, many people prefer government jobs because they are seen as more stable and lucrative. But there aren't enough to go around - each year, some 400,000 graduates compete for around 3,000 jobs in the civil service exam. \"What is unfolding in Bangladesh is deeply unsettling for a generation that only asked for a fair opportunity in public service recruitment,\" said Saad Hammadi, a freedom of speech advocate with the Canada-based Balsillie School of International Affairs. \"That a peaceful protest against a state policy would slip into the peak of lawlessness shows the government's lack of farsightedness and inefficient policy governance,\"\u009d Hammadi said. \"The internet shutdown makes matters worse. Local news sites are inaccessible, and people in the country are left incommunicado with the rest of the world all in the pretext of conducting sweeping operations by the state that have often resulted in serious human rights violations,\"\u009d he added in an email. Bangladesh has previously shut down internet services in areas affected by protests, using it as a measure to suppress dissent by opposition parties. Internet watchdog Access Now said it recorded three shutdowns in the country in 2023 - all of which overlapped with opposition rallies and were limited in scope to one city or district. That came after six shutdowns in 2022. CIVICUS, a nonprofit that tracks civic freedoms around the world, last year downgraded Bangladesh to \"closed,\"\u009d the worst rating that it could assign, along with China and Venezuela, following a crackdown on the country's opposition members and supporters ahead of its national election. The main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party has backed the protesting students and vowed to organize its own demonstrations, and many of their supporters have joined in the students' demonstrations. On Friday, police fired tear gas at a few hundred BNP supporters, and arrested senior BNP leader Ruhul Kabir Rizvi. The Awami League and the BNP have often accused each other of fueling political chaos and violence, most recently ahead of the country's national election, which was marred by a crackdown on several opposition figures while Hasina's government accused the party of attempting to disrupt the vote. Hasina's government had earlier halted the job quotas following mass student protests in 2018, but last month, Bangladesh's High Court nullified that decision and reinstated the quotas after relatives of the 1971 veterans filed petitions, triggering the latest demonstrations. The Supreme Court has suspended that ruling pending an appeal hearing, and said in a statement it will take up the issue on Sunday. On Wednesday, Hasina urged protesters in a televised address to \"wait with patience\"\u009d for the court verdict, saying that she believes they \"will get justice\"\u009d and \"will not be disappointed.\"\u009d ___ Pathi reported from New Delhi, India.", "source": {"uri": "medicinehatnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medicine Hat News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Authorities could not be reached to immediately confirm figures for the deaths.\n\nThe chaos has highlighted cracks in Bangladesh's governance and economy, as well as the frustration of young graduates who face a lack of good jobs.\n\nThe government has deployed police and paramilitary forces across the capital to lock down campuses and break up protests.

The Associated Press has not been able to independently verify this.\n\nStudent protesters said they will extend their calls to impose a shutdown on Friday as well, and urged mosques across the country to hold funeral prayers for those who have been killed. Major universities have said they will close their doors until tensions ease.\n\nThe protesters are demanding an end to a quota system that reserves up to 30 per cent of government jobs for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971 against Pakistan.\n\nThey argue the system is discriminatory and benefits supporters of Hasina, whose Awami League party led the independence movement, and they want it replaced with a merit-based system.\n\nBut Hasina has defended the quota system, saying that veterans deserve the highest respect for their contributions in the war, regardless of their political affiliation.\n\nThe Bangladeshi leader is credited for bringing stable growth to Bangladesh, but rising inflation -- thanks in part to the global upheaval sparked by the war in Ukraine -- has triggered labour unrest and dissatisfaction with the government.\n\nEven though job opportunities have grown in some parts of the private sector, many people prefer government jobs because they are seen as more stable and lucrative. But there aren't enough to go around -- each year, some 400,000 graduates compete for around 3,000 jobs in the civil service exam.\n\n\"What is unfolding in Bangladesh is deeply unsettling for a generation that only asked for a fair opportunity in public service recruitment.

Here's what you need to know - KION546", "body": "By Samra Zulfaqar, Helen Regan and Andee Capellan, CNN\n\n(CNN) -- Huge protests across Bangladesh escalated into deadly violence this week with clashes between students, pro-government supporters and armed police fueling widespread anger over civil service job quotas opponents say are discriminatory.\n\nDozens of people have reportedly been killed and hundreds injured in the violence, which has seen riot police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters and crowds of demonstrators armed with sticks filling the streets and university campuses in the capital Dhaka and other cities.\n\nState broadcaster Bangladesh Television (BTV) was off air on Friday after student demonstrators allegedly set fire to its headquarters, according to local media, and protesters have called for a nationwide shutdown in a major challenge to the government of longstanding Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.\n\nMobile and internet services have been cut, schools and universities ordered to close, and security forces deployed to quell the unrest, with human rights groups accusing authorities of using unlawful force against protesters.\n\nMany Bangladeshi students are demanding an end to the government's quota system, which reserves more than half of civil service posts for certain groups.\n\nSome 30% of those highly sought-after jobs are reserved for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's war of independence from Pakistan in 1971, a seminal moment in the nation's history as it successfully won freedom from a much larger ruler.\n\nMany of the country's contemporary political elite are related to that generation - including Prime Minister Hasina, a daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the widely regarded founder of modern Bangladesh who was assassinated in 1975.\n\nThe reserved roles are linked to job security and higher pay, and protesters say the quota system is discriminatory and favors supporters of Hasina's ruling Awami League party. They are demanding recruitment based on merit.\n\n\"A government job is a really good opportunity,\" said Maruf Khan, 29, a Bangladeshi studying in Australia, who has joined rallies supporting the protests in Sydney. \"About 500,000 to 600,000 people are competing for 600 to 700 government jobs and on top of that it includes a 56% quota. It's not easy.\"\n\nDriving the anger is high unemployment levels in the country, especially among young people. Bangladesh has seen strong economic growth under Hasina, but it has slowed in the post-pandemic era and, as the World Bank notes in its latest overview, inequality has \"widened in urban areas.\" In a nation of 170 million people, more than 30 million are not in work or education.\n\nIn 2018, the quota system was scrapped following similar protests but in June the High Court reinstated it, ruling its removal was unconstitutional. On July 10, the Supreme Court suspended the quotas for one month while it took up the case.\n\nCritics and protesters say the quota system creates a two-tier Bangladesh where a politically connected elite benefit by their birth.\n\n\"The freedom fighters have sacrificed a lot for the nation ... for that reason this quota was a logical thing in the past,\" said student protester Tahmeed Hossain. \"But there have been at least two generations after that. Nowadays, the quota ... has rather become a form of discrimination. It has become a cultural propaganda to create a stronghold in the country.\"\n\nWhy did the protests escalate?\n\nThe protests began at the prestigious Dhaka University on July 1 and later spread to other campuses and cities nationwide in almost daily street gatherings that included rail and road blockades.\n\nThe demonstrations became violent on July 15 when members of the Bangladesh Chatra League - the student wing of the ruling Awami League party - reportedly attacked student protesters inside the Dhaka University campus.\n\nSince then, clashes between security forces, protesters and government supporters have escalated, with Bangladesh deploying its paramilitary Rapid Action Battalion, which was sanctioned by the United States in 2021 after \"widespread allegations of serious human rights abuses.\"\n\nThe student protester Hossain told CNN he was wounded at a rally at Dhaka University on Wednesday when a projectile was thrown into the crowd.\n\n\"Someone threw a small thing at us that blew up and I heard shots. I started running and realized that I had been hurt by some splinters in my hands. The police then attacked us with tear shell in the building,\" he said. \"One of my friends got hit by a (rubber) bullet in the leg. Some of my friends got their heads smashed and are currently under treatment in the hospital.\"\n\nAnother protester in Dhaka, Hassan Abdullah, said Thursday: \"There are tear (gas) shells just 50 meters away from me as I am talking to you. The police are constantly bursting sound grenades right now.\"\n\nCNN cannot independently verify the accounts but the sounds of protest commotion, including multiple audible cracks, could be heard during the conversation with Abdullah.\n\nReports of the number of people killed has varied widely, with the Dhaka-based newspaper Prothom Alo saying 19 people were killed on Thursday alone and the Agence France-Press news agency reporting 32 deaths, citing its own tally compiled from hospital data.\n\nAuthorities have also moved to block online communications.\n\nInternet monitoring site Netblocks confirmed a \"near-total national internet shutdown\" across Bangladesh on Thursday. \"The new measure follows earlier efforts to throttle social media and restrict mobile data services,\" it said on X.\n\nWhat has the government said?\n\nThe demonstrations are the biggest challenge to Prime Minister Hasina since she secured a fourth consecutive term in January elections, which were boycotted by the main opposition party to protest what they said was a widespread crackdown on their ranks.\n\nHasina has announced a judicial investigation into the killings and called on protesters to await the verdict of the Supreme Court.\n\n\"I especially urge everyone to wait patiently until the Supreme Court verdict comes. I believe our students will get justice from high court, they will not be disappointed,\" Hasina said in a news conference Thursday.\n\nBut she has been accused of enflaming protester anger by reportedly calling them \"razakar,\" an offensive term used for those who allegedly collaborated with the Pakistani army during the 1971 independence war.\n\n\"We expected an apology from our prime minister for comparing us to traitors of 1952 and 1972, and a solid solution to quota reform,\" said protester Salman Farsi. \"What did the students do to deserve this tag?\"\n\nStudent protesters CNN spoke to say their demonstrations have gone beyond frustration over the quota system and their anger is now directed at Hasina and her government, which human rights organizations have long warned are headed toward a one-party system.\n\n\"This is a people's movement against the authoritarian government,\" Hossain said.\n\n\"This is not just about quota protests anymore, this is much bigger than that, in simple quota protests the government wouldn't go around hurting and shooting students. This shows the current fascist and autocratic nature of the government, who has been upholding the power without any proper voting system.\"\n\nWhat has global reaction been?\n\nBangladeshi students have held smaller protests elsewhere, including in New York's Times Square, the Australian cities Melbourne and Sydney and the Danish capital Copenhagen.\n\nThe US said it was \"continuing to monitor the reports of violence from the ongoing protests in and around Dhaka,\" a State Department spokesperson said in a briefing on Thursday.\n\n\"Freedom of expression and peaceful assembly are essential building blocks to any thriving democracy, and we condemn the recent acts of violence in Bangladesh.\"\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for restraint on all sides and urged the government to investigate all acts of violence, according to UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric.\n\n\"The secretary-general encourages the meaningful and constructive participation of youth to address the ongoing challenges in Bangladesh. Violence can never be the solution,\" Dujarric said.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Bullets littered the streets, which were also marked by smears of blood.\n\nA news producer and reporter at Bangladesh Television on Thursday told the Associated Press that protesters had broken through the main gate and set fire to vehicles and the reception area. They spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\n\"I escaped by leaping over the wall but some of my colleagues got stuck inside. The attackers entered the building and set furniture on fire,\" the producer said by phone.\n\nAt least 22 people were killed on Thursday, a local TV station reported, following six deaths earlier this week. Authorities could not be reached to immediately confirm figures for the deaths.\n\nOn Friday morning, internet services and mobile data appeared to be down in the capital, Dhaka, and social media platforms such as Facebook and WhatsApp were not loading.\n\nA statement from the country's Telecommunication Regulatory Commission said they were unable to ensure service after their data centre was attacked on Thursday by demonstrators, who set fire to some equipment. The Associated Press has not been able to independently verify this.\n\nStudent protesters said they will extend their calls to impose a shutdown on Friday as well, and urged mosques across the country to hold funeral prayers for those who have been killed.\n\nThe protesters are demanding an end to a quota system that reserves up to 30% of government jobs for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971 against Pakistan.\n\nThey argue the system is discriminatory and benefits supporters of Ms Hasina, whose Awami League party led the independence movement, and they want it replaced with a merit-based system.\n\nBut Ms Hasina has defended the quota system, saying that veterans deserve the highest respect for their contributions in the war regardless of their political affiliation.\n\nThe Bangladeshi leader is credited for bringing stable growth to Bangladesh, but rising inflation -- thanks in part to the global upheaval sparked by the war in Ukraine -- has triggered labour unrest and dissatisfaction with the government.\n\nEven though job opportunities have grown in some parts of the private sector, many people prefer government jobs because they are seen as more stable and lucrative. But there are not enough to go around -- each year, some 400,000 graduates compete for around 3,000 jobs in the civil service exam.\n\n\"What is unfolding in Bangladesh is deeply unsettling for a generation that only asked for a fair opportunity in public service recruitment. That a peaceful protest against a state policy would slip into the peak of lawlessness shows the government's lack of farsightedness and inefficient policy governance,\" said Saad Hammadi, policy and advocacy manager at the Canada-based Balsillie School of International Affairs who has advocated for freedom of speech in the country.\n\n\"The internet shutdown makes matters worse. Local news sites are inaccessible, and people in the country are left incommunicado with the rest of the world all in the pretext of conducting sweeping operations by the state that have often resulted in serious human rights violations,\" he added in an email.\n\nBangladesh has previously shut down internet services in areas affected by protests, using it as a measure to suppress dissent by opposition parties, according to Access Now, an internet watchdog.\n\nCIVICUS, a nonprofit that tracks civic freedoms around the world, last year downgraded Bangladesh to \"closed,\" the worst rating that it could assign, along with China and Venezuela, following a crackdown on the country's opposition members and supporters ahead of its national election.\n\nThe main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party has backed the protesting students and is expected to hold demonstrations to show their support. Ms Hasina's party has accused them of stoking the violence, raiding the BNP's headquarters and arresting activists from the party's student wing earlier this week.\n\nThe Awami League and the BNP have often accused each other of fuelling political chaos and violence, most recently ahead of the country's national election, which was marred by a crackdown on several opposition figures while Ms Hasina's government accused the party of attempting to disrupt the vote.\n\nMs Hasina's government had earlier halted the job quotas following mass student protests in 2018, but last month, Bangladesh's High Court nullified that decision and reinstated the quotas after relatives of the 1971 veterans filed petitions, triggering the latest demonstrations.\n\nThe Supreme Court has suspended that ruling pending an appeal hearing, and said in a statement it will take up the issue on Sunday.\n\nOn Wednesday, Ms Hasina urged protesters in a televised address to \"wait with patience\" for the court verdict. \"I believe our students will get justice from the apex court. They will not be disappointed.\"", "source": {"uri": "expressandstar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Express & Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tear_gas",

Main opposition groups boycotted those polls.\n\nSomoy TR, a local television channel, reported that four more people died in the latest clashes.\n\nThis comes a day after the bloodiest day of demonstrations to date when 22 people were killed, according to local media, as protesting students attempted to impose a \"complete shutdown\" on the country.\n\nAuthorities could not be reached immediately to confirm figures for the deaths.\n\nThe chaos has highlighted cracks in Bangladesh's governance and economy and the frustration of young graduates who face a lack of good jobs.\n\nThe government has deployed police and paramilitary forces across the capital to lock down campuses and break up protests. On Wednesday, universities including the country's largest suspended classes and closed dormitories, and on Friday Dhaka police said they were banning all gatherings and demonstrations in the capital.\n\nAn Associated Press reporter saw border guard officials fire at a crowd of more than 1,000 protesters who had gathered outside the head office of state-run Bangladesh Television, which was attacked and set on fire by protesters the previous day.\n\nThe border guards shot at the right crowd with rifles and sound grenades, while police officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets. Bullets littered the streets, which were also marked by smears of blood.\n\nA news producer and reporter at Bangladesh Television on Thursday told the AP that protesters had broken through the main gate and set fire to vehicles and the reception area. They spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.\n\n\"I escaped by leaping over the wall but some of my colleagues got stuck inside. The attackers entered the building and set furniture on fire,\" the producer said by phone.\n\nInternet services and mobile data were widely disrupted on Thursday night and remained down on Friday in the capital, Dhaka. Social media platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp were also not loading. It coincided with a widespread internet outage on Friday that disrupted flights, banks, media outlets and companies around the world, but the disruptions in Bangladesh were substantially greater than seen elsewhere.\n\nA statement from the country's Telecommunication Regulatory Commission said they were unable to ensure service after their data centre was attacked on Thursday by demonstrators, who set fire to some equipment. The Associated Press has not been able to independently verify this.\n\nStudent protesters said they will extend their calls to impose a shutdown on Friday as well, and urged mosques across the country to hold funeral prayers for those who have been killed. Major universities have said they will close their doors until tensions ease.\n\nThe protesters are demanding an end to a quota system that reserves up to 30% of government jobs for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971 against Pakistan.\n\nThey argue the system is discriminatory and benefits supporters of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, whose Awami League party led the independence movement, and they want it replaced with a merit-based system.\n\nBut Hasina has defended the quota system, saying that veterans deserve the highest respect for their contributions to the war regardless of their political affiliation.\n\nThe Bangladeshi leader is credited for bringing stable growth to Bangladesh, but rising inflation -- thanks in part to the global upheaval sparked by the war in Ukraine -- has triggered labor unrest and dissatisfaction with the government.\n\nEven though job opportunities have grown in some parts of the private sector, many people prefer government jobs because they are seen as more stable and lucrative. But there aren't enough to go around -- each year, some 400,000 graduates compete for around 3,000 jobs in the civil service exam.\n\n\"What is unfolding in Bangladesh is deeply unsettling for a generation that only asked for a fair opportunity in public service recruitment. That a peaceful protest against a state policy would slip into the peak of lawlessness shows the government's lack of farsightedness and inefficient policy governance,\" said Saad Hammadi, policy and advocacy manager at the Canada-based Balsillie School of International Affairs who has advocated for freedom of speech in the country.\n\n\"The internet shutdown makes matters worse. Local news sites are inaccessible, and people in the country are left incommunicado with the rest of the world all in the pretext of conducting sweeping operations by the state that have often resulted in serious human rights violations,\" he added in an email.\n\nBangladesh has previously shut down internet services in areas affected by protests, using it as a measure to suppress dissent by opposition parties. Internet watchdog Access Now said it recorded three shutdowns in the country in 2023 - all of which overlapped with opposition rallies and were limited in scope to one city or district. That came after six shutdowns in 2022.\n\nCIVICUS, a non-profit that tracks civic freedoms around the world, last year downgraded Bangladesh to \"closed,\" the worst rating that it could assign, along with China and Venezuela, following a crackdown on the country's opposition members and supporters ahead of its national election.\n\nThe main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party has backed the protesting students and vowed to organise its own demonstrations, and many of their supporters have joined in the students' demonstrations. On Friday, police fired tear gas at a few hundred BNP supporters, and arrested senior BNP leader Ruhul Kabir Rizvi.\n\nHasina's government has accused the BNP of stoking the violence, with authorities raiding the opposition party's headquarters earlier this week and arresting activists from the party's student wing.\n\nThe Awami League and the BNP have often accused each other of fuelling political chaos and violence, most recently ahead of the country's national election, which was marred by a crackdown on several opposition figures while Hasina's government accused the party of attempting to disrupt the vote.\n\nHasina's government had earlier halted the job quotas following mass student protests in 2018, but last month, Bangladesh's High Court nullified that decision and reinstated the quotas after relatives of the 1971 veterans filed petitions, triggering the latest demonstrations.\n\nThe Supreme Court has suspended that ruling pending an appeal hearing, and said in a statement it will take up the issue on Sunday.\n\nOn Wednesday, Hasina urged protesters in a televised address to \"wait with patience\" for the court verdict. \"I believe our students will get justice from the apex court. They will not be disappointed.\"", "source": {"uri": "euronews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Euronews English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet",

Here's what you need to know", "body": "Huge protests across Bangladesh escalated into deadly violence this week with clashes between students, pro-government supporters and armed police fueling widespread anger over civil service job quotas opponents say are discriminatory.\n\nDozens of people have reportedly been killed and hundreds injured in the violence, which has seen riot police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters and crowds of demonstrators armed with sticks filling the streets and university campuses in the capital Dhaka and other cities.\n\nOn Thursday, student demonstrators allegedly set fire to a building of Bangladesh's state broadcaster, according to local media, and have called for a nationwide shutdown, in a major challenge to the government of longstanding Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.\n\nMobile and internet services have been cut, schools and universities ordered to close, and security forces deployed to quell the unrest, with human rights groups accusing authorities of using unlawful force against protesters.\n\nHere's what you need to know.\n\nWhy are students protesting?\n\nMany Bangladeshi students are demanding an end to the government's quota system, which reserves more than half of civil service posts for certain groups.\n\nSome 30% of those highly sought-after jobs are reserved for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's war of independence from Pakistan in 1971, a seminal moment in the nation's history as it successfully won freedom from a much larger ruler.\n\nMany of the country's contemporary political elite are related to that generation - including Prime Minister Hasina, a daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the widely regarded founder of modern Bangladesh who was assassinated in 1975.\n\nThe reserved roles are linked to job security and higher pay, and protesters say the quota system is discriminatory and favors supporters of Hasina's ruling Awami League party. They are demanding recruitment based on merit.\n\n\"A government job is a really good opportunity,\" said Maruf Khan, 29, a Bangladeshi studying in Australia, who has joined rallies supporting the protests in Sydney. \"About 500,000 to 600,000 people are competing for 600 to 700 government jobs and on top of that it includes a 56% quota. It's not easy.\"\n\nProtesters vandalize motorcycles in Dhaka on July 18, 2024.\n\nStringer/AFP/Getty Images\n\nDriving the anger is high unemployment levels in the country, especially among young people. Bangladesh has seen strong economic growth under Hasina, but it has slowed in the post-pandemic era and, as the World Bank notes in its latest overview, inequality has \"widened in urban areas.\" In a nation of 170 million people, more than 30 million are not in work or education.\n\nIn 2018, the quota system was scrapped following similar protests but in June the High Court reinstated it, ruling its removal was unconstitutional. On July 10, the Supreme Court suspended the quotas for one month while it took up the case.\n\nCritics and protesters say the quota system creates a two-tier Bangladesh where a politically connected elite benefit by their birth.\n\n\"The freedom fighters have sacrificed a lot for the nation ... for that reason this quota was a logical thing in the past,\" said student protester Tahmeed Hossain. \"But there have been at least two generations after that. Nowadays, the quota ... has rather become a form of discrimination. It has become a cultural propaganda to create a stronghold in the country.\"\n\nWhy did the protests escalate?\n\nThe protests began at the prestigious Dhaka University on July 1 and later spread to other campuses and cities nationwide in almost daily street gatherings that included rail and road blockades.\n\nThe demonstrations became violent on July 15 when members of the Bangladesh Chatra League - the student wing of the ruling Awami League party - reportedly attacked student protesters inside the Dhaka University campus.\n\nSince then, clashes between security forces, protesters and government supporters have escalated, with Bangladesh deploying its paramilitary Rapid Action Battalion, which was sanctioned by the United States in 2021 after \"widespread allegations of serious human rights abuses.\"\n\nThe student protester Hossain told CNN he was wounded at a rally at Dhaka University on Wednesday when a projectile was thrown into the crowd.\n\nStudents clash with police during protests in Dhaka on July 18, 2024.\n\nMunir Uz Zaman/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\"Someone threw a small thing at us that blew up and I heard shots. I started running and realized that I had been hurt by some splinters in my hands. The police then attacked us with tear shell in the building,\" he said. \"One of my friends got hit by a (rubber) bullet in the leg. Some of my friends got their heads smashed and are currently under treatment in the hospital.\"\n\nAnother protester in Dhaka, Hassan Abdullah, said Thursday: \"There are tear (gas) shells just 50 meters away from me as I am talking to you. The police are constantly bursting sound grenades right now.\"\n\nCNN cannot independently verify the accounts but the sounds of protest commotion, including multiple audible cracks, could be heard during the conversation with Abdullah.\n\nReports of the number of people killed has varied widely, with the Dhaka-based newspaper Prothom Alo saying 19 people were killed on Thursday alone and the Agence France-Press news agency reporting 32 deaths, citing its own tally compiled from hospital data.\n\nAuthorities have also moved to block online communications.\n\nInternet monitoring site Netblocks confirmed a \"near-total national internet shutdown\" across Bangladesh on Thursday. \"The new measure follows earlier efforts to throttle social media and restrict mobile data services,\" it said on X.\n\nWhat has the government said?\n\nThe demonstrations are the biggest challenge to Prime Minister Hasina since she secured a fourth consecutive term in January elections, which were boycotted by the main opposition party to protest what they said was a widespread crackdown on their ranks.\n\nHasina has announced a judicial investigation into the killings and called on protesters to await the verdict of the Supreme Court.\n\n\"I especially urge everyone to wait patiently until the Supreme Court verdict comes. I believe our students will get justice from high court, they will not be disappointed,\" Hasina said in a news conference Thursday.\n\nBut she has been accused of enflaming protester anger by reportedly calling them \"razakar,\" an offensive term used for those who allegedly collaborated with the Pakistani army during the 1971 independence war.\n\nBangladeshi police fire tear gas to disperse protesters during a clash in Dhaka on July 18, 2024.\n\nMunir Uz Zaman/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\"We expected an apology from our prime minister for comparing us to traitors of 1952 and 1972, and a solid solution to quota reform,\" said protester Salman Farsi. \"What did the students do to deserve this tag?\"\n\nStudent protesters CNN spoke to say their demonstrations have gone beyond frustration over the quota system and their anger is now directed at Hasina and her government, which human rights organizations have long warned are headed toward a one-party system.\n\n\"This is a people's movement against the authoritarian government,\" Hossain said.\n\n\"This is not just about quota protests anymore, this is much bigger than that, in simple quota protests the government wouldn't go around hurting and shooting students. This shows the current fascist and autocratic nature of the government, who has been upholding the power without any proper voting system.\"\n\nWhat has global reaction been?\n\nBangladeshi students have held smaller protests elsewhere, including in New York's Times Square, the Australian cities Melbourne and Sydney and the Danish capital Copenhagen.\n\nThe US said it was \"continuing to monitor the reports of violence from the ongoing protests in and around Dhaka,\" a State Department spokesperson said in a briefing on Thursday.\n\n\"Freedom of expression and peaceful assembly are essential building blocks to any thriving democracy, and we condemn the recent acts of violence in Bangladesh.\"\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for restraint by all sides and urged the authorities to investigate acts of violence, according to UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric.\n\n\"The secretary-general encourages the meaningful and constructive participation of youth to address the ongoing challenges in Bangladesh. Violence can never be the solution,\" Dujarric said.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "helen_regan@cnn.com", "name": "Helen Regan", "type":

Hundreds of people, including the police, have suffered injuries since.\n\nPolice and security officials fired bullets and tear gas at protesters in Bangladesh on Friday as the authorities cut off internet and mobile services following deadly clashes in the capital Dhaka and other major cities.\n\nThe fresh clashes follow the bloodiest day of the protests to date, which led to the death of 22 people, mostly undergraduate students, as protesters attempted to impose a \"complete shutdown\" in the country.\n\nAt least two journalists were among those killed during the violence. \"I am shot at but will continue my work after dressing at hospital,\" wrote journalist Muktadir Rashid on X.\n\nThe protesters have called on the government to abolish the quota for being \"discriminatory\" against the students.\n\nUnder the quota system, government jobs are also reserved for women, disabled people and members of ethnic minorities, but students have mainly protested against jobs reserved for veterans' families, which they claim benefits mostly supporters of prime minister Sheikh Hasina, whose Awami League party led the independence movement.\n\nThe policy has angered students suffering from high unemployment in a country where some 32 million young people are not in work or education. Even though job opportunities have grown in some parts of the private sector, many people prefer government jobs because they are seen as more stable and lucrative.\n\n\"We have to look out for ourselves and our future generations. We need jobs in this country, we are already suffering from the lack of it,\" said Alam Rashid, a student from Dhaka. \"We have invited the government to have a conversation with us multiple times, instead she [Sheikh Hasina] just unleashed her police force on us,\" he told The Independent.\n\nMs Hasina's government had halted the job quotas following mass student protests in 2018, but last month, the High Court nullified that decision and reinstated the quotas after relatives of the 1971 veterans filed petitions.\n\nThe Supreme Court suspended that ruling pending an appeal hearing. The court will take up the matter on Sunday.\n\nMs Hasina is the daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the man who led Bangladesh to independence. She has defended the quota system, saying that veterans deserve the highest respect for their contributions in the war regardless of their political affiliation.\n\nShe previously labelled those opposing the quota system as \"razakar\", or volunteer, a term used for those who allegedly collaborated with the Pakistani army during the 1971 war.\n\nMs Hasina \"was forced\" to call in the army to \"maintain order\" as paramilitary and police failed to curtail the violence, according to reports. Rights groups have accused the police of using brute force against the protesters after bullet injuries were found on the body of a 25-year-old university student this week.\n\nMost television news channels in Bangladesh were off the air on Friday after thousands of protesters stormed the headquarters of the state broadcaster BTV, vandalised furniture, smashed windows, and set fire to parts of the building.\n\nBacked by the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), the students have refused to back down.\n\n\"We were protesting peacefully until we were attacked by the goons. It is our right to continue protesting, it is embedded in the history of this country and we shall continue to do so for our right,\" a Dhaka university student who did not want to be named for fear of persecution told The Independent.\n\nThe Awami League and the BNP have often accused each other of fueling political chaos and violence, most recently ahead of the country's national election, which was marred by a crackdown on several opposition figures while Hasina's government accused the party of attempting to disrupt the vote.\n\nMs Hasina on Wednesday urged protesters in a televised address to \"wait with patience\" for the court verdict. \"I believe our students will get justice from the apex court. They will not be disappointed.\"\n\nHer law minister, Anisul Huq, said the government was willing to talk to the protesters \"whenever they want to sit in the discussion, it will happen\".\n\nEarlier in the week the government suspended university classes indefinitely and asked students to vacate the dorms immediately.\n\n\"What is unfolding in Bangladesh is deeply unsettling for a generation that only asked for a fair opportunity in public service recruitment. That a peaceful protest against a state policy would slip into the peak of lawlessness shows the government's lack of farsightedness and inefficient policy governance,\" said Saad Hammadi, policy and advocacy manager at the Canada-based Balsillie School of International Affairs.\n\n\"The internet shutdown makes matters worse. Local news sites are inaccessible, and people in the country are left incommunicado with the rest of the world all in the pretext of conducting sweeping operations by the state that have often resulted in serious human rights violations,\" he told the Associated Press.\n\nThe streets of Dhaka were deserted on Friday with little traffic and very few rickshaw pullers on the roads and thin crowds near a vegetable and fish market.\n\nThe official websites of the Bangladesh central bank, the prime minister's office, and the police appeared to have been hacked by a group calling itself \"THE R3SISTANC3\".\n\n\"Operation HuntDown, Stop Killing Students,\" it said in identical messages on both sites, adding in bright red font: \"It's not a protest anymore, it's a war now.\"\n\nThe US and the UN have raised concerns about the ongoing protests and called for \"restraint from all sides\".\n\nIndia, one of Bangladesh's strongest allies, issued an advisory on Thursday for its residents living in the embattled country. The embassy asked Indian citizens to \"avoid local travel and minimise their movement outside their living premises\".", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"},

Main opposition groups boycotted those polls.\n\nSomoy TR, a local television channel, reported that four more people died in the latest clashes.\n\nThis comes a day after the bloodiest day of demonstrations to date when 22 people were killed, according to local media, as protesting students attempted to impose a \"complete shutdown\" on the country.\n\nAuthorities could not be reached immediately to confirm figures for the deaths.\n\nThe chaos has highlighted cracks in Bangladesh's governance and economy and the frustration of young graduates who face a lack of good jobs.\n\nThe government has deployed police and paramilitary forces across the capital to lock down campuses and break up protests. On Wednesday, universities including the country's largest suspended classes and closed dormitories, and on Friday Dhaka police said they were banning all gatherings and demonstrations in the capital.\n\nAn Associated Press reporter saw border guard officials fire at a crowd of more than 1,000 protesters who had gathered outside the head office of state-run Bangladesh Television, which was attacked and set on fire by protesters the previous day.\n\nThe border guards shot at the right crowd with rifles and sound grenades, while police officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets. Bullets littered the streets, which were also marked by smears of blood.\n\nA news producer and reporter at Bangladesh Television on Thursday told the AP that protesters had broken through the main gate and set fire to vehicles and the reception area. They spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.\n\n\"I escaped by leaping over the wall but some of my colleagues got stuck inside. The attackers entered the building and set furniture on fire,\" the producer said by phone.\n\nInternet services and mobile data were widely disrupted on Thursday night and remained down on Friday in the capital, Dhaka. Social media platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp were also not loading. It coincided with a widespread internet outage on Friday that disrupted flights, banks, media outlets and companies around the world, but the disruptions in Bangladesh were substantially greater than seen elsewhere.\n\nA statement from the country's Telecommunication Regulatory Commission said they were unable to ensure service after their data center was attacked Thursday by demonstrators, who set fire to some equipment. The Associated Press has not been able to independently verify this.\n\nStudent protesters said they will extend their calls to impose a shutdown on Friday as well, and urged mosques across the country to hold funeral prayers for those who have been killed. Major universities have said they will close their doors until tensions ease.\n\nThe protesters are demanding an end to a quota system that reserves up to 30% of government jobs for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971 against Pakistan.\n\nThey argue the system is discriminatory and benefits supporters of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, whose Awami League party led the independence movement, and they want it replaced with a merit-based system.\n\nBut Hasina has defended the quota system, saying that veterans deserve the highest respect for their contributions to the war regardless of their political affiliation.\n\nThe Bangladeshi leader is credited for bringing stable growth to Bangladesh, but rising inflation -- thanks in part to the global upheaval sparked by the war in Ukraine -- has triggered labor unrest and dissatisfaction with the government.\n\nEven though job opportunities have grown in some parts of the private sector, many people prefer government jobs because they are seen as more stable and lucrative. But there aren't enough to go around -- each year, some 400,000 graduates compete for around 3,000 jobs in the civil service exam.\n\n\"What is unfolding in Bangladesh is deeply unsettling for a generation that only asked for a fair opportunity in public service recruitment. That a peaceful protest against a state policy would slip into the peak of lawlessness shows the government's lack of farsightedness and inefficient policy governance,\" said Saad Hammadi, policy and advocacy manager at the Canada-based Balsillie School of International Affairs who has advocated for freedom of speech in the country.\n\n\"The internet shutdown makes matters worse. Local news sites are inaccessible, and people in the country are left incommunicado with the rest of the world all in the pretext of conducting sweeping operations by the state that have often resulted in serious human rights violations,\" he added in an email.\n\nBangladesh has previously shut down internet services in areas affected by protests, using it as a measure to suppress dissent by opposition parties. Internet watchdog Access Now said it recorded three shutdowns in the country in 2023 - all of which overlapped with opposition rallies and were limited in scope to one city or district. That came after six shutdowns in 2022.\n\nCIVICUS, a nonprofit that tracks civic freedoms around the world, last year downgraded Bangladesh to \"closed,\" the worst rating that it could assign, along with China and Venezuela, following a crackdown on the country's opposition members and supporters ahead of its national election.\n\nThe main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party has backed the protesting students and vowed to organize its own demonstrations, and many of their supporters have joined in the students' demonstrations. On Friday, police fired tear gas at a few hundred BNP supporters, and arrested senior BNP leader Ruhul Kabir Rizvi.\n\nHasina's government has accused the BNP of stoking the violence, with authorities raiding the opposition party's headquarters earlier this week and arresting activists from the party's student wing.\n\nThe Awami League and the BNP have often accused each other of fueling political chaos and violence, most recently ahead of the country's national election, which was marred by a crackdown on several opposition figures while Hasina's government accused the party of attempting to disrupt the vote.\n\nHasina's government had earlier halted the job quotas following mass student protests in 2018, but last month, Bangladesh's High Court nullified that decision and reinstated the quotas after relatives of the 1971 veterans filed petitions, triggering the latest demonstrations.\n\nThe Supreme Court has suspended that ruling pending an appeal hearing, and said in a statement it will take up the issue on Sunday.\n\nOn Wednesday, Hasina urged protesters in a televised address to \"wait with patience\" for the court verdict. \"I believe our students will get justice from the apex court.

This comes after several major universities in the country agreed to shut their doors indefinitely until tensions ease.\n\nThe protests, which have drawn tens of thousands out on the streets, began late last month but tensions escalated on Monday when student activists at Dhaka University, the country's largest, clashed with police and counter-protesters backed by the ruling Awami League. At least 100 people were injured in the aftermath.\n\nThe next day, as violence continued to roil campuses across Bangladesh, six people were killed. More clashes were also reported on Wednesday and Thursday and paramilitary forces were deployed to patrol the streets of major cities. Media reports said at least 19 more people died on Thursday.\n\nIn response, major universities said they will close until the situation is resolved in order to protect students.\n\nThe protesters say they will continue to demonstrate but are open to discussions with the government. More violence took place on Thursday in Dhaka and elsewhere in the country as police fired tear gas at protesters, according to police officials and local television.\n\nAt the heart of the demonstrations is a quota system that reserves up to 30% of government jobs for family members of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's 1971 war of independence against Pakistan, the AP reported.\n\nProtesters want to abolish this system, which they say is discriminatory and benefits supporters of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's Awami League party, which led the independence movement. They want it replaced with a system that's based on merit.\n\nEven though job opportunities have grown in some parts of the private sector, many people prefer government jobs because they are seen as more stable and lucrative. But there aren't enough to go around -- each year, some 400,000 graduates compete for around 3,000 jobs in the civil service exam.\n\nUnder the quota system, government jobs are also reserved for women, disabled people and members of ethnic minorities, but students have mainly protested against jobs reserved for veterans' families.\n\nThe clashes come months after Hasina maintained power in an election that was boycotted by opposition parties and saw opposition members jailed ahead of the polls.\n\nThis isn't the first time there's been uproar over this issue. In 2018, Hasina's government halted the quotas after mass student protests.", "source": {"uri": "tasnimnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "\u062e\u0628\u0631\u06af\u0632\u0627\u0631\u06cc \u062a\u0633\u0646\u06cc\u0645"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awami_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Awami League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Dhaka", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Dhaka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tear_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tear gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramilitary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paramilitary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Liberation_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Liberation War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_independence_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian independence movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minority group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://newsmedia.tasnimnews.com/Tasnim/Uploaded/Image/1403/04/29/140304291017238430600794.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744480", "eventUri": "eng-9744480", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2705882352941177, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Here's what you need to know", "body": "By Samra Zulfaqar, Helen Regan and Andee Capellan, CNN\n\n(CNN) -- Huge protests across Bangladesh escalated into deadly violence this week with clashes between students, pro-government supporters and armed police fueling widespread anger over civil service job quotas opponents say are discriminatory.\n\nDozens of people have reportedly been killed and hundreds injured in the violence, which has seen riot police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters and crowds of demonstrators armed with sticks filling the streets and university campuses in the capital Dhaka and other cities.\n\nState broadcaster Bangladesh Television (BTV) was off air on Friday after student demonstrators allegedly set fire to its headquarters, according to local media, and protesters have called for a nationwide shutdown in a major challenge to the government of longstanding Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.\n\nMobile and internet services have been cut, schools and universities ordered to close, and security forces deployed to quell the unrest, with human rights groups accusing authorities of using unlawful force against protesters.\n\nMany Bangladeshi students are demanding an end to the government's quota system, which reserves more than half of civil service posts for certain groups.\n\nSome 30% of those highly sought-after jobs are reserved for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's war of independence from Pakistan in 1971, a seminal moment in the nation's history as it successfully won freedom from a much larger ruler.\n\nMany of the country's contemporary political elite are related to that generation - including Prime Minister Hasina, a daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the widely regarded founder of modern Bangladesh who was assassinated in 1975.\n\nThe reserved roles are linked to job security and higher pay, and protesters say the quota system is discriminatory and favors supporters of Hasina's ruling Awami League party. They are demanding recruitment based on merit.\n\n\"A government job is a really good opportunity,\" said Maruf Khan, 29, a Bangladeshi studying in Australia, who has joined rallies supporting the protests in Sydney. \"About 500,000 to 600,000 people are competing for 600 to 700 government jobs and on top of that it includes a 56% quota. It's not easy.\"\n\nDriving the anger is high unemployment levels in the country, especially among young people. Bangladesh has seen strong economic growth under Hasina, but it has slowed in the post-pandemic era and, as the World Bank notes in its latest overview, inequality has \"widened in urban areas.\" In a nation of 170 million people, more than 30 million are not in work or education.\n\nIn 2018, the quota system was scrapped following similar protests but in June the High Court reinstated it, ruling its removal was unconstitutional. On July 10, the Supreme Court suspended the quotas for one month while it took up the case.\n\nCritics and protesters say the quota system creates a two-tier Bangladesh where a politically connected elite benefit by their birth.\n\n\"The freedom fighters have sacrificed a lot for the nation ... for that reason this quota was a logical thing in the past,\" said student protester Tahmeed Hossain. \"But there have been at least two generations after that. Nowadays, the quota ... has rather become a form of discrimination. It has become a cultural propaganda to create a stronghold in the country.\"\n\nThe protests began at the prestigious Dhaka University on July 1 and later spread to other campuses and cities nationwide in almost daily street gatherings that included rail and road blockades.\n\nThe demonstrations became violent on July 15 when members of the Bangladesh Chatra League - the student wing of the ruling Awami League party - reportedly attacked student protesters inside the Dhaka University campus.\n\nSince then, clashes between security forces, protesters and government supporters have escalated, with Bangladesh deploying its paramilitary Rapid Action Battalion, which was sanctioned by the United States in 2021 after \"widespread allegations of serious human rights abuses.\"\n\nThe student protester Hossain told CNN he was wounded at a rally at Dhaka University on Wednesday when a projectile was thrown into the crowd.\n\n\"Someone threw a small thing at us that blew up and I heard shots. I started running and realized that I had been hurt by some splinters in my hands. The police then attacked us with tear shell in the building,\" he said. \"One of my friends got hit by a (rubber) bullet in the leg. Some of my friends got their heads smashed and are currently under treatment in the hospital.\"\n\nAnother protester in Dhaka, Hassan Abdullah, said Thursday: \"There are tear (gas) shells just 50 meters away from me as I am talking to you. The police are constantly bursting sound grenades right now.\"\n\nCNN cannot independently verify the accounts but the sounds of protest commotion, including multiple audible cracks, could be heard during the conversation with Abdullah.\n\nReports of the number of people killed has varied widely, with the Dhaka-based newspaper Prothom Alo saying 19 people were killed on Thursday alone and the Agence France-Press news agency reporting 32 deaths, citing its own tally compiled from hospital data.\n\nAuthorities have also moved to block online communications.\n\nInternet monitoring site Netblocks confirmed a \"near-total national internet shutdown\" across Bangladesh on Thursday. \"The new measure follows earlier efforts to throttle social media and restrict mobile data services,\" it said on X.\n\nThe demonstrations are the biggest challenge to Prime Minister Hasina since she secured a fourth consecutive term in January elections, which were boycotted by the main opposition party to protest what they said was a widespread crackdown on their ranks.\n\nHasina has announced a judicial investigation into the killings and called on protesters to await the verdict of the Supreme Court.\n\n\"I especially urge everyone to wait patiently until the Supreme Court verdict comes. I believe our students will get justice from high court, they will not be disappointed,\" Hasina said in a news conference Thursday.\n\nBut she has been accused of enflaming protester anger by reportedly calling them \"razakar,\" an offensive term used for those who allegedly collaborated with the Pakistani army during the 1971 independence war.\n\n\"We expected an apology from our prime minister for comparing us to traitors of 1952 and 1972, and a solid solution to quota reform,\" said protester Salman Farsi. \"What did the students do to deserve this tag?\"\n\nStudent protesters CNN spoke to say their demonstrations have gone beyond frustration over the quota system and their anger is now directed at Hasina and her government, which human rights organizations have long warned are headed toward a one-party system.\n\n\"This is a people's movement against the authoritarian government,\" Hossain said.\n\n\"This is not just about quota protests anymore, this is much bigger than that, in simple quota protests the government wouldn't go around hurting and shooting students. This shows the current fascist and autocratic nature of the government, who has been upholding the power without any proper voting system.\"\n\nBangladeshi students have held smaller protests elsewhere, including in New York's Times Square, the Australian cities Melbourne and Sydney and the Danish capital Copenhagen.\n\nThe US said it was \"continuing to monitor the reports of violence from the ongoing protests in and around Dhaka,\" a State Department spokesperson said in a briefing on Thursday.\n\n\"Freedom of expression and peaceful assembly are essential building blocks to any thriving democracy, and we condemn the recent acts of violence in Bangladesh.\"\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for restraint on all sides and urged the government to investigate all acts of violence, according to UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric.\n\n\"The secretary-general encourages the meaningful and constructive participation of youth to address the ongoing challenges in Bangladesh. Violence can never be the solution,\" Dujarric said.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Bullets littered the streets, which were also marked by smears of blood.\n\nA news producer and reporter at Bangladesh Television on Thursday told the Associated Press that protesters had broken through the main gate and set fire to vehicles and the reception area. They spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\n\"I escaped by leaping over the wall but some of my colleagues got stuck inside. The attackers entered the building and set furniture on fire,\" the producer said by phone.\n\nAt least 22 people were killed on Thursday, a local TV station reported, following six deaths earlier this week. Authorities could not be reached to immediately confirm figures for the deaths.\n\nOn Friday morning, internet services and mobile data appeared to be down in the capital, Dhaka, and social media platforms such as Facebook and WhatsApp were not loading.\n\nA statement from the country's Telecommunication Regulatory Commission said they were unable to ensure service after their data centre was attacked on Thursday by demonstrators, who set fire to some equipment. The Associated Press has not been able to independently verify this.\n\nStudent protesters said they will extend their calls to impose a shutdown on Friday as well, and urged mosques across the country to hold funeral prayers for those who have been killed.\n\nThe protesters are demanding an end to a quota system that reserves up to 30% of government jobs for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971 against Pakistan.\n\nBut Ms Hasina has defended the quota system, saying that veterans deserve the highest respect for their contributions in the war regardless of their political affiliation.\n\nThe Bangladeshi leader is credited for bringing stable growth to Bangladesh, but rising inflation -- thanks in part to the global upheaval sparked by the war in Ukraine -- has triggered labour unrest and dissatisfaction with the government.\n\nEven though job opportunities have grown in some parts of the private sector, many people prefer government jobs because they are seen as more stable and lucrative. But there are not enough to go around -- each year, some 400,000 graduates compete for around 3,000 jobs in the civil service exam.\n\n\"What is unfolding in Bangladesh is deeply unsettling for a generation that only asked for a fair opportunity in public service recruitment. That a peaceful protest against a state policy would slip into the peak of lawlessness shows the government's lack of farsightedness and inefficient policy governance,\" said Saad Hammadi, policy and advocacy manager at the Canada-based Balsillie School of International Affairs who has advocated for freedom of speech in the country.\n\n\"The internet shutdown makes matters worse. Local news sites are inaccessible, and people in the country are left incommunicado with the rest of the world all in the pretext of conducting sweeping operations by the state that have often resulted in serious human rights violations,\" he added in an email.\n\nBangladesh has previously shut down internet services in areas affected by protests, using it as a measure to suppress dissent by opposition parties, according to Access Now, an internet watchdog.\n\nCIVICUS, a nonprofit that tracks civic freedoms around the world, last year downgraded Bangladesh to \"closed,\" the worst rating that it could assign, along with China and Venezuela, following a crackdown on the country's opposition members and supporters ahead of its national election.\n\nThe main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party has backed the protesting students and is expected to hold demonstrations to show their support. Ms Hasina's party has accused them of stoking the violence, raiding the BNP's headquarters and arresting activists from the party's student wing earlier this week.\n\nThe Awami League and the BNP have often accused each other of fuelling political chaos and violence, most recently ahead of the country's national election, which was marred by a crackdown on several opposition figures while Ms Hasina's government accused the party of attempting to disrupt the vote.\n\nMs Hasina's government had earlier halted the job quotas following mass student protests in 2018, but last month, Bangladesh's High Court nullified that decision and reinstated the quotas after relatives of the 1971 veterans filed petitions, triggering the latest demonstrations.\n\nThe Supreme Court has suspended that ruling pending an appeal hearing, and said in a statement it will take up the issue on Sunday.\n\nOn Wednesday, Ms Hasina urged protesters in a televised address to \"wait with patience\" for the court verdict. \"I believe our students will get justice from the apex court.

Main opposition groups boycotted those polls.\n\nAlso Read | Al-Qaeda Leader Amin Ul Haq, Close Aide to Osama Bin Laden, Arrested in Pakistan's Punjab Province.\n\nSomoy TR, a local television channel, reported that four more people died in the latest clashes.\n\nThis comes a day after the bloodiest day of demonstrations to date when 22 people were killed, according to local media, as protesting students attempted to impose a \"complete shutdown\" on the country.\n\nAlso Read | Russia: Helicopter With 4 on Board Goes Missing in Yakutia, Search and Rescue Efforts On.\n\nAuthorities could not be reached immediately to confirm figures for the deaths.\n\nThe chaos has highlighted cracks in Bangladesh's governance and economy and the frustration of young graduates who face a lack of good jobs.\n\nThe government has deployed police and paramilitary forces across the capital to lock down campuses and break up protests. On Wednesday, universities including the country's largest suspended classes and closed dormitories, and on Friday Dhaka police said they were banning all gatherings and demonstrations in the capital.\n\nAn Associated Press reporter saw border guard officials fire at a crowd of more than 1,000 protesters who had gathered outside the head office of state-run Bangladesh Television, which was attacked and set on fire by protesters the previous day.\n\nThe border guards shot at the right crowd with rifles and sound grenades, while police officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets. Bullets littered the streets, which were also marked by smears of blood.\n\nA news producer and reporter at Bangladesh Television on Thursday told the AP that protesters had broken through the main gate and set fire to vehicles and the reception area. They spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.\n\n\"I escaped by leaping over the wall but some of my colleagues got stuck inside. The attackers entered the building and set furniture on fire,\" the producer said by phone.\n\nInternet services and mobile data were widely disrupted on Thursday night and remained down on Friday in the capital, Dhaka. Social media platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp were also not loading. It coincided with a widespread internet outage on Friday that disrupted flights, banks, media outlets and companies around the world, but the disruptions in Bangladesh were substantially greater than seen elsewhere.\n\nA statement from the country's Telecommunication Regulatory Commission said they were unable to ensure service after their data centre was attacked on Thursday by demonstrators, who set fire to some equipment. The Associated Press has not been able to independently verify this.\n\nStudent protesters said they will extend their calls to impose a shutdown on Friday as well, and urged mosques across the country to hold funeral prayers for those who have been killed. Major universities have said they will close their doors until tensions ease.\n\nThe protesters are demanding an end to a quota system that reserves up to 30 per cent of government jobs for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971 against Pakistan.\n\nThey argue the system is discriminatory and benefits supporters of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, whose Awami League party led the independence movement, and they want it replaced with a merit-based system.\n\nBut Hasina has defended the quota system, saying that veterans deserve the highest respect for their contributions to the war regardless of their political affiliation.\n\nThe Bangladeshi leader is credited for bringing stable growth to Bangladesh, but rising inflation -- thanks in part to the global upheaval sparked by the war in Ukraine -- has triggered labour unrest and dissatisfaction with the government.\n\nEven though job opportunities have grown in some parts of the private sector, many people prefer government jobs because they are seen as more stable and lucrative. But there aren't enough to go around -- each year, some 400,000 graduates compete for around 3,000 jobs in the civil service exam.\n\n\"What is unfolding in Bangladesh is deeply unsettling for a generation that only asked for a fair opportunity in public service recruitment. That a peaceful protest against a state policy would slip into the peak of lawlessness shows the government's lack of farsightedness and inefficient policy governance,\" said Saad Hammadi, policy and advocacy manager at the Canada-based Balsillie School of International Affairs who has advocated for freedom of speech in the country.\n\n\"The internet shutdown makes matters worse. Local news sites are inaccessible, and people in the country are left incommunicado with the rest of the world all in the pretext of conducting sweeping operations by the state that have often resulted in serious human rights violations,\" he added in an email.\n\nBangladesh has previously shut down internet services in areas affected by protests, using it as a measure to suppress dissent by opposition parties. Internet watchdog Access Now said it recorded three shutdowns in the country in 2023 - all of which overlapped with opposition rallies and were limited in scope to one city or district. That came after six shutdowns in 2022.\n\nCIVICUS, a nonprofit that tracks civic freedoms around the world, last year downgraded Bangladesh to \"closed\", the worst rating that it could assign, along with China and Venezuela, following a crackdown on the country's opposition members and supporters ahead of its national election.\n\nThe main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party has backed the protesting students and vowed to organise its own demonstrations, and many of their supporters have joined in the students' demonstrations. On Friday, police fired tear gas at a few hundred BNP supporters, and arrested senior BNP leader Ruhul Kabir Rizvi.\n\nHasina's government has accused the BNP of stoking the violence, with authorities raiding the opposition party's headquarters earlier this week and arresting activists from the party's student wing.\n\nThe Awami League and the BNP have often accused each other of fuelling political chaos and violence, most recently ahead of the country's national election, which was marred by a crackdown on several opposition figures while Hasina's government accused the party of attempting to disrupt the vote.\n\nHasina's government had earlier halted the job quotas following mass student protests in 2018, but last month, Bangladesh's High Court nullified that decision and reinstated the quotas after relatives of the 1971 veterans filed petitions, triggering the latest demonstrations.\n\nThe Supreme Court has suspended that ruling pending an appeal hearing, and said in a statement it will take up the issue on Sunday.\n\nOn Wednesday, Hasina urged protesters in a televised address to \"wait with patience\" for the court verdict. \"I believe our students will get justice from the apex court. They will not be disappointed.\" (AP)", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type":

Prime Minister Hasina, the daughter of Bangladesh's founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, has been accused of using the quota system to reward her party's loyalists. Protestors allege the system is unfair and limits their job opportunities.\n\nHowever, Prime Minister Hasina, refusing to accept any demands, has referred to the protesters as \"razakar\", an offensive term used to describe those who betrayed the country by collaborating with the Pakistani army in 1971.\n\nWhat is quota system in Bangladesh?\n\nThe quota system in Bangladesh was introduced in 1972 and has undergone several changes since then. Before it was abolished in 2018, the system reserved 56 per cent of government jobs for various groups, but the majority of these quotas benefited freedom fighters' families.\n\nHere's how the quotas were allocated:\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nWomen: 10 per cent\n\nUnderdeveloped districts: 10 per cent\n\nIndigenous communities: 5 per cent\n\nDisabled people: 1 per cent\n\nThe system has now been reinstated again.\n\nSituation in Bangladesh\n\nViolence erupted across Bangladesh as police and protesters clashed in various parts of the country, including the capital, Dhaka. The protests, although going on for weeks, took a dark turn on Wednesday when Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina appeared on TV to address the escalating clashes. However, her appearance on a national broadcasting channel seemed to have the opposite effect, as the demonstrators set fire to the country's state broadcaster building on Thursday.\n\nThe unrest also led to widespread disruption of communication services on Friday, with internet and mobile services cut off in many areas. The protesters, comprising students, were armed with sticks and rocks, and attempted to shut down transportation services nationwide.

jobs were blocked under various quotas.\n\nThe protesting students fear that the quota shrinks the number of government jobs open for all, hurting aspirants who want them filled on the basis of merit.\n\nOn Thursday, Bangladesh law minister Anisul Huq expressed willingness to hold talks with the protesting students after fresh violence erupted across the country.\n\n\"Whenever they agree, we will sit...it could be held this (Thursday) afternoon even...Government has agreed to hold talks with the quota reformists,\" he said, as quoted by PTI.\n\nMeanwhile, Hasina condemned the loss of lives and called for patience until the Supreme Court delivers its verdict.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Several people were killed, media reports said.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nQuader said the military was deployed to help the civilian administration keep order.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe protests, which began weeks ago but escalated sharply this week, represent the biggest challenge to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina since she won a fourth consecutive term in office after elections in January. Main opposition groups boycotted those polls.\n\nThere were varying reports of the number of people killed Friday, with Independent Television reporting 17 dead and Somoy TV reporting 30. An Associated Press reporter saw 23 bodies at Dhaka Medical College and Hospital, but it was not immediately clear whether they had all died on Friday.\n\nA death toll of 22 people was reported on Thursday, in what had so far been the bloodiest day of demonstrations, according to local media, as protesting students attempted to impose a \"complete shutdown\" of the country.\n\nAuthorities could not be reached immediately to confirm figures for the deaths.\n\nThe chaos has highlighted cracks in Bangladesh's governance and economy and the frustration of young graduates who face a lack of good jobs.\n\nThe government has deployed police and paramilitary forces across the capital to lock down campuses and break up protests. On Wednesday, universities including the country's largest suspended classes and closed dormitories, and on Friday police in Dhaka said they were banning all gatherings and demonstrations in the capital.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAn Associated Press reporter saw border guard officials fire at a crowd of more than 1,000 protesters who had gathered outside the head office of state-run Bangladesh Television, which was attacked and set on fire by protesters the previous day.\n\nThe border guards shot at the crowd with rifles and sound grenades, while police officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets. Bullets littered the streets, which were also marked by smears of blood.\n\nInternet services and mobile data were widely disrupted on Thursday night and remained down on Friday in the capital, Dhaka. Social media platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp were also not loading. It coincided with a widespread internet outage on Friday that disrupted flights, banks, media outlets and companies around the world, but the disruptions in Bangladesh were substantially greater than seen elsewhere.\n\nA statement from the country's Telecommunication Regulatory Commission said they were unable to ensure service after their data center was attacked Thursday by demonstrators, who set fire to some equipment. The Associated Press was not able to independently verify this.\n\nStudent protesters said they will extend their calls to impose a shutdown on Friday as well, and urged mosques across the country to hold funeral prayers for those who have been killed. Major universities have said they will close their doors until tensions ease.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe protesters are demanding an end to a quota system that reserves up to 30% of government jobs for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971 against Pakistan.\n\nThey argue the system is discriminatory and benefits supporters of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, whose Awami League party led the independence movement, and they want it replaced with a merit-based system.\n\nBut Hasina has defended the quota system, saying that veterans deserve the highest respect for their contributions to the war regardless of their political affiliation.\n\nThe Bangladeshi leader is credited for bringing stable growth to Bangladesh, but rising inflation -- thanks in part to the global upheaval sparked by the war in Ukraine -- has triggered labor unrest and dissatisfaction with the government.\n\nEven though job opportunities have grown in some parts of the private sector, many people prefer government jobs because they are seen as more stable and lucrative. But there aren't enough to go around -- each year, some 400,000 graduates compete for around 3,000 jobs in the civil service exam.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"What is unfolding in Bangladesh is deeply unsettling for a generation that only asked for a fair opportunity in public service recruitment,\" said Saad Hammadi, a freedom of speech advocate with the Canada-based Balsillie School of International Affairs. \"That a peaceful protest against a state policy would slip into the peak of lawlessness shows the government's lack of farsightedness and inefficient policy governance,\" Hammadi said.\n\n\"The internet shutdown makes matters worse. Local news sites are inaccessible, and people in the country are left incommunicado with the rest of the world all in the pretext of conducting sweeping operations by the state that have often resulted in serious human rights violations,\" he added in an email.\n\nBangladesh has previously shut down internet services in areas affected by protests, using it as a measure to suppress dissent by opposition parties. Internet watchdog Access Now said it recorded three shutdowns in the country in 2023 - all of which overlapped with opposition rallies and were limited in scope to one city or district. That came after six shutdowns in 2022.\n\nCIVICUS, a nonprofit that tracks civic freedoms around the world, last year downgraded Bangladesh to \"closed,\" the worst rating that it could assign, along with China and Venezuela, following a crackdown on the country's opposition members and supporters ahead of its national election.\n\nThe main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party has backed the protesting students and vowed to organize its own demonstrations, and many of their supporters have joined in the students' demonstrations. On Friday, police fired tear gas at a few hundred BNP supporters, and arrested senior BNP leader Ruhul Kabir Rizvi.\n\nThe Awami League and the BNP have often accused each other of fueling political chaos and violence, most recently ahead of the country's national election, which was marred by a crackdown on several opposition figures while Hasina's government accused the party of attempting to disrupt the vote.\n\nHasina's government had earlier halted the job quotas following mass student protests in 2018, but last month, Bangladesh's High Court nullified that decision and reinstated the quotas after relatives of the 1971 veterans filed petitions, triggering the latest demonstrations.\n\nThe Supreme Court has suspended that ruling pending an appeal hearing, and said in a statement it will take up the issue on Sunday.\n\nOn Wednesday, Hasina urged protesters in a televised address to \"wait with patience\" for the court verdict, saying that she believes they \"will get justice\" and \"will not be disappointed.\"\n\n___\n\nPathi reported from New Delhi, India.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [{"uri":

How do they pose a challenge for Hasina?\n\nWhat do we know about the protests?\n\nThese protests have to do with the Bangladesh's quota system for government jobs.\n\nAs per The Diplomat, a high court on 5 July reinstated the quota system the Hasina government scrapped in 2018.\n\nThe government had scrapped the system in the aftermath of student protests.\n\nHasina was seemingly sympathetic towards the students at the time.\n\n\"There is nothing to get angry at; the students are demanding [an end to quotas], and I totally accept it,\" she said in 2018.\n\nThe quota reserves 30 per cent of government jobs for the kin of freedom fighters in the 1971 war of independence from Pakistan.\n\nThe rules were introduced by in 1972 by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founding father of Bangladesh who led its freedom movement.\n\nHasina is his daughter.\n\nBangladesh's quota system has gone through several metamorphoses.\n\nBy the time it was abolished in 2018, 56 per cent of government jobs were blocked under various quotas.\n\nThe bulk covered groups such as freedom fighters' families, with women and those from underdeveloped districts receiving a share of a tenth each, with five per cent allotted to indigenous communities, and one per cent for the disabled.\n\nThe protesting students want all categories abolished, except the last two.\n\nAs per News18, students say the Hasina government uses the quota system to fill government posts with those loyal to the ruling Awami League.\n\nThe Bangladesh government has challenged the order in the Supreme Court - which will hear the plea on August 7.\n\nBut the students, who insist that isn't enough, took to the streets.\n\nHasina responded by saying that there is 'no justification' for the anti-quota protests.\n\nShe then added fuel to the flames.\n\n\"Why do they [the protesters] have so much resentment towards the freedom fighters? If the grandchildren of the freedom fighters don't get quota benefits, should the grandchildren of Razakars get the benefit?\" Hasina said at a press conference following her visit to China, as per The Diplomat.\n\n\"Razakar\" is an offensive term for those accused of collaborating with Pakistan's army in 1971 to betray Bangladesh.\n\nThe protests turned violent this week following clashes between thousands of anti-quota demonstrators and members of the student wing of Hasina's Awami League party.\n\nAs per News18, the demonstrations are being spearheaded by a coalition of college unions named Students Against Discrimination.\n\nAuthorities cut some mobile internet services to try to quell the unrest.\n\nNews18 quoted Bangladeshi news channel Ekattor TV as saying that the roadblocks and internet shutdowns have left the common man struggling.\n\nBD24, a Bangladeshi news outlet said Dhaka is witnessing a 'public transport crisis' after demonstrators called for a 'complete shutdown.'\n\nPolice fired rubber bullets and hurled sound grenades and tear gas to scatter protesters who also blocked railway tracks and major roads.\n\nThursday alone saw 13 people killed - the worst day of violence so far in protests in Bangladesh - as thousands of students armed with sticks and rocks clashed with armed police in Dhaka.\n\nThese included a bus driver who was brought to a hospital with a bullet wound to his chest, a rickshaw-puller and three students, officials told Reuters.\n\nThe capital's main university campus had been the site of the worst of the nationwide protests, but on Thursday there were stronger demonstrations in other pockets of the city.\n\nHundreds of people were injured as police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to break up groups of protesters, who torched vehicles, police posts and other establishments, witnesses said.\n\nLaw Minister Anisul Huq said the government was willing to hold talks with the protesters.\n\nThe demonstrators refused, saying, \"Discussions and opening fire do not go hand in hand\".\n\n\"We cannot trample over dead bodies to hold discussions. Discussions could have taken place earlier,\" protest co-ordinator Nahid Islam told Reuters.\n\nAll public and private universities were shut indefinitely from Wednesday and security forces were deployed at campuses to keep order.\n\n\"At the Brac University medical centre at least 25 students were treated for rubber bullet wounds and tear gas-related injuries. Rubber bullets hit several students in their eyes,\" a university official told AFP.\n\nHow do they pose a challenge for Hasina?\n\nThe protests are the first challenge to Hasina's government since she won a fourth consecutive term in January in elections boycotted by the main opposition.\n\nHasina has pledged justice for those killed in the demonstrations.\n\nBut Students Against Discrimination said her words were insincere and urged supporters to press on.\n\n\"It did not reflect the murders and mayhem carried out by her party activists,\" Asif Mahmud, one of the coordinators of the protests, told AFP.\n\nA piece in The Diplomat said that the stark differences between the two protests are a sign of 'the winds of change' in Bangladesh.\n\nThe piece noted how students are labelling Hasina a dictator and how social media is rife with anti-Awami League posts from people of all strata of life.\n\n\"Through writing, caricatures, videos, photos, and more, Bangladeshis, especially students, are directly calling the prime minister an autocrat',\" the piece noted.\n\nProtesters and critics say the 30 per cent quota for families of freedom fighters favours Awami League supporters, which led the independence fight.\n\nExperts also attribute the unrest to stagnant job growth in the private sector, making public sector jobs, with their accompanying regular wage hikes and privileges, very attractive.\n\nThe quotas shrink the number of government jobs open for all, hurting aspirants who want them filled on the basis of merit.\n\nThey have sparked anger among students grappling with high youth unemployment, as nearly 32 million young people are out of work or education from a population of 170 million.\n\nThe economy, once among the world's fastest growing, has stagnated, inflation hovers around 10 per cent and dollar reserves are shrinking.\n\nA piece in The Wire argued the protests have now gone beyond the mere call for quota reforms.\n\n\"They now say they are seeking a complete overhaul of the system, the restoration of their voting rights lost through three consecutive disputed elections, and recognition as equal citizens in a democracy, not mere subjects under \"authoritarian\" rule,\" the piece stated.\n\nIt added that students want to \"reclaim the dignity that they believe the people of Bangladesh collectively have lost during Sheikh Hasina's tenure.\"", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistance_movement", "type":

Students are protesting against the country's job quota system. At least 19 people have died in the violence this week.\n\nBut on Friday, even amid the crackdown on phone and internet connectivity, the protests took new forms -- including apparent hacking attacks on top government websites.\n\nHere's more about the protests, and where they are headed next.\n\nProtests that began weeks ago saw violence at the start of the week after student protesters were attacked by activists of the Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL), the student wing of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's Awami League Party.\n\nAs protesters refused to back down, the government on Wednesday ordered the closure of all universities -- the epicentres of the movement against the quotas. But students refused to vacate campuses, in a tense standoff.\n\nThen, on Thursday, that tension exploded into deadly violence. Thousands of students clashed with armed police in Dhaka. During these police clashes, eleven people were killed including a bus driver and a student, police sources told Al Jazeera. The AFP news agency has reported that 39 people have been killed this week -- 32 on Thursday alone. Local media reports are saying at least 28 have been killed as of Thursday. Al Jazeera has not been able to independently verify these numbers.\n\nAuthorities cut mobile and internet services to quell the unrest on Thursday. According to the watchdog NetBlocks, the South Asian country has faced a complete, nationwide internet blackout for more than 16 hours now.\n\nThe police released a statement accusing protesters of burning and vandalising buildings, including police and government offices. This included the Dhaka headquarters of state broadcaster Bangladesh Television (BTW), which remains offline since.\n\nThe websites of major news organisations including The Daily Star and Dhaka Tribune remain offline.\n\nAnd several official websites in Bangladesh appeared to be hacked by a group which goes by \"THE R3SISTANC3\".\n\nThe hacked websites include those of the central bank, the prime minister's office and police.\n\nOn the website of the Prime Minister's Office, the message reads \"Stop Killing Students\", and then, in blood-red capital letters: \"It's not a protest anymore. It's a war now.\"\n\nDetails of the alleged hackers are not known. The central bank and police sites remained inaccessible when Al Jazeera tried to reach them.\n\nUniversity students across Bangladesh are calling for the country's conventional job quota system to be reformed. Under the system, more than half of much sought-after government jobs are reserved\n\nThe protests erupted after June 5, when the High Court ordered the reinstatement of the 30 percent quota for children of freedom fighters who participated in the country's liberation movement in 1971.\n\nThe quota system was in place since 1972, and was abolished by Hasina in 2018 as a result of student protests, before the court brought it back in June.\n\nThe students argue the reserved jobs for freedom fighters benefit a small group of people, affiliated with Hasina's Awami League, which led the movement for independence from Pakistan.\n\nThe country's Supreme Court suspended the High Court's reinstatement of quotas after the government's appeal. It has set August 7 as the date when it will hearing for the government's challenge to the High Court ruling.\n\nThe Hasina government says it agrees with students on doing away with the quota, a position it is expected to reiterate before the Supreme Court. But student protesters are demanding a legal amendment against the quota -- they say they don't trust the government.\n\nStudents took to the streets on Friday morning and counterdemonstrations were planned after midday prayers.\n\nOn Wednesday, Hasina called for patience and urged the students to wait for the Supreme Court's decision.\n\nThe same day, the PM also announced a judicial probe to investigate the killings that have taken place.\n\nOn July 14, Hasina had implied that the protesters were \"Razakars\", an offensive term for those who collaborated with Pakistan during the 1971 war. That comparison further drew the ire of protesters.", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Jazeera Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Jazeera", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Al Jazeera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_outage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Power outage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awami_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Awami League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Chhatra_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Chhatra League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Civil_Law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bachelor of Civil Law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetBlocks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NetBlocks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka_Tribune", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka Tribune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Star_(Bangladesh)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Star (Bangladesh)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10_Downing_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "10 Downing Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razakar_(Pakistan)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Razakar (Pakistan)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistance_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Resistance movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Partition of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Liberation_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Liberation War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "High Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AFP__20240718__364E9DZ__v1__HighRes__BangladeshUnrestStudentsProtest-1721381462.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744480", "eventUri": "eng-9744480", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "textStart": 2980, "textEnd": 2986}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 3616, "textEnd": 3624}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-14", "textStart": 4305, "textEnd": 4312}], "sentiment": -0.5686274509803921, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

The court opens on Sunday.\n\n\"I am requesting all to wait with patience until the verdict is delivered,\" Ms Hasina said in a televised address Wednesday evening.\n\nThe protests first escalated on Monday, when violence broke out between protesters, police and pro-government student activists on the Dhaka University campus.\n\nAt least 100 people were injured in the aftermath, and paramilitary forces were deployed to patrol the streets of major cities.\n\nAt least six people were killed on Tuesday, leading the government to ask universities across the country to close and police to raid the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party's headquarters, as well as arrest several student activists.\n\nOn Wednesday night, the protesters responded to security officials' continued attacks on campus demonstrators by announcing their plans for a \"complete shutdown\" of the country beginning the next day, except for essential services.\n\nThe opposition BNP said it would do what it could to make the shutdown a success.\n\nDetective Chief Harun-or-Rashid said police arrested seven members of the party's student wing and found 100 crude bombs, 500 wooden and bamboo sticks and five-to-six bottles of gasoline in the raid.\n\nRuhul Kabir Rizvi, a senior BNP leader, said the raid was a government attempt to divert attention from the protests.\n\nProtesters attempted to enforce the violence on Thursday morning, blocking the road in Dhaka's Uttara neighbourhood until police gave chase.\n\nAt least ten people died in Thursday's clashes -- the highest toll in a single day so far -- including a bus driver whose body was brought to a hospital with a bullet wound to his chest, a rickshaw-puller and three students, officials told Reuters.\n\nIn other places, police fired tear gas and charged with batons to disperse the protesters -- who threw stones in response.\n\nScores, including police, were injured in the violence, a spokesperson for the Dhaka Metropolitan Police said.\n\nPolice also said protesters attacked and set fire to a traffic police box and vandalised police vehicles amid clashes across the city.\n\nDhaka's usually clogged streets saw thin traffic on Thursday and many malls in the area closed.\n\nOffices and banks opened, but commuters complained that transport was limited.\n\nPolice set up checkpoints at the entrances to Dhaka University.\n\nLocal television reported violence in other cities including Chattogram and Khulna, while protesters also blocked some major highways.\n\nSalma Rahman, an official at a financial institution in Dhaka, said she left her car at home and caught a ride on a motorcycle.\n\n\"Our office has alerted us to stay safe on streets, as there is fear that violence could happen during the shutdown.\"\n\nMr Huq revealed on Thursday afternoon that the prime minister asked him to sit down with the protesters for a dialogue, and he was ready to speak with them if protesters were willing.\n\nThe protesters say they are willing to talk and want to return to class when their demands are met.", "source": {"uri": "abc.net.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian Broadcasting

The outage isn't related to global internet issues affecting banks, airlines and other industries that began Thursday in the U.S. with disruptions linked to Microsoft Corp. services.\n\nIn Bangladesh, student protesters angered by the government's job quota policy attempted to shut down transport networks and businesses after authorities closed all universities.\n\nAFP reported that 39 people have been killed in the clashes so far and the police in the capital Dhaka have banned all public rallies. The government hasn't commented on reported death toll or the outages.\n\nThere were reports of clashes on Friday in parts of the capital, Dhaka, with the internet shutdown affecting ATM services and mobile money companies. According to Somoy TV, the police have also detained Ruhul Kabir Rizvi, a senior leader with the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party.\n\nThe protests pose a challenge to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who extended her grip on power for a fourth straight term in elections earlier this year. If the demonstrations continue, they could further slow the economy at a time when Bangladesh is seeking funds from creditors and the International Monetary Fund to bolster dwindling foreign-exchange reserves.\n\nThe local police said the protesters have set fire to several government buildings including the state broadcaster, the national disaster management agency and a toll plaza. Hackers defaced the official Bangladesh police website with messages describing the protest as \"a war for justice, for freedom, and for our future.\"\n\n\"Situation in Bangladesh is fragile and worsening,\" said Dr Smruti Pattanaik, senior fellow at the New Delhi-based Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies. \"The administration should seriously pursue the offer of dialog with students and finally statements from politicians belittling students will not help the situation.\"\n\nThe U.S., the biggest buyer of Bangladesh's exports and a vocal critic of Hasina's government, condemned the violence.\n\n\"We need to make sure that any kind of freedom of expression is happening safely and people are free from violence,\" State Department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters in Washington on Thursday. \"That's something we're continuing to pay close attention to.\"\n\nNeighboring India described it as an \"an internal matter for Bangladesh,\" according to Randhir Jaiswal, spokesperson for the Ministry of External Affairs, who spoke to reporters on Friday. \"We are aware that the government has taken some steps regarding the protests but we are in touch with our people there.\"\n\nThe students' frustrations have centered on a policy that sets aside 30% of government job openings for family members of veterans from the 1971 war of independence from Pakistan, which critics say has been abused. The anger stems also from persistently high youth unemployment that stands at about 40%, according to the latest census.\n\nHasina has sought to reassure the students, telling them to have faith in the courts while a case against the quota system is being deliberated. But she has also vowed to come down hard on those responsible for the violence, saying in a televised address on Wednesday that a judicial committee will investigate the turmoil.\n\nThe Associated Press said the country's Supreme Court will take up the jobs quota case on Sunday. The court had initially suspended a ruling by a lower court that reinstated the quota system, triggering the protests last month.\n\nProtesters say the quota system has excluded new job seekers in favor of supporters of Hasina, whose party led the movement to separate from Pakistan. They want the system to be replaced with a merit-based one.\n\nGovernment jobs are highly sought after in Bangladesh and have taken on greater importance as the economy struggles to rebound after the pandemic and years of strong growth. The largely student-driven protests turned violent earlier this week and Bangladesh's main opposition party has joined in on the demonstrations.\n\nThe government has deployed paramilitary troops in Dhaka to tighten security. \"This is one the toughest challenges that Sheikh Hasina has ever faced. The streets are converging with discontent,\" said Harsh Pant, a professor of International Relations at Kings College, London. \"But, the opposition will not let this go and it depends on how she manages the opposition and street level anger coming together.\"\n\n-------\n\n(With assistance from Arun Devnath, Swati Gupta and Sudhi Ranjan Sen.)", "source": {"uri": "m.arcamax.com", "dataType":

As of Thursday, as many as 25 people had been killed, and hundreds more are estimated to have been injured.\n\nThe source of the unrest is a contentious quota hiring system established in 1972, when Bangladesh was reeling from war and had just declared its independence from Pakistan. Under the quota system, 30 percent of highly coveted government jobs are reserved for the descendants of so-called freedom fighters who fought for Bangladesh in the war, while a percentage of other positions are allocated to additional select groups. In total, 56 percent of all positions have traditionally been reserved for members of various groups, including ethnic minorities, women, individuals with disabilities, and people from underrepresented districts.\n\nProtesters want to dismantle this system because they say it is discriminatory and that hiring should be based on merit. Although the country has experienced remarkable economic growth in the decades since independence, it remains one of the world's least developed countries, according to the United Nations, and its post-pandemic recovery has been rocky: Real GDP growth slowed to 5.8 percent in fiscal year 2023, down from 7.1 percent in the previous year, per the World Bank. Government jobs, seen as more stable and better paid than those in the private sector, are highly sought after, with more than 400,000 graduates competing for about 3,000 government jobs each year, Bloomberg reports.\n\nDemonstrators also contend that the quota system favors Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and her supporters, since Hasina's party, the Awami League, spearheaded the country's independence drive. Critics \"believe that the quota system is partisan and meant to ensure sufficient party support within the government, all while reducing the availability of merit-based jobs in a country with high youth unemployment,\" Michael Kugelman wrote in FP's South Asia Brief newsletter.\n\nHasina previously scrapped the system following a wave of protests in 2018, but a top Bangladeshi court restored it last month, sparking the current unrest. In an apparent attempt to appease protesters, Bangladesh's Supreme Court last week suspended the quota system for a month and said it would make a final decision at the end of that period.\n\nHasina has defended the system and accused the country's main opposition parties of fueling the unrest. She deployed paramilitary forces to help police quell the demonstrations in major cities, though she vowed to establish an investigatory judicial committee over the deaths and promised justice for students. Law Minister Anisul Huq said on Thursday that the government was ready to meet with student leaders to find a solution, though he said the final decision would be up to the Supreme Court.\n\nBut demonstrators -- who have threatened to launch a \"complete shutdown\" of the country's transportation systems, businesses, and schools if their demands aren't met -- seem intent on continuing the fight. \"We want a permanent executive order from the government, saying that the quotas are abolished, except some quotas for the disabled and minorities,\" Parvez Mosharraf, a student at Dhaka University, told Dawn last week. The opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party has backed the protesters' call for a shutdown.", "source": {"uri": "southasiajournal.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "South Asia Journal"}, "authors":

The new casualties Thursday would bring the overall toll to 25 dead since Monday when violence erupted at the Dhaka University in the capital.However, an AFP tally of casualty figures from hospitals said the toll was now 32.\n\nViolence pitting protesters against pro-govt student groups and police soon spread to other cities. Six people had been reported killed on Tuesday, and hundreds more have been injured. Authorities did not confirm figures for the deaths.\n\nThe protesters are demanding an end to a quota system that reserves up to 30% of govt jobs for relatives of veterans who fought in war of independence in 1971. They argue the system is discriminatory and benefits supporters of PM Sheikh Hasina, and they want it replaced with a merit-based system. Hasina's party has accused opposition parties of stoking the violence.\n\nThe leading Dhaka-based newspaper Prothom Alo said that by late Thursday night, they received reports of 19 deaths in Dhaka and elsewhere in the day's raging violence. The country's leading English-language Daily Star also reported 19 deaths on Thursday.\n\nProthom Alo said at least six people died in Dhaka's Uttara area alone in the latest clashes pitting the protesters against security officials and ruling party activists. Thirteen others including a Dhaka-based journalist of an online portal died in other parts of the capital and elsewhere.\n\nProtesters attacked the head office of state-run Bangladesh Television, breaking through a main gate and setting vehicles and the reception area on fire, a news producer and a reporter told AP by phone. \"I escaped by leaping over the wall but some of my colleagues got stuck inside. The attackers entered the building and set furniture on fire,\" the producer said by phone. He said the station continued broadcasting, though some Dhaka locals said they were receiving no signal from the broadcaster.\n\nMeanwhile, the country was experiencing a near-total shutdown of internet services, Alp Toker, director of the London-based internet monitor NetBlocks, said on X.\n\nThe violence has continued despite a pending court decision on the legality of quota system. Hasina and law minister Anisul Huq urged protesters to await that decision, with Hasina saying she believes the protesters won't be disappointed by the court verdict.\n\nFollowing the first deaths in this week's violence on Tuesday, the govt asked universities across the country to close in hopes of quelling the student unrest, and police raided the main opposition party's headquarters.\n\nProtesters responded Wednesday evening by saying they would enforce a \"complete shutdown\" of transportation across the country on Thursday. The opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party said that it would join those efforts.\n\nClashes continued Thursday as protesters tried to enforce the shutdown. In Dhaka's Uttara neighbourhood, police chased hundreds of protesters after they blocked a road and chanted. In other locations, police fired tear gas and charged with batons to disperse protesters, who threw stones in response. Police said protesters vandalised police cars and set fire to a traffic police box. Scores of people, including police officers, were injured in the violence, the Dhaka Metropolitan Police said.

Several people were killed, media reports said.\n\nThe protests, which began weeks ago but escalated sharply this week, represent the biggest challenge to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina since she won a fourth consecutive term in office after elections in January. Main opposition groups boycotted those polls.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nThere were varying reports of the number of people killed Friday, with Independent Television reporting 17 dead and Somoy TV reporting 30. An Associated Press reporter saw 23 bodies at Dhaka Medical College and Hospital, but it was not immediately clear whether they had all died on Friday.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nA death toll of 22 people was reported on Thursday, in what had so far been the bloodiest day of demonstrations, according to local media, as protesting students attempted to impose a \"complete shutdown\" of the country.\n\nAuthorities could not be reached immediately to confirm figures for the deaths.\n\nThe chaos has highlighted cracks in Bangladesh's governance and economy and the frustration of young graduates who face a lack of good jobs.\n\nThe government has deployed police and paramilitary forces across the capital to lock down campuses and break up protests. On Wednesday, universities including the country's largest suspended classes and closed dormitories, and on Friday police in Dhaka said they were banning all gatherings and demonstrations in the capital.\n\nAn Associated Press reporter saw border guard officials fire at a crowd of more than 1,000 protesters who had gathered outside the head office of state-run Bangladesh Television, which was attacked and set on fire by protesters the previous day.\n\nThe border guards shot at the crowd with rifles and sound grenades, while police officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets. Bullets littered the streets, which were also marked by smears of blood.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nInternet services and mobile data were widely disrupted on Thursday night and remained down on Friday in the capital, Dhaka. Social media platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp were also not loading. It coincided with a widespread internet outage on Friday that disrupted flights, banks, media outlets and companies around the world, but the disruptions in Bangladesh were substantially greater than seen elsewhere.\n\nA statement from the country's Telecommunication Regulatory Commission said they were unable to ensure service after their data center was attacked Thursday by demonstrators, who set fire to some equipment. The Associated Press was not able to independently verify this.\n\nStudent protesters said they will extend their calls to impose a shutdown on Friday as well, and urged mosques across the country to hold funeral prayers for those who have been killed. Major universities have said they will close their doors until tensions ease.\n\nThe protesters are demanding an end to a quota system that reserves up to 30% of government jobs for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971 against Pakistan.\n\nThey argue the system is discriminatory and benefits supporters of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, whose Awami League party led the independence movement, and they want it replaced with a merit-based system.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBut Hasina has defended the quota system, saying that veterans deserve the highest respect for their contributions to the war regardless of their political affiliation.\n\nThe Bangladeshi leader is credited for bringing stable growth to Bangladesh, but rising inflation -- thanks in part to the global upheaval sparked by the war in Ukraine -- has triggered labor unrest and dissatisfaction with the government.\n\nEven though job opportunities have grown in some parts of the private sector, many people prefer government jobs because they are seen as more stable and lucrative. But there aren't enough to go around -- each year, some 400,000 graduates compete for around 3,000 jobs in the civil service exam.\n\n\"What is unfolding in Bangladesh is deeply unsettling for a generation that only asked for a fair opportunity in public service recruitment,\" said Saad Hammadi, a freedom of speech advocate with the Canada-based Balsillie School of International Affairs. \"That a peaceful protest against a state policy would slip into the peak of lawlessness shows the government's lack of farsightedness and inefficient policy governance,\" Hammadi said.\n\n\"The internet shutdown makes matters worse. Local news sites are inaccessible, and people in the country are left incommunicado with the rest of the world all in the pretext of conducting sweeping operations by the state that have often resulted in serious human rights violations,\" he added in an email.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBangladesh has previously shut down internet services in areas affected by protests, using it as a measure to suppress dissent by opposition parties. Internet watchdog Access Now said it recorded three shutdowns in the country in 2023 - all of which overlapped with opposition rallies and were limited in scope to one city or district. That came after six shutdowns in 2022.\n\nCIVICUS, a nonprofit that tracks civic freedoms around the world, last year downgraded Bangladesh to \"closed,\" the worst rating that it could assign, along with China and Venezuela, following a crackdown on the country's opposition members and supporters ahead of its national election.\n\nThe main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party has backed the protesting students and vowed to organize its own demonstrations, and many of their supporters have joined in the students' demonstrations. On Friday, police fired tear gas at a few hundred BNP supporters, and arrested senior BNP leader Ruhul Kabir Rizvi.\n\nThe Awami League and the BNP have often accused each other of fueling political chaos and violence, most recently ahead of the country's national election, which was marred by a crackdown on several opposition figures while Hasina's government accused the party of attempting to disrupt the vote.\n\nHasina's government had earlier halted the job quotas following mass student protests in 2018, but last month, Bangladesh's High Court nullified that decision and reinstated the quotas after relatives of the 1971 veterans filed petitions, triggering the latest demonstrations.\n\nThe Supreme Court has suspended that ruling pending an appeal hearing, and said in a statement it will take up the issue on Sunday.\n\nOn Wednesday, Hasina urged protesters in a televised address to \"wait with patience\" for the court verdict, saying that she believes they \"will get justice\" and \"will not be disappointed.\"\n\n___\n\nPathi reported from New Delhi, India.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [{"uri":

She had asked, \"If the grandchildren of freedom fighters do not receive [quota] benefits, who would get it? The grandchildren of Razakars?\" \"Razakar\" is a derogatory term in Bangladesh, referring to those who collaborated with the Pakistani military during the 1971 Liberation War.\n\nFollowing the prime minister's comments, clashes broke out at Dhaka University between protesters and members of the student wing of the ruling Awami League party, the Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL). The demonstrators are now demanding an apology from Hasina and justice for those killed during the protests. \"Our first demand is that the prime minister must apologise to us,\" a protester told AFP. \"Secondly, justice must be ensured for our killed brothers,\" she added.\n\nThe quota system, which was suspended in 2018 following large student protests, was reinstated last month by a high court decision after relatives of 1971 veterans filed petitions. This decision led to renewed protests and violent clashes between students and police at Jahangir Nagar University outside Dhaka and Dhaka University. The Supreme Court has since suspended the high court's ruling and promised a verdict by August 7.\n\n\"I am requesting all to patiently wait until the verdict is delivered. I believe our students will get justice from the apex court. They will not be disappointed,\" Hasina urged protesters. Meanwhile, international embassies, including those of the United States and India, have issued advisories to their citizens to avoid demonstrations and large gatherings in Bangladesh. Amnesty International, along with the United Nations and the US, have also urged the Bangladeshi government to protect peaceful protesters from violence.", "source": {"uri": "newsbytesapp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsBytes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Liberation_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Liberation War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razakar_(Pakistan)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Razakar (Pakistan)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tear_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tear gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetBlocks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NetBlocks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awami_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Awami League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Chhatra_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Chhatra League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistance_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Resistance movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Dhaka", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Dhaka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jahangirnagar_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jahangirnagar University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Bangladesh", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of Bangladesh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amnesty International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://i.cdn.newsbytesapp.com/images/29017291721365847.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744480", "eventUri": "eng-9744480", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 2246, "textEnd": 2254}], "sentiment": -0.2941176470588235, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

The outage isn't related to global internet issues affecting banks, airlines and other industries that began Thursday in the US with disruptions linked to Microsoft Corp. services.\n\nIn Bangladesh, student protesters angered by the government's job quota policy attempted to shut down transport networks and businesses after authorities closed all universities.\n\nAFP reported that 39 people have been killed in the clashes so far and the police in the capital Dhaka have banned all public rallies. The government hasn't commented on reported death toll or the outages.\n\nThe protests pose a challenge to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who extended her grip on power for a fourth straight term in elections this year. If the demonstrations continue, they could further slow the economy at a time when Bangladesh is seeking funds from creditors and the International Monetary Fund to bolster dwindling foreign-exchange reserves.\n\nThe local police said the protesters have set fire to several government buildings including the state broadcaster, the national disaster management agency and a toll plaza. Hackers defaced the official Bangladesh police website with messages describing the protest as \"a war for justice, for freedom, and for our future.\"\n\nThe US, the biggest buyer of Bangladesh's exports and a vocal critic of Hasina's government, condemned the violence.\n\n\"We need to make sure that any kind of freedom of expression is happening safely and people are free from violence,\" State Department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters in Washington on Thursday. \"That's something we're continuing to pay close attention to.\"\n\nThe students' frustrations have centered on a policy that sets aside 30% of government job openings for family members of veterans from the 1971 war of independence from Pakistan, which critics say has been abused. The anger stems also from persistently high youth unemployment that stands at about 40%, according to the latest census.\n\nHasina has sought to reassure the students, telling them to have faith in the courts while a case against the quota system is being deliberated. But she has also vowed to come down hard on those responsible for the violence, saying in a televised address on Wednesday that a judicial committee will investigate the turmoil.\n\nThe Associated Press said the country's Supreme Court will take up the jobs quota case on Sunday. The court had initially suspended a ruling by a lower court that reinstated the quota system, triggering the protests last month.\n\nProtesters say the quota system has excluded new job seekers in favor of supporters of Hasina, whose party led the movement to separate from Pakistan. They want the system to be replaced with a merit-based one.\n\nGovernment jobs are highly sought after in Bangladesh and have taken on greater importance as the economy struggles to rebound after the pandemic and years of strong growth. The largely student-driven protests turned violent earlier this week and the Bangladesh's main opposition party has joined in on the demonstrations.\n\n(Updates with Supreme Court taking up the jobs quota case and police banning public rallies in Dhaka)", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Bangladesh is facing its worst unrest in years after at least 39 people were killed in protests demanding the government scrap its preferential hiring rules for sought-after civil service jobs.\n\nAFP explains why students around the country are protesting and how weeks of demonstrations escalated into violence:\n\nBangladesh has more than 1.9 million civil servant posts, according to a 2022 report by the country's public administration ministry.\n\nMore than half of the people hired to these jobs are not selected on merit but under affirmative action rules prioritising women, residents of less developed districts and other disadvantaged cohorts.\n\nThe most contentious aspect of this quota system is the reservation of 30 percent of posts for children of freedom fighters who fought in the country's 1971 liberation war against Pakistan.\n\nThe current rules were introduced in 1972 by independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, father of current Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.\n\nEarlier protests by students in 2018 prompted Hasina's administration to cut down the quota scheme.\n\nBut last month the High Court ruled that this change had been unlawful and ordered the government to reintroduce the freedom fighter category it had abolished.\n\nBangladesh was one of the world's poorest countries when it gained independence in 1971 and suffered a devastating famine three years later.\n\nIts economy has grown dramatically in the decades since, thanks largely to a thriving textile industry that supplies the world's leading fast fashion brands and accounts for around $50 billion in yearly exports.\n\nBut the country still struggles to provide adequate employment opportunities for its burgeoning population of about 170 million people.\n\nMore than 40 per cent of Bangladeshis aged between 15 and 24 were not working, studying or training, according to government statistics from 2022 - altogether 18 million people.\n\nEconomists say the jobs crisis is especially acute for millions of university graduates.\n\nCivil service posts offer a chance at stable lifetime employment but students say the quota system is abused to stuff government posts with loyalists of Hasina's ruling Awami League party.\n\nThey want the quota system dramatically scaled back to only apply to ethnic minorities and people with disabilities, with the remaining 94 per cent of positions selected purely on merit.\n\nProtests began on July 1 with university pupils blocking major roads and railway lines in big cities around the country to draw attention to their demands.\n\nThey have continued nearly every day since, with high school students also joining the rallies, despite Bangladesh's top court suspending the quota system on July 10 for one month and urging demonstrators to return to class.\n\nMonday saw the start of fierce clashes between anti-quota demonstrators and the student wing of the Awami League, with more than 400 people injured across two Dhaka universities.\n\nViolence escalated on Thursday, the deadliest day of the protests so far, with 32 people killed and the toll expected to rise further after reports of clashes in nearly half of the country's 64 districts.\n\nPolice said protesters carried out \"destructive activities\" on government offices, including the Dhaka headquarters of state broadcaster Bangladesh Television.\n\nMore than 700 people were wounded on Thursday, including 104 police officers and 30 journalists, according to local broadcaster Independent Television.\n\nHelicopters rescued 60 police officers who were trapped on the roof of a campus building at Canadian University, the scene of some of Dhaka's most brutal clashes.\n\nPolice fire was the cause of at least two-thirds of deaths reported so far, based on descriptions given to AFP by hospital staff.\n\nPrime Minister Hasina's government on Tuesday ordered schools and universities across the country to close indefinitely, deploying the paramilitary Border Guard Bangladesh force to keep order in several cities.\n\nPolice raided the headquarters of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party that night, arresting seven members of its student wing and claiming they had found a cache of Molotov cocktails and other weapons.\n\nIn a national address on Wednesday, Hasina condemned the \"murder\" of protesters and vowed that those responsible would be punished regardless of their political affiliation.\n\nJustice Minister Anisul Huq on Thursday called for \"dialogue\" with protesters.\n\nHasina's government blocked internet access across the country the same day, with global web monitor NetBlocks saying Friday that a \"nation-scale\" internet shutdown remained in effect.\n\nProtesters have vowed to continue demonstrations despite the crackdown, while rights groups and the United Nations have urged the government to protect students from violence.", "source": {"uri": "newindianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New

Thursday was the most violent day thus far, with at least 39 people having died.\n\nPolice and protestors carrying sticks and rocks clashed all around the nation, including in the capital city of Dhaka, sparking the chaos that followed. When students attempted to stop transit across Bangladesh, authorities had to use tear gas and rubber bullets, which resulted in hundreds of injuries. In retaliation, demonstrators set fire to cars, police stations, and other buildings.\n\nDhaka's Deserted Streets and Media Blackout\n\nFollowing the violent protests on Thursday, the streets of Dhaka appeared deserted on Friday. Local TV news channels ceased transmission, and communication services were widely disrupted. Authorities cut some mobile services on Thursday to quell the unrest, but the disruption soon spread nationwide. According to outage monitor NetBlocks, Bangladesh experienced a \"near-total\" internet shutdown by nightfall. International telephone calls and internet-based communication were largely ineffective.\n\nDestruction and Unrest Intensify\n\nOn Thursday, student protesters set fire to the state broadcaster's building, just a day after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina appealled for peace. Several police posts, vehicles, and other establishments were also torched, and multiple Awami League officers were attacked.\n\nThe Quota System Controversy\n\nThe protesters demand an end to the quota system that reserves 30% of government jobs for the families of those who fought in the 1971 war of independence from Pakistan. This agitation, driven by high unemployment rates, is the largest since Prime Minister Hasina's reelection earlier this year. The protests began late last month and escalated on Monday when Dhaka University student activists clashed with police and counter-protesters backed by the ruling Awami League.\n\nProtesters demand a merit-based system, claiming that the quota system is discriminatory and favours Sheikh Hasina's Awami League followers. Despite the fact that these quotas were eliminated by the Bangladeshi government in 2018, a High Court later restored them.\n\nAwaiting Supreme Court Decision\n\nThe Bangladesh Supreme Court is set to hear the government's appeal against the High Court's reinstatement of the quota on August 7. Prime Minister Hasina has appealed for peace, assuring students they will not be disappointed by the Supreme Court's decision. She also promised judicial inquiries and justice for the perpetrators of violence.\n\nAllegations and International Reactions\n\nThe ruling Awami League claimed the protest turned violent after infiltration by Chhatra Shibir, the student wing of Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh, and another organization, Chhatra Dal. Security forces were deployed to maintain order.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged authorities to look into the violence and hold those responsible accountable, as well as for all parties to exercise restraint.", "source": {"uri": "dnpindia.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNP INDIA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "harsh_tyagi@dnpindia.in", "name": "Harsh Tyagi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awami_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Awami League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_bullet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rubber bullet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tear_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tear gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_union_territories_of_India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "States and union territories of India"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetBlocks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NetBlocks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Bangladesh", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of Bangladesh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Jamaat-e-Islami", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Dhaka", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Dhaka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Bangladesh", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of Bangladesh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Liberation_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Liberation War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant\u00f3nio_Guterres", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ant\u00f3nio Guterres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "High Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secretary-General of the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Espionage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.dnpindia.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Bangladesh-Protest.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744480", "eventUri": "eng-9744480", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 2490, "textEnd": 2498}], "sentiment": -0.5058823529411764, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

Her address came after rival student groups and police clashed in cities around Bangladesh on Tuesday. Three people were killed in the southern port city of Chattogram, two in the capital, Dhaka, and one in the northern district of Rangpur, according to police.\n\nHasina said there would be a judicial probe, and those responsible for the deaths would be brought to justice. \"Some precious lives have been lost unnecessarily,\" she said. \"I condemn every killing.\" On Thursday, six more people died during protests between students, police and ruling party activists in Dhaka, local media said.\n\nBangladeshi authorities have instructed high schools, universities, and Islamic seminaries around the country to close indefinitely. Paramilitary units were also dispatched to keep order in several cities. Authorities on Thursday also suspended mobile internet services. Nusrat Tabassum, a quota protester in Dhaka, said she was attacked twice in two days by activists from the Chhatra League, the student wing of Hasina's ruling party, the Awami League.\n\n\"We were doing peaceful demonstrations to reform the quota system. It's not a political movement. Why did the activists of the ruling party student wing attack us?\" she told DW. Tanveer Hasan Saikat, general secretary of the Dhaka University (DU) Chhatra League, told DW that student wings of Bangladesh's political opposition parties have been taking advantage of discontent over the job quota issue and are \"using students' emotions as a political weapon.\"\n\nThe student groups are on opposing sides of a high court decision earlier this month order to reinstate quotas for government jobs. The quota system had been abolished in 2018 following massive student protests. Under the quota system, more than half of civil service jobs are reserved for specific groups. For example, 30% of government jobs are reserved for family members of veterans who fought in the 1971 liberation war against Pakistan.\n\nThey are commonly called \"freedom fighters\" in Bangladesh. Other groups, like women and the disabled, are allotted a smaller percentage. Several protesters calling for the quota system to be reformed told DW that reinstatement of the job quotas in their previous form would block off the prestigious civil service jobs that many meritorious students aim for.\n\n\"Most of the students want to have a government job in Bangladesh. Social security is one of the reasons behind this,\" Lamia Rahman Supti, a Dhaka University student who has been participating in the protests, told DW.\n\nShe said she didn't the protesters do not see the logic in reserving government jobs for the grandchildren of people who fought in the liberation war more than 50 years ago.\n\nThose against the quotas in the previous form argue the system is discriminatory and should be reformed to prioritize a merit-based system. Supti said reserving 56% of government jobs for certain groups, as is stipulated under the former quota system, \"can't be a healthy practice.\"\n\n\"Ordinary students feel excluded at first glance, nothing can be more unfair than this,\" she said. \"It should be reduced to a tolerable limit, which is 5% in our opinion. It will be good for all of us,\" she added.\n\nSome 3,000 such government jobs were open to nearly 340,000 graduates last year, according to government data. Nasiruddin Yousuff Bachchu, a well-known freedom fighter and cultural personality based in Dhaka, also thinks the quota system should be reformed, but he opposes reducing it to 5%, which the quota reform protesters demand.\n\n''The quota system should be reduced to 20% from the current 56%. The 10% quota we have for women should be increased to 15% as we still need to see more women in government jobs. Also, we need to keep quotas for ethnic minorities, persons with physical disabilities, and marginalized communities,\" he told DW.\n\nHe said that in recent years, the Hasina government has been providing monthly allowances to freedom fighters, which has allowed many of their family members to get better educations, and therefore, more grandchildren of freedom fighters are eligible for government jobs than before. Bachchu said that violence was not the way to solve disagreements over the quota system.\n\n''I think dialogue should be initiated between the government and other groups to solve the quota reform issue. The protests shouldn't continue this way for a long time,'' he added.\n\nAlthough the Supreme Court said last week the new ruling on quotas would be temporarily paused, protesters have promised to continue until the government removes the quotas once and for all. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Hasina asked the protesters to have faith in the country's Supreme Court, which is due to issue a new decision on the quota system next month. \"I am requesting all to wait with patience until the verdict is delivered,\" she said.\n\n\"I believe our students will get justice from the apex court. They will not be disappointed,\" she added. Anti-quota protesters were outraged after they claimed Hasina indirectly referred to them as \"Razakars\" in a press conference Sunday. The term is considered offensive, and refers to those who betrayed Bangladesh in the 1971 War of Independence by collaborating with Pakistan.\n\n\"This remark from the prime minister created discontent among many demonstrators. Ordinary students feel offended. Does it mean that apart from the grandchildren of freedom fighters, everyone else are Razakars? That is not possible,\" said protester Tabassum.\n\nDenouncing the violence, Asif Nazrul, a law professor at Dhaka University, told DW that the government can solve the issue amicably. \"Our country's employment situation is very poor, and the economic situation is not good. Students see the reinstatement of the job quotas in such a situation as an attack on their livelihood,\" he said.\n\n\"If the government wants, it can revise the circular about the quota system and solve the issue immediately. The court has left the option to change the ratio or percentage of the quotas open.\"", "source": {"uri": "dtnext.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "dtNext.in"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The protesters are demanding an end to a quota system that reserves up to 30% of government jobs for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971.\n\nThey argue the system is discriminatory and benefits supporters of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, whose Awami League party led the independence movement, and they want it replaced with a merit-based system. Hasina's party has accused opposition parties of stoking the violence.\n\nThe leading Dhaka-based newspaper 'Prothom Alo', which has a strong network of reporters across the country, said that by late Thursday night, they received reports of 19 deaths in Dhaka and elsewhere in the day's raging violence. The country's leading English-language 'Daily Star' also reported 19 deaths on Thursday.\n\n'Prothom Alo' said at least six people died in Dhaka's Uttara area alone in the latest clashes pitting the protesters against security officials and ruling party activists.

Violence flared in several cities of Bangladesh on Tuesday and the situation was exacerbated when students called a nationwide shutdown on Wednesday, a move backed by the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).\n\nOn Thursday, protesters clashed with pro-government student groups and the police in Dhaka and many other places as videos emerged purportedly showing police vehicles driving into protestors in the capital city. While six people were killed earlier this week, the violence on Thursday reportedly claimed more than 20 lives.\n\nWith websites of leading English newspapers such as Daily Star and Dhaka Tribune, and even those of the foreign and home ministries, inaccessible, it has become increasingly difficult for the outside world to get credible information on the developments in Bangladesh, especially after the government blocked mobile internet and telecommunications services. Mobile phones and WhatsApp numbers within Bangladesh, which could be accessed till Thursday, were unreachable on Friday.\n\nThough Prime Minister Hasina's government had scrapped a job quota for the children of freedom fighters who participated in the 1971 war in October 2018, it was reinstated in June this year by the high court. The Supreme Court was set to hear petitions challenging the high court's ruling on August 7, but will now take up the matter on Sunday following an urgent appeal from the government on Thursday.\n\nHasina, who began an unprecedented fifth term as prime minister in January after scoring a record fourth win in general elections, has long faced charges of giving undue advantages to supporters and workers of her Awami League party in virtually every wing of the government. Critics of the job quota, which reserves more than 50% of government jobs, have alleged that there is no verifiable list of veterans of the 1971 war and that the measure would largely benefit Awami League workers.\n\nAs in many other South Asian countries grappling with creating new avenues for employment, government jobs in Bangladesh are highly valued because of the salary and other benefits. The protesters have argued that the jobs should be awarded on merit and based on reservations that are perceived as skewed.\n\nHasina, who has also grappled with allegations of her government taking an increasingly authoritarian bent, has been blamed by some quarters for triggering the latest round of violent protests by her comments on the job quota during a news conference on Sunday.\n\nWhen she was asked by a journalist about the opposition to the quota, the PM responded by asking whether jobs should be reserved for the children of freedom fighters or those of \"razakars\", a derogatory term used in Bangladesh to refer to those who collaborated with Pakistan before and during the 1971 war. Some students participating in the protests have referred to themselves as \"razakars\", reflecting the depth of their anger against the government.\n\nIndia, which has invested billions of dollars in Bangladesh over the past decade to forge physical, trade and energy connectivity primarily aimed at boosting economic links between the northeastern and eastern regions and the neighbouring country, has already issued an advisory to its citizens in Bangladesh to avoid travel and remain indoors. New Delhi is keeping a close watch on the volatile situation to ensure the welfare of some 10,000 Indians, including about 7,000 students, who live in Bangladesh.\n\nHasina's government has worked steadily for the economic development of Bangladesh, which is set to graduate out of the group of Least Developed Countries (LDCs) by 2026. But it is now increasingly common to hear both her well-wishers and critics say that Hasina needs to do more to relax her grip on power and create a viable space for the opposition, especially as her government has been accused of ramming through decisions without widespread consultations.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Liberation_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Liberation War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awami_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Awami League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka_Tribune", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka Tribune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistance_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Resistance movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Nationalist_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Nationalist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Star_(Bangladesh)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Star (Bangladesh)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Telecommunications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_developed_countries", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Least developed countries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razakar_(Pakistan)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Razakar (Pakistan)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pejorative", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pejorative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Authoritarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2024/07/19/1600x900/Smoke-rises-from-burning-vehicles-after-protesters_1721377493866.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744480", "eventUri": "eng-9744480", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 1549, "textEnd": 1557}, {"amb": false, "date": "2018-10-", "textStart": 1397, "textEnd": 1409}], "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

When it was abolished in 2018, 56% of government jobs were blocked under various quotas.\n\nThe bulk covered groups such as freedom fighters' families, with women and those from underdeveloped districts receiving a share of a 10th each, with 5% allotted to indigenous communities and 1% for the disabled.\n\nThe protesting students want all categories abolished, except the last two.\n\nThis image contains sensitive content which some people may find offensive or disturbing.

This image contains sensitive content which some people may find offensive or disturbing - Click to reveal An injured protester is taken to a hospital after a clash with police and Awami League supporters at the Rampura area of Dhaka, Bangladesh, on July 18, 2024.\n\nWhat sparked the violence?\n\nThe protests turned violent this week following clashes between thousands of anti-quota demonstrators and members of the student wing of Hasina's Awami League party.

According to Agence France-Presse, hundreds of inmates were released.\n\nKey government websites, including that of the central bank, the police and the prime minister's office, also appeared to have been hacked by a group calling itself \"THE R3SISTANC3\". A message posted across the prime minister's office website on Friday called for an end to the killing of students, saying: \"It's not a protest any more. It's a war now.\"\n\nAnother message posted on the website read: \"The government has shut down the internet to silence us and hide their actions. We need to stay informed about what is happening on the ground.\"\n\nThe protests began this month on university campuses as students demanded an end to a quota system that reserves 30% of government jobs for family members of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971.\n\nThose protesting have argued that the policy is unfair and discriminatory as young people struggle for jobs during an economic downturn and instead benefits members of the ruling Awami League party, which is led by the prime minister, Sheikh Hasina.\n\nPro-government student groups have been accused of attacking the protesters, and police have routinely fired teargas and rubber bullets into the crowds, leaving thousands injured and dozens killed.\n\nOn Friday, all public rallies and gatherings were banned but student groups still took to the streets. The sounds of gunfire and stun grenades could be heard coming from areas close to universities in Dhaka. According to reports, police were seen firing live ammunition to break up demonstrations and protesters accused police of being responsible for a large proportion of the fatalities.\n\nWitnesses said the protests had begun to take on a much broader anti-government tone against Hasina and her party, with slogans calling her an \"authoritarian dictator\" and demanding her resignation.\n\nHasina has ruled since 2009 and overseen a vast and severe crackdown on political opponents and critics while corruption has flourished. Critical figures are routinely picked up in \"enforced disappearances\" by paramilitary forces and tens of thousands of political opponents have been jailed. She won a fifth term in January in an election widely documented as being heavily rigged.\n\nClashes between heavily armed riot police and protesters, many wielding batons and bricks, have spread across the country, with vehicles set ablaze in the streets and thousands left injured. On Thursday protesters stormed the headquarters of the state broadcaster, Bangladesh Television, and set it on fire. Authorities said the building was safely evacuated.\n\nThe Dhaka Times said one of its reporters, Mehedi Hasan, was killed while covering clashes in the capital.\n\nAccess to social media was restricted after the telecommunications minister, Zunaid Ahmed Palak, said it had been \"weaponised as a tool to spread rumours, lies and disinformation\".\n\nHasina, 76, ordered that all universities and colleges be shut indefinitely after the clashes. In a speech on Wednesday night, she had condemned the \"murder\" of students killed in the protests and promised justice, telling students to wait for an upcoming supreme court order on the quota system, but it did little to quell the unrest.\n\nThe prime minister was earlier accused of inflaming tensions after she defended the quotas and appeared to refer to protesters as \"razakars\", a derogatory slur meaning those who betrayed the country by collaborating with the enemy, Pakistan, during the war of independence.\n\nThe quotas that sparked the protests were abolished in 2018 but brought back last month after a court ruling, prompting outrage among students. About 40% of young people in Bangladesh are unemployed as the economy has floundered post-Covid and government jobs are seen as one of the few means of secure employment. Young people say the quotas make it very difficult to get the jobs on merit.\n\nHasina's party, which was set up by her father who led the independence fight for Bangladesh, is accused of disproportionately benefiting from the system.\n\nPierre Prakash, the Asia director of the International Crisis Group, said the protests were a reflection of growing frustration on the streets at the erosion of democracy and the country's economic distress, which has led to high inflation and rising unemployment.\n\n\"The protests reflect deep political and economic tensions in Bangladesh. For several years Bangladesh's economy has been struggling and youth unemployment is a serious problem,\" he said. \"With no real alternative at the ballot box, discontented Bangladeshis have few options besides street protests to make their voices heard.\"\n\nSt\u00e9phane Dujarric, a spokesperson for the UN secretary general, said they were following developments in Bangladesh and urged restraint on all sides.", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc",

A high-security alert has been issued across Bangladesh as violent clashes between students and police persist. The clash has resulted in the deaths of 32 people as of July 19, according to reports. It's been weeks since the students protest began, triggering unrest across the country. Here is a deeper look into why students are protesting in Bangladesh and what their demands are.\n\nDuring the protest, which was started by students from the Dhaka University, the protesting crowd pursued retreating officers to BTV's headquarters in Dhaka, setting fire to the reception building and numerous parked vehicles. The incident occurred a day after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina appeared at BTV's headquarters to address the deadly clashes. The protesters are holding rallies nationwide to abolish the Sheikh Hasina-led government's job quota system. Bangladesh Violence: 11 More People Killed in Dhaka As Violence Escalates Over Student Protests Demanding Reforms of Quota System for Government Jobs.\n\nThe protests began when the High Court reinstated a job quota system for families of 1971 independence warfighters, reversing a 2018 decision by Hasina's government to abolish it. The Supreme Court later suspended this decision and scheduled a hearing for August 7. Despite this, student protests grew after Hasina called them \"razakar,\" a term for those who collaborated with Pakistan during the war. The demonstrations intensified after Sheikh Hasina declined to meet the students' demands, citing ongoing court proceedings. Bangladesh Shuts Down Mobile Internet for 'Security' Reasons As Student Protests Over Job Quota System Continue.\n\nAs of 2018, 56% of the government jobs were reserved. The Hasina government had abolished the 30% quota for families of freedom fighters from the 1971 independence war. The students are demanding government jobs based on merit instead of the existing quota system. Student protesters in Bangladesh are now calling for the removal of \"discriminatory\" quotas across all job grades and limiting overall reservation to 5 percent for backward populations. They also demand the removal of separate quotas for children of veterans from the country's 1971 liberation war against Pakistan, as defined by the Bangladeshi Constitution. They also demand a parliamentary bill to make these changes official.", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Dhaka", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Dhaka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Partition of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "High Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Bangladesh", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of Bangladesh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistance_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Resistance movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Liberation_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Liberation War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://st1.latestly.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Violence-in-Bangladesh-784x441.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744480", "eventUri": "eng-9744480", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 7, "textEnd": 14, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 1363, "textEnd": 1371}], "sentiment": -0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

On Friday morning, television news channels remained off air after the state broadcasting headquarters in Dhaka was stormed and set alight by protesters.\n\nThe protests began this month on university campuses as students demanded an end to a quota system that reserves 30% of government jobs for family members of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971.\n\nThose protesting have argued that the policy is unfair and discriminatory and particularly benefits members of the ruling Awami League party, which is led by the prime minister, Sheikh Hasina.\n\nThe demonstrations have escalated into some of worst unrest seen in a decade as pro-government student groups were accused of attacking the protesters, and police fired teargas and rubber bullets into the crowds.\n\nClashes between heavily armed riot police and protesters, many armed with batons and bricks, spread across the country, with vehicles set ablaze in the streets and thousands left injured.\n\nThe Dhaka Times said one of its reporters, Mehedi Hasan, was killed while covering clashes in the capital.\n\nOn Thursday protesters stormed the headquarters of the state broadcaster, Bangladesh Television, and set it on fire. Authorities said the building was safely evacuated.\n\nAccess to social media was restricted after the telecommunications minister, Zunaid Ahmed Palak, said it had been \"weaponised as a tool to spread rumours, lies and disinformation\".\n\nHasina, 76, ordered that all universities and colleges be shut down indefinitely. In a speech on Wednesday night, she had condemned the \"murder\" of students killed in the protests and promised justice, telling students to wait until a high court order on the quota system was given, but it did little to quell the unrest.\n\nOn Friday morning the sounds of gunfire and stun grenades could be heard coming from areas close to universities in Dhaka.\n\nWitnesses on the ground said the protests had begun to take on a much broader anti-government tone against Hasina and her party, with slogans calling her an \"authoritarian dictator\".\n\nHasina has ruled since 2009 and has overseen a vast and severe crackdown on political opponents and critics. Critical figures are routinely picked up in \"enforced disappearances\" by paramilitary forces and tens of thousands of political opponents have been jailed. She was brought back to power in January in an election that was widely documented as being heavily rigged.\n\nThe prime minister further inflamed the anger of protesters when she appeared to refer to them using the derogatory slur \"razakars\", meaning those who betrayed the nation by collaborating with the enemy, Pakistan, during the war of independence.\n\nThe quotas that sparked the protests were abolished in 2018 but brought back last month after a court ruling, prompting outrage among students. Youth unemployment is high in Bangladesh and government jobs are seen as one of the few means of secure employment. Young people say the quotas make it very difficult to get the jobs on merit.\n\nHasina's party, which was begun by her father who led the independence fight for Bangladesh, is accused of disproportionately benefiting from the system.\n\nPierre Prakash, the Asia director of the International Crisis Group, said the protests were a reflection of growing frustration on the streets at the lack of democracy and representation of the issues of the people.\n\n\"The protests reflect deep political and economic tensions in Bangladesh. For several years Bangladesh's economy has been struggling and youth unemployment is a serious problem,\" he said. \"With no real alternative at the ballot box, discontented Bangladeshis have few options besides street protests to make their voices heard.\"\n\nSt\u00e9phane Dujarric, a spokesperson for the UN secretary general, said they were following developments in Bangladesh and urged restraint on all sides.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hannah_ellis_petersen@theguardian.com", "name": "Hannah

Here are details of the protests and their history.\n\nViolence in Bangladesh has killed at least 19 people and injured hundreds after students took to the streets to demand reforms to a quota system that governs distribution of government jobs.\n\nHere are details of the protests and their history:\n\nThe demonstrations started last month after the High Court reinstated a quota system for government jobs, overturning a 2018 decision by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's government to scrap it.\n\nThat move, which covered the 30% of jobs reserved for family members of freedom fighters in the 1971 war for independence from Pakistan, followed similar student protests.\n\nBut the Supreme Court suspended the high court order after the government's appeal, setting a date of Aug. 7 to hear the government's challenge.\n\nHowever, the students stepped up their protest when Hasina refused to meet their demands, citing the court proceedings.\n\nShe called the protesters \"razakar\", making use of an offensive term for those accused of collaborating with Pakistan's army in 1971 to betray the country.\n\nIntroduced in 1972, Bangladesh's quota system has gone through several changes since. When it was abolished in 2018, 56% of government jobs were blocked under various quotas.\n\nThe bulk covered groups such as freedom fighters' families, with women and those from underdeveloped districts receiving a share of a tenth each, with 5% allotted to indigenous communities, and 1% for the disabled.\n\nThe protesting students want all categories abolished, except the last two.\n\nThe protests turned violent this week following clashes between thousands of anti-quota demonstrators and members of the student wing of Hasina's Awami League party. Police fired rubber bullets and hurled sound grenades and tear gas to scatter protesters who also blocked railway tracks and major roads.\n\nHasina is the daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founding father of Bangladesh, who led its freedom movement. Protesters and critics say the 30% quota for families of freedom fighters favours Awami League supporters, which led the independence fight.\n\nExperts also attribute the unrest to stagnant job growth in the private sector, making public sector jobs, with their accompanying regular wage hikes and privileges, very attractive.\n\nThe quotas shrink the number of government jobs open for all, hurting aspirants who want them filled on the basis of merit.\n\nThey have sparked anger among students grappling with high youth unemployment, as nearly 32 million young people are out of work or education from a population of 170 million.\n\nThe economy, once among the world's fastest growing, has stagnated, inflation hovers around 10% and dollar reserves are shrinking.\n\nThe protests are the first challenge to Hasina's government since she won a fourth consecutive term in January in elections boycotted by the main opposition.

Authorities cut some mobile internet services to try to quell the unrest as it turned more violent.\n\nHundreds of people were injured as police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to break up groups of protesters, who torched vehicles, police posts and other establishments, witnesses said. The nationwide agitation, the biggest since Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was reelected earlier this year, saw the intervention of the Army to help \"maintain order\".\n\nIn a dramatic escalation, protesters in Bangladesh set fire to several government buildings, including the headquarters of the state television network, trapping numerous individuals inside the blazing building. Bangladesh's information minister told the BBC that broadcasts had been stopped and most employees had left the building in the capital.\n\nTelevision news channels in Bangladesh were off the air and telecommunications were widely disrupted on Friday amid mostly deserted streets in Bangladesh on Friday following the violence seen on the previous day. According to outage monitor NetBlocks, Bangladesh was plunged into a \"near-total\" internet shutdown as night fell, with telephone and internet calls disrupted.\n\nThere was fresh violence in some parts of the country on Friday and police were using tear gas to disperse protesters. Web sites of several Bangladesh-based newspapers were not updating on Friday morning and their social media handles were also not active. There was no mobile data or broadband on Friday morning, a Reuters photographer in Dhaka said.\n\nNews television channels and state broadcaster BTV were off the air while entertainment channels continued normal transmission. Some news channels displayed a message which said they were not able to broadcast due to technical reasons and that programming would be back soon, as per a witness.\n\nFurthermore, the official web sites of the Bangladesh central bank, the prime minister's office and police appeared to have been hacked by a group calling itself \"THE R3SISTANC3\". \"Operation HuntDown, Stop Killing Students,\" it said in identical messages on both sites, adding in bright red font: \"It's not a protest anymore, it's a war now.\"\n\nThe nationwide agitation, the biggest since Hasina was re-elected earlier this year, has been fuelled by high youth unemployment. Protesters are demanding the state stop setting aside 30 per cent of government jobs for the families of people who fought in the 1971 war of independence from Pakistan. The demonstrations started last month after the High Court reinstated a quota system for government jobs, overturning a 2018 decision by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's government to scrap it.\n\nThe protesters have argued that the quota system is beneficial for supporters of Sheikh Hasina's Awami League, which led the independence movement and called it a \"discriminatory\" move. Nearly 32 million young Bangladeshis are unemployed or without education out of a total population of 170 million people. Experts also attribute the unrest to stagnant job growth in the private sector, making public sector jobs, with their accompanying regular wage hikes and privileges, very attractive.\n\nTo make matters worse, Hasina refused meet the students' demands and used the term 'razakar' (volunteers) - a term used for those who allegedly collaborated with the Pakistani army during the 1971 war that perpetrated some of the worst atrocities during the war. The protests turned violent this week following clashes between thousands of anti-quota demonstrators and members of the student wing of Hasina's Awami League party.\n\nThe capital's main university campus had been the site of the worst of the nationwide protests, but on Thursday there were stronger demonstrations in other pockets of the city. Hasina's government has appealed against the June verdict on quotas and the Supreme Court suspended the high court order, setting a date of August 7 to hear the government's appeal.\n\nThe protests are the first challenge to Hasina's government since she won a fourth consecutive term in January in elections boycotted by the main opposition. She has condemned the loss of lives and called for patience until the Supreme Court delivers its verdict, but the demonstrators refused.\n\n(with inputs from Reuters)", "source": {"uri": "indiatvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India TV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Telecommunications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "State media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tear_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tear gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_bullet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rubber bullet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetBlocks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NetBlocks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Liberation_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Liberation War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Telephone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Floyd protests"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awami_League", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Awami League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "High Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Private sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_independence_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian independence movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/resize/newbucket/1200_-/2024/07/bangladesh-2-1721370660.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744480", "eventUri": "eng-9744480", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 4228, "textEnd": 4236}], "sentiment": -0.4588235294117647, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

The protesters are demanding reforms to the recruitment system for public sector jobs.\n\nTensions escalated on Monday, when scores of protesters clashed with police and pro-government activists at Dhaka University in the country's capital. The government shut all public and private universities indefinitely on Wednesday and sent riot police and paramilitary force to campuses. On Thursday, thousands of protesters stormed the office of the state broadcaster BTV and set fire to the building.\n\nBangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina had appeared on the network one day earlier to call for peace. The protests are the biggest since Hasina was reelected for a fifth term earlier this year.\n\nThe exact death toll in the clashes is unclear. Anadolu reported on Friday, citing police sources, that 39 people were confirmed dead. AFP and Al Jazeera have reported the death toll at 32, while Reuters has said 13 people were killed in clashes on Thursday, adding to six people killed earlier this week.\n\nAccording to Bangladeshi newspaper the Daily Prothom Alo, some 27 people have been killed in the incidents and more than 1,500 injured. The outlet reported that fresh clashes broke out between the protesters and the police in various areas of the capital on Friday. Police are said to have fired stun grenades, tear gas shells, and rubber bullets.\n\nThe websites of other major Bangladeshi newspapers were either not accessible or had not been updated since Thursday. Television news channels were off air on Friday morning and telecommunications were severely disrupted.\n\nThe government has also ordered a countrywide shutdown of its mobile internet network. Zunaid Ahmed Palak, the junior telecommunications minister, told AFP that it was necessary to \"ensure the security of citizens.\" According to Dhaka residents who spoke to RT via online messengers on Thursday night, some ISP-based Wi-Fi networks were still available while mobile internet was cut off through the city.\n\nProtesters have been demanding that the government abolish special quotas allowing the descendants of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's war of independence from Pakistan in 1971 to receive government jobs. Instead, they are demanding recruitment on a merit-based system. At present, 30% of government jobs are reserved for veterans' families.\n\nThe quota system was scrapped in 2018, but in June this year the High Court reinstated it, ruling its removal was unconstitutional. On July 10, the Supreme Court suspended the quotas and the case is pending there. Hasina has urged the demonstrators to place their trust in the Supreme Court.\n\nActivists have claimed that the system is discriminatory and that it favors allies of the ruling Awami League party, which spearheaded the independence movement. Hasina is a daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the leader of the independence movement and the \"founding father\" of the country. He was assassinated in 1975 along with most of his family members by a group of army officials.", "source": {"uri": "kenyastar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Kenya Star"}, "authors": [],

Such a decision, they said, must be made by the government.\n\nBut what really made the students furious was when Hasina on Sunday likened those who are against quotas for war veterans' families to people who collaborated with Pakistan during Bangladesh's war of independence.\n\nAfter violence earlier in the week claimed seven lives, Hasina addressed the nation on Wednesday, saying that the top court was dealing with the quota issue and Bangladeshis would \"not be disappointed.\"\n\nShe urged patience and accused groups with vested interests of stoking anger.\n\n'A new farce'\n\nAfter a meeting with Hasina earlier in the day, Law Minister Anisul Huq on Thursday afternoon offered to hold talks with protesting students in an effort to suspend their agitation.\n\n\"The government has, in principle, agreed to reform the quota system. ...We will sit with the protesters whenever they agree and, if they want, it may be today,\" the minister said.\n\nHe also offered to advance to Sunday a Supreme Court hearing on the quota policy scheduled for Aug. 7.\n\nProtesters rejected this offer, saying the government needed to deal with the consequences of unprovoked aggression against them.\n\n\"By resorting to violence against a peaceful movement, the government has created an unprecedented situation. It is the government's responsibility,\" Nahid Islam, one of the coordinators of the movement, said in a Facebook post.\n\nQuota reform alone will not be enough to resolve the crisis now, he wrote.\n\n\"At first, using the judiciary, the government did not heed the demand, and law enforcers and party cadres tried to suppress the movement,\" he said.\n\n\"[N]ow a new farce is being played out in the name of addressing [our] demands and in the name of dialogue.\"", "source": {"uri": "benarnews.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "BenarNews"}, "authors": [{"uri":

What they fail to see is that their own actions are responsible for that development.\n\nThe quota reform movement in Bangladesh has rocked and shocked the whole nation due to the massive crackdown on the protesters by law enforcement forces and the ruling Awami League's student wing, known as the Bangladesh Chhatra League. Even I, thousands of miles away from Bangladesh, could not sleep the whole night of July 18-19.\n\nMessages and calls from my students constantly hooked me to my phone long into the night. They messaged me, asking me to write about the protests, to stand up for them and their rights. Some cried, asking rhetorically: \"Is this the independent Bangladesh?\" Several students wrote Facebook posts to me, saying \"We are scared and feeling helpless.\"\n\nHowever, everything seemed to stop after 2.00 a.m. Australian Eastern Standard Time, or 10.00 p.m. in Bangladesh. I rushed to check and learned that the government had shut down the mobile network and internet connection countrywide. It remains so as of this writing.\n\nWith a heavy heart, I feel obliged to write for my students and console myself (vaguely) that I did not remain silent.\n\nThe Context: The Quota System and Its Abolishment in 2018\n\nThe immediate cause of the protests was student anger over the reinstatement of a controversial quota system, which reserves a sizable chunk of Bangladesh civil service jobs. The quota system in Bangladesh was introduced in 1972 and has undergone several changes since then.\n\nIn the latest iteration, the quotas applied to 56 percent of Bangladesh civil service jobs. Most notably, 30 percent of government jobs were reserved for the children and grandchildren of freedom fighters, those who fought the Liberation War in 1971 against the regime of then-West Pakistan, now Pakistan. Other quotas reserve positions for women (10 percent), backward districts that are considered marginalized (10 percent), minorities such as the Indigenous population (5 percent), and people with physical disabilities (1 percent).\n\nCivil service jobs are highly sought-after, as these jobs come with higher social status, prestige, pay, security, and future pensions. As a result, the quota system - which reserves over half of available positions for various groups - has been questioned as problematic by students and civil society for a long time.\n\nIn 2018, a massive protest broke out when students at public universities countrywide demanded reform to the quota system. They claimed that the 56 percent reserved quota does not fairly consider the merits and the vast number of applicants who remain outside the quota criteria. They were especially concerned about the 30 percent reserved quota for the freedom fighters' children and grandchildren.\n\nThe current ruling party, the Awami League, which has also been in power for the last 15 years, maintains that they are the true holders of the spirit of the Liberation War, and by extension independent Bangladesh. Their politics revolve around the narrative that the opposition parties, such as the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, stand opposed to the spirit of the Liberation War due to their relationship with the Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, a radical religious-oriented party whose leaders were accused of collaborating with the Pakistani military and committing war crimes against the freedom fighters and the mass population of Bangladesh during the independence war of 1971. Therefore, it is in the interest of the Awami League to sustain the freedom fighter quota to prove and maintain their political position.\n\nHowever, the intensity of the 2018 protests was so high that the government was compelled to abolish the quota system, meaning there would be no quota for civil service jobs. After that announcement, the protesters left the street, thinking they had received what they wanted.\n\nThe 2024 Protests\n\nOn June 5, 2024, the high court of Bangladesh reinstated the quota system in response to a writ submitted by a freedom fighter descent. The verdict mentioned that the quota abolishment was \"unconstitutional, illegal, and ineffective.\" The quota system was back, as if nothing had happened.\n\nThe students did not take it easily. They have again gone to the streets to protest the return of the quota system, an issue they thought had been resolved.\n\nThe protests started at the University of Dhaka, arguably the country's best and most historical university. Soon, students at other universities followed suit, and the protests, for the second time within six years, turned into a nationwide movement.\n\nAt first, ruling party politicians and the government were dismissive, saying they had nothing to do with the quota reinstatement, as the order came from the country's highest court. There was also an argument that the protestors should wait until the appeal hearing, which was set for August 7. But the protesters were not ready to listen. They wanted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to reassure them and act.\n\nThe tension escalated when Hasina made a controversial remark on July 14 while answering a question from a journalist regarding quota reform protesters. She said, \"Why do they [the protesters] have so much resentment towards the freedom fighters? If the grandchildren of the freedom fighters don't get quota benefits, should the grandchildren of Razakars get the benefit?\"\n\nFollowing her remarks, thousands of students from the Dhaka University student dorms came out to the street and started shouting a slogan which can be translated as \"Who am I? Who are You? Razakar, Razakar. Who said that? Who said that? Autocrat. Autocrat.\"\n\nTo contextualize the student's anger and disappointment, we must understand why \"Razakar\" is such a derogatory label in Bangladesh. The term refers to people who collaborated with the Pakistani military to torture, murder, and rape people of then-East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) during the Liberation War of 1971. It is a consensus that the Razakars are the worst traitors in the history of Bangladesh. Any Bangladeshi would take offence if someone calls them Razakar. It was no wonder, then, that Hasina's remark sparked the students' anger.\n\nHowever, following the students' chant, the government and some of the media chose to distort their anger. They only took the first part of the slogan, which might seem, void of context, to indicate that the students are proclaiming themselves to be Razakars. Hasina and other politicians made harsh statements based on this assessment and threatened the students about the chant, completely forgetting the next part of the slogan and the entire context.\n\nIt was an even more inflammatory move for politicians and the government to misinterpret the chant as proof that the students of Bangladesh's highest educational institutions are claiming themselves as Razakars. Meanwhile, the threats only increased the anger of the protesters. Soon the same chant could be heard in other universities as well.\n\nThe government still did not choose to sit for a peaceful dialogue with the protesters. Instead, it instituted a mass crackdown on the protesters through law enforcement agencies, such as the Bangladesh Police and Border Guard Bangladesh, and its student wing, the Bangladesh Chhatra League. As a result, it has been reported that six protestors died, and hundreds were injured on July 16.\n\nThe same night, Hasina gave a speech to the nation, claiming she condemned all violence without saying anything that the protestors wanted to hear. The government also shut down all universities, colleges and schools. This did not end the protests.\n\nOn July 18, the protesters called for a complete shutdown nationwide, except for emergency service vehicles. This time, students from private universities in the capital city joined students from public universities and students from secondary schools and colleges. The government was still not ready to back down; as a result, the crackdown on the protesters became even more aggressive. There are various reports of dozens dead.\n\nWith the situation worsening, the law minister came in front of the media, declaring the government was ready to sit down with the protesters. However, the attack continued on the students. With a massive backlash from netizens seeing horrific images and videos of injured and dead students, the protesters declared that they were not going to talk with the government over the dead bodies of their comrades.\n\nSoon, the government shut down the internet and the mobile network countrywide, making it impossible to know what was happening. Nevertheless, till now, it has been reported that at least 39 protestors were killed over the two days (meaning 33 were killed on July 18), and thousands were injured. Other estimates have the death toll higher, at 64.\n\nIt's No Longer About Quota Reform\n\nThe current government and its supporters keep saying that the quota reform movement has been hijacked from the general students by the BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami cadres, who are allegedly trying to create chaos. However, the basis of such claims is unclear.\n\nEven if such claims are true, many asked why it would be a crime if the supporters of other political parties attended the protests. Are they not also citizens of Bangladesh? To the government, however, the BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami are terrorists and corrupt parties, while the Awami League and its leaders are the ones who are sailing Bangladesh toward economic growth and progress.\n\nIn a word, the government says that the current protest movement is not only about quota reform anymore, but it has become a threat to the existence of the current regime. But why?\n\nThe current government has been in power for the last 15 years, since 2009. There are wide concerns, both nationally and internationally, around the nature of elections in 2014, 2019, and 2024. Over the past year, the government has failed to manage inflation, amid other crises. There are also wide concerns about corruption in the government sector and private sectors. Recently, news broke out that even the civil service job questions were being leaked by the Public Service Commission (PSC) officials for the last 12 years.\n\nFinally, for a long time, the ruling party's student wing, the Chhatra League, has been accused of torturing not only the opposition party's student wing, but also the general student population. The Chhatra League has been used as a shadow army of the government, including in the current protests. It is astonishing to hear the general secretary of the current ruling party asking supporters and activists, which includes the Chhatra League, to \"deal with\" the Chhatra Dal (the student wing of BNP) and Chhatra Shibir (the student wing of Jamaat-e-Islami), who are assumed to be among the protesters. The Chhatra League obeyed their leader's words and attacked the protesters.\n\nThe accumulation of all these factors created mass anger among the youth and the nation's general population. So, of course, the protest movement might not remain the same as when it started, with the agenda of reforming the quota system alone.\n\nIt's clear that the ruling Awami League sees the protests as an existential threat. If so, the government can only blame itself and its \"no compromise\" approach for that development. Its recklessness, failure to stop corruption, use of students against students, excessive force, and depriving the voting rights of the general people while claiming the mantle of a democratic government all contributed to the massive public backlash now exploding throughout Bangladesh.\n\nThe government might be right that the protests are not only about quota reform anymore. However, it is high time for the government to reflect on how it contributed to that escalation instead of blaming and killing the protesting students indiscriminately.", "source": {"uri":

But this is not the first stream of protests that sought to end quotas in Bangladesh government jobs. University students had taken to the streets in 2018 as well as months before Bangladesh was to vote in a national election in 2019. Back then, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina adopted a more conciliatory approach scrapping the quota for the children of Bangladesh's Liberation War veterans.\n\nThis time, protests have erupted six months into her re-election for a record fourth-term. And this time, she had adopted a stern approach to deal with the protesters. She has dubbed them as \"Razakars\" -- a term hitherto synonymous with \"anti-nationals\" in Bangladesh. Literally meaning volunteers in Arabic, \"Razakars\" is a pejorative term in Bangladesh as it refers to those who sided with the Pakistan military during the country's armed struggle for independence in 1971.\n\nNow, the word seems to be acquiring a new meaning in anti-quota protests in Bangladesh.\n\nWhy this Bangladesh agitation is different from 2018's protests\n\nFrustrated with continued protests, Hasina on July 14 remarked, \"Why do they [the protesters] have so much resentment towards the freedom fighters? If the grandchildren of the freedom fighters don't get quota benefits, should the grandchildren of Razakars get the benefit?\"\n\nTo put more context to Hasina's comment, it's helpful to recall that this was her first press conference after she returned from China -- let's rephrase it, after she returned home, cutting short her China visit by a day amid reports that she was upset with the Chinese leadership over economic package deal. We will return to China's connection a little later.\n\nBut this comment by Hasina seems to have galvanised anti-quota protesters. The same night, thousands of students marched on the Dhaka University campus and Bangladesh capital's major stress. Women students joined the protesters in large numbers. Before midnight, protesters were chanting slogans, repurposing the term Razakar to denounce Hasina -- \"Who am I? Who are You? Razakar, Razakar. Who said that? Who said that? Autocrat. Autocrat.\"\n\nThis was not the fervour of the protests that led to the scrapping of the quota for the children of Liberation War heroes. Hasina's father Sheikh Mujibur Rehman and their Awami League party were at the forefront of the Liberation War. Many believe that the quota system helps Hasina supporters and that is why she has been reluctant to scrap it for a merit-based recruitment policy.\n\nHigh unemployment, less jobs: The source of Bangladesh protests\n\nThe source of these protests is a hiring system that Bangladesh adopted in 1972, soon after its liberation from Pakistan. The role of the war veterans was acknowledged by reserving seats for their children.\n\nUnder the quota system, 30 per cent of government jobs are reserved for the descendants of Bangladesh's freedom fighters. This is not all reserved seats.\n\nCurrently, 56% of government jobs are reserved -- including 10 per cent for applicants from backward districts, 10 per cent for women, five per cent for ethnic minorities, and one per cent for aspirants with physical disabilities.\n\nThe trigger to the current wave of protests came from a high court order in June-end. Petitioners, representing the children of the war veterans, had challenged the Hasina government's order to scrap the job quota in 2021. The high court in its order restored the job quota for the descendants of the war veterans, immediately triggering protests.\n\nOn July 10, Bangladesh's Supreme Court suspended the order for a month. The top court will hear the matter on August 7. So, technically, the job quota for the children of war veterans is not applicable currently in Bangladesh but protesters are demanding an executive order from the Hasina government stating that the policy to reward the third generation of war veterans would be replaced by a merit-based hiring system.\n\nTo give a sense of the competition for government jobs -- highly coveted in the Indian subcontinent, thanks to British colonial legacy -- there are around 400,000 job-seeking graduates in Bangladesh for about 3,000 government jobs a year.\n\nUntil Bangladesh fixes its employment structure, there will likely be a huge volume of university pass-outs looking for jobs and forced to stay unemployed or under-employed. The job situation has become complicated in recent times due to the struggle that Bangladesh's economy has been going through, especially after Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nEconomy: Declining growth amid delayed reforms\n\nBangladesh is facing mounting economic challenges now, starkly different from its robust growth trajectory of previous years. The aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic, coupled with global economic uncertainties including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, has left the nation grappling with significant setbacks.\n\nThe country's GDP growth has slowed notably, falling to 5.8 per cent in fiscal 2023 from a previous high of 7.1 per cent in 2022. When protests were happening in 2018, the growth rate was 7.9 per cent.\n\nBangladesh's foreign reserves was about $42 billion during 2018. Now, it has declined to around $26.5 billion.\n\nMoreover, inflation surged, reaching alarming levels around 9.7 per cent by mid-2024. This economic downturn has been exacerbated by widespread corruption scandals implicating high-ranking officials, further eroding public trust and economic stability.\n\nOnly recently, the Bangladesh press was filled with revelations of retired Inspector General of Police Benazir Ahmed's black money and vast assets. Hasina herself said earlier this month that she dismissed one of her aides for illicitly amassing 4 billion Bangladeshi takas ($34 million). This comes against the backdrop of the youth scampering for viable employment options.\n\nRising debt burden: The typical China loan syndrome\n\nBangladesh's fiscal challenges are compounded by its substantial debt burden, primarily attributed to extensive infrastructure projects financed through loans, notably from China's Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nWhile these initiatives aimed to stimulate growth, they have raised concerns about sustainability and long-term financial obligations. Bangladesh's economic woes are intertwined with its growing dependence on foreign loans, notably from China, to fund critical infrastructure projects.\n\nThese initiatives have bolstered economic development aspirations but have also burdened the nation with substantial repayment obligations. These are reflected in Bangladesh's debt-to-GDP ratio of approximately 36.4 per cent. Chinese loans have wreaked havoc in several economies including Sri Lanka in South Asia and a host of African countries.\n\nBangladesh has been wary of the nature of Chinese loans that come in the name for infrastructure development but with preconditions like which Chinese companies will be involved in the projects and also that the loanee country has to deposit some guarantee money in an escrow account to secure China's loan.\n\nHasina's recent visit to China did not go as expected. Bangladesh had anticipated substantial financial support, including some relaxations in debt repayment. Additionally, Bangladesh hoped to secure a $5 billion loan that could re-energise its economy. Instead, over the three days of talks and negotiations, Hasina could get China to consent for a financial assistance of just about $137 million.\n\nShe returned home on July 10, a day ahead of the conclusion of her four-day Beijing visit. It's not clear what curtailed her trip -- was it the ongoing protest or her disappointment with the Chinese leadership, as media have reported.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news",

The protesters are demanding reforms to the recruitment system for public sector jobs.\n\nTensions escalated on Monday, when scores of protesters clashed with police and pro-government activists at Dhaka University in the country's capital. The government shut all public and private universities indefinitely on Wednesday and sent riot police and paramilitary force to campuses. On Thursday, thousands of protesters stormed the office of the state broadcaster BTV and set fire to the building.\n\nBangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina had appeared on the network one day earlier to call for peace. The protests are the biggest since Hasina was reelected for a fifth term earlier this year.\n\nThe exact death toll in the clashes is unclear. Anadolu reported on Friday, citing police sources, that 39 people were confirmed dead. AFP and Al Jazeera have reported the death toll at 32, while Reuters has said 13 people were killed in clashes on Thursday, adding to six people killed earlier this week.\n\nAccording to Bangladeshi newspaper the Daily Prothom Alo, some 27 people have been killed in the incidents and more than 1,500 injured. The outlet reported that fresh clashes broke out between the protesters and the police in various areas of the capital on Friday. Police are said to have fired stun grenades, tear gas shells, and rubber bullets.\n\nThe websites of other major Bangladeshi newspapers were either not accessible or had not been updated since Thursday. Television news channels were off air on Friday morning and telecommunications were severely disrupted.\n\nThe government has also ordered a countrywide shutdown of its mobile internet network. Zunaid Ahmed Palak, the junior telecommunications minister, told AFP that it was necessary to \"ensure the security of citizens.\" According to Dhaka residents who spoke to RT via online messengers on Thursday night, some ISP-based Wi-Fi networks were still available while mobile internet was cut off through the city.\n\nProtesters have been demanding that the government abolish special quotas allowing the descendants of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's war of independence from Pakistan in 1971 to receive government jobs. Instead, they are demanding recruitment on a merit-based system. At present, 30% of government jobs are reserved for veterans' families.\n\nThe quota system was scrapped in 2018, but in June this year the High Court reinstated it, ruling its removal was unconstitutional. On July 10, the Supreme Court suspended the quotas and the case is pending there. Hasina has urged the demonstrators to place their trust in the Supreme Court.\n\nActivists have claimed that the system is discriminatory and that it favors allies of the ruling Awami League party, which spearheaded the independence movement. Hasina is a daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the leader of the independence movement and the \"founding father\" of the country.

Students' protests over job quota system escalate - Vatican News", "body": "Bangladesh is reeling from days of students' protests against a controversial government job quota system, that has escalated this week into violent clashes across the country with police forces and between opposing factions reportedly killing at least 39 people.\n\nOn July 18 police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse protesters who torched vehicles, police posts and other public buildings in the capital Dhaka. In the evening several thousand demonstrators stormed the state broadcaster BTV, setting parts of it on fire, interrupting broadcasts.\n\nThe students are protesting the controversial quota system reserving 30% of public sector jobs for the relatives of veterans of the country's war for independence from Pakistan in 1971.\n\nWith high youth unemployment, students are pressing for a new system based on merit arguing that the current scheme is discriminatory. Critics say it benefits supporters of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's Awami League who has ruled the country since 2009.\n\nHasina's government had scrapped the quota system following previous protests in 2018, but a high court reinstated it in June this year. The government appealed against the verdict and the Supreme Court suspended the high court order, pending hearing the government's appeal on August 7.\n\nThe latest unrest has been fuelled by worsening economic conditions, including high inflation, rising unemployment and depleting foreign reserves. Nearly a fifth of the country's 170 million population is out of work or education.\n\nThe protests are the first significant challenge to Hasina's government since she won a fourth consecutive term in January in an election boycotted by the opposition and are growing into a wider expression of discontent with her autocratic rule.\n\nHasina has long been accused by opposition and rights groups of misusing state institutions to stay in power and of clamping on dissent, even through extrajudicial killings of opposition activists.\n\nEarlier this week the government had ordered schools and universities to close indefinitely and on Thursday authorities cut some mobile services in an effort to bring the law and order situation under control .\n\nIn a further attempt to quell the protests, on Wednesday the Prime Minister addressed the nation on TV promising her government would set up a judicial panel to investigate the deaths during the clashes and assuring that those responsible would be brought to justice. She asked the students to be patient until the Supreme Court's verdict next month.\n\nHowever, the protesters have vowed to continue their campaign and protests are ongoing, despite police banning public rallies, with telecommunications widely disrupted.\n\nAccording to broadcaster Independent Television more than 700 people were injured on July 18 including 104 police officers and 30 journalists. Local sources reported that thee more people were killed on Friday.\n\nMeanwhile, police authorities have announced the arrest of Ruhul Kabir Rizvi Ahmed,\n\none of the leaders of the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), which is supporting the protests.", "source": {"uri": "vaticannews.va", "dataType": "news", "title": "vaticannews.va"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "High Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_bullet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rubber bullet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tear_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tear gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algerian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Algerian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_reserves", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foreign exchange reserves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awami_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Awami League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Telecommunications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruhul_Kabir_Rizvi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ruhul Kabir Rizvi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Nationalist_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Nationalist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrajudicial_killing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extrajudicial killing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Autocracy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.vaticannews.va/content/dam/vaticannews/agenzie/images/ansa/2024/07/18/15/1721310510435.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.cropped.1500.844.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744480", "eventUri": "eng-9744480", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-18", "textStart": 268, "textEnd": 275, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 1281, "textEnd": 1289}], "sentiment": -0.3490196078431372, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

When the High Court junked her decision this July, the government approached the Supreme Court leading to the suspension of the lower court's order\n\nNew Delhi: Under the existing system of recruitment for about 3000 annual government jobs in Bangladesh, 30 per cent are reserved for family members or veterans who fought in the 1971 War of Independence, 10 per cent for women, 10 per cent for residents of the administrative districts, five per cent for the ethnic minority groups like Hindus, Christians etc while one per cent jobs are reserved for physically handicapped. Only 44 per cent of the jobs in Bangladesh are based on merit. The ongoing student protest in Bangladesh, where close to 40 people/students have lost their lives in the last four days, is related to the demand for the scrapping of this quota system, especially the 30 per cent for the family of the war veterans.\n\nIt is alleged that this freedom fighters' quota benefits the supporters of PM Sheikh Hasina because her party, the Awami League Party had led the independence movement in 1971. Meanwhile, the students on the other end of the spectrum ask, why should the third-generation family members of these war veterans be given the reservation benefit.\n\nMeanwhile, there are two interesting sides to this tale. First, even as students are protesting, there is no 30 per cent quota in the country as of date. Secondly, PM Hasina, against whom much anger of the protesters is directed, is the one who scrapped it.\n\nPM Hasina scrapped the quota\n\nWhy did PM Hasina scrap it? After large-scale agitations years ago, PM Hasina scrapped the quota in 2018 to get mileage in the General Elections. She won the elections. Things were fine for a few years until a petitioner approached the court against Hasina's decision in 2021 demanding back the quota as a matter of right. Strangely, the High Court reinstated the quota on July 1, which triggered the student protests. The government of Bangladesh approached the Supreme Court against the High Court's decision and it suspended the lower court's order for four weeks.\n\nPM Hasina blunders\n\nLast Sunday, PM Hasina had just returned empty-handed from China where she failed to secure any financial package she desperately needed to bail out Bangladesh's struggling economy. When she attended the press conference, a routine after her foreign visits, she appeared notably agitated and affected. When asked about the ongoing quota reform movement, PM Hasina was expected to criticise it. However, not in the words she chose. \"If the grandchildren of the freedom fighters don't get quotas, then should the grandchildren of Razakars [Pakistani collaborators] get quotas? That is my question,\" said the prime minister.\n\nRazakar refers to anyone who collaborated with the Pakistani military during the war of independence and the biggest abuse one can hurl at an opponent. All hell broke loose after the statement and within hours of the press conference, the students across the colleges and universities in the country came out on the streets chanting slogans such as, \"Who are you? Who are you? I am Razakar, I am Razakar.\" What followed was mayhem in the streets of Dhaka when the protesting students were accosted by the armed students of the\n\nBangladesh Chhatra League (BCL), the student wing of the Awami League. Several students were killed in the police firing that followed. Ever since the violence has been going on unabated.\n\nWhile the death toll is nearing 40, the protestors' clash with the police continues. The country is experiencing a near-total internet shutdown even as the protestors set fire to the BTV's headquarters in Dhaka on Thursday.\n\nGovernment jobs matter\n\nIn a third-world country like Bangladesh, lucrative and secure government jobs are considered an immediate passport to the good life. It is worth fighting for them. With a stagnant economy and corruption cases routine, the majority of the population in Bangladesh is still dependent on agriculture even as farmland is shrinking and income opportunities dwindling. Close to 22 million people in the country are living below the poverty line.\n\nWhile the Awami League may accuse the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) of provoking the students and financing the protests, it remains a leaderless protest. But since it is the government's job to pour water over any fire anywhere in the country, PM Hasina should immediately call the students' delegation for talks. While it is a political compulsion for the PM Hasina to defend the freedom fighters' quota, the students should understand that the government is standing with them and has gone to the Supreme Court against the High Court's decision. Meanwhile, they should refrain from any violence and provocations.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sandeep_yadav@news9live.com",

A smaller quota would be earmarked for women, the disabled and people from poor neighborhoods.\n\nCritics say the proposals are discriminatory and will benefit those groups aligned with the Awami League party of Hasina, who has ruled Bangladesh with an iron fist for the past 15 years.\n\nCompetition for stable and lucrative public-sector jobs in Bangladesh is fierce. Each year, some 400,000 graduates compete for around 3,000 jobs in the civil service exam.\n\nThe quota system is potentially being reintroduced after the High Court last month overturned a ban when relatives of the 1971 veterans filed petitions.\n\nThat ruling was suspended by the Supreme Court pending an appeal hearing scheduled for Sunday.\n\nOn Wednesday, Hasina urged protesters in a televised address to \"wait with patience\" for the court verdict, saying that she believes they \"will get justice\" and \"will not be disappointed.\"\n\nThe government also said it had offered to hold talks with the protesters but the call was rejected.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

"Bangladesh is facing its worst unrest in years after at least 39 people were killed in protests demanding the government scrap its preferential hiring rules for sought-after civil service jobs.\n\nAFP explains why students around the country are protesting and how weeks of demonstrations escalated into violence:\n\nBangladesh has more than 1.9 million civil servant posts, according to a 2022 report by the country's public administration ministry.\n\nMore than half of the people hired to these jobs are not selected on merit but under affirmative action rules prioritising women, residents of less developed districts and other disadvantaged cohorts.\n\nThe most contentious aspect of this quota system is the reservation of 30 per cent of posts for children of freedom fighters who fought in the country's 1971 liberation war against Pakistan.\n\nThe current rules were introduced in 1972 by independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, father of current Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.\n\nEarlier protests by students in 2018 prompted Hasina's administration to cut down the quota scheme.\n\nBut last month the High Court ruled that this change had been unlawful and ordered the government to reintroduce the freedom fighter category it had abolished.\n\nBangladesh was one of the world's poorest countries when it gained independence in 1971 and suffered a devastating famine three years later.\n\nIts economy has grown dramatically in the decades since, thanks largely to a thriving textile industry that supplies the world's leading fast fashion brands and accounts for around $50 billion in yearly exports.\n\nBut the country still struggles to provide adequate employment opportunities for its burgeoning population of about 170 million people.\n\nMore than 40 percent of Bangladeshis aged between 15 and 24 were not working, studying or training, according to government statistics from 2022 -- altogether 18 million people.\n\nEconomists say the jobs crisis is especially acute for millions of university graduates.\n\nCivil service posts offer a chance at stable lifetime employment but students say the quota system is abused to stuff government posts with loyalists of Hasina's ruling Awami League party.\n\nThey want the quota system dramatically scaled back to only apply to ethnic minorities and people with disabilities, with the remaining 94 percent of positions selected purely on merit.\n\nProtests began on July 1 with university pupils blocking major roads and railway lines in big cities around the country to draw attention to their demands.\n\nThey have continued nearly every day since, with high school students also joining the rallies, despite Bangladesh's top court suspending the quota system on July 10 for one month and urging demonstrators to return to class.\n\nMonday saw the start of fierce clashes between anti-quota demonstrators and the student wing of the Awami League, with more than 400 people injured across two Dhaka universities.\n\nViolence escalated on Thursday, the deadliest day of the protests so far, with 32 people killed and the toll expected to rise further after reports of clashes in nearly half of the country's 64 districts.\n\nPolice said protesters carried out \"destructive activities\" on government offices, including the Dhaka headquarters of state broadcaster Bangladesh Television.",

Critics say the system is designed to benefit loyalists to the Awami League, which styles itself as the only true heir of the independence movement.\n\nSheikh Hasina, the world's longest-serving female leader, was re-elected for a fifth term in January in a vote marred by irregularities including a police crackdown on her political rivals ahead of the polls. The Bangladesh Nationalist party, her main rivals, called for a strike in the capital Dhaka in solidarity with the students.\n\nAnger over the quota system highlights the lack of opportunities in Bangladesh despite rapid economic growth that has helped turn it from one of the world's poorest countries into a hub for global manufacturers such as H&M and Zara. Its GDP a head is now higher than that of neighbouring India.\n\nYet the economy has struggled through a grinding slowdown since the Covid-19 pandemic, with painful inflation, blackouts and falling foreign reserves stoking popular anger with Sheikh Hasina's increasingly autocratic rule.\n\nHer government has enjoyed robust support from neighbouring India and China, who see her secularism as a bulwark against Islamism in the region, but ties with the US and Europe have been strained by her proximity to Beijing.\n\nThe US state department said this week it was monitoring the protests and \"condemn[ed] any violence against peaceful protesters\".\n\nA case over the quota system is set to make its way to the country's Supreme Court.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news",

Here are five key details to know.\n\nAs many as 39 people have been killed in massive student riots in Bangladesh against reservations in government jobs. Hundreds of people have been injured as the police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at the protestors who torched vehicles, police posts and other establishments, according to witnesses. The agitation has led the Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina-led government to shut down mobile internet services in some parts of the South Asian country. Here are five key details about the issue.\n\nStudent rioters across Bangladesh have been clashing with the police and pro-government activists in their demand to replace reservations with merit-based systems in government jobs. The protestors believe that the \"discriminatory\" quota system is framed to favour supporters of Sheikh Hasina's Awami League. According to the quota system, 30% of government jobs are reserved for the families of people who fought in the 1971 war of independence from Pakistan.\n\nThe protests started at Dhaka University in late June and have now turned violent, proving fatal for over 39 people. Hundreds of people were injured as police used tear gas and rubber bullets to curb the attacks on establishments, police posts, and some Awami League officers. Though the Bangladesh government scrapped these quotas in 2018, a High Court reinstated them later. This is reportedly one of the worst agitations since PM Hasina was re-elected earlier in 2024.\n\nCommunication services were disrupted on July 19 as authorities shut down some mobile internet services in the country, according to reports. According to NetBlocks, the South Asian country faced a \"near-total\" shutdown the previous night. Telephone calls from overseas were mostly not getting connected. Additionally, TV channels in Bangladesh came to a standstill as rioters set the state broadcaster BTV's building ablaze on July 18, a day after PM Hasina appeared on the network seeking to calm the clashes.\n\nThe official websites of the Bangladesh Central Bank, the Prime Minister's Office and the police were reportedly hacked by a group calling itself \"THE R3SISTANC3\". \"Operation HuntDown, Stop Killing Students.\" The websites displayed the messages, in bright red font, \"It's not a protest anymore, it's a war now.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina refused to meet the students' demands, further worsening the protests.

The Bangladesh Supreme Court has set August 7 to hear the government's appeal against the High Court's order reinstating the quota, which was abolished by the government in 2018.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed deep concern over the matters in Bangladesh and urged authorities and the rioters to find peaceful solutions. \"The secretary-general encourages the meaningful and constructive participation of youth to address the ongoing challenges in Bangladesh.

Subsequently, the unrest spread across the country. On Thursday, clashes were the bloodiest since the start of the protests, with more than two dozens getting killed and over 1,500 getting injured.\n\nThe situation in Dhaka remains very volatile, intense and critical, according to Al Jazeera. Violence has spread to other cities and smaller towns.\n\nThe 'anti-discrimination student movement' activists have been protesting against the reservation quota system that has a 30% reservation for families of the country's freedom fighters, which they say favours the supporters of the Awami league, the nation's ruling party. With the rising economic issues and higher unemployment, the protests intensified.\n\nBangladesh's private sector, once a leading factor in its growing economy, is now stagnant. This led to the private sector offering fewer job opportunities and increased the demand for government sector jobs. The 'freedom fighter quota' reduces the number of government job opportunities, which are open to all, and the protesting students want these jobs to be filled on the basis of merit.\n\nThe reservation, once scrapped in 2018, was reinstated by the High Court in June. This sparked nationwide student demonstrations and the Supreme court intervened by temporarily suspending the High Court order following the government's appeal to it and setting up August 7 as the date of hearing.\n\nMeanwhile, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's derogatory remarks compared them to those who collaborated with Pakistan during Bangladesh's struggle for independence resulting in huge furor against the government and sparked massive uproar across the nation.\n\nBangladesh is facing a near-complete isolation from the world outside due to a nationwide communication shutdown imposed by the Sheik Hasina government. All telecom services, including mobile data and broadband, have been suspended. Reports say that even SMS and voice call services are not available since Friday morning. Many news organisations based in Bangladesh have been off the air at the time of writing.\n\nA video was released by the opposition party on Thursday showing an Imam being taken away by the police while offering funeral prayers for the students killed during the violence.\n\nThe External Affairs ministry of India commented over the issue with its spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal saying, \"We see this as an internal matter of the country\".\n\nHe said that around 15,000 Indians including 8,000 students residing in Bangladesh are currently safe. \"We have issued an advisory for Indian nationals, including our students, resident in Bangladesh for their safety and assistance if required. Helpline numbers are activated operating on a 24\u00d77 basis for people to reach out.\", Jaiswal added.\n\nMeanwhile, Bangladeshi citizens residing in India are worried about the situation at home. A Bangladeshi national, who resides in Hyderabad, expressed concerns over the difficulty in the connecting with his family. \"Cable TV is the sole functioning communication in the country right now as the government uses it as the tool to reach to the people while controlling the internal narrative,\" he said. He added that he is hoping that the communication services are restored by late tonight or early tomorrow.\n\nThe West Bengal police on Friday detained students and activists who held a demonstration to show their solidarity with the protesting students in Bangladesh. The solidarity rally organised by many Left wing student organisations and human rights organisations saw hundreds of individuals near the Academy of Fine Arts.\n\nA tussle between the police and the students occurred during a march towards the Bangladesh Deputy High Commission in Kolkata.

Another national newspaper, the Daily Star, reported the same death toll, which would bring the total number of fatalities this week to 25, according to the country's media.\n\nThe Bangladeshi government and police have not released any casualty figures.\n\nThousands of protesters attacked the headquarters of the state broadcaster, Bangladesh Television (BTV), in Dhaka on Thursday, setting the building and parked cars on fire. A day earlier, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina appeared on the network appealing for peace. BTV and other news networks went off the air on Friday.\n\nHasina's government has reached out to protest leaders to engage in talks, and federal Law Minister Anisul Huq told reporters Thursday that the government had appointed him and Education Minister Mohibul Hassan Chowdhury to lead the conversations, but the protesters have rejected the offer of a dialogue.\n\n\"The government has killed so many people in a day that we cannot join any discussions in the current circumstances,\" protest leader Nahid Iqbal told the regional Bengali service of CBS News' partner network BBC.\n\n\"The Prime Minister is asking for an end to the violence with one hand whilst, with the other hand, attacking students using pro-ruling party groups and the police,\" another protester, Aleem Khan, told the BBC.\n\nYoung people, many of them college students, started protesting in early July against a job reservations system they see as unfairly benefiting ruling politicians and their families. At first it was largely peaceful sit-ins, blocking roads and railways, but the clashes with police have ramped up since Tuesday.\n\nThe protests started at Dhaka University but spread quickly to other educational institutions in the capital and beyond, especially after pro-ruling party groups entered the Dhaka campus and attacked protesting students. Earlier in the week, the government ordered schools and universities to close indefinitely as police tried to quash the unrest.\n\nThe protesters are demanding changes to a system that reserves 30% of high-ranking government jobs for relatives of veterans of the country's 1971 war for independence. They argue that the job reservation system is discriminatory and has been exploited to benefit people close to Prime Minister Hasina and other politicians of her Bangladesh Awami League.\n\nProtesters are demanding job recruitment based on merit.\n\nHasina's government had scrapped the job reservation system in 2018, but a High Court decision reinstated it last month. The government appealed against the verdict and the Supreme Court suspended the High Court order, pending a government appeal scheduled for Aug. 7.\n\nThe country-wide agitation is the biggest crisis Hasina, 76, has faced since her re-election for a fourth term this year. Anger against the job quotas has been fueled by high unemployment rates among young Bangladeshis, who make up nearly a fifth of the country's population of about 170 million.\n\nU.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller urged the Bangladeshi government to \"uphold individuals' rights to protest peacefully.\"\n\n\"The freedom of expression and peaceful assembly are essential building blocks of any thriving democracy, and we condemn any violence against peaceful protesters,\" Miller said Thursday.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Bangladesh urged American citizens in the country on Wednesday to \"practice vigilance and reconsider their travel plans, especially to areas around public universities... avoid demonstrations and exercise caution in the vicinity of any large gatherings.\"\n\nRights

Many victims died in police firing while hundreds of others were grievously injured in clashes between rival student groups.\n\nHasina has accused her political opponents, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the Jamaat-e-Islami (Jamaat) alliance, of being behind the protests.\n\nIn a televised address to the nation, she announced a judicial enquiry to look into the police firing, and expressed anguish at the death of students and expressed sympathy to the families for their loss.\n\nAlso Read | India's offer to finance Teesta barrage puts Prime Minister Hasina in a diplomatic fix\n\nHasina has invited the students for talks to settle the issue amicably. However, given the volatile situation and the deep sense of hurt among the student community, it is not clear whether they will accept the government's offer. While Hasina is willing to look for a reconciliation with the students, she is determined to be tough in thwarting attempts by her political adversaries to destabilize her government.\n\nEducational institutions shut down indefinitely\n\nMore than 56 per cent of government jobs are reserved under various categories, including 30 per cent for families of those who fought for the country's independence that helped it break away from Pakistan in 1971.\n\nThere was broad consensus on the quota for freedom fighters' families, there was resentment at the government's decision to extend the privilege to their grandchildren in subsequent years.\n\nStudents and job seekers shout slogans as they protest to ban quotas for government jobs at Shahbagh Square in Dhaka, Bangladesh, July 3, 2024. | Photo Credit: Reuters\n\nA student protest in 2018 had led Hasina to scrap the entire quota system. But on July 7, the High Court reinstated it, bringing back the students to the street. The situation worsened from July 14 onwards when Hasina compared those opposing quotas for freedom fighters with \"razakars\" -- a pejorative euphemism for those who worked and fought for the Pakistani army during Bangladesh's independence struggle. The Prime Minister's comment was interpreted widely as her attempt to label the protesting students as \"razakars\" and led to shock, disappointment, and anger among a wider section of the society that went beyond the campuses.\n\nFor the past week student protests have been raging all over the country. All educational institutions in the country have been shut indefinitely and university hostels and campuses emptied out while scheduled examinations were called off until normalcy could be restored.\n\n\"The situation could have been handled better if she restrained the trigger-happy police and called for early talks with the students,\" says Imtiaz Ahmed, former professor of Dhaka University's political science department. But Hasina and her party leaders see the BNP and Jamaat using the students' frustration over the quota system as a shield against her.\n\nRising public resentment\n\nHasina won a fourth consecutive term as prime minister in January 2024, in a parliamentary election that was largely boycotted by the opposition parties. The BNP and its allies had relied on the United States' intervention to install a caretaker government to conduct the election in Bangladesh. But India managed to use its influence to convince the US to let Hasina deal with the situation on her own.\n\nThe Joe Biden administration, which had been pressuring Hasina for democratic backsliding for much of 2023 in the run-up to the election, decided to relent and the Awami League had a landslide victory.\n\nThe Awami League thinks the opposition that had been marginalised for all these months, is now trying to stage a comeback to the political theatre in Bangladesh by instigating the students' protest.\n\nEarlier in the year, they had tried to launch a \"boycott India\" campaign to convince people not to buy Indian goods as it held New Delhi responsible for Hasina's victory. But the campaign fizzled and did not find many takers in Bangladesh.\n\n\"Resentment is building up against Hasina's government among the public, not only because of the cumulative effect of her four-term anti-incumbency but due to her autocratic way of handling dissent,\" says former Bangladeshi diplomat Humayun Kabir and president of Bangladesh Enterprise Institute. He pointed out that the wide support that the students' protest has been getting, reflects that growing resentment against Hasina.\n\nHasina said the government had asked for the Supreme Court 's view after the High Court reinstated the quota system. The Prime Minister explained that until the apex court gives its verdict there was nothing the executive could do. Therefore, her government has no option but to wait.\n\nShe said people have the right to hold peaceful protests. But if they turn violent, the law would take its own course.\n\nRich history of protests\n\nBangladesh has a rich history of students' protest which dates back to the days of the Bhasha Andolan (the language movement) of 1952 in erstwhile East Pakistan. The students had taken the lead in forcing Bengali to be given the same status as Urdu in Pakistan and in subsequent years they also played a stellar role in the country's freedom struggle that led to the creation of Bangladesh.\n\nAlso Read | What do India's neighbours expect from the new government?\n\nIt remains to be seen how the current students protest pan put in the coming days. The Awami League leaders have instructed cadres all over the country to be prepared to deal with the BNP-Jamaat combine's attempt to foment trouble for Hasina's regime. In such a scenario it might take Bangladesh much longer before it restores peace and normalcy in the country and bring the students protest to an amicable end.\n\nPranay Sharma is a commentator on political and foreign affairs-related developments.

[Source: Md. Hasan/BenarNews]\n\nUNITED NATIONS, Jul 19 2024 (IPS) - Student protests over the Bangladesh government's recruitment system have escalated into violent retaliation from the police and the leading party's student wing.\n\nToday (Friday, July 19), violent clashes continued to rock Dhaka, Bangladesh's capital, and the northern city of Rangpuras, where university students continued their protest over the government's civil service recruitment system. AFP reports reports the death toll reached 105.\n\nThe quota system, as it is known, now reserves 56 percent of positions in the civil service to certain groups: 10 percent to women, 10 percent to those from underdeveloped districts, 5 percent to indigenous peoples, 1 percent to people with disabilities, and 30 percent to those who fought in the 1971 war of independence, along with their descendants.\n\nIn June, Bangladesh's High Court ruled to reinstate the measure to reserve jobs for indepdendence fighters, which had been previously abolished by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in 2018.\n\nStudents and young workers raised concerns that this system did not reward merit but rather favored those affiliated with the Awami League, the ruling party.\n\nSince then, students have been demanding a reform to the quota system. This comes at a time when the unemployment rate is at 40 percent for youth who are neither working nor in university.\n\nOn July 14, Hasina implied that the protestors were \"razakars,\" a contentious term in Bangladesh as it refers to the people who supported Pakistan during the 1971 war, traitors in the eyes of the Bangladeshi people. The comments from Hasina caused outrage among students and they decried them during the protests.\n\nThe escalation into violence began on July 15, when protestors were attacked by members of the Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL), the student wing of the Awami League. Reports emerged of heavily armed BCL members attacking indiscriminately against unarmed protestors, including women and younger students.\n\nThe government consequently called for all university campuses to shut down amid the tensions. The police force was sent in to suppress the movement, where they have used rubber bullets and tear gas against students.\n\nProtests and the resulting violent clashes have broken out all over the country, including Chittagong, Rangpur, and Dhaka.\n\nOn Thursday, the government deployed the military, namely the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB). Since then, at least 105 deaths have been reported and over 25,000 people have been injured during the protests. This number could be much higher.\n\nSince July 18, internet and phone communications have been shut down, first in select areas and now across the country.\n\nThe internet shutdown has also meant that the websites of some major news outlets, such as the Daily Star and Bangladesh have gone offline. Just prior to the shutdown, the BCL's official website was hacked with a message that reads \"Hacked by THE R3SISTANC3.\"\n\nThere are also reports that the official websites of the police and the prime minister's office were also hacked with messages reading, \"Stop killing students\" and \"It's not a protest anymore, it's a war now.\"\n\nAmid the protests, the government announced on Thursday announced that it would be willing to sit down with protestors to discuss their demands for reform to the quota system.\n\nLaw minister Anisul Haq said that discussions would be held whenever the student protestors agreed. Student protestors have so far denied this call to action, with one student telling the BBC on Thursday, \"The government has killed so many people in a day that we cannot join any discussions in the current circumstances.\"\n\nUN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker T\u00fcrk expressed concern for the violation of human rights and has called for impartial investigations into the attacks.\n\n\"The government should take the necessary measures to ensure the protection and safety of the students participating in peaceful protests, and to guarantee the right to freedom of assembly and expression without fear of attacks against their lives and physical integrity, or other forms of repression,\" he said. \"Bangladesh's political leaders must work with the country's young population to find solutions to the ongoing challenges and focus on the country's growth and development. Dialogue is the best and only way forward.\"\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed deep concern about the violence and called for \"restraint on all sides.\"\n\nIn a statement issued on Thursday, he called for authorities to \"investigate all acts of violence, hold perpetrators to account, and ensure a conducive environment for dialogue.\"", "source": {"uri": "ipsnews.net",

What we know so far | Today News", "body": "Bangladeshi students set fire to the country's state broadcaster on Thursday as protests against civil service hiring rules escalated, with the death toll mounting to at least 39.\n\nBangladeshi students set fire to the state broadcaster on Thursday, a day after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina appeared on it to address deadly clashes that killed at least 39 persons over a quota system for government jobs.\n\nHundreds of protesters, demanding civil service hiring reforms, fought with riot police who fired rubber bullets. The angry crowd chased retreating officers to BTV's headquarters in Dhaka, setting fire to the reception building and dozens of parked vehicles.\n\nRights groups accused Hasina's government of abusing state institutions to solidify its power and suppress dissent, including through extrajudicial killings of opposition activists.\n\nThis week, her administration ordered schools and universities to close indefinitely as police intensified efforts to control the worsening law and order situation.\n\nProtester Bidisha Rimjhim, 18, told AFP, \"Our first demand is that the prime minister must apologise to us. Secondly, justice must be ensured for our killed brothers.\"\n\nProtesters seek to abolish this system, claiming it is discriminatory and favours supporters of PM Hasina's Awami League party, which led the independence movement. They advocate for a merit-based system instead.\n\nDespite growth in some private sector job opportunities, many prefer government jobs for stability and better pay. However, there are not enough to meet demand -- around 400,000 graduates compete for about 3,000 civil service jobs yearly.\n\nWhile the quota system also reserves jobs for women, disabled people, and ethnic minorities, students primarily protest the jobs reserved for veterans' families.\n\nThis issue has caused an uproar earlier, too. In 2018, Hasina's government suspended the quotas following large student protests. However, the High Court overturned that decision last month and reinstated the quotas after relatives of the 1971 veterans filed petitions, leading to the latest protests.\n\nThe Supreme Court then suspended the High Court's ruling and promised to decide on the matter by August 7. Despite this, the protests have continued.\n\nHer government has also blamed the main opposition parties, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the right-wing Jamaat-e-Islami party, for inciting unrest. The BNP has endorsed the students' call for a shutdown on Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "livemint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mint"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Civil service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riot police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_bullet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rubber bullet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awami_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Awami League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_independence_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian independence movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrajudicial_killing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extrajudicial killing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaat-e-Islami", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamaat-e-Islami"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Nationalist_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Nationalist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "High Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Private sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minority group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property_Rights", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property Rights", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images.livemint.com/img/2024/07/19/600x338/BANGLADESH-UNREST-STUDENTS-PROTEST-20_1721356373539_1721356399417.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744480", "eventUri": "eng-9744480", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 2200, "textEnd": 2208}], "sentiment": -0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

Buildings and cars on fire. Tear gas and rubber bullets fired. A mounting death toll.\n\nThese are the frightening scenes currently coming out of Bangladesh.\n\nViolent clashes between students and police and counter-protesters in support of the ruling political party Awami League have led to at least 39 deaths, according to international news agency AFP, reporting from Dhaka. Many more have been injured.\n\nStudents in the South Asian nation are protesting against a quota system for jobs in the civil service, which are sought-after because they are stable and well-paid.\n\nThey say the system - which reserves more than half of the government jobs for specific groups, including 30 per cent for children of veterans who fought in the country's 1971 liberation war against Pakistan - favours allies of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's government.\n\nStudents instead want a system based on merit.\n\nSchools and universities across the country have been ordered to close until further notice and Ms Hasina gave a national address in an attempt to calm the violence this week.\n\nShe said she condemns every \"murder\".\n\n\"I firmly declare that those who carried out murders, looting and violence - whoever they are - I will make sure they will be given the appropriate punishment,\" she said.\n\nBut a day later, Bangladeshi students set fire to the head office of the state-run Bangladesh Television, which aired the speech.\n\nPolice had fired rubber bullets at hundreds of protesters, but they fought back and chased retreating officers to the headquarters of the broadcaster in the capital of Dhaka.\n\n\"Our first demand is that the prime minister must apologise to us,\" protester Bidisha Rimjhim, 18, told AFP.\n\n\"Secondly, justice must be ensured for our killed brothers,\" she added.\n\nAt least 32 people were killed on Thursday alone, according to an AFP tally based on hospital data.\n\nPolice weaponry was the cause of at least two-thirds of those deaths, based on descriptions given from hospital figures.\n\nRights group Amnesty International said video and photographic evidence from clashes this week showed that Bangladeshi security forces had used unlawful force.\n\nWitnesses that Amnesty International spoke with also claimed protesters were peaceful before individuals from the Bangladesh Chhatra League, a group affiliated with Awami League, started attacking them at Dhaka University on July 15.\n\nOne example of the violence Amnesty International heard about was a first-year university student found lying on the street while \"vomiting incessantly and struggling to breathe\".\n\n\"We recovered his phone from his pocket which was completely smashed into pieces,\" an unnamed witness said. \"Imagine the kind of force it needs to break a phone into pieces while it's inside someone's pocket.\"\n\nThe internet has also been shut down in the country in what is understood to be an effort to prevent students from communicating and organising protest activities via social media.\n\n\"Metrics show Bangladesh has now been cut off from the world for over six hours, with a nation-scale internet shutdown in effect amid student protests,\" London-based internet monitor NetBlocks said on X, formerly Twitter, just before 8am AEST.\n\n\"The disruption prevents families from contacting each other and stifles efforts to document human rights violations.\"\n\nNetBlocks had confirmed in the early hours of Friday AEST, that live network data showed a \"near-total national internet shutdown\".\n\nZunaid Ahmed Palak, who is the state minister for telecommunications and information technology, said earlier mobile internet had been \"temporarily suspended\" and services would only be restored once the situation returned to normal, Al Jazeera reported.\n\nAttempting to access local news coverage, news.com.au discovered Bangladesh news websites were also down, including the largest circulating English-language newspaper in the country, The Daily Star, and Dhaka Tribune, an English-language newspaper based in the country's capital.\n\nThe current quota rules were introduced in 1972 by independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who is the father of current Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.\n\nProtests by students in 2018 prompted Ms Hasina's administration to cut down the quota scheme.\n\nBut last month, the High Court ruled that this change had been unlawful and ordered the government to reintroduce the freedom fighter category it had abolished.\n\nThis meant the 30 per cent quota in government jobs for the children of veterans was back.\n\nReacting to the violence, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric appealed for \"restraint from all sides\".\n\n\"We urge the government to ensure a conducive environment for dialogue. And we encourage protesters to engage in dialogue to resolve the deadlock,\" he told reporters. \"Violence is never a solution.\"", "source": {"uri": "news.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title":

The move overturned a 2018 decision by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's government to scrap it.On the government's appeal, Bangladesh's top court has suspended the reinstated system and is set to hear a challenge against it on August 7.:: What is the quota system?Bangladesh's quota system was introduced in 1972 - and by the time it was abolished in 2018, over half of government jobs were reserved for specific groups.

She has called in the military to crush the protests.\n\nMore than 100 deaths have been reported and over 700 people have been injured in this week's violence that has now spread to most of the country.\n\nThe declaration of the curfew and the deployment of the military to support the embattled police and paramilitary personnel was separately confirmed by Hasina's office and her political party Bangladesh Awami League (BAL).\n\nHasina's Press Secretary Nayeemul Islam Khan told AFP, \"The government has decided to impose a curfew and deploy the military in aid of the civilian authorities.\"\n\nKhan on Friday further said that the order had come into force with immediate effect.\n\nSeparately, BAL General Secretary Obaidul Quader announced that Hasina's government had declared nationwide curfew and had ordered the deployment of military to help the civilian authorities maintain law and order, according to The Associated Press.\n\nThe nationwide curfew comes amid reports of nationwide suspension of internet since Thursday. Despite these measures, the protests have continued to rage across the country as the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) has lent support to the protesters.\n\nMore than 100 killed -- 52 killed on Friday alone\n\nMore than 50 deaths were reported in Bangladesh's capital Dhaka on Friday\n\nAt least 52 people were killed in Dhaka on Friday, according to a list of casualties of Dhaka Medical College Hospital and cited by AFP.\n\nOverall, the agency reported that at least 105 people have been killed, according to a tally compiled from figures from various hospitals.\n\nMore than half of these deaths were a result of police firing, reported the agency by citing hospital staffers.\n\nEarlier in the day, the agency reported that more than 700 people were injured, around 100 of whom were security personnel.\n\nPreviously, the police in Dhaka banned all public gatherings but that did not stop the protests. The police in Dhaka said protesters on Thursday burnt, vandalised, and carried out \"destructive activities\" on police and government offices. Among the places attacked included state broadcasters Bangladesh Television's headquarters which protesters stormed and put on fire.\n\nQuota system triggered Bangladesh quota system\n\nThe immediate trigger for protests is the public's opposition to Bangladesh's quota system that reserves more than 50 per cent of civil services post to specific groups, such as the children of veterans of Bangladesh's war of liberation against Pakistan.\n\nThe critics say the system is rigged in favour of Hasina as her family-run BAL was central to the war of liberation and her father Mujibur Rahman was the leader of the liberation movement and was the first president of the independent Bangladesh. Hence, these seats are effectively reserved for children of Hasina's family's supporters, say critics. Protest marches have taken place on a nearly-daily basis this month which seek an end to the system.\n\nHasina is also facing protests over rising resentment against her 15-year reign in Bangladesh in which critics have claimed significant democratic decline. In the general elections held earlier this year, Hasina's BAL practically won unopposed as the BNP, the main opposition party, had boycotted the elections.\n\nEarlier in the day, protesters stormed a jail in Narsingdi and freed hundreds of prisoners. They also set the prison on fire.\n\nUN calls for restraint & investigation\n\nUnited Nations human rights chief Volker Turk called for restraint from all sides and pressed for the need of impartial investigations and accountability.\n\nTurk said that there need to be impartial, prompt, and exhaustive investigations into these attacks and accountability must be fixed.\n\nTurk called upon Hasina's government to respect the right to protest and free expressions. He said dialogue was the only way forward.\n\n\"The Government should take the necessary measures to ensure the protection and safety of the students participating in peaceful protests, and to guarantee the right to freedom of assembly and expression without fear of attacks against their lives and physical integrity, or other forms of repression,\" said Turk in a statement.\n\nNationwide internet suspension reported in Bangladesh\n\nAmid widespread violence, nationwide internet suspension has also been reported in Bangladesh.\n\nInternet freedom watchdog NetBlocks said on Friday that up to 90 per cent of internet connectivity in Bangladesh remained suspended since Thursday.\n\n\"Metrics show connectivity flatlining at 10 per cent of ordinary levels, raising concerns over public safety as little news flows in or out of the country,\" said the watchdog in a post on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nUN human rights chief Turk also mentioned the internet suspension in his statement and said it \"disproportionately restricts the enjoyment of the right to freedom\" and urged Hasina's government to reinstate internet at the earliest.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType":

That number could not be immediately verified.\n\nAl Jazeera had previously reported that at least 19 protesters were killed by Thursday night, with the majority in the capital, Dhaka. Others were killed in protests in nearby Narayanganj and the eastern city of Chittagong.\n\nThe death toll could rise with reports of clashes in nearly half of the country's 64 districts.

Calls from overseas were mostly not getting connected.\n\nSocial media platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp were not loading.\n\nStudent protesters said they would extend their calls to impose a national shutdown on Friday, and urged mosques across the country to hold funeral prayers for those who have been killed.\n\nThe nationwide agitation, the biggest since Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was re-elected earlier this year, has been fuelled by high youth unemployment, with about a fifth of the country's 170 million population out of work or education.\n\nProtesters are demanding the state stop setting aside 30 percent of government jobs for allies of Hasina's Awami League party, which led the country's independence movement.\n\nThe jobs are reserved for family members of veterans who fought for the country's independence from Pakistan in 1971.\n\nA further 26 percent of jobs are allocated to women, disabled people and ethnic minorities.

escalated after violence broke out on the campus of Dhaka University on Monday, with students violently clashing with police and the student wing of the Awami League.\n\nThe government shut all public and private universities indefinitely on Wednesday and sent riot police and the Border Guard paramilitary force to campuses.\n\nAl Jazeera's Chowdhury said the government had been \"conciliatory\".\n\n\"The law minister announced that the prime minister has instructed him to come to a compromise and sit down with the quota protesters,\" he said.\n\nBut students he had spoken to

Please try again later.\n\nNEW DELHI -- Clashes between police and various student groups in Bangladesh have killed dozens of people after protests escalated sharply over a policy backed by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to reserve a portion of government jobs for descendants of the nation's freedom fighters.\n\nIn the capital, Dhaka, protesters attacked the state television headquarters and set fire to police booths Thursday as they called for a \"complete shutdown\" of the country. Running street battles between security forces using rubber bullets and tear gas and crudely armed protesters forced life in several neighborhoods to a halt, with streets emptying of traffic and even the cabinet canceling its meetings, Bangladeshi media reported.\n\nMore than 150 students were being treated at a Dhaka hospital for injuries after being hit by rubber bullets, Agence France-Presse reported. There were also reports of clashes between protesters agitating against the job quotas and the student wing of Hasina's ruling party, the Awami League.\n\nSchools and universities have been closed indefinitely, and authorities have cut mobile internet services nationwide, citing the need to curb disinformation. NetBlocks, an internet monitoring group, said live network data showed the country plunged into a near-total internet shutdown late Thursday. The websites for several leading Bangladeshi newspapers were either not updated since Thursday or altogether inaccessible. Television channel have also been taken off the air.\n\nAs of late Thursday, before communications were fully severed, news outlets reported conflicting numbers of casualties, although most put the number of dead in the dozens. The leading newspaper, Prothom Alo, reported 29 killed and 1,500 injured Thursday, while AFP put the day's death toll at 32, citing a police spokesman.\n\nThe protests, which have simmered for weeks but ratcheted sharply in recent days, represent the most serious challenge to Hasina, 76, and her Awami League in years. Hasina's father, Mujibur Rahman, helped form the Awami League in 1949, which led the country's bloody independence struggle against Pakistan in 1971. Hasina has argued that families who participated in the liberation war should be compensated with jobs, but her critics say the scheme unfairly benefits families close to the Awami League at a time of economic distress.\n\nAlthough Hasina has been credited with boosting Bangladesh's textile export industry and improving public infrastructure over her more than two decades in power, the country has recently been wracked by inflation topping 9 percent and stagnant growth. Government positions are often seen as the most secure and coveted option by young jobseekers, but more than half of the slots are reserved for various groups, including residents in remote areas and women.\n\nThe 30 percent quota for the descendants of freedom fighters existed until 2018, when it was canceled by the Hasina government amid violent protests. Last month, a Bangladeshi court reinstated the policy, and Hasina continued to argue in its favor.\n\nAt a news conference Sunday, Hasina said she was open to lowering the quota but argued that some form of the policy should exist. She used a politically charged term -- \"razakar,\" referring to the violent mobs that collaborated with the Pakistani army in 1971 -- in a comment that reverberated around the country and led to student groups hitting the streets in anger.\n\n\"Why do they have so much resentment toward the freedom fighters?\" Hasina asked. \"If the grandchildren of freedom fighters don't get quota benefits, should the grandchildren of razakars get them?\"\n\nHasina has won every election since 2009, including several that have been criticized as unfair, and has come under criticism for her increasingly heavy-handed leadership style. In the run-up to the most recent election in January, her government jailed thousands of opposition figures and won unopposed after rival parties boycotted the polls.\n\nThe Supreme Court has temporarily suspended the quota policy and said it would make a ruling on its legality on Aug. 7. During her last public appearance Wednesday, Hasina pleaded for \"patience\" and said she believed \"our students will get justice from the court.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gerry_shih@washingtonpost.com", "name": "Gerry Shih", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awami_League", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Awami League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_bullet", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rubber bullet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019\u20132020_Hong_Kong_protests", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2019\u20132020 Hong Kong protests"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistance_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Resistance movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tear_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tear gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetBlocks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NetBlocks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prothom_Alo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prothom Alo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_National_Revolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indonesian National Revolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Mujibur_Rahman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Mujibur Rahman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Liberation_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Liberation War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RXKYMKZ6SVHFZOT5GHZHKMHASA_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744480", "eventUri": "eng-9744480", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 4179, "textEnd": 4185}], "sentiment": -0.2941176470588235, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

But, equally, it is not clear whether the government is attempting to silence critics and prevent organization of anti-regime protests or whether the outages are a consequence of ongoing violence and attacks on infrastructure.\n\nThe unrest centers on demands to end a quota system reserving up to 30% of government jobs for relatives of 1971 independence war veterans. Protesters argue the system is discriminatory and instead seek a merit-based alternative.\n\nAssociated Press says that there have been 28 deaths in the country during the protests, citing local media reports. Several prominent members of the arts community in Bangladesh changed their display pictures to black in commiseration of the deaths.\n\nVariety managed to get through to one such person who, on condition of anonymity, confirmed the internet outage, describing it as a \"total shutdown\" \"Things are really turning bad,\" the person said. The deaths are at 32, the person said, adding that the movement is now a \"people's protest\" against attempted suppression by the government and the police.\n\nThe digital blackout followed Thursday's intensification of violence, with students attempting to impose a \"complete shutdown\" on the country. Protesters reportedly attacked the headquarters of state-run Bangladesh Television, damaging property and setting fire to vehicles, per AP.\n\nA BTV news producer, speaking anonymously to AP, described escaping over a wall as attackers breached the main gate and set furniture ablaze. While the station reportedly continued broadcasting, some Dhaka residents reported signal loss.\n\nBy Friday morning, internet services and mobile data appeared non-functional in Dhaka, with social media platforms inaccessible. Student protesters announced plans to extend their shutdown call and urged nationwide funeral prayers for the deceased.\n\nThe protests have become the most significant unrest since Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's re-election in January.

AFP\n\nThe student protests in Bangladesh seem to be a result of deep misunderstanding and a misplaced hardened stance on the part of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's government of the Awami League.\n\nOn Tuesday, there were clashes between the protesting students on the one side, and the police and the Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL), which is the student wing of the ruling party. Six students were dead.\n\nThe protests are about the quota system in government jobs. About 56 per cent of the jobs are marked out for descendants of the freedom fighters of 1971, for women, for the differently-abled and for ethnic minorities. These were announced in 2018, and there were protests then as well. The government in a sudden turnaround, abolished the quota system.\n\nBut the Bangladesh High Court had ruled that the quota system cannot be abolished, but the system can be reformed. The protesting students want a reform in the quota structure. But the government's response is intended to polarise the situation.\n\nMany in the government, including Prime Minister Hasina, raised the counter-argument whether instead of reserving jobs for the freedom fighters should they be reserved for the collaborators or 'razakars' who helped the Pakistan army in the 1971 war. This was an incendiary remark, making the students to be on the side of the enemies of Bangladesh. And they defied the government by crying, 'Yes, we are 'razakars''.\n\nIt has been pointed out in the Bangladesh media that the students took a wrong turn. The others said that the students' counter-slogan was meant to be sarcastic, and it was not to be taken literally. But in the heat of political exchange, the subtleties and the contexts are lost out.\n\nThe quota system as it exists becomes an issue because of the 'jobless growth' of the Bangladesh economy. The economy is growing but the young people are without jobs. Those who can are leaving the country. But the people who are not able to, and who do not want to, leave the country are forced to challenge the government's job policy. What was needed was tact on the part of the Awami League government, but the government seems to have only hardened its stance.\n\nBut there is a change in the approach of the government which was reflected in Prime Minister Hasina's televised address to the nation. She adopted a more conciliatory approach in contrast to the attitude of the government of the last two days. She asked protesting students to keep faith in the judiciary, and she said that the court will deliver justice. She condoled the death of the students killed in the police firing, and she warned the students from getting misled by miscreants.\n\nThe government had taken the stance that the matter is before the court and there is not much it can do. The question is whether the government is trying to pass the buck to the courts, or does it feel that it should act only after the final decision of the court. The High Court had already hinted that the quota system can be reformed.\n\nWill the protesting students be mollified by the words of the prime minister? The troublemakers will have enough room to play mischief. It becomes necessary for leaders of the protesting students to accept the prime minister's assurance at its face value, and give her the elbow room to step back.

Why Are Students Protesting? Check the Full Story Here!", "body": "Why Are Students Protesting in Bangladesh? Violence has erupted in Bangladesh, claiming at least six lives and injuring hundreds. The cause? Students have taken to the streets, demanding reforms to a quota system that governs the distribution of government jobs.\n\nLast month, demonstrations erupted after the High Court reinstated a quota system for government jobs. This decision overturned a 2018 move by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's government to scrap the system.\n\nIntroduced in 1972, Bangladesh's quota system has undergone several changes. When it was abolished in 2018, 56% of government jobs were blocked under various quotas. These included allocations for freedom fighters' families, women, underdeveloped districts, indigenous communities, and the disabled.\n\nThe protesting students want all categories abolished, except the last two. They argue that the system is discriminatory and hinders merit-based recruitment.\n\nClashes between anti-quota demonstrators and members of the student wing of Hasina's Awami League party turned violent this week. Rubber bullets, sound grenades, and tear gas were used to disperse protesters who also blocked railway tracks and major roads.\n\nExperts attribute the unrest to stagnant job growth in the private sector. Public sector jobs, with regular wage hikes and privileges, remain attractive. The quotas limit opportunities for all aspirants based on merit.\n\nNearly 32 million young people in Bangladesh are out of work or education. The economy, once a global growth leader, has stagnated, and inflation remains high.\n\nPrime Minister Hasina, daughter of Bangladesh's founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, faces the first challenge to her government since winning a fourth consecutive term.

The students, who have been demanding an end to quotas for government jobs in Bangladesh, called for a complete nationwide shutdown.\n\nWhat triggered the protest?\n\nThe protests erupted in the wake of a June 5 ruling by the Bangladesh High Court. The ruling reinstated the 30% quota for posts for the descendants of those who participated in the country's 1971 liberation movement. This system was repealed in 2018 after a massive agitation led by students and teachers.\n\nThe protests turned violent this week following clashes between anti-quota demonstrators and members of the student wing of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's Awami League party. Police fired rubber bullets and hurled sound grenades and tear gas to scatter protesters.\n\nWhat is the quota system in Bangladesh?\n\nGovernment jobs in Bangladesh are highly coveted. According to AP, nearly 400,000 graduates compete every year for around 3,000 such jobs.\n\nUntil 2018, 56 per cent of these jobs were reserved for various categories. The majority -- 30 per cent -- were reserved for family members of veterans who had fought for Bangladesh's liberation in 1971. Women and people from underdeveloped districts enjoyed 10 per cent reservation each, members of tribal communities got 5 per cent, and 1 per cent was reserved for persons with disabilities.\n\nThe freedom fighters' quota has drawn flak as many perceive it to be favouring those loyal to Hasina's party, the Awami League. The special examinations for quota candidates, varying age limits for each category, and many vacancies in quota seats even as eligible candidates in the merit list were unemployed were some of the factors that drew criticism.\n\nHasina's jibe\n\n\"Are the children and grandchildren of freedom fighters not talented? Are only the children and grandchildren of the razakars talented?\" Hasina said in a press conference on Sunday.\n\nAre the children and grandchildren of freedom fighters not talented? Are only the children and grandchildren of the razakars talented?\" she said in a press conference on Sunday.\n\nThe Awami League has often referred to its government's critics and dissidents as \"razakars\", evoking the brutal collaborationists who raped and massacred Bengali civilians during the liberation war.\n\nThe protests are the first challenge to Hasina's government since she won a fourth consecutive term in January. She has condemned the loss of lives and called for patience until the Supreme Court delivers its verdict.\n\nMeanwhile, experts also see popular frustration being vented out in the anti-quota agitation.\n\n\"There are artworks, memes, rap songs, and slogans circulating on social media calling Sheikh Hasina a dictator. It was unthinkable previously.

Protests, which have ensued have led to at least six people's death and over 400 injured.\n\nThe protest began after the Bangladesh High Court on June 5 issued a ruling to restore the quota for freedom fighters and their families to 30% for government posts. This quota had however been abolished in 2018 following students and teachers' pressure and protest. The recent ruling revived the issue thus causing massive demonstrations in different parts of the country.\n\nBangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina crossed a line by calling the protesting people 'razakars' term used to describe traitors. This comment escalated the ire of the demonstrators and preceded to make the atmosphere even more tense.\n\nGujarat: Chandipura virus claims life of 4-year-old; 14 more deaths suspected due to virus\n\nThe essence of government jobs in Bangladesh is well understood by knowing the fact that throughout the country the government jobs are much sought after more as they are assured and better paid jobs. Every year, over 4 lakh graduates are in the fray for about nearly 3,000 jobs that are provided by the government. In 2018, 56% of these jobs were reserved for various categories:\n\nThis left only 44% of the positions open for merit-based candidates thereby developing stringent search for jobs among the people. In particular, the freedom fighters' quota was seen as favoring those loyal to the ruling Awami League, adding to the frustration.\n\nIn April 2018, students and teachers staged a four-month-long protest demanding the removal of these quotas and a reduction in overall reservation to 10%. The protests turned violent, involving clashes with the Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL) and the police. Following international attention, PM Hasina announced the removal of all quotas.\n\n'We are united to win': Republican US Senator JD Vance accepts nomination to be Donald Trump's running mate\n\nThe June 2024 High Court decision to reinstate the freedom fighters' quota led to fresh protests, which intensified after Eid-ul-Adha celebrations on June 17. A nationwide Bangla Bandh was declared on July 7, despite the Supreme Court's Appellate Division staying the order's implementation for a month.\n\nProtestors are now demanding the complete removal of discriminatory quotas, limiting reservations to 5% for constitutionally recognized backward populations, and enacting a parliamentary bill to secure these changes. This effectively calls for the elimination of the quota for freedom fighters' families while retaining benefits for the disabled and tribal communities.\n\nIt can be seen that the violence erupted on Monday as anti-quota protestors clashed with BCL members and police at various universities. The clashes resulted in six deaths, including three students, prompting the government to close all educational institutions indefinitely.\n\nHillbilly Elegy author's political move: JD Vance's

As of Thursday, as many as 25 people had been killed, and hundreds more are estimated to have been injured.\n\nThe source of the unrest is a contentious quota hiring system established in 1972, when Bangladesh was reeling from war and had just declared its independence from Pakistan. Under the quota system, 30 percent of highly coveted government jobs are reserved for the descendants of so-called freedom fighters who fought for Bangladesh in the war, while a percentage of other positions are allocated to additional select groups. In total, 56 percent of all positions have traditionally been reserved for members of various groups, including ethnic minorities, women, individuals with disabilities, and people from underrepresented districts.\n\nProtesters want to dismantle this system because they say it is discriminatory and that hiring should be based on merit. Although the country has experienced remarkable economic growth in the decades since independence, it remains one of the world's least developed countries, according to the United Nations, and its post-pandemic recovery has been rocky: Real GDP growth slowed to 5.8 percent in fiscal year 2023, down from 7.1 percent in the previous year, per the World Bank. Government jobs, seen as more stable and better paid than those in the private sector, are highly sought after, with more than 400,000 graduates competing for about 3,000 government jobs each year, Bloomberg reports.\n\nDemonstrators also contend that the quota system favors Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and her supporters, since Hasina's party, the Awami League, spearheaded the country's independence drive. Critics \"believe that the quota system is partisan and meant to ensure sufficient party support within the government, all while reducing the availability of merit-based jobs in a country with high youth unemployment,\" Michael Kugelman wrote in FP's South Asia Brief newsletter.\n\nHasina previously scrapped the system following a wave of protests in 2018, but a top Bangladeshi court restored it last month, sparking the current unrest. In an apparent attempt to appease protesters, Bangladesh's Supreme Court last week suspended the quota system for a month and said it would make a final decision at the end of that period.\n\nHasina has defended the system and accused the country's main opposition parties of fueling the unrest. She deployed paramilitary forces to help police quell the demonstrations in major cities, though she vowed to establish an investigatory judicial committee over the deaths and promised justice for students. Law Minister Anisul Huq said on Thursday that the government was ready to meet with student leaders to find a solution, though he said the final decision would be up to the Supreme Court.\n\nBut demonstrators -- who have threatened to launch a \"complete shutdown\" of the country's transportation systems, businesses, and schools if their demands aren't met -- seem intent on continuing the fight. \"We want a permanent executive order from the government, saying that the quotas are abolished, except some quotas for the disabled and minorities,\" Parvez Mosharraf, a student at Dhaka University, told Dawn last week. The opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party has backed the protesters' call for a shutdown.\n\nDismantling the humanitarian pier. Around two months after the U.S. military installed a $230 million floating pier to send humanitarian aid into the beleaguered Gaza Strip, the operation is coming to an end. Washington will instead focus its humanitarian efforts on delivering aid to Gaza through the Port of Ashdod in Israel, U.S. officials said on Wednesday. \"In the coming weeks, we expect that millions of pounds of aid will enter into Gaza via this new pathway,\" said U.S. Navy Vice Adm. Brad Cooper, the deputy head of U.S. Central Command.\n\nIsrael has heavily restricted the entry of aid into Gaza, prompting the Biden administration -- which was facing pressure to take more action to address the humanitarian crisis there -- to build the pier as a means of rushing additional relief into the territory amid warnings of famine. Yet the operation was beset by a number of logistical, technical, and weather-related challenges, rendering it functional for only around 20 days. In total, 8,100 metric tons of aid reached Gaza through the pier.\n\nSuspended nuclear talks. China has halted arms control and nuclear proliferation talks with the United States as a result of Washington's continued arms sales to Taiwan, China's Foreign Ministry announced on Wednesday. U.S. arms sales to the island \"severely undermine China's core interests and the mutual trust between China and the U.S.,\" said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian. Washington, in response, said Beijing's decision was \"unfortunate\" and \"undermines strategic stability.\"\n\nWashington is Taiwan's biggest arms provider, although Republican presidential candidate and former U.S. President Donald Trump recently told Bloomberg Businessweek that the \"immensely wealthy\" island should pay more for its defense support. \"We're no different than an insurance company,\" he said, yet \"Taiwan doesn't give us anything.\"\n\nTrump's remarks \"highlight a critical open question: What might Trump's approach to Taiwan look like in a second term?\" FP's Lili Pike wrote this week. \"The answer hinges on whether Trump's own America First mentality would dominate over the agenda of the China hawks in his national security orbit who are staunch defenders of Taiwan.\"\n\nLandmark ruling. South Korea's Supreme Court determined on Thursday that same-sex couples are eligible for spousal coverage under the country's national health insurance, in a landmark ruling that was celebrated as a move in the right direction for LGBTQ+ rights in the country. Seoul still does not legally recognize same-sex marriages, although rights groups and activists hope this decision could lay the groundwork for future change.\n\nThe ruling is a \"stepping stone for progress\" for marriage equality, Horim Yi, an activist with the campaign group Marriage for All, told Reuters. \"It's going to be a very hopeful ruling for same-sex couples living in South Korea.\"\n\nTens of thousands of Italians are in an uproar over a decision to rename Milan's international airport after controversial former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. Many of the country's airports are named after famed Italians -- including Leonardo da Vinci; Galileo Galilei; and two anti-Mafia prosecutors, Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino -- but perhaps none who carry as politically divisive a legacy as Berlusconi, who was embroiled in numerous corruption and sex scandals before his death in 2023 at age 86. As of Wednesday, more than 160,000 people had signed a petition to block the designation.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Protesters are demanding their government abolish a quota system that reserves up to 30 per cent of government jobs for families of those who fought for Bangladesh's freedom in the country's 1971 war with Pakistan.\n\nProtesters say the quota is discriminatory and benefits supporters of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's Awami League party, which led the independence movement.\n\n\"It is against humanity. It's a crime,\" Saiful Bhuiyan, the advisor and director of the Bangladesh-Canada Students' Society of Windsor (BCSSW), told CBC Radio's Afternoon Drive.\n\nSix people were killed in Bangladesh on Wednesday and 19 more were killed on Thursday, according to media reports.\n\nBhuiyan has siblings, nieces and nephews who still live in Bangladesh. He says he and other members of the Bangladeshi community in Canada are concerned as they watch the situation play out from afar.\n\n\"Day by day we are frustrated because our brother[s], sister[s] and other people back home, they are now in [a] real crisis situation,\" said Bhuiyan. \"A lot of places are burning.\"\n\nThe BCSSW is holding a peaceful protest at the University of Windsor on Thursday night to show their support for fellow students in Bangladesh and raise awareness about the violence there.\n\n\"We [want] to put our solidarity and our worry all over the world,\" said Bhuiyan. \"We cannot tolerate this type of killing.\"\n\nSimilar protests have taken place internationally in countries like the U.S., according to Bhuiyan. He says he hopes that by adding their voices, protesters here might be able to encourage Canada's government to pressure the Bangladeshi government to listen to the student protesters.\n\nProtest sought to organize \"a complete shutdown\" of Bangladesh on Thursday, except for essential services. This comes after several major universities in the country agreed to shut their doors indefinitely until tensions ease.\n\nOffices and banks opened Thursday, though many malls did not and traffic on usually jammed roads was thin.\n\nProtesters attacked the head office of state-run Bangladesh Television, breaking through a main gate and setting vehicles and the reception area on fire, a news producer and a reporter told The Associated Press by phone.\n\nThe dead on Thursday included a bus driver, a rickshaw-puller and three students according to Reuters.\n\n\"Now they're killing more and more. They are innocent people they are killing,\" said Bhuiyan.\n\nGiven Bangladeshi independence was reached over 50 years ago, Bhuiyan says its mostly grandchildren of the freedom fighters who benefit from the quota system.\n\nBangladesh's prime minister has defended the quota system, saying veterans deserve the highest respect for their contributions to the country's independence.\n\nGovernment jobs in Bangladesh are seen as the most stable and lucrative -- but there's not enough of them to go around. Each year, some 400,000 graduates compete for around 3,000 jobs in the civil service exam.\n\nThe quota was repealed in 2018 but that ruling was nullified last month after relatives of the 1971 veterans filed petitions, sparking the latest round of protests.\n\nThe Supreme Court suspended the decision and will rule on the quota in August.\n\nJobs are also reserved for women, disabled people and members of ethnic minorities under the quota system, but students are primarily protesting against the reservations for veterans' families.\n\nOn Wednesday night, the prime minister, Hasina, encouraged her country to wait for the Supreme Court's verdict.\n\n\"I am requesting all to wait with patience until the verdict is delivered,\" Hasina said in a televised address. \"I believe our students will get justice from the apex court. They will not be disappointed.\"\n\nBhuiyan says that doesn't give him hope, however, because the \"autocratic\" government controls what judges are on the Supreme Court.", "source": {"uri": "cbc.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awami_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Awami League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Liberation_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Liberation War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBC_Radio", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBC Radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_independence_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian independence movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Windsor", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Windsor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Bangladesh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of Bangladesh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistance_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Resistance movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Partition of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minority group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Autocracy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.7268358.1721334411!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/bangladesh-campus-violence.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744480", "eventUri": "eng-9744480", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

This is a rather rocky start to Hasina's fourth straight term in office,\" he said.\n\nA Dhaka journalist who did not wish to be named said the full might of the state has been unleashed on protesters. \"Not just the police but paramilitary forces have deployed to take on protesters, armoured personnel carriers are roaming Dhaka streets. Chhatra League are moving around with machetes and attacking quota protesters,\" they said.\n\nWhat is worse, perhaps, is that Bangladeshi society itself is deeply divided now over which is a better choice: Razakar or a dictator.\n\nAlso Read: Are Bangladesh youth done with 1971 legacy? Anti-quota student protests question old ideas\n\nAnti-quota agitation is not new to Bangladesh. In 2018, after nationwide protests that eventually turned violent, a government circular cancelled quotas for first and second-class jobs. This year, on 5 June, the Bangladesh High Court ruled on a writ petition and said the 2018 circular was illegal. This meant quotas were to be brought back in government recruitments again. While the government appealed against the judgment, protests broke out in Dhaka and outside.\n\nThen, on 14 July, in response to a journalist's question during a presser, Hasina said: \"Why do they [anti-quota protesters] have so much resentment towards the freedom fighters? If the grandchildren of the freedom fighters don't get quota benefits, should the grandchildren of Razakars get them?\"\n\nSahidul Hasan Khokon, member of the International Affairs Sub Committee, Awami League, told ThePrint that protesting students are degrading themselves by identifying as Razakars, even if in retaliation to Hasina's statement. \"The prime minister did not call students Razakars. Her statement has been taken out of context. But the larger point is that such slogans being chanted on the streets by students go against the very foundational ethos of Bangladesh,\" he said.\n\nFor Bangladeshi Hindu Rights activist Joyanta Karmoker some things should not be alluded to even in jest. \"Those who know what happened in 1971 would not raise such slogans. Razakars specifically targeted Hindus during the liberation war, raping and killing them. Even in such trying times, one would expect some sensitivity from protesting students towards fellow citizens of the country,\" Karmoker said.\n\nKarmoker said such slogans are dangerous as it is impossible to know whether there are Razakars among the protesting students. \"It is not as if Razakars are a thing of the past. Last year, Delwar Hussain Sayeedi, a Razakar and a convicted war criminal, died and there was an outpouring of public grief in Bangladesh. It showed there is a pro-Razakar sentiment in certain sections of the society still.\"\n\nAlso Read: Opposition corners Hasina as Awami League MP's gruesome murder sends shockwaves across Dhaka\n\nFor Bangladeshi journalist Avijit Majumder Hridoy, what is more alarming is the fact that protesters are saying it is better to be a Razakar than a dictator. But it's more important to take stock of the situation first, he stressed. \"The violence must stop immediately. Many students have died and such brutal clampdown on students is giving Bangladesh a bad name. We can continue to debate who is a Razakar and who isn't later, but the government must stop targeting students.\"\n\nA Bangladeshi TV news anchor who did not wish to be named said it has become a standard practice for the Hasina administration to harp about 1971 whenever there is a crisis in the country. \"The quota agitation is a result of joblessness. Bangladesh is battling inflation which rose to 9.73 per cent in 2023-24, the highest since 2011-12, and joblessness. The number of unemployed people rose by around 2.4 lakh to 25.9 lakh in the first quarter of 2024, according to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics in May,\" she said.\n\nInstead of addressing these issues, the news anchor added, the government has unleashed brutal violence on protesting students. \"How can Hasina escape the dictator tag when police brutality has become her standard response to any protest?\"\n\nTarique Rehman, acting chairman of Bangladesh Nationalist Party, the country's principal Opposition party, wrote on X that the Hasina government has once again proved \"there is no space for innocent students to express their legitimate demands...I call upon everyone, regardless of party affiliation, to unite against the atrocities of this government.\"\n\nThis is not the first anti-Hasina protest that has rocked Bangladesh in 2024. Soon after she returned to power for a fourth time, a \"Boycott India\" protest on social media and the streets exhorted Bangladeshis to say no to any Indian product. This was a reaction against India for allegedly helping Hasina remain in power through a \"sham election\". The 7 January election raised some uncomfortable questions about the health of Bangladesh's electoral democracy.\n\nAnd now there are these quota protests where many citizens have joined hands with students to condemn police brutality and killings. Hasina needs to control the situation before her country stops asking 'If not Hasina who' and starts chanting 'Anyone but Hasina'.", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ThePrint"}, "authors": [{"uri": "deep_halder@theprint.in", "name": "Deep Halder", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razakar_(Pakistan)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Razakar (Pakistan)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThePrint", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ThePrint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistance_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Resistance movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Floyd protests"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awami_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Awami League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grenade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Chhatra_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Chhatra League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dictator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armoured_personnel_carrier", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Armoured personnel carrier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "High Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machete", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Machete"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tear_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tear gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramilitary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paramilitary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism_in_Bangladesh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hinduism in Bangladesh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Liberation_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Liberation War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "War crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Bureau_of_Statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Nationalist_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Nationalist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static.theprint.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Untitled-design-13-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744480", "eventUri": "eng-9744480", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "textStart": 1151, "textEnd": 1157}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-14", "textStart": 1429, "textEnd": 1436}, {"amb": false, "date": "-01-07", "textStart": 5057, "textEnd": 5066}], "sentiment": -0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

You may opt out at any time.\n\nBangladesh has been grappling with some of its most violent unrest in years as tens of thousands of people participate in university student-led demonstrations against a decades-old quota employment system for government positions.\n\nThe protests, which first erupted on July 1, escalated further this week as protesters clashed with police and counter-protesters in confrontations that sometimes turned deadly. As of Thursday, as many as 25 people had been killed, and hundreds more are estimated to have been injured.\n\nThe source of the unrest is a contentious quota hiring system established in 1972, when Bangladesh was reeling from war and had just declared its independence from Pakistan. Under the quota system, 30 percent of highly coveted government jobs are reserved for the descendants of so-called freedom fighters who fought for Bangladesh in the war, while a percentage of other positions are allocated to additional select groups. In total, 56 percent of all positions have traditionally been reserved for members of various groups, including ethnic minorities, women, individuals with disabilities, and people from underrepresented districts.\n\nProtesters want to dismantle this system because they say it is discriminatory and that hiring should be based on merit. Although the country has experienced remarkable economic growth in the decades since independence, it remains one of the world's least developed countries, according to the United Nations, and its post-pandemic recovery has been rocky: Real GDP growth slowed to 5.8 percent in fiscal year 2023, down from 7.1 percent in the previous year, per the World Bank. Government jobs, seen as more stable and better paid than those in the private sector, are highly sought after, with more than 400,000 graduates competing for about 3,000 government jobs each year, Bloomberg reports.\n\nDemonstrators also contend that the quota system favors Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and her supporters, since Hasina's party, the Awami League, spearheaded the country's independence drive. Critics \"believe that the quota system is partisan and meant to ensure sufficient party support within the government, all while reducing the availability of merit-based jobs in a country with high youth unemployment,\" Michael Kugelman wrote in FP's South Asia Brief newsletter.\n\nHasina previously scrapped the system following a wave of protests in 2018, but a top Bangladeshi court restored it last month, sparking the current unrest. In an apparent attempt to appease protesters, Bangladesh's Supreme Court last week suspended the quota system for a month and said it would make a final decision at the end of that period.\n\nHasina has defended the system and accused the country's main opposition parties of fueling the unrest. She deployed paramilitary forces to help police quell the demonstrations in major cities, though she vowed to establish an investigatory judicial committee over the deaths and promised justice for students. Law Minister Anisul Huq said on Thursday that the government was ready to meet with student leaders to find a solution, though he said the final decision would be up to the Supreme Court.\n\nBut demonstrators -- who have threatened to launch a \"complete shutdown\" of the country's transportation systems, businesses, and schools if their demands aren't met -- seem intent on continuing the fight. \"We want a permanent executive order from the government, saying that the quotas are abolished, except some quotas for the disabled and minorities,\" Parvez Mosharraf, a student at Dhaka University, told Dawn last week. The opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party has backed the protesters' call for a shutdown.\n\nDismantling the humanitarian pier. Around two months after the U.S. military installed a $230 million floating pier to send humanitarian aid into the beleaguered Gaza Strip, the operation is coming to an end. Washington will instead focus its humanitarian efforts on delivering aid to Gaza through the Port of Ashdod in Israel, U.S. officials said on Wednesday. \"In the coming weeks, we expect that millions of pounds of aid will enter into Gaza via this new pathway,\" said U.S. Navy Vice Adm. Brad Cooper, the deputy head of U.S. Central Command.\n\nIsrael has heavily restricted the entry of aid into Gaza, prompting the Biden administration -- which was facing pressure to take more action to address the humanitarian crisis there -- to build the pier as a means of rushing additional relief into the territory amid warnings of famine. Yet the operation was beset by a number of logistical, technical, and weather-related challenges, rendering it functional for only around 20 days. In total, 8,100 metric tons of aid reached Gaza through the pier.\n\nSuspended nuclear talks. China has halted arms control and nuclear proliferation talks with the United States as a result of Washington's continued arms sales to Taiwan, China's Foreign Ministry announced on Wednesday. U.S. arms sales to the island \"severely undermine China's core interests and the mutual trust between China and the U.S.,\" said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian. Washington, in response, said Beijing's decision was \"unfortunate\" and \"undermines strategic stability.\"\n\nWashington is Taiwan's biggest arms provider, although Republican presidential candidate and former U.S. President Donald Trump recently told Bloomberg Businessweek that the \"immensely wealthy\" island should pay more for its defense support. \"We're no different than an insurance company,\" he said, yet \"Taiwan doesn't give us anything.\"\n\nTrump's remarks \"highlight a critical open question: What might Trump's approach to Taiwan look like in a second term?\" FP's Lili Pike wrote this week. \"The answer hinges on whether Trump's own America First mentality would dominate over the agenda of the China hawks in his national security orbit who are staunch defenders of Taiwan.\"\n\nLandmark ruling. South Korea's Supreme Court determined on Thursday that same-sex couples are eligible for spousal coverage under the country's national health insurance, in a landmark ruling that was celebrated as a move in the right direction for LGBTQ+ rights in the country. Seoul still does not legally recognize same-sex marriages, although rights groups and activists hope this decision could lay the groundwork for future change.\n\nThe ruling is a \"stepping stone for progress\" for marriage equality, Horim Yi, an activist with the campaign group Marriage for All, told Reuters. \"It's going to be a very hopeful ruling for same-sex couples living in South Korea.\"\n\nTens of thousands of Italians are in an uproar over a decision to rename Milan's international airport after controversial former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. Many of the country's airports are named after famed Italians -- including Leonardo da Vinci; Galileo Galilei; and two anti-Mafia prosecutors, Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino -- but perhaps none who carry as politically divisive a legacy as Berlusconi, who was embroiled in numerous corruption and sex scandals before his death in 2023 at age 86.

The January elections were marred by an opposition boycott, but the challenge the government faces this month comes from university students with no apparent political affiliation.\n\nThe students have been protesting since the beginning of July, demanding an end to a quota system for government jobs that allocates 56% to applicants from special categories and the remaining 44% to general applicants. That, students say, discriminates against most applicants with the required qualifications.\n\nThe protests turned deadly Thursday as the students enforced a country-wide shutdown, triggering widespread clashes with police that have left at least 19 dead and scores wounded. The deaths follow violence on Tuesday when at least six people were killed.\n\nSome media outlets put the death toll much higher.\n\nObservers and media reports put the blame for much of the violence on the police and the Bangladesh Chhatra League or BCL, the student wing of Hasina's ruling Awami League party.\n\nThe government is reeling from an economic crisis, with increasing costs of living hitting ordinary households hard, said political analyst Mushtuq Hussain.\n\nLingering public discontent over the elections, recent revelations of massive corruption in high places and on-going strikes by public university teachers over pension provisions have combined to make it a perfect storm for Hasina.\n\n\"The student movement has spread, and various groups seem to have become involved in this, which is turning into the most serious and widespread political challenge this government has faced,\" Hussain told VOA in an interview.\n\nHussain, a former general secretary of the Dhaka University Central Students Union, said the government appears to have branded agitating students as their enemy and painted them in a political color. Hussain said the government has miscalculated badly, by thinking the students' movement could be suppressed through violence.\n\n\"The government is already using violence against the protesters and if opposition political parties get involved in the violence, then the situation will spin out of everyone's control,\" Hussain warned.\n\nThe initial student protests over job quotas took place in 2018 when students urged the government to cancel the 30% reservations for the grandchildren of veterans of Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971.\n\nIn the early years following independence, the quotas were reserved for war veterans themselves, then expanded to include their children in 1997 and grandchildren in 2010.\n\nStudents argued that was clearly discriminatory and needed to change.\n\nHasina initially resisted their demands, but then took everyone by surprise by scrapping the entire quota system - including the reservations for women, minorities and disabled people. There were protests from civil society groups who called for reform of the quotas, rather than outright cancellation, but the government remained unmoved, and the agitation died down.\n\nTrouble reared its head again in June 2024, when a group of people, including relatives of war veterans, went to the High Court and challenged the government's 2018 order to cancel the quotas. The court ruled that the government order was illegal and restored the quotas in their entirety.\n\nThe government appealed the High Court ruling, and several students took the matter to the Supreme Court. The quota case has now moved to the top court, where judges have urged students to wait for them to issue a ruling. But the agitation has continued, as student leaders fear that the whole court saga is a government ploy to have the quotas restored.\n\n\"We don't want quotas, any type of quotas,\" one of the leaders of the movement Mohiuddin Roni told VOA. \"Minorities and other marginalized communities should come and join us, and we can discuss how to minimize the quotas.\"\n\nQuotas in government jobs are not new in Bangladesh - they have existed since the days of British colonial rule, to ensure fair representation of regions, women, ethnic minorities, etc. But young people are now forcefully questioning a system that they see as depriving them of opportunities.\n\n\"This young generation has become victims of jobless growth ... the economy shows growth, but jobs are not created,\" professor of economics Anu Muhammad wrote in the local Daily Star newspaper. \"The total uncertainty in getting jobs ... created frustration and anger among the students.\"\n\nSix years after the original movement, the student anger against the quota system appears to have remained as strong as before. Thousands have taken to the streets, setting up blockades, disrupting traffic in cities and on highways and battling both police and BCL activists.\n\nTo put a lid on the unrest, public universities around the country shut their campuses and ordered students residing in college dormitories to vacate the premises. Sensing the gravity of the situation, Hasina took to the airways and addressed the nation Wednesday.\n\nShe acknowledged the serious nature of the violence and promised a judicial inquiry into the killings. But she was noncommittal on the central issue of the unrest.\n\n\"I am urging everyone to be patient until the Supreme Court delivers its judgment on the issue. I am sure the student community will get justice from the highest court; they will not be disappointed,\" Hasina said.\n\nHussain said Hasina appeared to have toned down her rhetoric, but she did not announce any step to reform the quota system, which is the core demand of the students. This was a missed opportunity, he said.\n\n\"This government is hugely experienced; it is a political government and knows how to defuse a situation. If it does not move quickly and the violence spreads further, then the country's education system, democracy, everything will come under threat,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "voanews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "VOA Voice of America"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awami_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Awami League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Chhatra_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Chhatra League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Civil_Law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bachelor of Civil Law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Bangladesh", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of Bangladesh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_reservation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian reservation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Voice of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_living", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cost of living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Great Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Secretary_of_the_Chinese_Communist_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_of_South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Union of South Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Dhaka", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Dhaka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Liberation_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Liberation War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "High Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_university", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public university"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_activism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Student activism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_society", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pension", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pension"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anu_Muhammad", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anu Muhammad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British Empire"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://gdb.voanews.com/1B37256E-C326-4C8D-BF96-A89146BC9D1E.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744480", "eventUri": "eng-9744480", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4823529411764705, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

What began as a protest over job quotas has rapidly transformed into a broader movement against perceived government injustice and authoritarianism.\n\nDespite the Supreme Court's intervention, the protests escalated following Prime Minister Hasina's derogatory remarks, labeling the protesters as \"Razakar,\" an offensive term for collaborators with Pakistan during the independence war. This insult galvanized students from various districts, schools, colleges, and universities, who then called for nationwide marches and rallies.\n\nAs the situation deteriorated, students who had not initially joined the protests began to participate, driven by the government's blatant negligence and violent response towards the protesters. Historically, similar protests had failed as the government repeatedly used the BCL to silence dissent. However, this time, the movement gained momentum as students from various schools, universities, and educational institutions across the country united in protest.\n\nIn an attempt to control the situation, the government has cut off media coverage and blocked social media platforms like Facebook. Despite these efforts, the protests have continued to grow. The regime has also shut down cellular networks, the internet, and fixed landlines, plunging Bangladesh into a total communication blackout.\n\nThe protests have evolved into a symbol of resistance against what many see as a repressive and dictatorial regime. The initial call for the restoration of merit-based job distribution has transformed into widespread demands for systemic change, highlighting the deep-seated frustrations of a generation facing unemployment, corruption, and government indifference.

A court decision in June 2024 brought back the 30% quota for children and grandchildren of war veterans. This reversed the 2018 abolition of that specific quota.\n\nThis reinstatement sparked major protests by students who believe the quota system is unfair. They're demanding reforms or a complete shift to a merit-based system. The protests have turned violent, with a reported death toll of 25 so far!\n\nThe government, which ignored the students movement based on a valid ground at the initial stage, is now offering negotiation talks but the agitated students rejected it.\n\nThe government also appealed against the court order, and as of today, a status quo is in place, meaning the quota system isn't officially implemented but the court decision hasn't been overturned either.\n\nThe quota reform movement has gained significant support from expatriate Bangladeshi students, and has been a major issue of public interest and political discourse. Students abroad have organized processions and rallies to extend their support to the movement to drew international support and attention to the issue.\n\nExpatriate students leverage social media platforms to disseminate information, share updates, and coordinate actions. They engage with international human rights organizations, foreign governments, and global media to gain support. Fundraising efforts by expatriate communities help sustain the movement financially, covering costs for protests, legal fees, and other organizational needs. These efforts aim to pressure the Bangladeshi government by raising the issue in the global arena.\n\nThe involvement of expatriate students has added a unique dimension to the movement, highlighting the solidarity and active engagement of the Bangladeshi diaspora on national issues. This global support network amplifies pressure on the government and underscores the widespread demand for reform beyond national borders.\n\nThe protest, which began as a peaceful demonstration, has now turned violent, with clashes between protesters and police together with ruling party supporters leading to deaths, injuries and destroying public properties. The question is, who is to blame for this terrible situation? The government has failed to tackle the crisis. Initially, they dismissed the student's logical arguments. The government's delayed and inappropriate response and the suicidal move to engage ruling party leaders and activists exacerbated the situation, leading to the huge casualties.\n\nThe government also blames the opposition, claiming they have hijacked the movement. However, the real question is, who created the opportunity for the opposition to take the benefit of the students movement.? Once again, the answer would be the government. If the government had handled the crisis appropriately, no third party would have been able to get involved. Now, it is the government who will have to find the an amicable solution to the crisis.\n\nTime is running out, and the government has missed the opportunity to act. The responsibility will go to the government in case of failure to resolve the crisis and restore congenial atmosphere in the country.\n\nBackground\n\nIn 1972, Bangladesh, newly independent country from Pakistan, introduced a quota system for government jobs. The primary goal was to acknowledge the sacrifices made by the \"freedom fighters\" and their families during the 1971 War of Independence. The quota system reserved 30% for freedom fighters' kin, 10% for war-affected women, 40% for regional (district quota) quotas, leaving 20% for merit-based recruitment.\n\nThe quota system has adjusted the allocation percentages throughout its history and by 2018, A whopping 56% of government job openings were reserved under various quotas. 30% for freedom fighter kin, 10% for women, 10% for regional quotas, and 5% for minorities and 1% for disabled.\n\nIn 2018, the government abolished quotas for certain government jobs following protests demanding reform. Large-scale student protests erupted due to concerns about limited opportunities for merit-based recruitment. Students felt the existing quota system, with over 50% of positions reserved, left them disadvantaged despite high qualifications.\n\nIn response to the protests, the government issued a circular in 2018 that abolished quotas for certain government job positions. This was a significant move aimed at appeasing the protesters and potentially creating a more meritocratic system. The abolition of quotas only applied to specific government jobs, not the entire system. This move wasn't universally popular.

The AFP news agency reports 32 deaths in the last 24 hours alone, bringing to 39 the total death toll in the unrest that began on 7 July. Clashes are reported in at least 26 districts, almost half of the country's districts.\n\nStudents responded to the harsh police repression by setting fire to several government offices in a chain of violence. Among the buildings set on fire in Dhaka was the headquarters of the state broadcaster Bangladesh Television, from whose frequencies Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina had made an appeal to the nation. The security forces themselves complain of assaults on their vehicles and say they will use every means to restore order. There is a lot of concern about the interruption of telecommunications, which makes it impossible to get a clear picture of the situation: even local news sites are inaccessible.\n\nAs we wrote a few days ago, the protest started from the issue of public recruitment - tens of thousands of jobs in a country of 170 million inhabitants - in which a 30% quota is still reserved for the descendants of the combatants in the war of liberation from Pakistan in 1971, as well as for the protection of minorities and the disabled. An issue that remains hot in a country where the premier is still the daughter of Mujibur Rahman, the founding father and first president of Bangladesh.\n\nThis protest by the students is intertwined with the discontent that has been simmering in the country for some time over the increasingly authoritarian character assumed by Hasina's government. There had already been strong tensions at the end of last year with the unheeded demand of the opposition for a 'super partes' government to manage the elections held on 7 January. A vote that saw for the fourth consecutive time the reconfirmation of Sheikh Hasina's Awami League, but with a massive boycott of the polls by movements linked to the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, the main antagonist force, whose leader Khaleda Zia has been under arrest since 2018 on corruption charges. International observers and some Western governments have also accused the Dhaka government of using security laws to gag any form of dissent.\n\nThe issue of quotas, therefore, has become the catalyst for the opposition to Sheikh Hasina in recent hours. And the premier's accusation that the students are 'ghosts of the Razakars', the Pakistani army collaborators in the 1971 war, has further inflamed tempers. But the internal balance in Bangladesh - especially the question of the protection of Hindu, Buddhist and Christian minorities in a country with an overwhelming Muslim majority - remains an extremely delicate issue. And as we reminded AsiaNews a few days ago on theeighth anniversary of the Dhaka massacre, Islamic radicalism remains a latent threat that could find an important ally in the country's chaos and violence.", "source": {"uri": "asianews.it", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asia News.it"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications", "type": "wiki",

According to AP, nearly 400,000 graduates compete every year for around 3,000 such jobs.\n\nUntil 2018, 56 per cent of government jobs were reserved for various categories. The majority -- 30 per cent -- were reserved for family members of veterans who had fought for Bangladesh's liberation in 1971. Women and people from underdeveloped districts enjoyed 10 per cent reservation each, members of tribal communities got 5 per cent, and 1 per cent was reserved for persons with disabilities. This left only 44 per cent of all openings available for open admission.\n\nThe freedom fighters' quota was particularly contentious since many people perceived it to be favouring those loyal to Hasina's party, the Awami League, which headed the Bangladeshi liberation struggle. Adding to people's frustrations were the special examinations for quota candidates, varying age limits for each category, and the fact that there remained many vacancies in quota seats even as eligible candidates in the merit list were unemployed.\n\nA court ruling, and massive protests\n\nOn June 5, 2024, the High Court Division of the Bangladesh Supreme Court ordered the overturning of the 2018 order repealing all reservations, particularly the contentious 30 per cent freedom fighters' quota.\n\nWhile early resistance made itself known in Dhaka in June, larger protests picked up after Eid-ul-Adha festivities ended on June 17. The country-wide Bangla Bandh came into effect on July 7, even as the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court stayed the implementation of the order for a month.\n\nProtestors have this time demanded the removal of discriminatory quotas from all grades, to limit the overall reservation to 5 per cent for backward populations as identified in the constitution, and to pass a bill in parliament to secure this change. In effect, this amounts to a removal of the quota empowering the families of freedom fighters, while retaining quota benefits for physically disabled and tribal people.\n\nProtests took a violent turn on Monday with clashes between the anti-quota protestors, and the BCL and police at various universities across the country. At least six persons, including three students, were killed, prompting the indefinite closure of all educational institutes across Bangladesh. The higher secondary certificate exam, scheduled to be held on Thursday, has also been cancelled. The Border Guard has been deployed at various locations across the country.\n\nSt\u00e9phane Dujarric, the spokesperson for the United Nations Secretary-General on Tuesday implored the Bangladesh government to seek a peaceful resolution, and to recognise the right of the protestors to demonstrate peacefully.\n\nHasina's razakar jibe\n\nSo far, however, Hasina has done little to calm things down. Instead, her comments have only made the situation worse.\n\n\"Are the children and grandchildren of freedom fighters not talented? Are only the children and grandchildren of the razakars talented?\" she said in a press conference on Sunday.\n\nOver the years, the Awami League, Hasina's party, has often referred to its government's critics and dissidents as 'razakars', evoking the brutal collaborationists who raped and massacred Bengali civilians during the liberation war.\n\nThe razakars, literally \"volunteers\", were a paramilitary force set up by General Tikka Khan in 1971 to facilitate Islamabad's control of East Pakistan, and curb the ongoing liberation movement, headed by the Awami League. Working alongside the Pakistani armed forces, the collaborationist razakars were behind some of the worst atrocities perpetrated during the war.\n\nIn Bangladeshi memory, these collaborators are remembered with greater resentment than even the Pakistani Army and bureaucracy. However, following Hasina's razakar jibe -- and this is not the first time she has spoken on these lines -- protestors attempted to sarcastically co-opt the term. \"Who are you? Who am I? Razakar, razakar!\" echoing across the protests. Another slogan went, \"Chaite gelam odhikar, bone galam razakar\" (lose translation: \"We are being called traitors for asking for our rights\")\n\nThis in turn has spurred the BCL, with police support, to violently crack down on protestors. Things have gone further south since then.\n\nHasina is set to address the nation today evening at 7 pm BST.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian

Hundreds more were wounded.\n\nPolice sources say two persons were slain in Narayanganj, a city just southeast of Dhaka.\n\nIn Chittagong - officially known as Chattogram - in eastern Bangladesh, two more deaths were reported.\n\nWitnesses told media that police used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse protestors who were torching vehicles, police posts and other enterprises in Dhaka.\n\nZunaid Ahmed Palak, the junior information technology minister, said mobile internet had been \"temporarily suspended\" owing to \"various rumours\" and the \"unstable situation created\" on social media.\n\nServices would be restored once the situation returned to normal, he added.\n\nHours later, other Bangladeshi news websites, including The Daily Star and Dhaka Tribune, appear to remain down.\n\nTwo days before, internet service providers had disabled access to Facebook, the demonstrators' primary organising tool.\n\nOutgoing Ambassador of the European Union to Bangladesh Charles Whiteley called for a quick resolution of the present situation. \"All friends and partners of Bangladesh want to see a quick resolution of the present situation and the avoidance of further violence and bloodshed,\" he said.\n\nThe US embassy here has issued a \"demonstration alert\" for its citizens living in Dhaka and across the country saying the situation is extremely volatile.\n\nThe unrest began on July 1, when university students hit the streets demanding the scrapping of quotas in government jobs.\n\nLast month, the High Court reinstated a rule that provides for reservation of 30 percent of the posts for children and grandchildren of those who took part in the country's liberation war against Pakistan in 1971.\n\nAccording to reports, around 56 percent of government jobs are now reserved for various categories of citizens in the South Asian nation which has a high unemployment rate.\n\nUNI AKS", "source": {"uri": "uniindia.com", "dataType": "news",

Discontent toward Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has grown following her fourth reelection this year, in a campaign that was largely considered rigged and was marked by violence. Now, protesters openly refer to her as a dictator and an autocrat, and the demonstrations reflect a \"perfect storm of political and economic grievance.\"\n\nStudents frustrated with Bangladesh's rocky post-pandemic economy and high youth unemployment rate, which reached 16% in 2022, say the quotas deprive them of highly-sought after government work; more than 40,000 graduates are competing for only around 3,000 public sector jobs. \"Many students go through the bitter experience of not finding the jobs they deserve after completing their education,\" a professor wrote in Bangladeshi outlet Daily Star.\n\nIf the unrest continues at this scale, Bangladesh's already struggling economy could suffer major consequences from the disruption to public services and businesses.

Media reports detail the unlawful use of force by the state against the demonstrators. Human rights watchdogs report that several people have been killed and many others have been injured.\n\nImages of injured protesters are being widely shared on social media platforms. These pictures evoke strong condemnation of the Sheikh Hasina regime. There are fears that the student wing of the ruling party is being encouraged to confront the protesters. The establishment is desperate to reduce the matter to a case of 'law and order.' The establishment-backed media are attempting to propagate the narrative of a clash between pro-quota and anti-quota student groups while defending the criminal actions of state authorities.\n\nWhile more details of the police crackdown may emerge soon, and the exact number of protesters killed and injured may be ascertained, many facts are beyond doubt. First, the clash has been fuelled by the fight over limited government jobs due to massive privatization. It is a hard fact that the Bangladeshi economy cannot generate employment or address the legitimate demands of the student community due to its pro-rich economic policy. The Awami League government, led by Sheikh Hasina, has failed to provide relief to the people. As a result, it is becoming increasingly unpopular. However, the illegitimacy of the ruling establishment is evident not only in Bangladesh. Such a phenomenon is also witnessed elsewhere in South Asia.\n\nUnfortunately, authoritarian tendencies and sectarian politics are weakening democracy from Dhaka to New Delhi. Ruling establishments across South Asia, instead of addressing the issues, are attempting to divide the people through concocted conflicts. In our region, narratives of Hindus versus Muslims and national versus anti-national are being propagated by the Hindu-right regime, while the current Bangladeshi establishment is attempting to foment polarization between freedom fighters and razakars (traitors). The term 'razakar' is an Urdu word that means volunteer. In Bangladesh, opponents of the Awami League were pejoratively called razakars for allegedly supporting Pakistan-backed militias.\n\nReviving her pet narrative, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has recently called the protesting students razakars. Instead of listening to the protestors, she chose to dismiss them and treat dissent as a crime. The world condemns the use of such divisive language in the strongest terms. Who will tell Sheikh Hasina that she is the leader of 170 million Bangladeshi citizens? She has taken an oath to treat all citizens without discrimination. She must not forget that raking up past horror would only weaken the present. Whatever happened during the Bangladesh Liberation War is a part of history and that cannot be a ground to judge a person who was not born at that moment.\n\nConsider the example of British India. Many of the police officers and civil servants who worked for the British Raj until August 14/15, 1947, were considered freedom fighters disloyal to the Raj and criminals. However, the independent governments, headed by freedom fighters, did not attempt to take revenge on the officers. Nor was any attempt made to punish their children for the loyalty of their parents to the British Raj. Similarly, many supporters of the Congress and the Muslim League changed their loyalty after Partition and were not punished for their past associations. Similarly, the trope of the freedom fighters versus razakars can be useful for the ruling party to gain votes. But it cannot take Bangladesh as a nation to a big height. The sooner such a divisive narrative is buried, the better it will be for Bangladesh as a nation.\n\nThe reason why I cannot uphold the politics around divisive and emotive issues is because it hides the real fault lines in society. This is not to say that politics should become bereft of ideology. In fact, conflict, not cooperation, is a bigger reality of a property-based society. No one can deny that there is a fundamental conflict between the interests of the workers and the owners of all the resources. Similarly, in the South Asian context, caste, far more than religion, is the basis for the distribution of status, power, and wealth. Gender disparity, too, should also be a key factor in our analysis.\n\nBut it is also seen that the ruling party, which serves the dominant interests of society, always tries to hide the axis of inequality and discrimination. To hide them from the public discourse, imaginary issues and warring groups are created. It appears that the policy of giving 30 percent reservation to the families of the freedom fighters is a method to perpetuate the narrative of freedom fighters versus traitors discourse in Bangladesh. In this context, the protesting students are justified in opposing the 30 percent quota for the families of the freedom fighters. It is because no scientific study can show that the families of the freedom fighters are under-represented in Bangladesh and are historically, socially, and educationally marginalized.\n\nEvidence suggests that the recent decision of the Bangladesh Court to uphold the 30 percent reservation was taken under political pressure. For, Sheikh Hasina, who is facing a big crisis of legitimacy, hopes to consolidate her support base by introducing a quota system for the family of the freedom fighters. She is quite aware of the fact that it would definitely be opposed by those who have not got the status of freedom fighters. However, she believes that the lingering controversy would create a sharp division in society. She hopes that such a polarization would draw their alienated supporters back to the Awami League. That is why it lends credence to the allegation that the student wing of the ruling party is given state protection to attack the protestors.\n\nHowever, as the global community watches the brute use of power, her game plan seems to have backfired. Her statement shows that she is feeling anxious and getting nervous in the wake of the wider condemnation against her government. The use of force against the student community has dented her image of being a \"liberal\" face among Bangladeshi politicians.\n\nWhile expressing my solidarity with the protestors against the illogical quota, let me also make it clear that I am not comfortable with the language of \"meritocracy\" emerging within the protesting groups. It is true that my assumption is based on media reports as I could not have access to protestors. However, I have read in the newspapers that protestors are demanding that \"merit\" should be followed in the allocation of jobs and that the quota should be kept to a \"minimum\" level. Both these arguments appear to be elitist in nature.\n\nThere should not be any confusion that the basic goal of affirmative action, including reserving seats in educational institutes and employment, is to ensure proportional and effective representation of historically, socially, and educationally marginalized communities including minorities. Merit or poverty cannot be grounds to fix a quota for any particular person or section.\n\nThe reason why I do not accept the merit logic is because merit is a trope invented by the elites and socially dominant classes and castes. The language of merit is employed to instil a sense of inferiority among the weaker sections and to deny them equal opportunities. The elite sections often repeat the term merit every day but no one has ever given a definition of merit that is acceptable to all. For example, who is considered meritorious in Bangladesh? Is he a person good at English? Or a candidate who can speak fluent Bangla? Or an Adivasi who can only speak her own language and knows very little of English or Bangla? If public examinations were conducted in the Adivasi language, all those proficient in English and Bangla would fail.\n\nFor me, only the marginalized communities, including minorities and indigenous communities, deserve to be given reservations. The marginalization can be defined by an objective study and it should not be left to the whim of any particular leader. While the principle of equal opportunity should be given to all, historically, socially, and educationally marginalized social groups can be included in decision-making by ensuring proportionate and effective representation. That is why, although some members of the dominant groups are found to be poor, they do not deserve to get reservations. This is because their social group is not underrepresented. The state, apart from the reservation, is within the ambit of the democratic Constitution to make welfare policies for economically poor people.\n\nAs is evident here, the logic of reservation is so simple to grasp, yet so much confusion has been created around it by the elites. Reservation is one of the means to achieve social justice in society. The principle of social justice is indispensable in a stratified society. Even official figures say that Bangladesh, like other countries in South Asia, is a highly unequal society. A handful of people, who are ranked higher in status and possess a large share of resources, use all kinds of unfair means to check the entry of the marginalized into the process of decision-making. That is why, seats are reserved to ensure the entry of the marginalized groups into the process of policy-making.\n\nDr. B.R. Ambedkar, who was elected from Jessore and Khulna constituencies from undivided Bengal, now part of Bangladesh on the eve of Partition or the creation of Pakistan, has fought for proportionate and effective representation of minorities throughout his life. His definition of minorities was much broader as it included both religious and historically and socially marginalized groups. Speaking on the last day of India's Constituent Assembly on November 25, 1949, Dr. Ambedkar, the drafting chairman of the Constitution, underscored the indispensability of representation in any democracy in the following words: \"Because I feel, however good a Constitution may be, it is sure to turn out bad because those who are called to work it, happen to be a bad lot. However bad a Constitution may be, it may turn out to be good if those who are called to work it, happen to be a good lot. The working of a Constitution does not depend wholly upon the nature of the Constitution. The Constitution can provide only the organs of the state such as the Legislature, the Executive, and the Judiciary. The factors on which the working of those organs of the State depend are the people and the political parties they will set up as their instruments to carry out their wishes and their politics.\"\n\nAt this critical moment, democratic forces stand in solidarity with the protestors against the illogical freedom fighter quota because such a social group is a creation of political elites desperate to gain political mileage. That is why there is no substantive evidence to show that the freedom fighter category as a social group is historically, socially, and educationally discriminated against. No doubt, they suffered a lot during the Liberation Movement. The principle of justice demands that they should be rehabilitated and properly compensated.\n\nBut such solidarity is not unconditional. Our solidarity cannot go along with those protestors who are opposing the quota in the language of merit. Similarly, the logic of a \"minimum\" quota coined by some protestors is also not democratic. Instead, the protestors should immediately give up such elitist tendencies and firmly uphold the proportionate and effective representation of all marginalized communities.", "source": {"uri": "sabrangindia.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "SabrangIndia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awami_League", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Awami League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razakars_(Hyderabad)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Razakars (Hyderabad)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistance_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Resistance movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Raj", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "British Raj"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruling_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ruling party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_reservation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indian reservation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_exclusion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social exclusion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sectarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sectarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Liberation_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Liberation War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Urdu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pejorative", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pejorative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privatization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Privatization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Militia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caste", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caste"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Authoritarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Partition of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-India_Muslim_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-India Muslim League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_opportunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Equal opportunity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal_Presidency", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bengal Presidency"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._R._Ambedkar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "B.

Worse, communication lines were disrupted and Internet was shut down nationwide.\n\nThe quotas have caused anger among students who face high youth unemployment rates, with nearly 32 million young Bangladeshis not in work or education out of a total population of 170 million people.", "source": {"uri": "khaleejtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Khaleej times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@khaleejtimes.com", "name": "Agence France-Presse", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka_Medical_College_and_Hospital", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka Medical College and Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Floyd protests"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladeshis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangladeshis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expatriate", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Expatriate"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://image.khaleejtimes.com?uuid=2c53702d-5f06-59eb-82a6-7404f56ec03f&function=cropresize&type=preview&source=false&q=75&crop_w=0.99999&crop_h=0.8427&width=1200&height=675&x=1.0E-5&y=0.1573.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744480", "eventUri": "eng-9744480", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 820, "textEnd": 826}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 1117, "textEnd": 1124}], "sentiment": -0.5294117647058824, "wgt": 106, "relevance": 1}

Main opposition groups boycotted those polls.\n\nThere were varying reports of the number of people killed Friday, with Independent Television reporting 17 dead and Somoy TV reporting 30. An Associated Press reporter saw 23 bodies at Dhaka Medical College and Hospital, but it was not immediately clear whether they had all died on Friday.\n\nA death toll of 22 people was reported on Thursday, in what had so far been the bloodiest day of demonstrations, according to local media, as protesting students attempted to impose a \"complete shutdown\" of the country.\n\nAuthorities could not be reached immediately to confirm figures for the deaths.\n\nThe chaos has highlighted cracks in Bangladesh's governance and economy and the frustration of young graduates who face a lack of good jobs.\n\nThe government has deployed police and paramilitary forces across the capital to lock down campuses and break up protests. On Wednesday, universities, including the country's largest, suspended classes and closed dormitories, and on Friday police in Dhaka said they were banning all gatherings and demonstrations in the capital.\n\nAn AP reporter saw border guard officials fire at a crowd of more than 1,000 protesters who had gathered outside the head office of state-run Bangladesh Television, which was attacked and set on fire by protesters the previous day.\n\nThe border guards shot at the crowd with rifles and sound grenades, while police officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets. Bullets littered the streets, which were also marked by smears of blood.\n\nInternet services and mobile data were widely disrupted Thursday night and remained down Friday in the capital, Dhaka. Social media platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp were also not loading. It coincided with a widespread internet outage on Friday that disrupted flights, banks, media outlets, and companies around the world, but the disruptions in Bangladesh were substantially greater than seen elsewhere.\n\nA statement from the country's Telecommunication Regulatory Commission said it was unable to ensure service after its data center was attacked Thursday by demonstrators, who set fire to some equipment. The AP was not able to independently verify this.\n\nStudent protesters said they will extend their calls to impose a shutdown on Friday as well and urged mosques across the country to hold funeral prayers for those who have been killed. Major universities have said they will close their doors until tensions ease.\n\nThe protesters are demanding an end to a quota system that reserves up to 30% of government jobs for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971 against Pakistan.\n\nThey argue the system is discriminatory and benefits supporters of Hasina, whose Awami League party led the independence movement, and they want it replaced with a merit-based system.\n\nBut Hasina has defended the quota system, saying that veterans deserve the highest respect for their contributions to the war regardless of their political affiliation.\n\nThe Bangladeshi leader is credited for bringing stable growth to Bangladesh, but rising inflation -- thanks in part to the global upheaval sparked by the war in Ukraine -- has triggered labor unrest and dissatisfaction with the government.\n\nEven though job opportunities have grown in some parts of the private sector, many people prefer government jobs because they are seen as more stable and lucrative. But there aren't enough to go around -- each year, some 400,000 graduates compete for around 3,000 jobs in the civil service exam.\n\n\"What is unfolding in Bangladesh is deeply unsettling for a generation that only asked for a fair opportunity in public service recruitment,\" said Saad Hammadi, a freedom of speech advocate with the Canada-based Balsillie School of International Affairs. \"That a peaceful protest against a state policy would slip into the peak of lawlessness shows the government's lack of farsightedness and inefficient policy governance,\" Hammadi said.\n\n\"The internet shutdown makes matters worse. Local news sites are inaccessible, and people in the country are left incommunicado with the rest of the world all in the pretext of conducting sweeping operations by the state that have often resulted in serious human rights violations,\" he added in an email.\n\nBangladesh has previously shut down internet services in areas affected by protests, using it as a measure to suppress dissent by opposition parties. Internet watchdog Access Now said it recorded three shutdowns in the country in 2023 -- all of which overlapped with opposition rallies and were limited in scope to one city or district. That came after six shutdowns in 2022.\n\nCIVICUS, a nonprofit that tracks civic freedoms around the world, last year downgraded Bangladesh to \"closed,\" the worst rating that it could assign, along with China and Venezuela, following a crackdown on the country's opposition members and supporters ahead of its national election.\n\nThe main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party has backed the protesting students and vowed to organize its own demonstrations, and many of its supporters have joined in the students' demonstrations. On Friday, police fired tear gas at a few hundred BNP supporters and arrested senior BNP leader Ruhul Kabir Rizvi.\n\nThe Awami League and the BNP have often accused each other of fueling political chaos and violence, most recently ahead of the country's national election, which was marred by a crackdown on several opposition figures while Hasina's government accused the party of attempting to disrupt the vote.\n\nHasina's government had earlier halted the job quotas following mass student protests in 2018, but last month, Bangladesh's High Court nullified that decision and reinstated the quotas after relatives of the 1971 veterans filed petitions, triggering the latest demonstrations.\n\nThe Supreme Court has suspended that ruling pending an appeal hearing and said in a statement it will take up the issue Sunday.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh",

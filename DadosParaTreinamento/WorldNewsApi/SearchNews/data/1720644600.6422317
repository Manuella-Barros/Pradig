{"id": 231232288, "title": "The best thrillers to watch on Netflix this June", "text": "Summer is heating up, even as the box office cools down. You want to stay home and watch a movie this weekend instead, right? Each month, we hand-pick a few thrillers on Netflix that feel right for that time of year. Maybe there\u2019s a connection with a new release. Maybe it\u2019s good summer viewing. Maybe it\u2019s new on Netflix. Or maybe it\u2019s just that good. This month\u2019s selections include a new shark movie, a thriller comedy new on Netflix, and a standout Liam Neeson thriller from the creator of The Queen\u2019s Gambit and Monsieur Spade. Director: Scott FrankCast: Liam Neeson, Dan Stevens, Boyd Holbrook This dark neo-noir is a bright spot in Liam Neeson\u2019s late-career swerve to action and action-centric thrillers. He plays a retired NYPD detective who now works as a private investigator. When he\u2019s hired to investigate a brutal murder case, he\u2019s pulled into a dark web of crime and conspiracy. Based on Lawrence Block\u2019s novel, it\u2019s the rare Neeson action (or action-adjacent) vehicle that actually allows the Oscar-nominated actor to flex his acting chops. Neeson\u2019s Matt Scudder is troubled, but determined... and you really don\u2019t want to mess with him. Add in an appealing supporting cast with Dan Stevens, Boyd Holbrook, and David Harbour, and you have a modernized throwback of a detective movie. There are some reasons that A Walk Among the Tombstones is relevant this year: Director Scott Frank (The Queen\u2019s Gambit) recently partnered with Clive Owen for another PI throwback in the AMC Plus show Monsieur Spade. Frank also co-wrote Logan, which I guess is relevant again with Deadpool & Wolverine around the corner. And it\u2019s been a summer of Dan Stevens, with Abigail, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, and Cuckoo all coming out this year. A content warning: This movie is, in part, about sexual violence, and deals directly with that topic. \u2014Pete Volk Director: Paul FeigCast: Blake Lively, Anna Kendrick, Henry Golding A Simple Favor is every ounce the delicious thriller comedy you want and more. It helps that the film knows \u2014 and loves \u2014 what it is. Single mom and mommy vlogger Stephanie (Anna Kendrick) strikes up a surprise friendship with ultra cool and stylish Emily (Blake Lively), only to have Emily suddenly vanish entirely. That sounds like every pulpy lit mystery, but A Simple Favor has a laugh and an edge to it those stories don\u2019t. As Stephanie finds herself more drawn to Emily\u2019s husband, Sean (Henry Golding), in the wake of her disappearance, the movie winds its plot around its characters the way Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck get strapped to a pole. The result is a fun, splashy little thriller about a murder mystery mess, with great costumes (great costumes) and a gall far beyond its veneer. \u2014Zosha Millman Director: Xavier GensCast: B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bejo, Nassim Lyes, L\u00e9a L\u00e9viant Without a doubt, this is the best thriller on this list that starts with a quote \u201cbased on Charles Darwin.\u201d And for those who are craving the thrash and chomp of a good shark movie, Under Paris (from Mayhem! director Xavier Gens) will certainly satisfy \u2014 though it takes some time to build. Three years after losing her team to a shark attack, Sophia (B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bejo) has retreated to Paris to recover. But trouble, much like a shark in the Seine, follows her home and threatens the prosperity of the city. If you\u2019re thinking, Well just how much trouble could a shark in the Seine really cause? \u2014 Under Paris is happy to clear that up for you. Delicately balanced as a movie that takes the threat just seriously enough to help you cheer when a shark majestically jumps out of the water with a Parisian in its jaws, Under Paris is a platonic ideal for watching sharks tear through the heart of the city of love. \u2014ZM", "url": "https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/2024/6/8/24170486/best-thriller-movies-netflix-watch-june-2024", "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b1lNid8GgEZA0R7US0lR3KAxJPw=/0x0:5400x2827/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25480206/MCDAASI_EC042.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 13:00:00", "author": "Pete Volk,Zosha Millman", "authors": ["Pete Volk", "Zosha Millman"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.805}

{"id": 243256272, "title": "For Trump, the Debate Was Another Chapter in the Rewriting of Jan. 6", "text": "About halfway through Thursday night\u2019s presidential debate, the moderators asked former President Donald Trump about Jan. 6. Amid all the focus on President Biden\u2019s unsteady performance, it might have been easy to miss Trump\u2019s answer. Trump seized the moment to turn the debate stage \u2014 with the biggest audience he\u2019s enjoyed since his presidency \u2014 into the latest theater for his yearslong effort to rewrite the story of Jan. 6, 2021. And he twice ignored questions about whether he would accept the results of the next election before agreeing to do so only under certain conditions. Over the course of several exchanges with Biden and the moderators, CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, Trump downplayed the most damaging attack on the Capitol since the War of 1812, falsely blamed the security lapses that day on former Speaker Nancy Pelosi and defended the more than 1,000 people who have been charged with participating in the deadly violence.", "summary": "It was the biggest stage yet for his effort to rewrite the story of Jan. 6, 2021.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/28/us/politics/trump-debate-jan-6.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/28/multimedia/28-pol-on-politics-newsletter-topart-plkj/28-pol-on-politics-newsletter-topart-plkj-facebookJumbo.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 02:12:25", "author": "Jess Bidgood", "authors": ["Jess Bidgood"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.381}

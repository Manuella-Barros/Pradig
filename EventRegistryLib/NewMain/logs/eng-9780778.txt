The attack on Monday, July 29, resulted in the tragic death of three children.\n\nNine-year-old Alicia Dasilva Aguiar, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Bebe King, six, were fatally stabbed while five other children remained in a critical condition. The children had been in the seaside town attending a Taylor Swift dance event at a holiday club, reports ChronicleLive.\n\nAnthony Gordon, who plays for Newcastle United, has donated \u00a310,000 to the fundraiser, set up on behalf of UK-based pre-school dance companies. The ex-Everton winger grew up in Liverpool.\n\nREAD MORE: Appeal to find man after Bull Street Metro sex act horror\n\nGet breaking news on BirminghamLive WhatsApp, click the link to join\n\nThe donation took the total to more than \u00a347,000. All of the proceeds will be donated to the families affected by the tragedy. The donation came directly from Gordon himself, GoFundMe confirmed.\n\nIt comes as Merseyside Police were given more time on Wednesday July 31, to question a 17-year-old suspected of carrying of the stabbings. Last night, July 30, a vigil was held in the Merseyside town of Southport to honour the memory the girls.\n\nBut scenes turned ugly after a riot ensued and demonstrators hurled missiles at police officers, leaving some injured in hospital, while a local mosque was attacked. And just hours after the disorder last night, protestors have been setting off flares near Downing Street in London.\n\nThe fundraiser, which was launched on Monday on GoFundMe, was set up on behalf of pre-school dance companies which have \"united to raise funds to support those affected by the tragic stabbing incident today in Southport\", according to the page's author.\n\nClaire OConnor, the author, wrote: \"The dance world is a wonderful community of people who gain such joy from dancing and it's impossible to comprehend what has happened at this dance class today. All funds raised will go directly to the families affected to help them in whatever way they may need.\n\n\"Please share amongst your dance communities and wider networks to help those involved in this tragedy.

appears in court charged with murder of girls", "body": "A 17-year-old boy has appeared in court charged with the murder of three girls who were stabbed at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class.\n\nThe teenager, from Banks in Southport, appeared in the dock at Liverpool Magistrates' Court charged with three counts of murder, 10 counts of attempted murder and possession of a bladed article.\n\nAlice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, were fatally stabbed on Monday when a knifeman entered the dance class on Hart Street in Southport, Merseyside.\n\nEight other children suffered knife wounds - with five of them left in a critical condition - while two adults were also critically hurt.\n\nThe boy was charged with the attempted murder of two adults, who have been named in court as yoga class instructor Leanne Lucas and businessman John Hayes - as well as the attempted murder of the eight children who cannot be named for legal reasons.\n\nHe was remanded into youth detention accommodation and will appear at Liverpool Crown Court later on Thursday.\n\nThe defendant came to court at about 9am in a prison van with a large police escort of vans and cars.\n\nAround 20 members of the press packed into court 3.6, a youth court, before District Judge James Hatton sitting at Liverpool Magistrates' Court.\n\nThe teenager was brought into court at 10.21am, wearing a baggy grey tracksuit and black slippers.\n\nHe looked at the row of reporters sat behind the glass dock and smiled before he was asked to sit down.\n\nThe teenager used his left hand to pull his sweatshirt over his face above his nose and kept his head low during the five-minute hearing, in which he did not speak.\n\nThe hearing dealt largely with administrative legal matters ahead of his appearance before another judge later on Thursday.\n\nNone of the families of either the victims or defendant were in court for the brief hearing.\n\nJudge Hatton told the defendant he would be remanded to youth detention ahead of his appearance at Liverpool Crown Court, in the same building, later on Thursday before Recorder of Liverpool Judge Andrew Menary KC.\n\nHe said: \"You will appear at crown court sitting at Liverpool later on today before a more senior judge who will make further direction and determinations in this case.\"\n\nOn Thursday morning two of the children injured in the attack were discharged from hospital, Alder Hey Children's NHS Foundation Trust said.\n\nThe trust added: \"We continue to treat five children involved in the devastating incident in Southport on Monday, including one recently transferred to us from Aintree University Hospital.\n\n\"All the children in our care are currently in a stable condition.\n\n\"Out heartfelt sympathies remain with all those affected by Monday's incident.\"\n\nDisorder has broken out in some towns in England following the attack, with more than 100 people arrested at a protest in Whitehall on Wednesday night, while there was also unrest in Hartlepool, Manchester and Aldershot.\n\nMerseyside Police announced they were charging the boy at a midnight press conference on Thursday.\n\nHe cannot be named because he is under 18.\n\nChief Constable of Merseyside Police Serena Kennedy said: \"Whilst these charges are a significant milestone within this investigation, this remains very much a live investigation and we continue to work with our partners from Lancashire Police and counter-terrorism police in the North West.\"\n\nThousands of people turned out to pay their respects to the victims at a vigil in Southport on Tuesday evening, but violence later erupted outside a mosque in the town with 53 police officers and three police dogs injured.\n\nPolice called in support from neighbouring forces in case of further disorder, but the seaside town appeared to remain quiet on Wednesday evening, however unrest developed in other areas of the country.\n\nProtesters, chanting \"you're not English any more\" and throwing bottles and cans at police in riot gear, were detained on Whitehall while in Hartlepool, County Durham, a police car was set alight and glass bottles and eggs were thrown at officers.", "source": {"uri": "wirralglobe.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Wirral Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Their anonymity is preserved throughout the legal process.\n\nChief Constable Serena Kennedy said: \"Whilst these charges are a significant milestone within this investigation, this remains very much a live investigation and we continue to work with our partners from Lancashire Police and Counter Terrorism Policing North West (CTPNW).\n\n\"I would like to thank all of the forces who have offered and supplied support to Merseyside Police during the last three days and I can confirm that we are being supported with investigative resources from across the North West.\"", "source": {"uri": "liverpoolecho.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liverpool Echo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "katie_westwood@liverpoolecho.co.uk", "name": "Katie Westwood", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banks,_Lancashire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Banks, Lancashire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Banks, Lancashire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Attempted murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Prosecution_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crown Prosecution Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southport", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_constable", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief constable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_Magistrates'_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool Magistrates' Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remand_(court_procedure)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Remand (court procedure)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John F.

asked to sit down.\n\nHe pulled his sweatshirt over his face above his nose, kept his head low, and did not speak during the five-minute hearing.\n\nNone of the families of the victims nor any of the

The suspect, who cannot be named because he is under 18, has been charged with the murders of six-year-old Bebe King, seven-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe and nine-year-old Alice Dasilva Aguiar.\n\nThe teenager, who is from the nearby village of Banks, Lancashire, but was born in Cardiff, Wales, has also been charged with ten counts of attempted murder and possession of a bladed article. He has been remanded in custody and will appear at Liverpool Magistrates' Court on Thursday.\n\nAs well as the three fatalities, eight other children suffered stab wounds in the bloodbath when an attacker stormed the summer holiday club. Five youngsters are in a critical condition, as are two women who bravely tried to save the children. Pictured: Bebe King.\n\nThe identity of the youth has not been revealed because suspects under the age of 18 have automatic anonymity in all UK court cases. Chief Constable Serena Kennedy said: 'Whilst these charges are a significant milestone within this investigation, this remains very much a live investigation and we continue to work with our partners from Lancashire Police and Counter Terrorism Policing North West (CTPNW) to ensure we have as complete an understanding as possible of this matter.\n\n'I would like to thank all of the forces who have offered and supplied support to Merseyside Police during the last three days and I can confirm that we are being supported with investigative resources from across the North West.' Sarah Hammond, Chief Crown Prosecutor for CPS Mersey-Cheshire, said: 'The Crown Prosecution Service has authorised Merseyside Police to charge a 17-year-old male, of Banks, Lancashire, with three counts of murder and ten counts of attempted murder following the tragic incident that took place in Southport this week.'\n\n'He will appear at Liverpool City Magistrates' Court on Thursday August 1, 2024. 'We remind all concerned that criminal proceedings against the defendant are active and that he has the right to a fair trial. 'It is extremely important that there should be no reporting, commentary, or sharing of information online which could in any way prejudice these proceedings. 'Our thoughts remain with the families of all of those affected by these harrowing events.'\n\nDetectives yesterday said they had been been given more time to question the suspect, who was arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder after the attack. False claims online that the suspect was an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK by boat has sparked riots across Southport on Tuesday night. And there was more violence in Hartlepool, London and Manchester on Wednesday. Southport locals - including Elsie's mother - have called for the violence to stop after police vans were torched and bricks were hurled in violence that left 53 officers injured in the seaside town. Elsie's mother, Jenni Stancombe, wrote on Facebook: 'This is the only thing that I will write, but please please stop the violence in Southport tonight. 'The police have been nothing but heroic these last 24 hours and they and we don't need this.'\n\nSouthport MP Patrick Hurley, speaking on Wednesday, said rioters must face the 'full force of the law', saying they were 'utterly disrespecting the families of the dead and injured children'. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said rioters had 'hijacked' a vigil for victims and will 'feel the full force of the law', while Home Secretary Yvette Cooper described the rioting as 'violent attacks from thugs on the streets', which she branded 'appalling'.\n\nThe Southport riots came barely an hour after thousands of mourners had come together at a vigil to pay their respects to the victims. It comes as more than 100 thugs in London were arrested for offences including violent disorder, assault on an emergency worker and breach of protest conditions.\n\nSome among the crowd were heard shouting the name of English Defence League founder Tommy Robinson, while others shouted 'Rule Britannia', 'save our kids' and 'stop the boats'. In Hartlepool, four people were arrested after violent protests broke out. People have been detained for various offences after protesters threw missiles, glass bottles and eggs at officers, police said. A police car was also set on fire before protesters posed for selfies with it.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has also been charged with 10 counts of attempted murder and one count of possession of a weapon. He is due to appear in Liverpool City Magistrates' Court later today, Thursday.\n\nThree children, Bebe King, 6, Elsie Dot Stancombe, 7, and Alice Aguiar, 9, were killed in the deadly attack, which took place during a Taylor Swift-themed dance and yoga class at Hart Space. Eight other children and two adults suffered serious injuries, with several still in critical condition.\n\nMerseyside Police announced the charges during a press conference last night. They confirmed the defendant, who was arrested on Monday, is from the village of Banks, Lancashire, which is about five miles from where the stabbings took place. He was born in Cardiff.\n\n\"A 17-year-old boy from Banks has been charged with the murders of Bebe, Elsie Dot and Alice, 10 counts of attempted murder and possession of a bladed article following the tragic incident in Southport on Monday 29 July,\" Serena Kennedy, chief constable of Merseyside police, told press, per The Guardian. \"The 17-year-old cannot be named for legal reasons as he's under 18.

It is extremely important that there should be no reporting, commentary, or sharing of information online which could in any way prejudice these proceedings. Our thoughts remain with the families of all of those affected by these harrowing events.\"\n\nThe reminder comes after far-right protestors took to the streets of Southport on Tuesday night. Following a vigil held for the young victims, masked protestors threw glass bottles and bricks at police officers and attacked the Southport Islamic Society Mosque. Local emergency services treated 39 police officers for injuries sustained during the protest, according to the North West Ambulance Service, and three police dogs were also injured.\n\n\"The people of Southport are reeling after the horror inflicted on them yesterday,\" British prime minister Keir Starmer wrote in a statement on X. \"They deserve our support and our respect. Those who have hijacked the vigil for the victims with violence and thuggery have insulted the community as it grieves. They will feel the full force of the law.\"\n\nFurther protests took place on Wednesday night in London on Whitehall, near 10 Downing Street. More than 100 people were arrested during the demonstration. Eight people were also arrested in Hartlepool, where a police car was set on fire by protestors. Starmer is set to meet with senior police leaders at Downing Street today.\n\nFollowing the attack on Monday, Swift released a statement expressing her sorrow and dismay. \"The horror of yesterday's attack in Southport is washing over me continuously and I'm just completely in shock,\" Swift wrote on Instagram Stories. \"The loss of life and innocence and the horrendous trauma inflicted on everyone who was there, the families, and first responders. These were just little kids at a dance class. I am at a complete loss for how to ever convey my sympathies to these families.\"\n\nIn the U.K., the identity of a child between 10 and 17 who has been charged with a crime cannot be disclosed outside the court. According to the Crown Prosecution Service, defendants \"will remain anonymous throughout proceedings but these restrictions can be challenged -- usually by the media -- after proceedings have ended.\"", "source": {"uri": "rollingstone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rolling Stone"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emily_zemler@rollingstone.com", "name": "Emily Zemler", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southport", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Attempted murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banks,_Lancashire", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Banks, Lancashire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Banks, Lancashire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Prosecution_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crown Prosecution Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yoga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magistrates'_court_(England_and_Wales)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Magistrates' court (England and Wales)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiff", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cardiff"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cardiff"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterterrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Counterterrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_a_fair_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right to a fair trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_constable", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief constable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vigil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John F.

suffered knife wounds - with five of them in a critical condition - while two adults were also critically hurt.\n\nThe boy was charged with the attempted murder of two adults, yoga class instructor Leanne Lucas and businessman John Hayes, as well as the attempted murder of the eight children who cannot be named for legal reasons.\n\nHe was remanded into youth detention accommodation and will appear at Liverpool Crown Court later on Thursday.\n\nThe defendant came to court at about 9am in a prison van with a large police escort of vans and cars.\n\nAround 20 members of the press packed into court 3.6, a youth court, before District Judge James Hatton sitting at Liverpool Magistrates' Court.\n\nThe teenager was brought into court at 10.21am, wearing a baggy grey tracksuit and black slippers.\n\nA prison van escorted by multiple police vehicles arrives at Liverpool Magistrates\u00b4 Court (Danny Lawson/PA)\n\nHe looked at the row of reporters sat behind the glass dock and smiled before he was asked to sit down.\n\nThe teenager used his left hand to pull his sweatshirt over his face above his nose and kept his head low during the five-minute hearing, in which he did not speak.\n\nThe hearing dealt largely with administrative legal matters ahead of his appearance before another judge later on Thursday.\n\nNone of the families of either the victims or defendant were in court for the brief hearing.\n\nJudge Hatton told the defendant he would be remanded to youth detention ahead of his appearance at Liverpool Crown Court, in the same building, later on Thursday before Recorder of Liverpool Judge Andrew Menary KC.\n\nHe said: \"You will appear at crown court sitting at Liverpool later on today before a more senior judge who will make further direction and determinations in this case.\"\n\nDisorder has broken out in some towns in England following the attack, with more than 100 people arrested at a protest in Whitehall on Wednesday night, while there was also unrest in Hartlepool, Manchester and Aldershot.\n\nMerseyside Police announced they were charging the boy at a midnight press conference on Thursday.\n\nPolice officers outside Liverpool

quiet on Wednesday evening, however unrest developed in other areas of the country.\n\nProtesters, chanting \"you're not English any more\" and throwing bottles and cans at police in riot gear, were detained on Whitehall while in Hartlepool, County Durham, a police car was set alight and glass bottles and eggs were thrown at officers.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

Dasilva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, were fatally stabbed on Monday when a knifeman entered the dance class on Hart Street in Southport, Merseyside.\n\nEight other children suffered knife wounds - with five of them left in a critical condition - while two adults were also critically hurt.\n\nThe boy was charged with the attempted murder of two adults, yoga class instructor Leanne Lucas and businessman John Hayes, as well as the attempted murder of the eight children who cannot be named for legal reasons.\n\nHe was remanded into youth detention accommodation and will appear at Liverpool Crown Court later on Thursday.\n\nThe defendant came to court at about 9am in a prison van with a large police escort of vans and cars.\n\nAround 20 members of the press packed into court 3.6, a youth court, before District Judge James Hatton sitting at Liverpool Magistrates' Court.\n\nThe teenager was brought into court at 10.21am, wearing a baggy grey tracksuit and black slippers.\n\nHe looked at the row of reporters sat behind the glass dock and smiled before he was asked to sit down.\n\nThe teenager used his left hand to pull his sweatshirt over his face above his nose and kept his head low during the five-minute hearing, in which he did not speak.\n\nThe hearing dealt largely with administrative legal matters ahead of his appearance before another judge later on Thursday.\n\nNone of the families of either the victims or defendant were in court for the brief hearing.\n\nJudge Hatton told the defendant he would be remanded to youth detention ahead of his appearance at Liverpool Crown Court, in the same building, later on Thursday before Recorder of Liverpool Judge Andrew Menary KC.\n\nHe said: \"You will appear at crown court sitting at Liverpool later on today before a more senior judge who will make further direction and determinations in this case.\"\n\nOn Thursday morning two of the children injured in the attack were discharged from

incident.\"\n\nDisorder has broken out in some towns in England following the attack, with more than 100 people arrested at a protest in Whitehall on Wednesday night, while there was also unrest in Hartlepool, Manchester and Aldershot.\n\nMerseyside Police announced they were charging the boy at a midnight press conference on Thursday.\n\nHe cannot be named because he is under 18.\n\nChief Constable of Merseyside Police Serena Kennedy said: \"Whilst these charges are a significant milestone within this investigation, this remains very much a live investigation and we continue to work

evening, but violence later erupted outside a mosque in the town with 53 police officers and three police dogs injured.\n\nPolice called in support from neighbouring forces in case of further disorder, but the seaside town appeared to remain quiet on Wednesday evening, however unrest developed in other areas of the country.\n\nProtesters, chanting \"you're not English any more\" and throwing bottles and cans at police in riot gear, were detained on Whitehall while in Hartlepool, County Durham, a police car was set alight and glass bottles and eggs were thrown at officers.",

Dasilva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, were fatally stabbed on Monday when a knifeman entered the dance class on Hart Street in Southport, Merseyside.\n\nEight other children suffered knife wounds - with five of them in a critical condition - while two adults were also critically hurt.\n\nThe boy was charged with the attempted murder of two adults, yoga class instructor Leanne Lucas and businessman John Hayes, as well as the attempted murder of the eight children who cannot be named for legal reasons.\n\nHe was remanded into youth detention accommodation and will appear at Liverpool Crown Court later on Thursday.\n\nThe defendant came to court at about 9am in a prison van with a large police escort of vans and cars.\n\nAround 20 members of the press packed into court 3.6, a youth court, before District Judge James Hatton sitting at Liverpool Magistrates' Court.\n\nThe teenager was brought into court at 10.21am, wearing a baggy grey tracksuit and black slippers.\n\nHe looked at the row of reporters sat behind the glass dock and smiled before he was asked to sit down.\n\nThe teenager used his left hand to pull his sweatshirt over his face above his nose and kept his head low during the five-minute hearing, in which he did not speak.\n\nThe hearing dealt largely with administrative legal matters ahead of his appearance before another judge later on Thursday.\n\nNone of the families of either the victims or defendant were in court for the brief hearing.\n\nJudge Hatton told the defendant he would be remanded to youth detention ahead of his appearance at Liverpool Crown Court, in the same building, later on Thursday before Recorder of Liverpool Judge Andrew Menary KC.\n\nHe said: \"You will appear at crown court sitting at Liverpool later on today before a more senior judge who will make further direction and determinations in this case.\"\n\nDisorder has broken out in some towns in England following the attack, with more than 100 people arrested at a protest in Whitehall on Wednesday night, while there was also unrest in Hartlepool, Manchester and Aldershot.\n\nMerseyside Police announced they were charging the boy at a midnight press conference on Thursday.\n\nHe cannot be named because he is under 18.\n\nChief Constable of Merseyside Police Serena Kennedy said: \"Whilst these charges are a significant milestone within this investigation, this remains very much a live investigation and we continue to work with our partners from Lancashire Police and counter-terrorism police in the North West.\"\n\nThousands of people turned out to pay their respects to the victims at a vigil in Southport on Tuesday evening, but violence later erupted outside a mosque in the town with 53 police officers and three police dogs injured.\n\nPolice called in support from neighbouring forces in case of further disorder, but the seaside town appeared to remain quiet on Wednesday evening, however unrest developed in other areas of the country.\n\nProtesters, chanting \"you're not English any more\" and throwing bottles and cans at police in riot gear, were detained on Whitehall while in Hartlepool, County Durham, a police car was set alight and glass bottles and eggs were thrown at officers.", "source": {"uri": "andoveradvertiser.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Andover Advertiser"}, "authors": [],

Violent disorder has broken out across the country following the attack, with more than 100 people arrested at a protest in Whitehall on Wednesday night.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference just after midnight on Thursday (August 1), chief constable of Merseyside Police Serena Kennedy said: \"A 17-year old-boy from Banks has been charged with the murders of Bebe, Elsie Dot and Alice, 10 counts of attempted murder and possession of a bladed article following the tragic incident in Southport on Monday July 29.\n\n\"The 17 year old cannot be named for legal reasons as he's under 18.

Sarah Hammond, Chief Crown Prosecutor for CPS Mersey-Cheshire, said: \"We remind all concerned that criminal proceedings against the defendant are active and that he has the right to a fair trial.\n\n\"It is extremely important that there should be no reporting, commentary, or sharing of information online which could in any way prejudice these proceedings.\"\n\nThousands of people turned out to pay their respects to the victims at a vigil in Southport on Tuesday evening, but violence later erupted outside a mosque in the town with 53 police officers and three police dogs injured. Five men have been arrested following the violence.\n\nAfter rioting broke out, Elsie's mother, Jenni Stancombe, wrote on Facebook: \"This is the only thing that I will write, but please please stop the violence in Southport tonight. The police have been nothing but heroic these last 24 hours and they and we don't need this.\"\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said rioters had \"hijacked\" a vigil for victims and will \"feel the full force of the law\", while Home Secretary Yvette Cooper described the rioting as \"violent attacks from thugs on the streets\", which she branded \"appalling\".\n\nOn Wednesday, a clean up operation took place outside the mosque, with residents coming together to clear roads where fires had been set and rebuild walls which had been knocked down.\n\nPolice called in support from neighbouring forces in case of further disorder, but the seaside town appeared to remain quiet on Wednesday evening, however unrest developed in other areas of the country. Protesters, chanting \"you're not English any more\" and throwing bottles and cans at police in riot gear, were detained on Whitehall.\n\nA Met Police spokesman said: \"Over 100 people have been arrested for offences including violent disorder, assault on an emergency worker, and breach of protest conditions. Some officers suffered minor injuries.\"\n\nIn Hartlepool, County Durham, a police car was set alight and glass bottles and eggs were thrown at officers. Chief superintendent David Sutherland said: \"At this stage we believe the protest is in connection with the incident in Southport earlier this week.\n\n\"Our officers are facing missiles, glass bottles and eggs being thrown at them and have made arrests as they remain in the area to protect the safety of those living in the community.\"", "source": {"uri": "examinerlive.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "huddersfieldexaminer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "howard_lloyd@examinerlive.co.uk", "name": "Howard Lloyd", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southport", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Violent disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_constable", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief constable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitehall", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Whitehall"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Prosecution_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crown Prosecution Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attempted murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John F.

In addition to the fatal stabbings, eight other children sustained knife injuries, with five currently in critical condition; two adults are also critically injured.\n\nIt comes as a police vehicle was torched, and police faced a barrage of glass bottles and eggs during rioting in Hartlepool.

The boy is due to appear before the Recorder of Liverpool in the crown court later on Thursday.\n\nDeanna Heer KC, prosecuting, told the court: \"The three counts of murder are the most serious and send it to the crown court. The attempted murders and possession of a bladed article all relate to the same incident and therefore should be sent as well.\"\n\nAround 20 members of the press were in court for the hearing, which took place in the youth court where automatic restrictions apply to the defendant's identity as he is under the age of 18.\n\nThe accused teenager spoke only to confirm his name, address, and age during a hearing which lasted less than ten minutes.\n\nThe boy, who was born in Cardiff to Rwandan parents, is from the village of Banks, just outside Southport.\n\nSarah Hammond, Chief Crown Prosecutor for CPS Mersey-Cheshire, said: \"We remind all concerned that criminal proceedings against the defendant are active and that he has the right to a fair trial.\n\n\"It is extremely important that there should be no reporting, commentary, or sharing of information online which could in any way prejudice these proceedings.\"\n\nThousands of people turned out to pay their respects to the victims at a vigil in Southport on Tuesday evening, but violence later erupted outside a mosque in the town with 53 police officers and three police dogs injured.\n\nFive men have been arrested following the violence.\n\nAfter rioting broke out, Elsie's mother, Jenni Stancombe, wrote on Facebook: \"This is the only thing that I will write, but please please stop the violence in Southport tonight.\n\n\"The police have been nothing but heroic these last 24 hours and they and we don't need this.\"\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said rioters had \"hijacked\" a vigil for victims and will \"feel the full force of the law\", while Home Secretary Yvette Cooper described the rioting as \"violent attacks from thugs on the streets\", which she branded \"appalling\".\n\nOn Wednesday, a clean up operation took place outside the mosque, with residents coming together to clear roads where fires had been set and rebuild walls which had been knocked down.\n\nPolice called in support from neighbouring forces in case of further disorder, but the seaside town appeared to remain quiet on Wednesday evening, however unrest developed in other areas of the country.\n\nProtesters, chanting \"you're not English any more\" and throwing bottles and cans at police in riot gear, were detained on Whitehall.\n\nA Met Police spokesman said: \"Over 100 people have been arrested for offences including violent disorder, assault on an emergency worker, and breach of protest conditions.\n\n\"Some officers suffered minor injuries.\"\n\nIn Hartlepool, County Durham, a police car was set alight and glass bottles and eggs were thrown at officers.\n\nChief Superintendent David Sutherland said: \"At this stage we believe the protest is in connection with the incident in Southport earlier this week.\n\n\"Our officers are facing missiles, glass bottles and eggs being thrown at them and have made arrests as they remain in the area to protect the safety of those living in the community.\"",

Following the harrowing attack on Monday, the teenage suspect was charged with three counts of murder, 10 counts of attempted murder and possession of a bladed article.\n\nThree girls - Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, - were fatally stabbed while eight other children were left injured in the attack. Two adults were left with critical injuries.\n\nSarah Hammond, Chief Crown Prosecutor for CPS Mersey-Cheshire, said: \"We remind all concerned that criminal proceedings against the defendant are active and that he has the right to a fair trial.\n\n\"It is extremely important that there should be no reporting, commentary, or sharing of information online which could in any way prejudice these proceedings. Our thoughts remain with the families of all of those affected by these harrowing events.\"\n\nThe murders on Monday sparked widespread violent protests across the country, marring a night of remembrance for the girls who lost their lives and for those who were left with devastating injuries. Right-wing rioters threw bricks and stones at police officers before a local mosque was targeted and damaged.\n\nBaseless rumours were spread on social media, misidentifying the suspect and falsely claiming he was a refugee, when he was born in Cardiff, before moving to Banks just northeast of Southport. Further riots erupted across England on Wednesday with hundreds of people being arrested in Hartlepool and London.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer will today host senior police leaders in Downing Street following the violent unrest. He is expected to remind police that people \"exploit\" the right to protest in order to \"sow hatred\" or commit \"violent acts\" and should be met with the full force of the law.\n\nMr Starmer will also commit to working in partnership with police forces across the UK to stop \"mindless violence\" following the unrest. Multiple figures from the UK's major political parties said violence in Southport \"has no justification and in no way reflects values and people of our town.\"\n\nConservative, Labour, Liberal Democrat, Green and Reform UK figures in the Merseyside town posted a joint statement to their social media pages, using the hashtag #SouthportTogether. \"The scenes we saw at the vigil yesterday showed our town at its best,\" they wrote. \"Thousands coming together to pay their respects.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri":

He was charged with three counts of murder and ten further counts of attempted murder following the horror attack. He was also charged with possession of a bladed article.\n\nAlice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, were murdered in the attack. Police confirmed eight other children suffered stab wounds. Five are in critical conditions and two adults, alongside two adults who were also critically injured.\n\nThe 17-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons as he is under 18, has been remanded in custody and will appear at Liverpool Magistrates Court, Derby Square tomorrow, Thursday, August 1, reports the Mirror.\n\nChief Constable Serena Kennedy said: \"Whilst these charges are a significant milestone within this investigation, this remains very much a live investigation and we continue to work with our partners from Lancashire Police and Counter Terrorism Policing North West (CTPNW) to ensure we have as complete an understanding as possible of this matter.\n\n\"I would like to thank all of the forces who have offered and supplied support to Merseyside Police during the last three days and I can confirm that we are being supported with investigative resources from across the North West.\"\n\nChurchtown Primary in Southport said Alice was a pupil at the school and Bebe was a former pupil. A spokeswoman said one of the critically injured adults is a current staff member and one is a former member of staff who is still closely associated with the school.\n\nIn a statement, Bebe's family said: \"No words can describe the devastation that has hit our family as we try to deal with the loss of our little girl Bebe.\" Alice's family also paid tribute to their \"princess\". They said: \"Keep smiling and dancing like you love to do our Princess, like we said before to you, you're always our princess and no one would change that. Love from Your Hero Daddy and Mummy.\"\n\nMerseyside Police said all three families are being supported by specialist officers. The fully-booked club for children, which was advertised as a dance and yoga workshop as well as bracelet-making, quickly became something \"like a horror movie\", witnesses to the stabbings have said.\n\nHundreds of people took part in a vigil on Tuesday evening outside Southport's Atkinson arts venue and many were in tears as they laid flowers and cards of remembrance with the tragedy having brought heartbreak to the community\n\nUS singer Swift said she is \"completely in shock\" after the \"horror\" of the knife attack. In a statement on social media she said: \"The horror of yesterday's attack in Southport is washing over me continuously, and I'm just completely in shock. The loss of life and innocence, and the horrendous trauma inflicted on everyone who was there, the families and the first responders. These were just little kids at a dance class. I am at a complete loss for how to ever convey my sympathies to these families.\"\n\nHeadteacher of Churchtown Primary Jinnie Payne, the school where Alice was a year 4 pupil and a former school of Bebe, also paid tribute to the victims. Ms Payne said: \"Alice's radiant smile brightened our days, and she embraced every aspect of school life with enthusiasm and joy. Her kindness, playful nature, and zest for trying new things will forever be remembered.\"\n\nShe added: \"Bebe was a joyful girl, whose kindness radiated through the entire Churchtown community.

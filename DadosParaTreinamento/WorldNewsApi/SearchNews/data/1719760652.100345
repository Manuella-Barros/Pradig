{"id": 225016956, "title": "Saliva Pregnancy Tests Are A Thing \u2013 This Is How They Work", "text": "Now we\u2019ve all been to the pharmacy and seen urine pregnancy tests where you pee on a stick and wait to find out whether you\u2019re pregnant or not. But did you know you can also get saliva pregnancy tests? Though these are less common, Boots have now launched their own brand of kits. How exactly do saliva pregnancy tests work? Saliva pregnancy tests work in the same way as urine tests work \u2014 they use saliva for the detection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in which helps in the detection of pregnancy. These are seen to be slightly easier as you don\u2019t have to wait for the need to pee to take a test. The NHS explains that all pregnancy tests detect the hormone human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), which starts to be produced around 6 days after fertilisation. With majority of pregnancy tests, you can check whether you\u2019re pregnant the first day after a missed period. Boots\u2019 own saliva pregnancy test aims to make this easier as you can use it anywhere, and don\u2019t have to wait for a bathroom \u2014 the results usually appear in five minutes. The instructions for how to take the test say to: Pool saliva in your mouthCollect saliva with collection handleEnsure the indicator colour turns bluePush in and twistPlace facing upwards on a flat surfaceRead the result within 5-15 minutes What do you do if you have a positive pregnancy test? Louise Broadbridge, aka The Honest Midwife, runs an early pregnancy workshop for those struggling to navigate the limbo period where you take a positive pregnancy test, yet haven\u2019t had a doctors scan. She says that although you feel like you want to be busy planning \u2014 you should take it easy. For so many people, finding out they\u2019re pregnant can be a hugely exciting time. Equally, for lots of other people, it\u2019s not necessarily the news they hoped for. If you\u2019re not totally over the moon about the two lines on the test in front of you \u2013 and are actually very anxious or worried about what happens next \u2013 it\u2019s really important to be kind to yourself, says Broadbridge, and give yourself the time to get your head around this huge news. \u201cIt is really normal to be really overwhelmed,\u201d she explains. \u201cEven if you did want a baby and had been trying for a baby, suddenly being told that you\u2019re pregnant is quite an overwhelming feeling. \u201cAny emotion that someone feels when they\u2019re finding out they\u2019re having a baby is a normal emotion \u2013 there\u2019s no wrong reaction to it.\u201d But if you\u2019re still undecided about the pregnancy, it\u2019s really important to now surround yourself with the people you trust \u2013 including your partner, if you\u2019re in a relationship. \u201cTalk to the people that are closest to you, that you trust the most, about how you\u2019re feeling,\u201d the midwife advises. And really think about who are the right people to talk about it with \u2013 and who are the wrong people. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have people that are going to be really balanced to support you in whatever your decisions are,\u201d she adds. Secondly, she advises to call your GP. \u201cThere\u2019s no fixed, clear \u2018this is the way to go\u2019 ... But I would say your GP surgery is going to be a good place to start, with the understanding that the likelihood is you\u2019re going to make that phone call and then have to make another one,\u201d she says. Thirdly you can start taking folic acid. Your booking appointment is in the diary. Now what? Well, as your first appointment can take a few weeks to be set up, it\u2019s crucial that you make some immediate changes after finding out you\u2019re expecting (if you\u2019re not already doing so). It\u2019s recommended people take folic acid prior to getting pregnant but if you haven\u2019t been, don\u2019t worry \u2013 just make sure you start taking supplements as soon as possible after finding out, as this is really crucial for your baby\u2019s development. You\u2019re advised to take 400 micrograms of folic acid every day. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t need to be a pregnancy vitamin, you can just go and buy folic acid tablets, and that\u2019s really important because it reduces the risk of spina bifida [when a baby\u2019s spine and spinal cord does not develop properly in the womb],\u201d says Broadbridge. Lastly, if you are feeling overwhelmed \u2014 make sure to speak to someone, be it a partner or a friend. This can be a difficult time, so make sure to lean on support if you can.", "summary": "<div><img src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/6657207f2400003200a286c4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_630_noupscale\" alt=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-credit-link-back=\"\" data-credit=\"FreshSplash via Getty Images\" /></div><div class=\"content-list-component text\"><p>Now we\u2019ve all been to the pharmacy and seen urine <a href=\"../../../news/pregnancy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pregnancy</a> tests where you pee on a stick and wait to find out whether you\u2019re pregnant or not.</p><p>But did you know you can also get saliva pregnancy tests?

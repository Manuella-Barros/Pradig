{"id": 227486474, "title": "SIMMONS SAYS: Are the Maple Leafs the spoiled brats of the NHL?", "text": "Article content When the Marlies won the 2018 AHL championship in Toronto, I walked out of the arena with a high-ranking official from the Dallas Stars. I asked him how he felt about losing to the Marlies. He said he was OK with it, considering the disparity in budget between the two teams. It was his belief that Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment spent at least twice as much on the Marlies as Dallas did on its AHL team. Which is how the Maple Leafs are basically perceived throughout the hockey world. They have more money \u2014 buy nice things, have more front office people in more positions with more toys \u2014 and sometimes it pays off, as it did in winning an AHL title. But as Sheldon Keefe said recently \u2014 in a quote that was wildly misinterpreted by those who have a never met a GM or talked privately to an NHL coach \u2014 the Leafs live in their own little hockey world. The rest of the league looks at them kind of funny, either with resentment or as being slightly spoiled or somewhat incompetent. The rest of the league cheers quietly \u2014 and sometimes not that quietly \u2014 when the Leafs continually fail. Now, Keefe, with his words and in the words of coaches he spoke to, enters into the real NHL with the New Jersey Devils organization. Where money sometimes can be tight. Where extravagance is something other teams experience. The \u2018real NHL\u2019 has little to do with media coverage, a giant-sized fan base, or any rant that may have accompanied Keefe\u2019s surprising words. What the new Devils coach was really saying, as were his colleagues, is that he is now coaching in the rest of the league. The rest of the league is pretty much every team except Toronto. THIS AND THAT One giant aspect of Leafs Nation: Its fan base. Right across the country. Game 7 of the Leafs-Boston series obliterated television ratings for the rest of the playoffs across Canada. Edmonton\u2019s series against the Canucks and now the Stars, are being watched by a significantly smaller audience than watched the Leafs in Round 1 \u2026 Another giant aspect of Leafs Nation: Overkill. At the press conference to announce the hiring of coach Craig Berube, there were seven media relations people or consultants on hand, four from the team, two from the front office, one from MLSE. Roger Goodell does press conferences with half that staff \u2026 An NHL GM on the Mitch Marner situation: \u201cIt\u2019s all Fantasy Island stuff\u201d right now. It\u2019s fodder for guessing websites and talk radio. There is interest in Marner. There have been no serious talks with teams or with Marner\u2019s camp or anything beyond made-up speculation \u2026 If I were Max Domi and I wanted to stay with the Leafs, I\u2019d find myself a new agent. The numbers being floated around for Domi don\u2019t fit what the Leafs will be looking at. The Leafs\u2019 priority is to improve goaltending and defence. You can\u2019t do that if you\u2019re throwing too much money for too much term at players such as Domi or Tyler Bertuzzi \u2026 How do you get better on defence? Sometimes you have to be lucky. Florida claimed Gustav Forsling off waivers from Carolina (thank you, Don Waddell). He\u2019s turned out great. They traded a third-round pick to get Brandon Montour from Buffalo. Those are two top-four defenceman coming at a very inexpensive price \u2026 Florida wants to re-sign Montour who is a pending free agent, as is the 50-goal scorer Sam Reinhart. The thinking is, the Panthers will look to trade veteran Aaron Ekblad at the end of the season and use his money to keep Montour. Reinhart may sign a tax-friendly deal brought to you by the state of Florida \u2026 If the Stanley Cup final ends up as Edmonton versus Florida, consider this: The Panthers are the most penalized team in the NHL. The Oilers have the best power play. Will the Panthers be able to play their roughhouse style against Edmonton and avoid taking penalties, or will they take them and find a way to kill them? HEAR AND THERE Davis Schneider is the Blue Jays\u2019 MVP through the first third of this season, which is great if you happen to be Davis Schneider. Not so great if you\u2019re the Blue Jays or fans of the Jays \u2026 Alek Manoah is getting a second opinion on his bum elbow, which is another way of saying: \u2018See you next year\u2019 \u2026 The Jays are coming to the end of the really easy part of their schedule without making any real inroads in the standings. They were 11.5 games behind the Yankees on May 19 and were 11.5 games behind them heading into Saturday\u2019s game against Pittsburgh. They were 9.5 games behind Baltimore on May 19 and are 9.5 games behind them on Saturday. They were 4.5 games behind four teams in the wild-card race and were 4.5 games behind. In other words, 11 days and some easy schedule later and they are no closer to anything that matters in the standings \u2026 Something to hold on to for the desperate: The great 2015 Blue Jays team that reinvigorated baseball across Canada, didn\u2019t start so great. It was 26-30 after 56 games, one game behind the current team. Those Jays finished winning 67 of their final 106 games \u2026 How much will the Atlanta Braves miss Ronald Acuna Jr., out for the season with a knee injury? All he did last season was lead the National League in plate appearances, at-bats, hits, stolen bases, on-base percentage, OPS and total bases. Losing Acuna is like losing three players \u2026 Ricky Tiedemann, with no innings pitched in the big leagues and just 12 innings pitched at triple-A, leads the Jays in injury updates and promise. Which may be all that this season is about. SCENE AND HEARD For the most part, I like the Blue Jays\u2019 City Connect jerseys, except for the numbers on the back. You need X-ray vision to read them. They look like they were designed by Harold Ballard \u2026 The Raptors pick 19th in the NBA draft. If available, should they be considering Bronny James at that spot? And after that, could they convince daddy to come along as a free agent? \u2026 Aaron Judge is back being Aaron Judge again. He leads all of baseball in home runs and OPS and the Yankees have the best record in the American League \u2026 MacIntyre, Fox and Dahmen is either an accounting firm or the leaderboard Saturday afternoon at the Canadian Open \u2026 I used to run into Rob Ford regularly around the football field at St. Michael\u2019s College on Sunday afternoons. He was there because he loved youth football and that\u2019s where it was being played. He was a regular. So, I\u2019m not about to scream about naming a football stadium in Etobicoke after the late mayor. Considering all that he put into the game, he deserves that \u2026 With big wins in tennis come big responsibilities. That\u2019s a terrific victory for Felix Auger-Aliassime at the French Open, the last Canadian alive in singles, taking down American Ben Shelton in straight sets. For that, he earns a match with the boy wonder, Carlos Alcaraz, in the Round of 16 on Tuesday. Can we say: \u2018Ouch\u2019? \u2026 Clearly on the Team Canada Olympic watch list: Alexis Lafreniere of the Rangers, Wyatt Johnston of Dallas, and now an obvious selection, Evan Bouchard of the Oilers on defence \u2026 Not that anyone cares but the Mike Tyson-Jake Paul bout is on hold because of Tyson\u2019s recent injury. Not that a 58-year-old is supposed to be fighting, exhibition bouts or anything else \u2026 I like Dallas over Boston in the NBA Finals which means, if you want to make a buck, bet Boston. With the Stars up 2-1 in the series against Edmonton and leading 2-0 early in Game 4, it looked like Dallas was heading to the Stanley Cup. The Stars may be looking back at Game 4, over and over, this summer trying to figure out what went wrong \u2026 In the words of Lou Lamoriello, almost every pending NHL free agent is asking for too much money and too much term. Problem is, most teams don\u2019t have much cap space. The salary cap has gone up by $4 million and a lot of clubs, the Leafs included, have already spent or committed that money to extended contracts, which further clogs the marketplace \u2026 I\u2019ve been fortunate enough to watch the Stanley Cup presented live many times and the scene never fails to deliver. But I was personally shocked by how emotional I got watching the Walter Cup being presented to Minnesota of the Professional Women\u2019s Hockey League the other night. It was special and it was historic \u2026 Umpire Angel Hernandez made one perfect call in his baseball career. He called himself out. It was time \u2026 Is Draymond Green now playing in the WNBA under the name of Chennedy Carter? \u2026 In the latest power rankings on ESPN, the Blue Jays are listed as the 20th best team in baseball, or the 12th best team in the American League. Does Edward Rogers know this? \u2026 Pascal Siakam and OG Anunoby have similar decisions to make. Do they stay with their current teams, sign friendly deals by NBA standards, or do they head to free agency and chase every last dollar? Sometimes being in a good place and a good situation is better than padding an already inflated bank account. AND ANOTHER THING We should all be alive to hear what the world thinks of us, especially if the world thinks of us the way it thought about Bill Walton. The tributes were that special. Few athletes have ever been mourned so beautifully and by so many. It\u2019s too bad, isn\u2019t it, that we don\u2019t get to hear these things when we\u2019re alive? \u2026 If AFL statistics count for NFL players, and now Negro League statistics will be counted alongside MLB stats, why not have WHA statistics count along with NHL stats? If those stats were connected, Gordie Howe, not Wayne Gretzky, would be the career goal scoring leader at 975, followed by Gretzky at 940 and Bobby Hull at 913. Then Alex Ovechkin, well back at 853 \u2026 Since Paul Coffey landed in Edmonton to coach the Oilers defence, Bouchard\u2019s offensive numbers have taken off. In 83 games with Coffey on the bench, Bouchard has 98 points \u2026 How would you like to be Team Canada\u2019s Olympic basketball coach Jordi Fernandez and you look over at the Team USA bench, and there\u2019s Steve Kerr sitting beside his assistants Erik Spoelstra, Ty Lue and Gonzaga coach Mark Few. That\u2019s a touch intimidating \u2026 Brian Keefe is the new coach of the Washington Wizards. Brian Keefe is also Sheldon Keefe\u2019s father. The two are not related \u2026 If Andrew Wiggins isn\u2019t absolutely certain he wants to play for Team Canada at the Paris Olympics, then, simple, pick someone else. The days of grovelling over Wiggins as the great Canadian hope are long gone \u2026. What was the first jersey you ever owned? For me, it was a Dave Raimey Argos jersey, No. 14. After that a Bob Griese Miami Dolphins T-shirt jersey \u2026 Is something wrong with Joe Pavelski? Is he finished or just having the first horrible post-season run of his career? The normally great playoff Pavelski has been almost invisible for the Stars \u2026 Same with Adam Fox. Clearly, he\u2019s playing hurt with the Rangers. He\u2019s way better than this \u2026 Kris Knoblauch has coached 86 games with the Oilers in total, winning 57 of them. That\u2019s a 107-win pace on a baseball season \u2026 Scott Burnside wrote 175 double byline stories for the Toronto Sun with the late Al Cairns as his partner. Almost all of them were about the murderer, Paul Bernardo. The last one came in February of 1997. Burnside then turned to hockey writing. He was a Hall of Fame quality news reporter who became a Hall of Fame quality hockey writer. And it became official on Friday. He will be honoured by the hockey Hall in November. Hall of Fame life. Hall of Fame areer \u2026 The Leafs paid Bertuzzi $5.5 million in salary this season, same number the Oilers are paying Zach Hyman. And this makes less numerical sense: Hyman has scored 67 goals when combining regular season and playoff numbers \u2014 only three fewer than Auston Matthews scored for the Leafs. Hyman\u2019s deal runs for four more years \u2026 Happy birthday to Coffey (63), Gary Bettman (72), Larry Robinson (73), Lou Nanne (83), Russ Courtnall (59), Ron Mikolajczyk (74), Lex Luger (66), Lawrence McCutcheon (74), Roman Josi (34), Craig Stadler (71) and Jerry Mathers as The Beaver (76) \u2026 And hey, whatever became of Scott Downs? ssimmons@postmedia.com x.com/simmonssteve Share this Story : SIMMONS SAYS: Are the Maple Leafs the spoiled brats of the NHL?

In 2006, Yang Jian, the entrepreneurial team leader, founded TankeBlue Semiconductor Co., Ltd., in close cooperation with a research team of the Institute of Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The company now takes the lead in China in the research and development, manufacture and sales of the third generation of semiconductor SiC (silicon carbide) substrates. After 18 years of development, the company has up to now owned seven core technology systems with independent intellectual property rights, covering the whole SiC integrated industrial chain. It has formed a large-scale business layout consisting of a research center, three wholly-owned subsidiaries and a holding subsidiary. Silicon carbide substrate is the ideal material for manufacturing semiconductor devices with higher resistance to pressure and temperature. Yang is now the general manager of TankeBlue. His company has become one of the world's main suppliers of SiC substrates. Yang said that research and development is the foundation of industrialization, and delivering high-quality products to customers is the ultimate goal.
